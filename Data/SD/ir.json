        "abstract": "Abstract In this paper we study how to prioritize relevance assessments in the process of creating an Information Retrieval test collection. A test collection consists of a set of queries, a document collection, and a set of relevance assessments. For each query, only a sample of documents from the collection can be manually assessed for relevance. Multiple retrieval strategies are typically used to obtain such sample of documents. And rank fusion plays a fundamental role in creating the sample by combining multiple search results. We propose effective rank fusion models that are adapted to the characteristics of this evaluation task. Our models are based on the distribution of retrieval scores supplied by the search systems and our experiments show that this formal approach leads to natural and competitive solutions when compared to state of the art methods. We also demonstrate the benefits of including pseudo-relevance evidence into the estimation of the score distribution models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract An ever increasing part of communication between persons involve the use of pictures, due to the cheap availability of powerful cameras on smartphones, and the cheap availability of storage space. The rising popularity of social networking applications such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and of instant messaging applications, such as WhatsApp, WeChat, is the clear evidence of this phenomenon, due to the opportunity of sharing in real-time a pictorial representation of the context each individual is living in. The media rapidly exploited this phenomenon, using the same channel, either to publish their reports, or to gather additional information on an event through the community of users. While the real-time use of images is managed through metadata associated with the image (i.e., the timestamp, the geolocation, tags, etc.), their retrieval from an archive might be far from trivial, as an image bears a rich semantic content that goes beyond the description provided by its metadata. It turns out that after more than 20 years of research on Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR), the giant increase in the number and variety of images available in digital format is challenging the research community. It is quite easy to see that any approach aiming at facing such challenges must rely on different image representations that need to be conveniently fused in order to adapt to the subjectivity of image semantics. This paper offers a journey through the main information fusion ingredients that a recipe for the design of a \\{CBIR\\} system should include to meet the demanding needs of users.",

        "abstract": "Abstract With the exponential growth of information available on the Internet and various organisational intranets there is a need for profile based information seeking and retrieval (IS&amp;R) systems. These systems should be able to support users with their context-aware information needs. This paper presents a new approach for enterprise IS&amp;R systems using fuzzy logic to develop task, user and document profiles to model user information seeking behaviour. Relevance feedback was captured from real users engaged in IS&amp;R tasks. The feedback was used to develop a linear regression model for predicting document relevancy based on implicit relevance indicators. Fuzzy relevance profiles were created using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis for the successful user queries. Fuzzy rule based summarisation was used to integrate the three profiles into a unified index reflecting the semantic weight of the query terms related to the task, user and document. The unified index was used to select the most relevant documents and experts related to the query topic. The overall performance of the system was evaluated based on standard precision and recall metrics which show significant improvements in retrieving relevant documents in response to user queries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Evaluating Information Retrieval systems is crucial to making progress in search technologies. Evaluation is often based on assembling reference collections consisting of documents, queries and relevance judgments done by humans. In large-scale environments, exhaustively judging relevance becomes infeasible. Instead, only a pool of documents is judged for relevance. By selectively choosing documents from the pool we can optimize the number of judgments required to identify a given number of relevant documents. We argue that this iterative selection process can be naturally modeled as a reinforcement learning problem and propose innovative and formal adjudication methods based on multi-armed bandits. Casting document judging as a multi-armed bandit problem is not only theoretically appealing, but also leads to highly effective adjudication methods. Under this bandit allocation framework, we consider stationary and non-stationary models and propose seven new document adjudication methods (five stationary methods and two non-stationary variants). Our paper also reports a series of experiments performed to thoroughly compare our new methods against current adjudication methods. This comparative study includes existing methods designed for pooling-based evaluation and existing methods designed for metasearch. Our experiments show that our theoretically grounded adjudication methods can substantially minimize the assessment effort.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackground and Objective Passage retrieval, the identification of top-ranked passages that may contain the answer for a given biomedical question, is a crucial component for any biomedical question answering (QA) system. Passage retrieval in open-domain \\{QA\\} is a longstanding challenge widely studied over the last decades. However, it still requires further efforts in biomedical QA. In this paper, we present a new biomedical passage retrieval method based on Stanford CoreNLP sentence/passage length, probabilistic information retrieval (IR) model and \\{UMLS\\} concepts. Methods In the proposed method, we first use our document retrieval system based on PubMed search engine and \\{UMLS\\} similarity to retrieve relevant documents to a given biomedical question. We then take the abstracts from the retrieved documents and use Stanford CoreNLP for sentence splitter to make a set of sentences, i.e., candidate passages. Using stemmed words and \\{UMLS\\} concepts as features for the \\{BM25\\} model, we finally compute the similarity scores between the biomedical question and each of the candidate passages and keep the N top-ranked ones. Results Experimental evaluations performed on large standard datasets, provided by the BioASQ challenge, show that the proposed method achieves good performances compared with the current state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods by an average of 6.84% in terms of mean average precision (MAP). Conclusion We have proposed an efficient passage retrieval method which can be used to retrieve relevant passages in biomedical \\{QA\\} systems with high mean average precision.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Multimodal Retrieval is a well-established approach for image retrieval. Usually, images are accompanied by text caption along with associated documents describing the image. Textual query expansion as a form of enhancing image retrieval is a relatively less explored area. In this paper, we first study the effect of expanding textual query on both image and its associated text retrieval. Our study reveals that judicious expansion of textual query through keyphrase extraction can lead to better results, either in terms of text-retrieval or both image and text-retrieval. To establish this, we use two well-known keyphrase extraction techniques based on tf-idf and KEA. While query expansion results in increased retrieval efficiency, it is imperative that the expansion be semantically justified. So, we propose a graph-based keyphrase extraction model that captures the relatedness between words in terms of both mutual information and relevance feedback. Most of the existing works have stressed on bridging the semantic gap by using textual and visual features, either in combination or individually. The way these text and image features are combined determines the efficacy of any retrieval. For this purpose, we adopt Fisher-LDA to adjudge the appropriate weights for each modality. This provides us with an intelligent decision-making process favoring the feature set to be infused into the final query. Our proposed algorithm is shown to supersede the previously mentioned keyphrase extraction algorithms for query expansion significantly. A rigorous set of experiments performed on ImageCLEF-2011 Wikipedia Retrieval task dataset validates our claim that capturing the semantic relation between words through Mutual Information followed by expansion of a textual query using relevance feedback can simultaneously enhance both text and image retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The computer vision research aims to enable the computers to recognize visual images as easily as human. Studies have shown that human could segregate target from its surrounding environment, which is intimately associated with the brain memory mechanism. However, it is not quite clear about how the visual images are stored and retrieved in the human brain. In this paper, we propose a psychologically visual information storage and retrieval model (PVISRM) based on sparse coding and probabilistic decision theory. First, the dense scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm is applied to extract the features of visual images and then the extracted features are represented by sparse coding. In the storage procedure, each component of the feature vector is correctly copied with certain probability generated by an exponential distribution. For retrieval, the likelihood ratio between the probe image feature vector and that of each studied image is calculated based on probabilistic theory. Then the category likelihood ratio between the probe image and each category is obtained by adding the ratio values of all images belonging to the same category. Finally, the Bayesian decision rule for image classification is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed \\{PVISRM\\} model can obtain good classification performance and outperforms the \\{SVM\\} approach.",

The synergic effect of accomplishing something greater than the sum of its individual components is reached through the gathering of collaborators\u2019 complementary skills.

Experiments using two user studies with respectively 25 and 10 pairs of collaborators demonstrate the benefit of such an unsupervised method driven by collaborators\u2019 behaviors throughout the search session.

Agents that receive a delegation and move closer to content sources can retrieve data and return it back to requesters. We show that agent-based content retrieval may be even more efficient in scenarios where multi-hop communication is possible. Furthermore, we show that broadcast communication may not be necessarily the best option since dynamic unicast requests have little overhead and can better exploit short contact times between nodes (no broadcast delays required for duplicate suppression).",

Much research has been reported on modelling and correction of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) errors.

Our proposed approach automatically identifies the erroneous variants of query terms and consequently leads to improvement in retrieval performance through query expansion.

        "abstract": "Abstract The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) operator and its variants play an important role as the image feature extractor in the textural image retrieval and classification. The LBP-based operator extracts the textural information of an image by considering the neighboring pixel values. A single or join histogram can be derived from the \\{LBP\\} code which can be used as an image feature descriptor in some applications. However, the LBP-based feature is not a good candidate in capturing the color information of an image, making it is less suitable for measuring the similarity of color images with rich color information. This work overcomes this problem by adding an additional color feature, namely Color Information Feature (CIF), along with the LBP-based feature in the image retrieval and classification systems. The \\{CIF\\} and LBP-based feature adequately represent the color and texture features. As documented in the experimental result, the hybrid \\{CIF\\} and LBP-based feature presents a promising result and outperforms the existing methods over several image databases. Thus, it can be a very competitive candidate in retrieval and classification application.",

This cluster-based \\{CBIR\\} system utilizes an agglomerative hierarchical clustering to group images into visually separable clusters within the dataset. The proposed clustering does not utilize any background data either related to the semantics of images or the number of clusters formed.

This image represents all images in a cluster and hence, there is some loss of information, which is tracked and combined with proportional reduction in error method to automatically get the number of clusters.

        "abstract": "Abstract In contrast with their monolingual counterparts, little attention has been paid to the effects that misspelled queries have on the performance of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems. The present work makes a first attempt to fill this gap by extending our previous work on monolingual retrieval in order to study the impact that the progressive addition of misspellings to input queries has, this time, on the output of \\{CLIR\\} systems. Two approaches for dealing with this problem are analyzed in this paper. Firstly, the use of automatic spelling correction techniques for which, in turn, we consider two algorithms: the first one for the correction of isolated words and the second one for a correction based on the linguistic context of the misspelled word. The second approach to be studied is the use of character n-grams both as index terms and translation units, seeking to take advantage of their inherent robustness and language-independence. All these approaches have been tested on a from-Spanish-to-English \\{CLIR\\} system, that is, Spanish queries on English documents. Real, user-generated spelling errors have been used under a methodology that allows us to study the effectiveness of the different approaches to be tested and their behavior when confronted with different error rates. The results obtained show the great sensitiveness of classic word-based approaches to misspelled queries, although spelling correction techniques can mitigate such negative effects. On the other hand, the use of character n-grams provides great robustness against misspellings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Long-term memories can undergo destabilization/restabilization processes, collectively called reconsolidation. However, the parameters that trigger memory reconsolidation are poorly understood and are a matter of intense investigation. Particularly, memory retrieval is widely held as requisite to initiate reconsolidation. This assumption makes sense since only relevant cues will induce reconsolidation of a specific memory. However, recent studies show that pharmacological inhibition of retrieval does not avoid memory from undergoing reconsolidation, indicating that memory reconsolidation occurs through a process that can be dissociated from retrieval. We propose that retrieval is not a unitary process but has two dissociable components; one leading to the expression of memory and the other to reconsolidation, referred herein as executer and integrator respectively. The executer would lead to the behavioral expression of the memory. This component would be the one disrupted on the studies that show reconsolidation independence from retrieval. The integrator would deal with reconsolidation. This component of retrieval would lead to long-term memory destabilization when specific conditions are met. We think that an important number of reports are consistent with the hypothesis that reconsolidation is only initiated when updating information is acquired. We suggest that the integrator would initiate reconsolidation to integrate updating information into long-term memory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The absence of diacritics in text documents or search queries is a serious problem for Turkish information retrieval because it creates homographic ambiguity. Thus, the inappropriate handling of diacritics reduces the retrieval performance in search engines. A straightforward solution to this problem is to normalize tokens by replacing diacritic characters with their American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) counterparts. However, this so-called \\{ASCIIfication\\} produces either synthetic words that are not legitimate Turkish words or legitimate words with meanings that are completely different from those of the original words. These non-valid synthetic words cannot be processed by morphological analysis components (such as stemmers or lemmatizers), which expect the input to be valid Turkish words. By contrast, synthetic words are not a problem when no stemmer or a simple first-n-characters-stemmer is used in the text analysis pipeline. This difference emphasizes the notion of the diacritic sensitivity of stemmers. In this study, we propose and evaluate an alternative solution based on the application of deASCIIfication, which restores accented letters in query terms or text documents. Our risk-sensitive evaluation results showed that the diacritics restoration approach yielded more effective and robust results compared with normalizing tokens to remove diacritics.",

The present study looks to widen our knowledge about the effectiveness and applicability to that field of non-classical translation mechanisms that work at character n-gram level. For the purpose of this study, an n-gram based system of this type has been developed. This system requires only a bilingual machine-readable dictionary of n-grams, automatically generated from parallel corpora, which serves to translate queries previously n-grammed in the source language. n-Gramming is then used as an approximate string matching technique to perform monolingual text retrieval on the set of n-grammed documents in the target language. The tests for this work have been performed on \\{CLEF\\} collections for seven European languages, taking English as the target language. After an initial tuning phase in order to analyze the most effective way for its application, the results obtained, close to the upper baseline, not only confirm the consistency across languages of this kind of character n-gram based approaches, but also constitute a further proof of their validity and applicability, these not being tied to a given implementation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A main challenge in Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) is to estimate a proper translation model from available translation resources, since translation quality directly affects the retrieval performance. Among different translation resources, we focus on obtaining translation models from comparable corpora, because they provide appropriate translations for both languages and domains with limited linguistic resources. In this paper, we employ a two-step approach to build an effective translation model from comparable corpora, without requiring any additional linguistic resources, for the \\{CLIR\\} task. In the first step, translations are extracted by deriving correlations between source\u2013target word pairs. These correlations are used to estimate word translation probabilities in the second step. We propose a language modeling approach for the first step, where modeling based on probability distribution provides two key advantages. First, our approach can be tuned easier in comparison with heuristically adjusted previous work. Second, it provides a principled basis for integrating additional lexical and translational relations to improve the accuracy of translations from comparable corpora. As an indication, we integrate monolingual relations of word co-occurrences into the process of translation extraction, which helps to extract more reliable translations for low-frequency words in a comparable corpus. Experimental results on an English\u2013Persian comparable corpus show that our method outperforms the previous approaches in terms of both translation quality and the performance of CLIR. Indeed, the proposed method is naturally applicable to any comparable corpus, regardless of its languages. In addition, we demonstrate the significant impact of word translation probabilities, estimated in the second step of our approach, on the performance of CLIR.",

In this paper we examine candidate retrieval, where the goal is to find potential source documents of a suspicious text. Our proposed method for cross-language plagiarism detection is a keyword-focused approach. Since plagiarism usually happens in parts of the text, there is a requirement to segment the texts into fragments to detect local similarity. Therefore we propose a topic-based segmentation algorithm to convert the suspicious document to a set of related passages.

The task of resolving the polarity of a given word instance as positive or negative is addressed as an information retrieval problem. At the pre-processing stage, a vector of context features is built for each word w based on all its occurrences in the positive polarity corpus (consumer reviews with high ratings) and another vector \u2013 on its contexts in the negative polarity corpus (reviews with low ratings). Lexico-syntactic context features are automatically generated from dependency parse graphs of the sentences containing the word. These two vectors are treated as \u201cdocuments\u201d, one with positive and one with negative polarity. To resolve the contextual polarity of a specific instance of the word w in a given sentence, its context feature vector is built in the same way, and is treated as the \u201cquery\u201d. An information retrieval (IR) model is then applied to calculate the similarity of the \u201cquery\u201d to each of the two \u201cdocuments\u201d, with the polarity of the best matching \u201cdocument\u201d attributed to the \u201cquery\u201d. The method uses no prior polarity sentiment lexicons or purposefully annotated training datasets. The only external resource used is a readily available corpus of user-rated reviews. Evaluation on different domains shows more effective performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifiers, on three out of four datasets.

This topic has not been looked at in detail in prior work. We show that the approach proposed in standards bears significant drawbacks. High effort in the input message validation process causes a denial of service weakness of backbone services. Moreover, request messages contain removable data sets making them unnecessarily long, which leads to high bandwidth requirements for reliable communication between backbone and mobile node. Thus, we propose a new data retrieval scheme increasing robustness of the backbone to denial of service attacks and decreasing length of nodes' request messages.

In content centric networks emphasis is on data rather than its location. Content centric networks, support data caching in intermediate nodes that allows them to serve future request. This results in more efficient content delivery. As data is cached at various intermediate nodes, the owner of the data has no control over the data. Data stored in intermediate nodes can be vulnerable and be exploited by the intermediate nodes, malicious users and intruders, who do not have legitimate access to these data. In addition to this entire data is being broadcasted by the intermediate nodes whenever they receive a request for that corresponding data. This utilizes a substantial portion of the network bandwidth. To address these issues we propose a framework in this paper that (1) efficiently organizes data that is cached in intermediate nodes using a \\{NOSQL\\} (Not Only SQL) graph database, (2) reduces the network utilization, (3) secures all the data transferred across content centric networks, such that only owners of the data can provide access to the consumers of their data and (4) provides role-based access to the consumers, and reduces complications in key distribution and management.

        "abstract": "AbstractIntroduction Efficient searching and coding in databases that use terminological resources requires that they support efficient data retrieval. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) is a reference terminology for several countries and organizations to code adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for pharmacovigilance. Ontologies that are available in the medical domain provide several advantages such as reasoning to improve data retrieval. The field of pharmacovigilance does not yet benefit from a fully operational ontology to formally represent the MedDRA terms. Our objective was to build a semantic resource based on formal description logic to improve MedDRA term retrieval and aid the generation of on-demand custom groupings by appropriately and efficiently selecting terms: OntoADR. Methods The method consists of the following steps: (1) mapping between MedDRA terms and SNOMED-CT, (2) generation of semantic definitions using semi-automatic methods, (3) storage of the resource and (4) manual curation by pharmacovigilance experts. Results We built a semantic resource for \\{ADRs\\} enabling a new type of semantics-based term search. OntoADR adds new search capabilities relative to previous approaches, overcoming the usual limitations of computation using lightweight description logic, such as the intractability of unions or negation queries, bringing it closer to user needs. Our automated approach for defining MedDRA terms enabled the association of at least one defining relationship with 67% of preferred terms. The curation work performed on our sample showed an error level of 14% for this automated approach. We tested OntoADR in practice, which allowed us to build custom groupings for several medical topics of interest. Discussion The methods we describe in this article could be adapted and extended to other terminologies which do not benefit from a formal semantic representation, thus enabling better data retrieval performance. Our custom groupings of MedDRA terms were used while performing signal detection, which suggests that the graphical user interface we are currently implementing to process OntoADR could be usefully integrated into specialized pharmacovigilance software that rely on MedDRA.",

        "abstract": "\\{ABSTRACT\\} There are two methods of retrieving information from documents in the field of genomic science and medicine in general, namely: 1) through the combined use of associations determined by the Medical Subject Headings, and 2) by employing specific terminologies, such as in folksonomies, alternative medical-genomic terms in use in the general language, or acronyms or apocopes from the genomics field. To some extent, many thinkers and indexers hold that the combination of two methods may be the best approach. While few authors advocate for keeping the structure of controlled vocabularies, built up over many years of content interpretation, unchanged, there are numerous proposals for expanding the search horizons of thesauri, whether through social cataloging, algorithmic domain analyses that contrast indicators or the semantic web using markers of meaningful semantic lexicons contained in digitized text.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, spatial and temporal data play an important role in social networks. These data are distributed and dispersed in several heterogeneous data sources. These peculiarities make that geographic information retrieval being a non-trivial task, considering that the spatial data are often unstructured and built by different collaborative communities from social networks. The problem arises when user queries are performed with different levels of semantic granularity. This fact is very typical in social communities, where users have different levels of expertise. In this paper, a novelty approach based on three matching-query layers driven by ontologies on the heterogeneous data sources is presented. A technique of query contextualization is proposed for addressing to available heterogeneous data sources including social networks. It consists of contextualizing a query in which whether a data source does not contain a relevant result, other sources either provide an answer or in the best case, each one adds a relevant answer to the set of results. This approach is a collaborative learning system based on experience level of users in different domains. The retrieval process is achieved from three domains: temporal, geographical and social, which are involved in the user-content context. The work is oriented towards defining a \\{GIScience\\} collaborative learning for geographic information retrieval, using social networks, web and geodatabases.",

Self-relevant information is likely to be accompanied by certain affective and motivational states. For instance, individuals may be afraid to be seriously ill and, thus, feel threatened. Threat is known to elicit preferential processing of positive information. Therefore, we predicted that under threat more positive search terms are retrieved from memory and more positive information is retrieved from already encoded online information than in a control condition. Two experiments supported this prediction. Thus, information processing during Internet search is positively biased under threat. This positive bias can satisfy coping needs, but can at the same time have a negative impact on subsequent behavior and decisions.",

Standard images are constructed by following the rule of thirds that divides an image into nine equal parts by placing objects or regions of interest at the intersecting lines of the grid. An image represents regions and objects that are in a spatial semantic relationship with respect to each other. While the Bag of Features (BoF) representation is commonly used for image retrieval, it lacks spatial information. In this paper, we present two novel image representation methods based on the histograms of triangles, which add spatial information to the inverted index of BoF representation. Histograms of triangles are computed at two levels, by dividing an image into two and four triangles that are evaluated separately. Extensive experiments and comparisons conducted on two datasets demonstrate that the proposed image representations enhance the performance of image retrieval.",

Behavioral studies have demonstrated that incidental learning of new \u201cfoil\u201d words in a recognition test is superior if the participant is trying to remember studied items that were semantically encoded compared to items that were non-semantically encoded. Here, we applied subsequent memory analysis to fMRI data to understand the neural mechanisms underlying the \u201cfoil effect\u201d. Participants encoded information during deep semantic and shallow non-semantic tasks and were tested in a subsequent blocked memory task to examine how orienting retrieval towards different types of information influences the incidental encoding of new words presented as foils during the memory test phase. To assess memory for foils, participants performed a further surprise old/new recognition test involving foil words that were encountered during the previous memory test blocks as well as completely new words. Subsequent memory effects, distinguishing successful versus unsuccessful incidental encoding of foils, were observed in regions that included the left inferior frontal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex. The left inferior frontal gyrus exhibited disproportionately larger subsequent memory effects for semantic than non-semantic foils, and significant overlap in activity during semantic, but not non-semantic, initial encoding and foil encoding. The results suggest that orienting retrieval towards different types of foils involves re-implementing the neurocognitive processes that were involved during initial encoding.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Due to its storage efficiency and fast query speed, cross-media hashing methods have attracted much attention for retrieving semantically similar data over heterogeneous datasets. Supervised hashing methods, which utilize the labeled information to promote the quality of hashing functions, achieve promising performance. However, the existing supervised methods generally focus on utilizing coarse semantic information between samples (e.g. similar or dissimilar), and ignore fine semantic information between samples which may degrade the quality of hashing functions. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a supervised hashing method for cross-media retrieval which utilizes the coarse-to-fine semantic similarity to learn a sharing space. The inter-category and intra-category semantic similarity are effectively preserved in the sharing space. Then an iterative descent scheme is proposed to achieve an optimal relaxed solution, and hashing codes can be generated by quantizing the relaxed solution. At last, to further improve the discrimination of hashing codes, an orthogonal rotation matrix is learned by minimizing the quantization loss while preserving the optimality of the relaxed solution. Extensive experiments on widely used Wiki and NUS-WIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.",

Aims The aims of this study were to examine the use of different medical information resources by nurses and their information searching and retrieving skills in the context of EBP. Method A descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted in four teaching hospitals in Iran. Data were collected from 182 nurses using a questionnaire in 2014. Results The nurses indicated that they use more human and printed resources than electronic resources to seek information (mean = 2.83, \\{SD\\} = 1.5; mean = 2.77, \\{SD\\} = 1.07; and mean = 2.13, \\{SD\\} = 0.88, respectively). To search online resources, the nurses use quick/basic search features more frequently (mean = 2.45, \\{SD\\} = 1.15) than other search features such as advanced search, index browsing and MeSH term searching. (1.74 \u2264 mean \u2264 2.30, \\{SD\\} = 1.01). At least 80% of the nurses were not aware of the purpose or function of search operators such as Boolean and proximity operators. In response to the question measuring skills of the nurses in developing an effective search statement by using Boolean operators, only 20% of them selected the more appropriate statement, using some synonyms of the concepts in a given subject. Conclusion The study showed that the information seeking and retrieval skills of the nurses were poor and there were clear deficits in the use of updated information resources. To compensate their \\{EBP\\} incompetency, nurses may resort to human resources. In order to use the latest up to date evidence independently, nurses need to improve their information literacy. To reach this goal, clinical librarians, health information specialists, nursing faculties, and clinical nurse educators and mentors can play key roles by providing educational programs. Providing access to online resources in clinical wards can also encourage nurses to learn and use these resources.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Information Centric Networking (ICN) leverages in-network caching to provide efficient data distribution and better performance by replicating contents in multiple nodes to bring content nearer the users. Since contents are stored and replicated into node caches, the content validity must be assured end-to-end. Each content object carries a digital signature to provide a proof of its integrity, authenticity, and provenance. However, the use of digital signatures requires a key management infrastructure to manage the key life cycle. To perform a proper signature verification, a node needs to know whether the signing key is valid or it has been revoked. This paper discusses how to retrieve up-to-date signing keys in the \\{ICN\\} scenario. In the usual public key infrastructure, the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL) or the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enable applications to obtain the revocation status of a certificate. However, the push-based distribution of Certificate Revocation Lists and the request/response paradigm of Online Certificate Status Protocol should be fit in the mechanism of named-data. We consider three possible approaches to distribute up-to-date keys in a similar way to the current \\{CRL\\} and OCSP. Then, we suggest a fourth protocol leveraging a set of distributed notaries, which naturally fits the \\{ICN\\} scenario. Finally, we evaluate the number and size of exchanged messages of each solution, and then we compare the methods considering the perceived latency by the end nodes and the throughput on the network links.",

However, problems such as why data fusion can increase effectiveness and favorable conditions for the use of data fusion methods are poorly resolved at best. In this paper, we formally describe data fusion under a geometric framework, in which each component result returned from an information retrieval system for a given query is represented as a point in a multi-dimensional space. The Euclidean distance is the measure by which the effectiveness and similarity of search results are judged. This allows us to explain all component results and fused results using geometrical principles. In such a framework, score-based data fusion becomes a deterministic problem. Several interesting features of the centroid-based data fusion method and the linear combination method are discussed. Nevertheless, in retrieval evaluation, ranking-based measures are the most popular. Therefore, this paper investigates the relation and correlation between the Euclidean distance and several typical ranking-based measures. We indeed find that a very strong correlation exists between these. It means that the theorems and observations obtained using the Euclidean distance remain valid when ranking-based measures are used. The proposed framework enables us to have a better understanding of score-based data fusion and use score-based data fusion methods more precisely and effectively in various ways.",

When applying this effect in education, it is an important question which type of retrieval task works best. Several studies have shown that learning is enhanced by linking new information with prior knowledge. A potential approach to making retrieval more effective, therefore, is to enrich retrieval instructions with the requirement to elaborate on the learning contents and link them to what is already known. In this study, we compared a free recall condition, as used in many studies on learning by retrieval, with a prompted recall condition in which learners were required to recall the information and apply it to their lives. Fifty-six undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of these two conditions. They learned from a video-recorded lecture. One week later, learning outcomes were assessed by a posttest measuring fact recall and comprehension of the contents from the video lecture. Learners in the prompted recall group, compared to the free recall group, used more elaborative strategies in response to the recall task and achieved better comprehension scores. The effect on comprehension was mediated by the use of elaborative strategies. This pattern of results supports the constructive retrieval hypothesis, stating that retrieval is most effective when it involves constructive elaboration of the contents being learned. Our findings also encourage the use of pedagogical tasks in classroom teaching that combine elaboration and retrieval.",

We varied (a) whether the adjunct questions required the learners to summarize (low complexity) or generate inferences on the basis of provided information (high complexity) and (b) whether the adjunct questions were implemented in a closed-book style that required learners to engage in retrieval or in an open-book style that did not require learners to engage in retrieval while responding to the questions.

Next, fuzzy-rough upper approximation of the target set (relevant list of images) with respect to the entire database that is represented by the prominent feature subset, is computed for retrieval and ranking. The information table on which every feature selection method works is small in size. Main reasons of performance boost of the proposed method are twofold. One is efficient feature subsets selection. The other reason is the fuzzy-indiscernibility relation based fuzzy-rough framework for computing upper-approximation which supports the approximate equality or similarity sense of CBIR. Fuzzy-rough upper approximation possibly adds more similar images in the relevant list from boundary region to expand the relevant list.

Our primary idea is to label the landmarks with the grid-like structure in the network using the landmark-labeling, dynamically designate the node that is the nearest to a landmark as the landmark broker, and transmit the consumers\u2019 interests (or producers\u2019 data) to all horizontal (or vertical) landmark brokers using the double-ruling technique. Simulations show that MobiMark achieves good performance in terms of data retrieval rate and data retrieval latency.

It is used as one of the major knowledge representation mechanism for semantic web. Introducing the ontology knowledge provides more relevant search results for the users information need. To deal with uncertain information, the mechanism supported by the regular ontology may not be adequate and the requirement for new technique arises. Fuzzy based methods are the proven methods to interpret the uncertain information. The combination of Fuzzy and Ontology based information retrieval provides better results as they mainly deal with the semantics and the uncertainty of information. Keyword matching is one another widely used method which matches the input keywords with the existing information domain to find the best match results. When the input queries are complex the fuzzy ontology based information retrieval which respects the user's keyword and the domain produces more accurate results. This work enlarges the fuzzy ontology knowledge results along with the input queries and keyword matching. The given algorithm is a hybrid technique based on matching extracted instances from the input queries and in information domain. Overall, compared to the existing query models supported by fuzzy ontology or keyword based models the hybrid ontology with keyword matching is sufficient and easy way to retrieve the documents in semantic web.

Based on a (t, n) threshold secret sharing algorithm, the measurement key used in the row scanning compressive ghost imaging can be decomposed and shared into two pairs of sub-keys, which are then reconstructed using two phase-only mask (POM) keys with fixed pixel values, placed in the input plane and transform plane 2 of the phase retrieval scheme, respectively; and the other \\{POM\\} key in the transform plane 1 can be generated and updated by the iterative encoding of each plaintext image.

        "abstract": "Abstract The salient region is the most important part of an image. The salient portion in images also attracts the most attention when people search for images in large-scale datasets. However, to improve image retrieval accuracy, considering only the most salient object in an image is insufficient because the background also influences the accuracy of image retrieval. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel concept called the extended salient region (ESR). First, the salient region of an input image is detected using a Region Contrast (RC) algorithm. Then, a polar coordinate system is constructed; the centroid of the salient region is set as the pole. Next, the regions surrounding the salient region are determined by the neighboring regions, moving in a counterclockwise direction. The resulting combination of the salient region and its surrounding regions is defined as the ESR. We extract the visual content from the \\{ESR\\} using the well-known Bag of Words (BoW) model based on Gabor, \\{SIFT\\} and \\{HSVH\\} features and propose a graph model of the visual content nodes to represent the input image. Then, we design a novel algorithm to perform matching between two images. We also define a new similarity measure by combining the similarities of the salient region and the surrounding regions using weights. Finally, to better evaluate the image retrieval accuracy, an improved measure called the mean label average precision (MLAP) is proposed. The results of experiments on three benchmark datasets (Corel, \\{TU\\} Darmstadt, and Caltech 101) demonstrate that our proposed \\{ESR\\} model and region-matching algorithm are highly effective at image retrieval, and can achieve more accurate query results than current state-of-the-art methods.",

There is a gap between low level features and high level semantic information. This is called semantic gap and it is the most important problem in CBIR. The visual properties were extracted from low level features such as color, shape, texture and spatial information in early days. Local Feature Descriptors (LFDs) are more successful to increase performance of \\{CBIR\\} system. Then, a semantic bridge is built with high level semantic information. Sparse Representations (SRs) have become popular to achieve this aim in the last years. In this study, \\{CBIR\\} models that use \\{LFDs\\} and \\{SRs\\} in literature are investigated in detail. The \\{SRs\\} and \\{LFD\\} extraction algorithms are tested and compared within a \\{CBIR\\} framework for different scenarios.

Nonetheless, the majority of information retrieval and text summarization methods rely on shallow document representations that do not account for the semantics of events. In this article, we present event graphs, a novel event-based document representation model that filters and structures the information about events described in text. To construct the event graphs, we combine machine learning and rule-based models to extract sentence-level event mentions and determine the temporal relations between them. Building on event graphs, we present novel models for information retrieval and multi-document summarization. The information retrieval model measures the similarity between queries and documents by computing graph kernels over event graphs. The extractive multi-document summarization model selects sentences based on the relevance of the individual event mentions and the temporal structure of events. Experimental evaluation shows that our retrieval model significantly outperforms well-established retrieval models on event-oriented test collections, while the summarization model outperforms competitive models from shared multi-document summarization tasks.",

Participants learned sequential finger movements to be performed either with the left or with the right index finger. Subsequently, they selectively practiced half the items of one hand. A final recall test then assessed memory for all initially learned items. We contrasted different retrieval modalities. In Experiment 1, retrieval practice pertained to motor responses in one experimental condition but it pertained to visual sequence displays in another condition. The final recall test was motoric in both conditions. In Experiment 2, retrieval practice always pertained to visual sequence displays but the final recall test either pertained to motor responses or to visual sequence displays. Retrieval-induced forgetting emerged only when the modality of the final recall test matched the modality of retrieval practice. In Experiment 3, retrieval practice either involved executing motor sequences with the same finger as in the learning phase or participants had to use the opposite hand for indicating sequences. An effector change for retrieval practice eliminated retrieval-induced forgetting in a test requiring the execution of motor sequences again with the same finger as in the learning phase. We suggest that retrieval-induced forgetting occurred as a consequence of retrieval-modality-specific inhibition.",

All prior local patterns are based on gray-level difference of pixels located in a square or circle. Since many of the actual textures can be represented by intensity relationship of pixels along a line, these methods do not have a suitable ability to represent texture information. In prior methods, difference between referenced pixel and its adjacent pixel is encoded with two, three or four values which leads to information loss of the image.

        "abstract": "Abstract Research into anomia has been carried out in English and many Indo-European languages extensively, but not in Arabic. Previous studies have investigated predictors of successful lexical retrieval after anomia, and access to syntax during lexical retrieval. The aim of the current study is to examine impaired lexical retrieval in Arabic at two levels: predictors of lexical retrieval, and access to syntax during lexical retrieval, via checking whether syntactic cueing (using the definite article/\u0259l-/'the' prior to nouns) facilitates noun retrieval in Arabic aphasia, with regard to naming speed and accuracy, and establishing the determinants of aphasic noun retrieval in Arabic. Three participants with anomia following \\{CVA\\} named 186 pictures from a published Arabic database in two conditions: bare noun condition, and determiner\u00a0+\u00a0noun condition. Participants' accuracy and reaction times were compared in both conditions. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis was carried out to test the effect of psycholinguistic variables (visual complexity, name agreement, age of acquisition, imageability and other intrinsic variables) on successful lexical retrieval to determine predictors of Arabic noun retrieval after anomia. The production of the determiner\u00a0+\u00a0noun in picture naming facilitated spoken naming in all three participants. Nouns produced with the determiner were produced faster and more accurately than their counterparts produced without the determiner. The two participants with agrammatism produced morpho-syntactic errors in the bare noun condition, but not in the determiner\u00a0+\u00a0noun condition, suggesting that the determiner sets up a noun phrase frame with a slot for the noun to be filled, resulting in responses that are faster and more accurate. Age of acquisition and imageability were the only two variables that had influence across the participants. These results have theoretical and clinical implications for lexical retrieval models.",

In such deployments it is necessary to continuously monitor the accuracy of each of the sensor data streams so that we can account for sudden failures of sensors, or errors due to calibration drive or biofouling. In multimedia information retrieval (MMIR), we search through archives of multimedia artefacts like video programs, by implementing several independent retrieval systems or agents, and we combine the outputs of each retrieval agent in order to generate an overall ranking. In this paper we draw parallels between these seemingly very different applications and show how they share several similarities. In the case of environmental monitoring we also need some mechanism by which we can establish the trust and reputation of each contributing sensor, though this is something we do not need in MMIR. In this paper we present an outline of a trust and reputation framework we have developed and deployed for monitoring the performance of sensors in a heterogeneous sensor network.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Blood centers often receive information from individuals after blood donation that should have resulted in their deferral and may attempt to retrieve distributed blood components that did not meet all quality standards and regulations. Typically, the information is discovered or reported only after the components from the donation have been transfused. Blood centers may notify the transfusion service and provide a statement of the potential risk, if any, associated with the blood components, but the transfusion service must decide if further investigation, notification of the transfusing physician, or counseling of the patient is warranted. Currently, postdonation information (PDI) affects an estimated 1 in 600 donations in the United States. Despite the regularity with which \\{PDI\\} occurs, there has been little analysis of the main sources of PDI, associated transfusion risk, or the actual benefit of various actions taken as a result of PDI. However, blood centers attempt to retrieve thousands of components each year for PDI: actions that can cause confusion, concern, and complaints from hospitals and transfusion services. Postdonation information is largely a reflection of the inherent limitations of the current donor screening process, which is error-prone and uses broad, precautionary questions to guard against theoretical or extremely remote risks. This article reviews the most commonly reported \\{PDI\\} and available information on the possible risk associated with the transfused components from the involved donations, to formulate a framework for blood center retrieval actions and hospital notification that is consistent with current regulations and commensurate with the likelihood of adverse outcomes associated with the most commonly reported PDI.",

In order to ensure the retrieval accuracy, a large vocabulary is always used in traditional methods. However, a large vocabulary will lead to a low recall. In order to improve recall, vocabularies with medium sizes are proposed, but they will lead to a low accuracy. To address these two problems, we propose a new method for image retrieval based on feature fusion and sparse representation over separable vocabulary. Firstly, a large vocabulary is generated on the training dataset. Secondly, the vocabulary is separated into a number of vocabularies with medium sizes. Thirdly, for a given query image, we adopt sparse representation to select a vocabulary for retrieval. In the proposed method, the large vocabulary can guarantee a relatively high accuracy, while the vocabularies with medium sizes are responsible for high recall. Also, in order to reduce quantization error and improve recall, sparse representation scheme is used for visual words quantization. Moreover, both the local features and the global features are fused to improve the recall. Our proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, i.e., Coil20 and Holidays.

        "abstract": "Abstract Cross-media retrieval is to submit data of any media type, and get semantically relevant results of different media types. Most existing approaches project low-level features of cross-media data onto a unified feature space. However, some of these feature spaces usually have no explicit semantics, which ignore the intrinsic semantic information contained in the original media content. The others only have coarse-grained semantics suffering from the ambiguity of high-level concepts, because the coarse-grained correlation between low-level features and high-level concepts is simply utilized. Hence, the aforementioned approaches cannot generate the descriptive representation of media content, leading to reduced effectiveness to measure the semantic similarities among cross-media data. To address the above problems, we propose a novel approach to cross-media retrieval by exploiting the fine-grained correlation at the entity level and generating the unified descriptive representation. Concretely, the proposed approach first constructs an entity level with fine-grained semantics between low-level features and high-level concepts. Second, by minimizing (maximizing) the distances between media content with positive (negative) correlation at the entity level, we learn the distance-preserving entity projections (DPEP) and generate the unified descriptive representation of media content. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The web is a network of linked sites whereby each site either forms a physical portal or a standalone page. In the former case, the portal presents an access point to its embedded web pages that coherently present a specific topic. In the latter case, there are millions of standalone web pages, that are scattered throughout the web, having the same topic and could be conceptually linked together to form virtual portals. Search engines have been developed to help users in reaching the adequate pages in an efficient and effective manner. All the known current search engine techniques rely on the web page as the basic atomic search unit. They ignore the conceptual links, that reveal the implicit web related meanings, among the retrieved pages. However, building a semantic model for the whole portal may contain more semantic information than a model of scattered individual pages. In addition, user queries can be poor and contain imprecise terms that do not reflect the real user intention. Consequently, retrieving the standalone individual pages that are directly related to the query may not satisfy the user\u2019s need. In this paper, we propose PREFCA, a Portal Retrieval Engine based on Formal Concept Analysis that relies on the portal as the main search unit. \\{PREFCA\\} consists of three phases: First, the information extraction phase that is concerned with extracting portal\u2019s semantic data. Second, the formal concept analysis phase that utilizes formal concept analysis to discover the conceptual links among portal and attributes. Finally, the information retrieval phase where we propose a portal ranking method to retrieve ranked pairs of portals and embedded pages. Additionally, we apply the network analysis rules to output some portal characteristics. We evaluated \\{PREFCA\\} using two data sets, namely the Forum for Information Retrieval Evaluation 2010 and ClueWeb09 (category B) test data, for physical and virtual portals respectively. \\{PREFCA\\} proves higher F-measure accuracy, better Mean Average Precision ranking and comparable network analysis and efficiency results than other search engine approaches, namely Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and \\{BM25\\} techniques.

In this study, we propose a data-driven method for outdoor scene modeling by using fast retrieval and automatic optimization layout techniques. Unlike the current methods, we first employ an improved manifold ranking algorithm in the sketch-based 3D model retrieval stage, which achieves higher accuracy. Next, according to the particular properties of outdoor architectures, specialized constraints are then proposed to define an energy function, which meets both the functional and aesthetic requirements. Finally, we cast the auto-arrangement as a combinatorial optimization problem, which we solve using an optimization algorithm. In contrast to the earlier version of this method, which was presented at Cyberworlds 2016, this extended version combines simulated annealing and particle swarm optimization algorithms, which have the advantages of rapid convergence and avoiding becoming trapped by local minima. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more intuitive and effective for modeling 3D scenes, and can be employed in the actual development of game scenes.",

We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two datasets for both segmentation and retrieval, validating the results using ground truth data.

However, little is known about the role of medial prefrontal cortex in long-term memory retrieval. We evaluate this issue in one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance (IA) paradigm. Our results showed that, 1) inactivation of mPFC by local infusion of GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol caused severe deficits in retrieval of 1-day and 7-day but had no effects on 2-h inhibitory avoidance memory; 2) the protein level of phosphorylated-ERK1/2 in mPFC were significantly increased following retrieval of 1-day and 7-day \\{IA\\} memory, so did the numbers of phosphorylated-ERK (pERK) and phosphorylated-CREB (pCREB) labeled neurons; 3) intra-mPFC infusion of \\{ERK\\} kinase inhibitor \\{PD98095\\} significantly reduced phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels and phosphorylated-ERK1/2 and phosphorylated-CREB labeled cells, and severely impaired retrieval of 7-day \\{IA\\} memory when the drugs were administrated 30 min prior to test.

        "abstract": "AbstractBackground Growing rod constructs are an important contribution for treating patients with Early Onset Scoliosis. These devices experience high failure rates, including rod fractures. Purpose The objective of this study was to identify the failure mechanism of retrieved growing rods, and to identify differences between patients with failed and intact constructs. Study Design/Setting Growing rod patients who had implant removal and were previously enrolled in a multicenter registry were eligible for this study. Patient Sample Forty (40) dual-rod constructs were retrieved from 36 patients across four centers, and 34 of those constructs met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen (18) constructs failed due to rod fracture. Sixteen (16) intact constructs were removed due to final fusion (n = 7), implant exchange (n = 5), infection (n = 2), or implant prominence (n = 2). Outcome Measures Analyses of clinical registry data, radiographs, and retrievals. Methods Retrievals were analyzed with microscopic imaging (optical and scanning electron microscopy) for areas of mechanical failure, damage, and corrosion. Failure analyses were conducted on the fracture surfaces to identify failure mechanism(s). Statistical analyses were performed to determine significant differences between the failed and intact groups. Results The failed rods fractured due to bending fatigue under flexion motion. Construct configuration and loading dictate high bending stresses at three distinct locations along the construct: 1) mid-construct, 2) adjacent to the tandem connector, or 3) adjacent to the distal anchor foundation. In addition, high torques used to insert set screws may create an initiation point for fatigue. Syndromic scoliosis, prior rod fractures, increase in patient weight, and rigid constructs consisting of tandem connectors and multiple crosslinks were associated with failure. Conclusions This is the first study to examine retrieved, failed growing rod implants across multiple centers. Our analysis found that rod fractures are due to bending fatigue, and that stress concentrations play an important role in rod fractures. Recommendations are made regarding surgical technique such as use of torque-limiting wrenches and/or not exceeding the prescribed torques. Additional recommendations include frequent rod replacement in select patients during scheduled surgeries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The estimation of query model is an important task in language modeling (LM) approaches to information retrieval (IR). The ideal estimation is expected to be not only effective in terms of high mean retrieval performance over all queries, but also stable in terms of low variance of retrieval performance across different queries. In practice, however, improving effectiveness can sacrifice stability, and vice versa. In this paper, we propose to study this tradeoff from a new perspective, i.e., the bias\u2013variance tradeoff, which is a fundamental theory in statistics. We formulate the notion of bias\u2013variance regarding retrieval performance and estimation quality of query models. We then investigate several estimated query models, by analyzing when and why the bias\u2013variance tradeoff will occur, and how the bias and variance can be reduced simultaneously. A series of experiments on four \\{TREC\\} collections have been conducted to systematically evaluate our bias\u2013variance analysis.

Even though medical thesauri such as the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and related tools (e.g., the MeSH Browser) were created to help consumers find medical term definitions, the lack of direct and explicit integration of these help tools into a health retrieval system prevented them from effectively achieving their objectives. To explore this issue, we conducted an empirical study with two systems: One is a simple interface system supporting query-based searching; the other is an augmented system with two new components supporting MeSH term searching and MeSH tree browsing. A total of 45 subjects were recruited to participate in the study. The results indicated that the augmented system is more effective than the simple system in terms of improving user-perceived topic familiarity and question\u2013answer performance, even though we did not find users spend more time on the augmented system.

We consider verbosity a different property of queries from length since a verbose query is not necessarily long, it might be succinct and a short query might be verbose. This paper proposes a methodology to automatically detect verbose queries and conditionally modify queries. The methodology proposed in this paper exploits state-of-the-art classification algorithms, combines concepts from a large linguistic database and uses a topic gisting algorithm we designed for verbose query modification purposes. Our experimental results have been obtained using the \\{TREC\\} Robust track collection, thirty topics classified by difficulty degree, four queries per topic classified by verbosity and length, and human assessment of query verbosity. Our results suggest that the methodology for query modification conditioned to query verbosity detection and topic gisting is significantly effective and that query modification should be refined when topic difficulty and query verbosity are considered since these two properties interact and query verbosity is not straightforwardly related to query length.",

However, a notable problem emerged in the current \\{IR\\} systems is that the input queries are usually too short and too ambiguous to express their actual idea which largely affects the performance of \\{IR\\} systems. In this study, a novel query recommendation technology which suggests a list of related queries is proposed to resolve these problems. The query concepts can be firstly extracted from the web-snippets of the search result returned by the input query. A bipartite graph is subsequently built to identify the related queries, and the query similarity can be calculated by such bipartite graph. Moreover, by analyzing the \\{URLs\\} clicked by users, we find that some tokens appeared in \\{URLs\\} are very meaningful, especial for some typical topic-based pages. Therefore, these potential tokens which can provide a brief description from the subject of the \\{URL\\} are also considered. In order to reveal the real semantics between queries, the approach TF-IQF model is further discussed, and three features of a query, i.e. clicked documents, associated query and reversed query, are utilized in our approach in depth. Such a method could hopefully acquire the comprehensive idea of a query. To investigate how these three features could be used effectively for query recommendation in search engine, we adopt the benchmark evaluation criterions in our experiments, and the experimental results show its promising results in comparison with state of the art methods.",

Specifically, design teams face considerable challenges in making effective use of increasing amounts of information. In order to support product information retrieval and reuse, one approach is to use case-based reasoning (CBR) in which problems are solved \u201cby using or adapting solutions to old problems.\u201d In CBR, a case includes both a representation of the problem and a solution to that problem. Case-based reasoning uses similarity measures to identify cases which are more relevant to the problem to be solved. However, most non-numeric similarity measures are based on syntactic grounds, which often fail to produce good matches when confronted with the meaning associated to the words they compare. To overcome this limitation, ontologies can be used to produce similarity measures that are based on semantics. This paper presents an ontology-based approach that can determine the similarity between two classes using feature-based similarity measures that replace features with attributes. The proposed approach is evaluated against other existing similarities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study on product\u2013service\u2013system design problems.",

This paper presents a date spotting based information retrieval system for natural scene image and video frames where text appears with complex backgrounds. We propose a line based date spotting approach using hidden Markov model (HMM) which is used to detect the date information in a given text. Different date models are searched from a line without segmenting characters or words. Given a text line image in RGB, we apply an efficient gray image conversion to enhance the text information. Wavelet decomposition and gradient sub-bands are used to enhance text information in gray scale. Next, pyramid histogram of oriented gradient (PHOG) feature has been extracted from gray image and binary images for date-spotting framework. Binary and gray image features are combined by \\{MLP\\} based tandem approach. Finally, to boost the performance further, a shape coding based scheme is used to combine the similar shape characters in same class during word spotting. For our experiment, three different date models have been constructed to search similar date information having numeric dates that contains numeral values and punctuations and semi-numeric that contains dates with numerals along with months in scene/video text.

        "abstract": "Summary Although it is now well established that the hippocampus supports memory encoding [1, 2], little is\u00a0known about hippocampal activity during spontaneous memory retrieval. Recent intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) work has shown that hippocampal activity during encoding predicts subsequent temporal organization of memories [3], supporting a role in contextual binding. It is an open question, however, whether the hippocampus similarly supports contextually mediated processes during retrieval. Here, we analyzed iEEG recordings obtained from 215 epilepsy patients as they performed a free recall task. To identify neural activity specifically associated with contextual retrieval, we compared correct recalls, intrusions (incorrect recall of either items from prior lists or items not previously studied), and deliberations (matched periods during recall when no items came to mind). Neural signals that differentiate correct recalls from both other retrieval classes reflect contextual retrieval, as correct recalls alone arise from the correct context. We found that in the\u00a0hippocampus, high-frequency activity (HFA, 44\u2013100\u00a0Hz), a proxy for neural activation [4], was greater prior to correct recalls relative to the other retrieval classes, with no differentiation between intrusions and deliberations. This pattern was not observed in other memory-related cortical regions, including DLPFC, thus supporting a specific hippocampal contribution to contextually mediated memory retrieval.",

We consider that the structure of \\{XML\\} document is an important source of prior knowledge, and the structural features of an element may influence the user to consider that element as relevant. We build a probabilistic model to estimate the probability that the structural characteristics of an element attract user to explore the content of this element and consider it as relevant. This probability reflects the context importance. We propose a simple, well-motivated probabilistic model to estimate the context importance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the context importance through comprehensive experimental studies carried out on \\{IEEE\\} \\{XML\\} document collection.

Parietal successful retrieval activity also varies with response bias, or the tendency to be conservative about making \u201cold\u201d judgments. Here, we examined whether differences in response bias associated with recognition judgments of perceived and imagined events could account for source-based differences in \\{LPPC\\} activity. Participants perceived and imagined items in response to cue words and then at test, made recognition judgments in blocks that knowingly contained either a high or low proportion of old to new trials. While participants were indeed more conservative when making judgments about perceived than imagined events, the neuroimaging results demonstrated that response bias and source effects occurred in non-overlapping parietal regions. These findings suggest that source-based differences in \\{LPPC\\} activity cannot be explained by differences in response bias associated with recognizing perceived and imagined events.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Interference has been identified as a cause of processing difficulty in linguistic dependencies, such as the subject-verb relation (Van Dyke and Lewis, 2003). However, while mounting evidence implicates retrieval interference in sentence processing, the nature of the retrieval cues involved - and thus the source of difficulty - remains largely unexplored. Three experiments used self-paced reading and eyetracking to examine the ways in which the retrieval cues provided at a verb characterize subjects. Syntactic theory has identified a number of properties correlated with subjecthood, both phrase-structural and thematic. Findings replicate and extend previous findings of interference at a verb from additional subjects, but indicate that retrieval outcomes are relativized to the syntactic domain in which the retrieval occurs. One, the cues distinguish between thematic subjects in verbal and nominal domains. Two, within the verbal domain, retrieval is sensitive to abstract syntactic properties associated with subjects and their clauses. We argue that the processing at a verb requires cue-driven retrieval, and that the retrieval cues utilize abstract grammatical properties which may reflect parser expectations.",

However, the retrieval performances of these techniques are directly affected by the quality of feature matching during the search process. In general, undesirable matched results appear mainly due to the following three aspects: (1) the locality of local features, (2) the quantization errors and (3) the phenomenon of burstiness. In this paper, starting from the framework of SMK, an in-depth study of the integration of Twin Feature (TF) and Similarity Maximal Matching (SMM) is fully investigated. To be specific, two effective modifications based on \\{TF\\} and \\{SMM\\} are proposed to further improve the quality of feature matching. On one hand, the original float vectors of \\{TF\\} are replaced with efficient binary signatures, which achieve relatively high efficiency and comparable accuracy of retrieval. On the other hand, Dynamic Normalization (DN) is designed to effectively control the impact of penalization generated by \\{SMM\\} and improve the performance with almost no extra cost. At last, an efficient image retrieval system is designed and realized based on a cloud-based heterogeneous computing framework through Apache Spark and multiple \\{GPUs\\} to deal with large-scale tasks.

The quantization errors and the prediction errors jointly guide the learning of the deep network. They are highly interrelated and promoted each other.

This method samples the posterior multiple-layer snow properties according to the likelihood of the brightness temperature (TB) simulation with the actual \\{TB\\} observations. The Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks with improved Born approximation (MEMLS-IBA) was used as the observation model. Using a globally applicable method to produce prior estimates of snow properties, the retrieval approach is called the Bayesian Algorithm for \\{SWE\\} Estimation with Passive Microwave measurements (BASE-PM), and was applied on 48 snowpits at Sodankyl\u00e4, Finland; Churchill, Canada and Colorado, US. The result shows that the root mean squared (RMS) error of the retrieved \\{SWE\\} is 42.7 mm excluding two outliers, and is 30.8 mm if the outliers as well as six deep snowpits from Colorado are excluded. This accuracy approximately meets the 30-mm requirement of Integrated Global Observing Strategy for shallow snow. The poor performance for the outlier and deep snowpits is explained. Additional experiments using more accurate priors show that \\{SWE\\} retrieval accuracy can be improved with local snowcover knowledge, e.g. if historical snowpit measurements or snow process model simulations are available.",

In this paper, we propose histogram feature refinement methods for enhancing performance of texture descriptor based content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. In the proposed approach for histogram refinement, each pixel in the query and database images is classified into one of the two categories based on the analysis of pixel values in its neighborhood. Local patterns corresponding to two sets of pixels are used to generate two histogram features for each image, effectively resulting in splitting of the original global histogram of texture descriptors into two based on the category of each pixel. Resulting histograms are then concatenated to form a single histogram feature. This study also explores three hybrid frameworks for histogram refinement in \\{CBIR\\} systems. Comparison of histogram features corresponding to query and database images are performed using the relative l 1 distance metric. Performance evaluation on three publicly available benchmark image databases namely, \\{GHIM\\} 10000, \\{COREL\\} 1000 database, and Brodatz texture database shows that performances of existing texture descriptor based approaches improve considerably when the proposed histogram feature refinement is incorporated.

        "abstract": "Abstract Retrieval orientation refers to a pre-retrieval process and conceptualizes the specific form of processing that is applied to a retrieval cue. In the current event-related potential (ERP) study, we sought to find evidence for an involvement of the auditory cortex when subjects attempt to retrieve vocalized information, and hypothesized that adopting retrieval orientation would be beneficial for retrieval accuracy. During study, participants saw object words that they subsequently vocalized or visually imagined. At test, participants had to identify object names of one study condition as targets and to reject object names of the second condition together with new items. Target category switched after half of the test trials. Behaviorally, participants responded less accurately and more slowly to targets of the vocalize condition than to targets of the imagine condition. \\{ERPs\\} to new items varied at a single left electrode (T7) between 500 and 800 ms, indicating a moderate retrieval orientation effect in the subject group as a whole. However, whereas the effect was strongly pronounced in participants with high retrieval accuracy, it was absent in participants with low retrieval accuracy. A current source density (CSD) mapping of the retrieval orientation effect indicated a source over left temporal regions. Independently from retrieval accuracy, the \\{ERP\\} retrieval orientation effect was surprisingly also modulated by test order. Findings are suggestive for an involvement of the auditory cortex in retrieval attempts of vocalized information and confirm that adopting retrieval orientation is potentially beneficial for retrieval accuracy. The effects of test order on retrieval-related processes might reflect a stronger focus on the newness of items in the more difficult test condition when participants started with this condition.",

In many cases, the large scale data in real-world lie near some (unknown) low-dimensional and non-linear manifold. Moreover, Manifold Ranking approach can preserve the global topological structure of the data set more effectively than Euclidean Distance-based Ranking approach, which fails to preserve the semantic relevance degree. However, most existing hashing methods ignore the global topological structure of the data set. The key issue is how to incorporate the global topological structure of data set into learning effective hashing function. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised hashing approach, namely Manifold-Ranking Embedded Order Preserving Hashing (MREOPH). A manifold ranking loss is introduced to solve the issue of global topological structure preserving. An order preserving loss is introduced to ensure the consistency between manifold ranking and hamming ranking. A hypercubic quantization loss is introduced to learn discrete binary codes. The information theoretic regularization term is taken into consideration for preserving desirable properties of hash codes.

However, it remains unclear whether the effect of learning and retrieval processes on intelligence is unique or merely due to the variance shared with working memory. The current study attempted to achieve a relatively purified representation of learning and retrieval processes and to examine whether they predict fluid intelligence beyond working memory. A sample of 220 university students completed a rule-based learning task, the Posner task, two working memory tasks and two fluid intelligence scales. Fixed-links models were used to separate the core processes representing learning and retrieval from the auxiliary processes and to link them with fluid intelligence. Results showed that the learning and retrieval processes contributed significantly to fluid intelligence (r = 0.38 and \u2212 0.35 respectively). More importantly, both learning and retrieval processes were still predictive of fluid intelligence when working memory was controlled for.

The reconsolidation hypothesis proposes that a previously consolidated memory reactivated by a reminder enters a vulnerability phase (labilization) during which it is transiently sensitive to modulation, followed by a re-stabilization phase. However, previous studies show that the expression of memories during reminder sessions is not a condition to trigger the reconsolidation process since unexpressed memories can be reactivated and labilized. Here we evaluate whether it is possible to reactivate-labilize a memory under the impairing-effects of a mild stressor. We used a paradigm of human declarative memory whose reminder structure allows us to differentiate between a reactivated-labile memory state and a reactivated but non-labile state. Subjects memorized a list of five cue-syllables associated with their respective response-syllables. Seventy-two hours later, results showed that the retrieval of the paired-associate memory was impaired when tested 20 min after a mild stressor (cold pressor stress (CPS)) administration, coincident with cortisol levels increase. Then, we investigated the long-term effects of \\{CPS\\} administration prior to the reminder session. Under conditions where the reminder initiates the reconsolidation process, \\{CPS\\} impaired the long-term memory expression tested 24 h later. In contrast, \\{CPS\\} did not show effects when administered before a reminder session that does not trigger reconsolidation. Results showed that memory reactivation-labilization occurs even when retrieval was impaired. Memory reactivation under stress could hinder -via reconsolidation- the probability of the traces to be expressed in the long term.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, due to the exponential growth of user generated images and videos, there is an increasing interest in learning-based hashing methods. In computer vision, the hash functions are learned in such a way that the hash codes can preserve essential properties of the original space (or label information). Then the Hamming distance of the hash codes can approximate the data similarity. On the other hand, vector quantization methods quantize the data into different clusters based on the criteria of minimal quantization error, and then perform the search using look-up tables. While hashing methods using Hamming distance can achieve faster search speed, their accuracy is often outperformed by quantization methods with the same code length, due to the low quantization error and more flexible distance lookups. To improve the effectiveness of the hashing methods, in this work, we propose Quantization-based Hashing (QBH), a general framework which incorporates the advantages of quantization error reduction methods into conventional property preserving hashing methods. The learned hash codes simultaneously preserve the properties in the original space and reduce the quantization error, and thus can achieve better performance. Furthermore, the hash functions and a quantizer can be jointly learned and iteratively updated in a unified framework, which can be readily used to generate hash codes or quantize new data points. Importantly, \\{QBH\\} is a generic framework that can be integrated to different property preserving hashing methods and quantization strategies, and we apply \\{QBH\\} to both unsupervised and supervised hashing models as showcases in this paper. Experimental results on three large-scale unlabeled datasets (i.e., SIFT1M, GIST1M, and SIFT1B), three labeled datastes (i.e., ESPGAME, \\{IAPRTC\\} and MIRFLICKR) and one video dataset (UQ_VIDEO) demonstrate the superior performance of our \\{QBH\\} over existing unsupervised and supervised hashing methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Microblogging platforms have emerged as large collections of short documents. In fact, the provision of an effective way to retrieve short text presents a significant research challenge owing to several factors: creative language usage, high contextualization, the informal nature of micro blog posts and the limited length of this form of communication. Thus, micro blogging retrieval systems suffer from the problems of data sparseness and the semantic gap. This makes it inadequate to accurately meet users\u2019 information needs because users compose tweets using few terms and without query terms inside; thus, many relevant tweets will not be retrieved. To overcome the problems of data sparseness and the semantic gap, recent studies on content-based microblog searching have focused on adding semantics to micro posts by linking short text to knowledge bases resources. Moreover, previous studies use bag-of-concepts representation by linking named entities to their corresponding knowledge base concepts. However, bag-of-concepts representation considers only concepts that match named entities and supposes that all concepts are equivalent and independent. Thus, in this paper, we present a graph-of-concepts method that considers the relationships among concepts that match named entities in short text and their related concepts and contextualizes each concept in the graph by leveraging the linked nature of \\{DBpedia\\} as a Linked Open Data knowledge base and graph-based centrality theory. Furthermore, we propose a similarity measure that computes the similarity between two graphs (query-tweet) by considering the relationships between the contextualized concepts.

Hashing methods map each high-dimensional vector onto a low-dimensional hamming space by projection operators. However, when processing high dimensional data retrieval, many existing methods including hashing cost a majority of time on projection operators. In this paper, we solve this problem by implementing a sparsity regularizer. On one hand, due to the sparse property of the projection matrix, our method effectively lower both the storage and computation cost. On the other hand, we reduce the effective number of parameters involved in the learned projection matrix according to sparsity regularizer, which helps avoid overfitting problem. Without relaxing binary constraints, an iterative scheme jointly optimizing the objective function directly was given, which helps to obtain effective and efficient binary codes. We evaluate our method on three databases and compare it with some state-of-the-art hashing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the comparison approaches.",

Geophysical products such as soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth at nadir (\u03c4nad) are retrieved by an operational algorithm using \\{TB\\} observations at different angles of incidence and polarizations. However, the quality of the retrievals depends on several surface effects, such as vegetation, soil roughness and texture, etc. In the microwave forward emission model used in the retrievals (L-band Microwave Emission Model, L-MEB), soil roughness is modelled with a semi-empirical equation using four main parameters (Qr, Hr, Nrp, with p = H or V polarizations). At present, these parameters are calibrated with data provided by airborne studies and in situ measurements made at a local scale that is not necessarily representative of the large \\{SMOS\\} footprints (43 km on average) at global scale. In this study, we evaluate the impact of the calibrated values of Nrp and Hr on the \\{SM\\} and \u03c4nad retrievals based on \\{SMOS\\} \\{TB\\} measurements (SMOS Level 3 product) over the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) network located in North America over five years (2011\u20132015).

At satellite scale, the results show that combining vegetation and roughness effects in a single parameter provides the best results in terms of soil moisture retrievals, as evaluated against the in situ \\{SM\\} data. Even though our retrieval approach was very simplified, as we did not account for pixel heterogeneity, the accuracy we obtained in the \\{SM\\} retrievals was almost systematically better than those of the Level 3 product.

Results Although the overall frequency of cases exhibiting these behaviors was low, \\{UHR\\} individuals produced substantially more mismatch and retrieval gestures than controls. The \\{UHR\\} group also exhibited significantly poorer verbal production performance when compared with controls. In the patient group, mismatch gestures were associated with poorer visual processing speed and elevated negative symptoms, while retrieval gestures were associated with higher speed of visual information-processing and verbal production, but not symptoms.

The existing satellite measurements are of the total radiance, with very little knowledge or impact of the polarization state of the limb radiance. Recently proposed instrument concepts for stratospheric aerosol profiling have been designed to measure the linearly polarized radiance. Yet, to date, the impact of the polarized measurement on the retrievals has not been systematically studied. Here we use a fully spherical, multiple scattering radiative transfer model to perform a sensitivity study on the effects of the polarized measurement on stratospheric aerosol extinction retrievals through specific investigations of the aerosol signal fraction in polarized measurements, potential retrieval bias, and achievable precision. In this study,we simulate both total and linearly polarized measurements, for a wide range of limb viewing geometries that are encountered in typical low earth orbits and for various aerosol loading scenarios. The orientation of the linear polarization with respect to the horizon is also studied. Taking into account instrument signal to noise levels it is found that in general, the linear polarization can be used as effectively as the total radiance measurement, with consideration of instrument signal to noise capabilities; however the horizontal polarization is more promising in terms of signal magnitude.",

Several \\{PR\\} algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. Recent efforts of exploiting sparsity were developed to improve the performance of \\{PR\\} algorithms, such as the reconstruction quality, robustness to noise, and convergence behavior. In this paper, we propose a novel sparsity-based algorithm, which can adaptively learn an orthogonal sparsifying transform, and reconstruct the image simultaneously from the Fourier magnitudes. However, the estimated images at the early iterations are extremely bad. Training samples from these images cannot provide much useful information for sparsifying transform learning. To avoid unnecessary updating, an orthogonal sparsifying transform learning method based on transfer learning is proposed. Through transfer learning, we transfer the fixed sparsifying transform to an adaptive one. We apply this new sparsifying transform learning method to PR, and exploit the alternating directions method of multipliers (ADMM) technique to solve the formulated problem. Since the learnt sparsifying transform is adaptive to data, it favors better sparsity. Using this learnt sparsifying transform for image reconstruction can improve the reconstruction quality at low oversampling ratios.

The three-dimensional shape contains various useful information including visual information, geometric relationships, and other type properties. Thus the strategy of exploring these characteristics is the core of extracting effective 3D shape features. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D feature learning framework which combines different modality data effectively to promote the discriminability of uni-modal feature by using deep learning. The geometric information and visual information are extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Convolutional Deep Belief Networks (CDBNs), respectively, and then two independent Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) are employed to learn high-level features from geometric and visual features. Finally, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is trained for mining the deep correlations between different modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Previous studies have provided support for the idea that information activated during retrieval can act as a mediator that facilitates later recall of a target. Evidence for this has been obtained from a paradigm involving independent cues in which participants initially learn cue-target pairs through retrieval (Mother: _____) or restudying (Mother: Child), and later show stronger benefits of retrieval over restudy in recalling targets from final test cues that are strongly related to the original cue (Father: _____) compared to cues that are unrelated to the original cues (Birth: _____). The current study used a new paradigm to explore the role of mediators in learning from retrieval by comparing the advantage of retrieval over restudying for cue-target pairs that varied in mediator strength (i.e., the strength of the strongest first associate to the cue). Across three experiments, items higher in mediator strength (e.g., Chalk: Crayon, with Chalk producing its strongest first associate Board at a rate of .69) produced stronger testing effects than items lower in mediator strength (e.g., Soup: Onion, with Soup producing its strongest first associate Chicken at a rate of .10). Item analyses revealed that mediator strength was positively associated with final test recall of items learned through retrieval but not through restudying, and this relationship held after controlling for other linguistic properties of the cues.",

However, the mechanisms that serve the retrieval of remote memories, has not yet been fully understood. Some evidences suggest that the central cholinergic system appears be involved in the modulation of these processes. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of a pre-test administration of dicyclomine, a high-affinity \\{M1\\} muscarinic receptor antagonist, on the retrieval of remote memories in fear conditioning and \\{IA\\} tasks. Male Wistar rats were trained, and after 1 or 28 days, the rats received dicyclomine (16 or 32 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, i.p.) and were tested in CFC, tone fear conditioning (TFC) and \\{IA\\} tasks. At both time intervals, 32 mg/kg dicyclomine induced impairment of CFC. In \\{TFC\\} task only the performance of the rats 28 days after training was impaired. The \\{IA\\} task was not affected in any of the studied intervals. These findings suggest a differential contribution of muscarinic receptors on recent and remote memories retrieval revealing a more generalized role in remote memory.",

        "abstract": "Summary In semantic web-based system, the concept of ontology is used to search results by contextual meaning of input query instead of keyword matching. From the research literature, there seems to be a need for a tool which can provide an easy interface for complex queries in natural language that can retrieve the domain-specific information from the ontology. This research paper proposes an \\{IRSCSD\\} system (Information retrieval system for computer science domain) as a solution. This system offers advanced querying and browsing of structured data with search results automatically aggregated and rendered directly in a consistent user-interface, thus reducing the manual effort of users. So, the main objective of this research is design and development of semantic web-based system for integrating ontology towards domain-specific retrieval support. Methodology followed is a piecemeal research which involves the following stages. First Stage involves the designing of framework for semantic web-based system. Second stage builds the prototype for the framework using Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 tool. Third Stage deals with the natural language query conversion into \\{SPARQL\\} query language using Python-based \\{QUEPY\\} framework. Fourth Stage involves firing of converted \\{SPARQL\\} queries to the ontology through Apache's Jena \\{API\\} to fetch the results. Lastly, evaluation of the prototype has been done in order to ensure its efficiency and usability. Thus, this research paper throws light on framework development for semantic web-based system that assists in efficient retrieval of domain-specific information, natural language query interpretation into semantic web language, creation of domain-specific ontology and its mapping with related ontology. This research paper also provides approaches and metrics for ontology evaluation on prototype ontology developed to study the performance based on accessibility of required domain-related information.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent evidence suggests that directing attention toward single item-context associations during encoding improves young and older adults' context memory performance and reduces demands on executive functions during retrieval. In everyday situations, there are many event features competing for our attention, and our ability to successfully recover those details may depend on our ability to ignore others. Failures of selective attention may contribute to older adults' context memory impairments. In the current electroencephalogram (EEG) study, we assessed the effects of age on processes supporting successful context memory retrieval of selectively attended features as indexed by neural oscillations. During encoding, young and older adults were directed to attend to a picture of an object and its relationship to one of two concurrently presented contextual details: a color or scene. At retrieval, we tested their memory for the object, its attended and unattended context features, and their confidence for both the attended and unattended features. Both groups showed greater memory for attended than unattended contextual features. However, older adults showed evidence of hyper-binding between attended and unattended context features while the young adults did not. \\{EEG\\} results in the theta band suggest that young and older adults recollect similar amounts of information but brain-behavior correlations suggest that this information was supportive of contextual memory performance, particularly for young adults. By contrast, sustained beta desynchronization, indicative of sensory reactivation and episodic reconstruction, was correlated with contextual memory performance for older adults only. We conclude that older adults' inhibition deficits during encoding reduced the selectivity of their contextual memories, which led to reliance on executive functions like episodic reconstruction to support successful memory retrieval.",

Most of the state-of-the-art \\{CBMIR\\} systems suffer from various problems: computationally expensive due to the usage of high dimensional feature vectors and complex classifier/clustering schemes. Inability to properly handle the \u201csemantic gap\u201d and the high intra-class versus inter-class variability problem of the medical image database (like radiographic image database). This yields an exigent demand for developing highly effective and computationally efficient retrieval system. Methods We propose a novel interactive two-stage \\{CBMIR\\} system for diverse collection of medical radiographic images. Initially, Pulse Coupled Neural Network based shape features are used to find out the most probable (similar) image classes using a novel \u201csimilarity positional score\u201d mechanism. This is followed by retrieval using Non-subsampled Contourlet Transform based texture features considering only the images of the pre-identified classes. Maximal information compression index is used for unsupervised feature selection to achieve better results. To reduce the semantic gap problem, the proposed system uses a novel fuzzy index based relevance feedback mechanism by incorporating subjectivity of human perception in an analytic manner. Results Extensive experiments were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed \\{CBMIR\\} system on a subset of Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA)-2009 database consisting of 10,902 labeled radiographic images of 57 different modalities. We obtained overall average precision of around 98% after only 2\u20133 iterations of relevance feedback mechanism. We assessed the results by comparisons with some of the state-of-the-art \\{CBMIR\\} systems for radiographic images. Conclusions Unlike most of the existing \\{CBMIR\\} systems, in the proposed two-stage hierarchical framework, main importance is given on constructing efficient and compact feature vector representation, search-space reduction and handling the \u201csemantic gap\u201d problem effectively, without compromising the retrieval performance.

As a result, cloud server can extract features from an encrypted image directly and compare them with the features of the queried images, so that users can thus obtain the image.

The information is distributed within database tables in large textual attributes with a free structure. Information retrieval from these information is necessary for complementing cardiotocography signals with additional information that is to be implemented in a decision support system. The basic statistical overview (n-gram analysis) helped with the insight into data structure, however more sophisticated methods have to be used as human (and expert) processing of the whole data were out of consideration: over 620,000 text fields contained text reports in natural language with (many) typographical errors, duplicates, ambiguities, syntax errors and many (nonstandard) abbreviations. There was a strong need to efficiently determine the overall structure of the database and discover information that is important from the clinical point of view. We have used three different methods: k-means, self-organizing map and a self-organizing approach inspired by ant-colonies that performed clustering of the records. The records were visualized and revealed the most prominent information structure(s) that were consulted with medical experts and served for further mining from the database. The outcome of this task is a set of ordered or nominal attributes with a structural information that is available for rule discovery mining and automated processing for the research of asphyxia prediction during delivery.

Thirdly, the semantic field adjustment process is described. Finally, fuzzy matching is employed to measure the similarity between the users\u05f3 intention and media documents.

It is of considerable challenge to stride across the heterogeneous gap between modalities. Existing methods project different modalities into a common space by minimizing the distance within the heterogeneous pairs (intra-pair) of the new latent space. However, the relationship among these multi-modal pairs (inter-pair) are neglected, which are beneficial to eliminate the heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on canonical correlation analysis by considering the high-order relationship among pairs (HCCA) for cross-modal retrieval. Supervised with additional semantic labels and unsupervised without semantic labels are simultaneously considered by treating the intra- and inter-pair correlation discriminatively. Moreover, kernel tricks are also performed on \\{HCCA\\} to learn a non-linear projection, termed HKCCA.

This chapter reviews more recent work, in which it is demonstrated that selective memory retrieval has two faces and that it can both impair and improve recall of other items. In this recent work, participants' access to study context during selective retrieval was experimentally manipulated and it was examined whether such manipulation influences the effects of selective retrieval. Access to study context was manipulated using listwise directed forgetting, context-dependent forgetting\u00a0and time-dependent forgetting. The results consistently showed that selective retrieval impairs recall of other memories if access to study context during retrieval is largely maintained, but that selective retrieval can improve recall if study context access is impaired. The findings are explained by a two-factor account, which claims that, in general, selective retrieval does not only trigger inhibition and blocking but also triggers\u00a0context reactivation processes. The proposal is that primarily inhibition and blocking operate when study context access during selective retrieval is largely maintained, whereas primarily context reactivation processes operate when study context access is impaired.

During each level in the high authentication process, any 2 or more participants can be gathered to reconstruct the original meaningful certification images. While in the case of each level in the low authentication process, only one authenticator who possesses a correct pair of SIKs, will gain no significant information of certification image; however, it can result in a remarkable peak output in the nonlinear correlation coefficient of the recovered image and the standard certification image, which can successfully provide an additional authentication layer for the high-level authentication.

A straightforward methodology that can protect data privacy is to encrypt the data before outsourcing. Recently, many searchable encryption schemes have been proposed to allow users to execute keyword-based search over encrypted data. However, it is different for users to exactly find all the interested files from the huge amounts of data by relying solely on keyword-based search. In information retrieval domain, full-text retrieval is an efficient information retrieval technology that allows efficient searches over massive amount of web data. Unfortunately, when applied in the cloud paradigm, full-text retrieval over encrypted cloud data have not been well studied. The full-text retrieval service requires extracting all the words in the contents of documents. The huge scale of index words cannot be efficiently supported by the existing searchable encryption schemes. Moreover, to protect user\u2019s privacy, a privacy-preserved full-text retrieval index is required. These problems make efficient full-text retrieval over a large amount of encrypted cloud data a very challenging task. In this paper, we first establish a set of strict privacy requirements for full-text retrieval in cloud storage systems. To address the challenging problem, we design a Bloom filter based tree index. Our scheme fine-tunes the similarity between the query and encrypted documents by proposing the membership entropies of index words. Our scheme is provably secure through our security analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed scheme through extensive experimental evaluation. The experimental results manifest the search operation can be done in 60 milliseconds using an off-the-shelf moderate PC.",

This paper proposes a framework named SoRTESum to take the advantages of social information such as document content reflection to extract summary sentences and social messages. In order to do that, the summarization was formulated in two steps: scoring and ranking. In the scoring step, the score of a sentence or social message is computed by using intra-relation and inter-relation which integrate the support of local and social information in a mutual reinforcement form. To calculate these relations, 16 features are proposed. After scoring, the summarization is generated by selecting top m ranked sentences and social messages. SoRTESum was extensively evaluated on two datasets. Promising results show that: (i) SoRTESum obtains significant improvements of ROUGE-scores over state-of-the-art baselines and competitive results with the learning to rank approach trained by RankBoost and (ii) combining intra-relation and inter-relation benefits single-document summarization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Reliable quantification of low-abundance proteins in complex proteomes is challenging largely owing to the limited number of spectra/peptides identified. In this study we developed a straightforward method to improve the quantitative accuracy and precision of proteins by strategically retrieving the less confident peptides that were previously filtered out using the standard target-decoy search strategy. The filtered-out MS/MS spectra matched to confidently-identified proteins were recovered, and the peptide-spectrum-match \\{FDR\\} were re-calculated and controlled at a confident level of \\{FDR\\} \u2264 1%, while protein \\{FDR\\} maintained at ~ 1%. We evaluated the performance of this strategy in both spectral count- and ion current-based methods. &gt; 60% increase of total quantified spectra/peptides was respectively achieved for analyzing a spike-in sample set and a public dataset from CPTAC. Incorporating the peptide retrieval strategy significantly improved the quantitative accuracy and precision, especially for low-abundance proteins (e.g. one-hit proteins). Moreover, the capacity of confidently discovering significantly-altered proteins was also enhanced substantially, as demonstrated with two spike-in datasets. In summary, improved quantitative performance was achieved by this peptide recovery strategy without compromising confidence of protein identification, which can be readily implemented in a broad range of quantitative proteomics techniques including label-free or labeling approaches. Significance We hypothesize that more quantifiable spectra and peptides in a protein, even including less confident peptides, could help reduce variations and improve protein quantification. Hence the peptide retrieval strategy was developed and evaluated in two spike-in sample sets with different LC-MS/MS variations using both MS1- and MS2-based quantitative approach. The list of confidently identified proteins using the standard target-decoy search strategy was fixed and more spectra/peptides with less confidence matched to confident proteins were retrieved. However, the total peptide-spectrum-match false discovery rate (PSM FDR) after retrieval analysis was still controlled at a confident level of \\{FDR\\} \u2264 1%. As expected, the penalty for occasionally incorporating incorrect peptide identifications is negligible by comparison with the improvements in quantitative performance. More quantifiable peptides, lower missing value rate, better quantitative accuracy and precision were significantly achieved for the same protein identifications by this simple strategy. This strategy is theoretically applicable for any quantitative approaches in proteomics and thereby provides more quantitative information, especially on low-abundance proteins.",

The evolution of tensor-resolved residual stress motifs in the three-dimensional space was examined, and key features, including exceptionally high shear stresses in one case, were uncovered. The effect of such a body of concurrent complications and malfunctioning are neither easily reproducible by in vitro simulations nor obviously obtainable through merely computational approaches.

        "abstract": "AbstractPurpose The association of retrievable inferior vena cava filters (IVCFs) with adverse events has led to increased interest in prompt retrieval, particularly in younger patients given the progressive nature of these complications over time. This study takes a design-of-experiments (DOE) approach to investigate methods to best improve filter retrieval rates, with a particular focus on younger (&lt;60 years) patients. Methods A \\{DOE\\} approach was executed in which combinations of variables were tested to best improve retrieval rates. The impact of a virtual \\{IVCF\\} clinic, primary care physician (PCP) letters, and discharge instructions was investigated. The decision for filter retrieval in group 1 was determined solely by the referring physician. Group 2 included those patients prospectively followed in an \\{IVCF\\} virtual clinic in which filter retrieval was coordinated by the interventional radiologist when clinically appropriate. In group 3, in addition to being followed through the \\{IVCF\\} clinic, each patient\u2019s \\{PCP\\} was faxed a follow-up letter, and information regarding \\{IVCF\\} retrieval was added to the patient\u2019s discharge instructions. Results A total of 10 \\{IVCFs\\} (8.4%) were retrieved among 119 retrievable \\{IVCFs\\} placed in group 1. Implementation of the \\{IVCF\\} clinic in group 2 significantly improved the retrieval rate to 25.3% (23 of 91 retrievable \\{IVCFs\\} placed, P &lt; .05). The addition of discharge instructions and \\{PCP\\} letters to the virtual clinic (group 3) resulted in a retrieval rate of 33.3% (17 of 51). The retrieval rates demonstrated more pronounced improvement when examining only younger patients, with retrieval rates of 11.3% (7 of 62), 29.5% (13 of 44, P &lt; .05), and 45.2% (14 of 31) for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Conclusions \\{DOE\\} methodology is not routinely executed in health care, but it is an effective approach to evaluating clinical practice behavior and patient quality measures. In this study, implementation of the combination of a virtual clinic, \\{PCP\\} letters, and discharge instructions improved retrieval rates compared with a virtual clinic alone. Quality improvement strategies such as these that augment patient and referring physician knowledge on interventional radiologic procedures may ultimately improve patient safety and personalized care.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Temporal context, memory for the timing of events, can be assessed using non-temporal strategies such as relative familiarity or inference from a semantic narrative. Neuroimaging studies, which have previously encouraged such strategies, find similar patterns of brain regions involved in both temporal and non-temporal context memory. The present study aims to investigate whether previous findings are driven by the use of non-temporal strategies or whether the same pattern of brain regions is identified when relative familiarity and semantic narrative strategies are discouraged. We used abstract phrases (e.g. alone me leave) created by scrambling familiar three-word phrases. The words in the phrases were less concrete than the object image stimuli used in previous studies of temporal context memory (Jenkins and Ranganath, 2010) and were presented quickly while participants read each word aloud. This differed from previous studies in which participants were encouraged to use narrative strategies during encoding (Tubridy and Davachi, 2011) and was designed to discourage use of narrative strategies. The relative familiarity of the words within each phrase was similar and likely not diagnostic of word order during encoding, in order to minimize the use of relative familiarity strategies. Neuroimaging results indicate that temporal context retrieval was associated with the hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and retrosplenial cortex, which are regions consistent with the retrieval of non-temporal context in episodic memory, suggesting that previous findings were not driven entirely by non-temporal strategies but rather that temporal memory relies on similar brain regions to non-temporal memory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It has long been argued that personal memories are usually generated in an effortful search process in word-cueing studies. However, recent research (Uzer, Lee, &amp; Brown, 2012) shows that direct retrieval of autobiographical memories, in response to word cues, is common. This invites the question of whether direct retrieval phenomenon is generalizable beyond the standard laboratory paradigm. Here we investigated prevalence of direct retrieval of autobiographical memories cued by specific and individuated cues versus generic cues. In Experiment 1, participants retrieved memories in response to cues from their own life (e.g., the names of friends) and generic words (e.g., chair). In Experiment 2, participants provided their personal cues two or three months prior to coming to the lab (min: 75 days; max: 100 days). In each experiment, \\{RT\\} was measured and participants reported whether memories were directly retrieved or generated on each trial. Results showed that personal cues elicited a high rate of direct retrieval. Personal cues were more likely to elicit direct retrieval than generic word cues, and as a consequence, participants responded faster, on average, to the former than to the latter. These results challenge the constructive view of autobiographical memory and suggest that autobiographical memories consist of pre-stored event representations, which are largely governed by associative mechanisms. These demonstrations offer theoretically interesting questions such as why are we not overwhelmed with directly retrieved memories cued by everyday familiar surroundings?",

Under such circumstance, much research attention has been spent on 3D model retrieval in recent decades. Although extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this task, it is a difficult task to explore the correlation among 3D models, which is the key issue in 3D model retrieval. In this paper, we design and implement a constructive-learning for cross-model correlation algorithm for 3D model retrieval. In this method, we first extract view features from multi-views of 3D models. To exploit the cross-model correlation, we formulate the correlation of 3D models in a hypergraph structure, where both the vertex correlation and the edge correlation are simultaneously learned in a constructive-learning process. Then, the correlation of each model to the query can be used for retrieval. To justify the performance of our proposed algorithm, we have implemented the method and tested on two datasets. We have compared it with recent state-of-the-art methods, and the results have shown superior performance of our proposed method.",

However, the complexity and the degree of specialization of the language used by the experts in this context, make this task both challenging and complex. In this work, we introduce a novel experimental study to evaluate the performance of the two semantic similarity metrics (Path and Intrinsic IC-Path, both widely accepted in the literature) in a real-life information retrieval situation.

The problem is formulated as R simultaneous sparse approximations of multiple 1-D signals. To get a method able to handle large size signals while maintaining a sufficient resolution, a multigrid dictionary refinement technique is associated to the simultaneous sparse approximation. The refinement procedure is proved to converge in the single R-D mode case. Then, for the general multiple modes case, the signal tensor model is decomposed in order to handle each mode separately in an iterative scheme. The proposed method does not require an association step since the estimated modes are automatically \u201cpaired\u201d.

Our schemes remain unforgeable against an adversary leaking arbitrary (yet bounded) information on the entire state of the signer (sometimes known as fully leakage resilience), including the random coin tosses of the signing algorithm. The main feature of our constructions is that they offer a graceful degradation of security in situations where standard existential unforgeability is impossible. This property was recently put forward by Nielsen, Venturi, and Zottarel (PKC 2014) [19] to deal with settings in which the secret key is much larger than the size of a signature. One remarkable such case is the so-called Bounded-Retrieval Model (BRM), where one intentionally inflates the size of the secret key while keeping constant the signature size and the computational complexity of the scheme. Our main constructions have leakage rate 1 \u2212 o ( 1 ) , and are proven secure in the standard model. We additionally give a construction in the BRM, relying on a random oracle. All of our schemes are described in terms of generic building blocks, but also admit efficient instantiations under fairly standard number-theoretic assumptions. Finally, we explain how to extend some of our schemes to the setting of noisy leakage, where the only restriction on the leakage functions is that the output does not decrease the min-entropy of the secret key by too much.",

First, in contrast to the classical 1-D phase problem which in general has multiple solutions, we prove that with sufficient over-sampling, the sign problem admits a unique solution. Next, we show that the sign problem can be viewed as a special case of a more general piecewise constant phase problem. Relying on this result, we derive a computationally efficient and robust to noise sign recovery algorithm. In the noise-free case and with a sufficiently high sampling rate, our algorithm is guaranteed to recover the true sign pattern.

Clients arriving at the network are interested in retrieving measurements from an arbitrary set of sensors of some fixed size s. We show that the sensors broadcast measurements according to a phase-type distribution. We determine the probability distribution of the time needed for a client to retrieve s sensor measurements. We provide a closed-form expression for the retrieval time of s sensor measurements for an asymptotically large capacity of the sensor battery or the rate at which energy is harvested. We also analyze numerically the retrieval time of s sensor measurements under various assumptions regarding the battery capacity of the sensors, the energy harvesting and consumption processes. The results provide a lower bound for the energy storage capacity of the sensors for which the retrieval time of measurements is below a targeted level. It is also shown that the ratio between the energy harvesting rate and the broadcasting rate significantly influences the retrieval time of measurements, whereas deploying sensors with large batteries does not significantly reduce the retrieval time of measurements. Numerical experiments also indicate that our theoretical results generalize to non-identical energy harvesting rates, various amount of energy consumed upon a broadcast and non-exponential distributions of the energy harvesting and broadcasting processes.",

In this paper, we propose an integrated users-feedback and learning algorithm by screening individual elements of content features and driving a group of swarmed particles inside the feature space to provide a possible solution. In comparison with the existing approaches, the proposed algorithm achieves a number of advantages, which can be highlighted as: (i) interpretation of users\u2019 feedback is independent of both the content features and relevance feedback schemes, and hence the proposed algorithm can be applicable to any content features and relevance feedback methods; (ii) the \\{RF\\} interpretation is followed by a group of swarmed particles, acting as multiple agents rather than a single query image in searching for the desirable images; (iii) the proposed \\{RF\\} interpretation and learning is exploited not only in reweighting the content similarity measurement, but also in regrouping the database images.

Researchers have found that utilizing the topic information generated through topic modeling together with traditional TF-IDF information generates superior results in document retrieval. However, in order to apply this idea to real-life \\{IR\\} systems, some critical problems need to be solved: how to store the topic information and how to utilize it with the TF-IDF information for efficient document retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Topic Enhanced Inverted Index (TEII) to incorporate the topic information into the inverted index for efficient top-k document retrieval. Specifically, we explore two different types of TEIIs. We first propose the incremental TEII, which includes the topic information into the traditional inverted index by adding topic-based inverted lists. The incremental \\{TEII\\} is beneficial for legacy \\{IR\\} systems, since it does not change the existing TF-IDF-based inverted lists. As a more flexible alternative, we propose the hybrid \\{TEII\\} to incorporate the topic information into each posting of the inverted index. In the hybrid TEII, two relaxation methods are proposed to support dynamic estimation of the upper bound impact of each posting. The hybrid \\{TEII\\} is highly extensible for incorporating different ranking factors and we show an extension of the hybrid \\{TEII\\} by considering the static quality of the documents in the corpus. Based on the incremental and hybrid TEIIs, we develop several query processing algorithms to support efficient top-k document retrieval on TEIIs. Empirical evaluation on the \\{TREC\\} dataset verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed index structures and query processing algorithms.",

We argue that offline annotation and online retrieval models should be regarded as a unified long-term learner to reinforce each other. Based on this viewpoint, this paper presents an annotation-retrieval reinforcement framework, in which a dual-structured learning model is presented: the keyword-image association is learned by semantic manifold modeling while the semantic correlation between keywords is learned by Image-Word Net modeling. In keyword-image association modeling level, to effectively model keyword-image manifold, we present a manifold co-training algorithm to address the sample insufficiency problem. In manifold-based image annotation, we view annotation process as semantic feature reduction in keyword space, based on which a Biased Fisher Discriminant Analysis (BFDA) algorithm is presented for Eigen feature (keyword) selection. In semantic correlation modeling level, a novel Image-Word Net is learned from annotation training set and users' retrieval log for (1) irrelevant annotated keyword pruning; (2) semantic-level retrieval enhancement. In retrieval, our framework can effectively reveal user target by improving traditional content-based relevance feedback to linguistic-level interaction using annotation information, based on which \\{BFDA\\} is adopted for keyword selection. Finally, user interaction logs are adopted for manifold model updating and annotation refinement.

Second, the conditional probability distribution of the random user preference, given this reduced feature vector, is modeled using a proportional odds model. A new model is fitted at each iteration. The score used to rank the image database is based on the estimated probability function of the random preference. Additionally, some memory is incorporated in the procedure by weighting the current and previous scores. Also, a novel evaluation procedure is proposed in this work based on the empirical commutative distribution functions of the relevant and non-relevant retrieved images.

A typical strategy of existing retrieval algorithms is to rank the images according to the image-to-image similarities, e.g., the similarities between the query image and the images in the database. This strategy ignores the inherent information of the class that the query image belongs to (we call it query class). To address this issue, rather than using image-to-image similarity, we propose a simple yet effective retrieval method based on exploring the image-to-class similarity. The method uses an iterative framework, where the size of the query class is progressively enlarged according to the previous retrieval results, and the ranked list is generated according to the similarities between the images in the database and the query class. This framework enables us to explore the inherent information of the query class, and hence helps to improve the retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our method is able to effectively improve the image and shape retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A significant effort by researchers has advanced the ability of computers to understand, index and annotate images. This entails automatic domain specific knowledge-base (KB) construction and metadata extraction from visual information and any associated textual information. However, it is challenging to fuse visual and textual information and build a complete domain-specific \\{KB\\} for image annotation due to several factors such as: the ambiguity of natural language to describe image features; the semantic gap when using image features to represent visual content and the incompleteness of the metadata in the KB. Typically the \\{KB\\} is based upon a domain specific Ontology. However, it is not an easy task to extract the data needed from annotations and images, and then to automatically process these and transform them into an integrated Ontology model, because of the ambiguity of terms and because of image processing algorithm errors. As such, it is difficult to construct a complete \\{KB\\} covering a specific domain of knowledge. This paper presents a Multi-Modal Incompleteness Ontology-based (MMIO) system for image retrieval based upon fusing two derived indices. The first index exploits low-level features extracted from images. A novel technique is proposed to represent the semantics of visual content, by restructuring visual word vectors into an Ontology model by computing the distance between the visual word features and concept features, the so called concept range. The second index relies on a textual description which is processed to extract and recognise the concepts, properties, or instances that are defined in an Ontology. The two indexes are fused into a single indexing model, which is used to enhance the image retrieval efficiency. Nonetheless, this rich index may not be sufficient to find the desired images. Therefore, a Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) algorithm is exploited to search for similar words to those used in a query. As a result, it is possible to retrieve images with a query using (similar) words that do not appear in the caption. The efficiency of the \\{KB\\} is validated experimentally with respect to three criteria, correctness, multimodality, and robustness. The results show that the multi-modal metadata in the proposed \\{KB\\} could be utilised efficiently. An additional experiment demonstrates that \\{LSI\\} can handle an incomplete \\{KB\\} effectively. Using LSI, the system can still retrieve relevant images when information in the Ontology is missing, leading to an enhanced retrieval performance.",

A central issue associated with this task is how to effectively and efficiently describe the leaf images and measure their similarities. In this paper, a novel shape descriptor termed R-angle is proposed. R-angle describes the curvature of the contour by measuring the angle between the intersections of the shape contour with a circle of radius R centered at points sampled around the contour. It is intrinsically invariant to group transforms including scaling, rotation and translation. Varying the parameter R of the proposed R-angle naturally introduces the notation of scale, which we leverage to provide a coarse-to-fine description of the local curvature. A local scale arrangement is proposed by taking the distance between each contour point and the center of the shape to be the maximum scale for a given contour point. Two matching schemes, including L1-norm matching and dynamic programming based matching, are applied to measure the similarities of the leaf shapes. The retrieval experiments conducted on two challenging leaf image datasets indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for leaf identification. An additional experiment on an animal dataset also indicates its potential for general shape recognition.",

In this work, we propose a new acquisition and processing scheme. Contrary to existing retrieval methods for EI, which require as input two images acquired in different setup configurations, the proposed approach can retrieve an approximate map of the X-ray phase from a single image, thus significantly simplifying the acquisition procedure and reducing data collection times. Methods The retrieval method is analytically derived, based on the assumption of a quasi-homogeneous object, i.e. an object featuring a constant ratio between refractive index and absorption coefficient. The noise properties of the input and retrieved images are also theoretically analyzed under the developed formalism. The method is applied to experimental synchrotron images of a biological object. Results The experimental results show that the method can provide high-quality images, where the \u201cedge\u201d signal typical of \\{XPCI\\} images is transformed to an \u201carea\u201d contrast that enables an easier interpretation of the sample geometry.

Results No differences were found in damage scores on the articular and backside surfaces, except for abrasion in the posterior articular regions, or in 3D deviations between patients who reached a high degree of flexion and patients who did not.

Administrative documents commonly contain some salient entities such as logos, stamps or seals as the means of their authentication and proprietorship. These salient entities provide quite discriminative information, which can effectively be used for different tasks of document image retrieval, classification and recognition in document-based applications. Thus, proper detection/recognition of these entities in document images increases the performance of such applications in terms of document retrieval, classification, and recognition. To present the state-of-the-art research on the retrieval of administrative document images, this paper deals with a survey of administrative document image retrieval in relation to seals and logos. All the available datasets, feature extraction and classification techniques for logo and seal detection/recognition are discussed systematically. The shortcomings of the present technologies on logo and seal based document processing are also highlighted. Avenues of the future works are further given for the benefit of readers.

Here, we recorded \\{BLA\\} neurons during the retrieval of associative memories and used optogenetic-mediated phototagging to identify populations of neurons that synapse in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the central amygdala (CeA), or ventral hippocampus (vHPC). We found that despite heterogeneous neural responses within each population, the proportions of BLA-NAc neurons excited by reward predictive cues and of BLA-CeA neurons excited by aversion predictive cues were higher than within the entire BLA. Although the BLA-vHPC projection is known to drive behaviors of innate negative valence, these neurons did not preferentially code for learned negative valence. Together, these findings suggest that valence encoding in the \\{BLA\\} is at least partially mediated via divergent activity of anatomically defined neural populations.",

Most existing cross-view hashing methods can only handle fully-paired scenarios, where all samples from different views are paired. However, such full pairwise correspondences may not be available in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing method, named semi-paired hashing (SPH), to deal with a more challenging cross-view retrieval task, where only partial pairwise correspondences are provided in advance. Specifically, \\{SPH\\} aims to preserve within-view similarity and cross-view correlation among multi-view data. Similarity structure within each view is obtained via anchor graph. As limited samples are paired, correlation between unpaired samples is exploited via a simple yet effective approach, which estimates cross-view correlation by partial cross-view pairwise information and within-view similarity structure. Besides, we further incorporate two regression terms between original features and target binary codes to reduce the quantization loss. An efficient iterative algorithm is presented to simultaneously solve hash functions and binary codes. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of \\{SPH\\} over the state-of-the-art methods, especially in the semi-paired scenarios.",

Traditional retrieval algorithms are known to fail over highly turbid Case 2 waters because they were developed specifically for the open ocean (Case 1 waters). Landsat 8 provides an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a new spectral coastal aerosol band in the blue. This additional information provides means to tackle this retrieval endeavor. A look-up-table (LUT) and spectrum-matching methodology was implemented to simultaneously retrieve CPAs, taking advantage of Landsat 8's new features. A \\{LUT\\} of spectral remote-sensing reflectances (Rrs) with different concentrations of \\{CPAs\\} was produced using the in-water radiative transfer model HydroLight. A model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) algorithm was developed to atmospherically correct the Landsat 8 imagery and allow direct comparison with the \\{LUT\\} of Rrs. This MoB-ELM atmospheric correction algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) from the image, ground-truth data and the HydroLight model. The retrieval algorithm was applied over three Landsat 8 scenes and shows a normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) of about 14% for chlorophyll-a, 11% for total suspended solids (TSS), and 7% for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) when compared with ground-truth data. The \\{CPA\\} concentration maps exhibit expected trends of low concentrations in clear water and higher concentrations in turbid water. These results demonstrate that the developed algorithm allows the simultaneous mapping of concentration of all \\{CPAs\\} in Case 2 waters and over areas where the traditional algorithms fail or are not available due to spatial resolution. Therefore, this study shows that the Landsat 8 satellite can be utilized over Case 2 waters as long as a careful atmospheric correction is applied.",

In the first stage, we propose a margin-based objective to find approximate hash codes such that a pair of hash codes associating to a pair of similar (dissimilar) images has sufficiently small (large) Hamming distance. This objective results in a challenging optimization problem. We develop a coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently solve this optimization problem.

        "abstract": "Abstract Nowadays the amount of multimedia data such as images and text is growing exponentially on social websites, arousing the demand of effective and efficient cross-modal retrieval. The cross-modal hashing based methods have attracted considerable attention recently as they can learn efficient binary codes for heterogeneous data, which enables large-scale similarity search. Generally, to effectively construct the cross-correlation between different modalities, these methods try to find a joint abstraction space where the heterogeneous data can be projected. Then a quantization rule is applied to convert the abstraction representation to binary codes. However, these methods may not effectively bridge the semantic gap through the latent abstraction space because they fail to capture latent information between heterogeneous data. In addition, most of these methods apply the simplest quantization scheme (i.e. sign function) which may cause information loss of the abstraction representation and result in inferior binary codes. To address these challenges, in this paper, we present a novel cross-modal hashing based method that generates unified binary codes combining different modalities. Specifically, we first extract semantic features from the modalities of images and text to capture latent information. Then these semantic features are projected to a joint abstraction space. Finally, the abstraction space is rotated to produce better unified binary codes with much less quantization loss, while preserving the locality structure of projected data. We integrate the binary code learning procedures above to develop an iterative algorithm for optimal solutions. Moreover, we further exploit the useful class label information to reduce the semantic gap between different modalities to benefit the binary code learning. Extensive experiments on four multimedia datasets show that the proposed binary coding schemes outperform several other state-of-the-art methods under cross-modal scenarios.",

Then, mid-level features are obtained by embedding local descriptors into the visual vocabulary space using the soft-assignment coding step of the bag-of-features model. A global descriptor is subsequently constructed by aggregating mid-level features weighted by a geodesic exponential kernel, resulting in a matrix representation that describes the frequency of appearance of nearby codewords in the vocabulary.

Effectiveness analysis performed in three widely used shape datasets demonstrate that the proposed graph-based ranked-list model yields significant gains (up to +55.52%) when compared with the use of shape descriptors in isolation. Furthermore, the proposed method also yields comparable or superior effectiveness scores when compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Age-related deficits in context memory may arise from neural changes underlying both encoding and retrieval of context information. Although age-related functional changes in the brain regions supporting context memory begin at midlife, little is known about the functional changes with age that support context memory encoding and retrieval across the adult lifespan. We investigated how age-related functional changes support context memory across the adult lifespan by assessing linear changes with age during successful context encoding and retrieval. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we compared young, middle-aged and older adults during both encoding and retrieval of spatial and temporal details of faces. Multivariate behavioral partial least squares (B-PLS) analysis of fMRI data identified a pattern of whole-brain activity that correlated with a linear age term and a pattern of whole-brain activity that was associated with an age-by-memory phase (encoding vs. retrieval) interaction. Further investigation of this latter effect identified three main findings: 1) reduced phase-related modulation in bilateral fusiform gyrus, left superior/anterior frontal gyrus and right inferior frontal gyrus that started at midlife and continued to older age, 2) reduced phase-related modulation in bilateral inferior parietal lobule that occurred only in older age, and 3) changes in phase-related modulation in older but not younger adults in left middle frontal gyrus and bilateral parahippocampal gyrus that was indicative of age-related over-recruitment. We conclude that age-related reductions in context memory arise in midlife and are related to changes in perceptual recollection and changes in fronto-parietal retrieval monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Abstract We propose two novel region-based descriptors for shape-based image retrieval and analysis, which are built upon an extended tensor scale based on the Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). First the tensor scale algorithm is applied to extract local structure thickness, orientation, and anisotropy as represented by the largest ellipse within a homogeneous region centered at each image pixel. In this work, we extend the local orientation to 360\u00b0. Then, for the first proposed descriptor, named Tensor Scale Sector descriptor (TSS), the local distributions of relative orientations within circular sectors are used to compose a fixed-length feature vector for a region-based representation. For the second method, named Tensor Scale Band descriptor (TSB), we consider histograms of relative orientations for each circular concentric band to compose a fixed-length feature vector with linear time matching. Experimental results with MPEG-7 and \\{MNIST\\} datasets are presented to illustrate and validate the methods. \\{TSS\\} can achieve high retrieval values comparable to state-of-the-art methods, which usually rely on time-consuming correspondence optimization algorithms, but uses a simpler and faster distance function, while the even faster linear complexity of \\{TSB\\} leads to a suitable and better solution for very large shape collections.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A wealth of research has shown that retrieval practice plays a significant role in improving memory retention. The current study focused on one simple yet rarely examined question: would repeated retrieval using two different retrieval routes or using the same retrieval route twice lead to greater long-term memory retention? Participants elaborately learned 22 Japanese-Chinese translation word pairs using two different mediators. Half an hour after the initial study phase, the participants completed two retrieval sessions using either one mediator (Tm1Tm1) or two different mediators (Tm1Tm2). On the final test, which was performed 1 week after the retrieval practice phase, the participants received only the cue with a request to report the mediator (M1 or M2) followed by the target (Experiment 1) or only the mediator (M1 or M2) with a request to report the target (Experiment 2). The results of Experiment 1 indicated that the participants who practiced under the Tm1Tm2 condition exhibited greater target retention than those who practiced under the Tm1Tm1 condition. This difference in performance was due to the significant disadvantage in mediator retrieval and decoding of the unpracticed mediator under the Tm1Tm1 condition. Although mediators were provided to participants on the final test in Experiment 2, decoding of the unpracticed mediators remained less effective than decoding of the practiced mediators. We conclude that practicing multiple retrieval routes leads to greater memory retention than focusing on a single retrieval route. Thus, increasing retrieval variability during repeated retrieval practice indeed significantly improves long-term retention in a delay test.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we present a new visual search system for finding similar images in a large database. However, there are a number of challenges regarding the robustness of the image representations and the efficiency of the retrieval framework. To tackle these challenges, we first propose an encoding technique based on soft-assignment of local features to convert an entire image into a single vector, which is a compact and discriminative representation. This encoded vector is suitable for most types of efficient indexing methods to produce an initial result. To compensate for the lack of incorporating geometric and object-related information during the encoding scheme, we then propose a probabilistic topic model to formalize the spatial structure among the local features. Moreover, the topic model allows us to effectively extract the object and background regions from the image. This is performed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for approximate inference. Finally, benefiting from the extracted objects in each image, we present a re-ranking scheme to automatically refine the initial search results. Our proposed retrieval framework has two major advantages: i) an aggregation strategy through soft-assignment improves the discriminative power of the representation, which has a determinative effect on the retrieval precision; and ii) the probabilistic latent topic model enables us to not only gain insight into the spatial structure of the image, but also handle a large variation in the object appearance. The experimental results from four benchmark datasets show that our approach provides competitive accuracy, and runs about ten times faster. Our studies also verify that proposed approach works effectively on large-scale databases of millions of images.",

This paper presents an unsupervised manifold learning algorithm that takes into account the intrinsic dataset geometry for defining a more effective distance among images. The dataset structure is modeled in terms of a Correlation Graph (CG) and analyzed using Strongly Connected Components (SCCs). While the Correlation Graph adjacency provides a precise but strict similarity relationship, the Strongly Connected Components analysis expands these relationships considering the dataset geometry. A large and rigorous experimental evaluation protocol was conducted for different image retrieval tasks. The experiments were conducted in different datasets involving various image descriptors. Results demonstrate that the manifold learning algorithm can significantly improve the effectiveness of image retrieval systems.

In particular, food intake monitoring is becoming more and more important because of the key role that it plays in health and market economies. In this paper, we address the study of food image processing from the perspective of Computer Vision. As first contribution we present a survey of the studies in the context of food image processing from the early attempts to the current state-of-the-art methods. Since retrieval and classification engines able to work on food images are required to build automatic systems for diet monitoring (e.g., to be embedded in wearable cameras), we focus our attention on the aspect of the representation of the food images because it plays a fundamental role in the understanding engines. The food retrieval and classification is a challenging task since the food presents high variableness and an intrinsic deformability. To properly study the peculiarities of different image representations we propose the UNICT-FD1200 dataset. It was composed of 4754 food images of 1200 distinct dishes acquired during real meals. Each food plate is acquired multiple times and the overall dataset presents both geometric and photometric variabilities. The images of the dataset have been manually labeled considering 8 categories: Appetizer, Main Course, Second Course, Single Course, Side Dish, Dessert, Breakfast, Fruit. We have performed tests employing different representations of the state-of-the-art to assess the related performances on the UNICT-FD1200 dataset.

This cue-to-target conversion started in layer 5 and was followed by layer 6. Finally, a subset of layer 6 neurons exclusively encoding the sought target became phase-locked to surrounding field potentials at theta frequency, suggesting that this coordinated cell assembly implements cortical long-distance outputs of the recalled target.

        "abstract": "Abstract There has been an unrestrained growth of videos on the Internet due to proliferation of multimedia devices. These videos are mostly stored in unstructured repositories which pose enormous challenges for the task of both image and video retrieval. Users aim to retrieve videos of interest having content which is relevant to their need. Traditionally, low-level visual features have been used for content based video retrieval (CBVR). Consequently, a gap existed between these low-level features and the high level semantic content. The semantic differential was partially bridged by proliferation of research on interest point detectors and descriptors, which represented mid-level features of the content. The computational time and human interaction involved in the classical approaches for \\{CBVR\\} are quite cumbersome. In order to increase the accuracy, efficiency and effectiveness of the retrieval process, researchers resorted to soft computing paradigms. The entire retrieval task was automated to a great extent using individual soft computing components. Due to voluminous growth in the size of multimedia databases, augmented by an exponential rise in the number of users, integration of two or more soft computing techniques was desirable for enhanced efficiency and accuracy of the retrieval process. The hybrid approaches serve to enhance the overall performance and robustness of the system with reduced human interference. This article is targeted to focus on the relevant hybrid soft computing techniques which are in practice for content-based image and video retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Abstract All the techniques that measure displacements, whether in the range of visible optics or any other form of field methods, require the presence of a carrier signal. A carrier signal is a wave form modulated (modified) by an input, deformation of the medium. A carrier is tagged to the medium under analysis and deforms with the medium. The wave form must be known both in the unmodulated and the modulated conditions. There are two basic mathematical models that can be utilized to decode the information contained in the carrier, phase modulation or frequency modulation, both are closely connected. Basic problems connected to the detection and recovery of displacement information that are common to all optical techniques will be analyzed in this paper, focusing on the general theory common to all the methods independently of the type of signal utilized.

The network retrieval proved to be robust to varying the pattern activity, the threshold strategy, the topological arrangement of the connections, and for several types of noisy configuration. We found that the lower the fingerprint patterns activity is, the higher the load ratio and retrieval quality are. A simplified theoretical framework, for the unbiased case, is developed as a function of five parameters: the load ratio, the finiteness connectivity, the density degree of the network, randomness ratio, and the spatial pattern correlation. Linked to the latter appears a new neural dynamics variable: the spatial neural correlation. The theory agrees quite well with the experimental results.",

Deep learning has shown to be very effective in variety of visual applications, such as image classification and object detection. However, it has not been successfully applied to 3D shape recognition. This is because 3D shape has complex structure in 3D space and there are limited number of 3D shapes for feature learning. To address these problems, we project 3D shapes into 2D space and use autoencoder for feature learning on the 2D images. High accuracy 3D shape retrieval performance is obtained by aggregating the features learned on 2D images. In addition, we show the proposed deep learning feature is complementary to conventional local image descriptors. By combing the global deep learning representation and the local descriptor representation, our method can obtain the state-of-the-art performance on 3D shape retrieval benchmarks.",

Participants underwent fMRI scanning during an associative recognition test that followed a study task performed on visually presented word pairs. Test items comprised pairs of intact (studied pairs), rearranged (items studied on different trials) and new words. fMRI recollection effects were operationalized as greater activity for studied pairs correctly endorsed as intact than for pairs incorrectly endorsed as rearranged. The reverse contrast was employed to identify retrieval monitoring effects. Robust recollection effects were identified in the core recollection network, comprising the hippocampus, along with parahippocampal and posterior cingulate cortex, left angular gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex. Retrieval monitoring effects were identified in the anterior cingulate and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Neither recollection effects within the core network, nor the monitoring effects differed significantly across the age groups after controlling for individual differences in associative recognition performance. Whole brain analyses did however identify three clusters outside of these regions where recollection effects were greater in the young than in the other age groups. Across-participant regression analyses indicated that the magnitude of hippocampal and medial prefrontal cortex recollection effects, and both of the prefrontal monitoring effects, correlated significantly with memory performance. None of these correlations were moderated by age. The findings suggest that the relationships between memory performance and functional activity in regions consistently implicated in successful recollection and retrieval monitoring are stable across much of the healthy adult lifespan.",

        "abstract": "Abstract How the brain combines the neural representations of features that comprise an object in order to activate a coherent object memory is poorly understood, especially when the features are presented in different modalities (visual vs. auditory) and domains (verbal vs. nonverbal). We examined this question using three versions of a modified Semantic Object Retrieval Test, where object memory was probed by a feature presented as a written word, a spoken word, or a picture, followed by a second feature always presented as a visual word. Participants indicated whether each feature pair elicited retrieval of the memory of a particular object. Sixteen subjects completed one of the three versions (N = 48 in total) while their \\{EEG\\} were recorded simultaneously. We analyzed \\{EEG\\} data in four separate frequency bands (delta: 1\u20134 Hz, theta: 4\u20137 Hz; alpha: 8\u201312 Hz; beta: 13\u201319 Hz) using a multivariate data-driven approach. We found that alpha power time-locked to response was modulated by both cross-modality (visual vs. auditory) and cross-domain (verbal vs. nonverbal) probing of semantic object memory. In addition, retrieval trials showed greater changes in all frequency bands compared to non-retrieval trials across all stimulus types in both response-locked and stimulus-locked analyses, suggesting dissociable neural subcomponents involved in binding object features to retrieve a memory. We conclude that these findings support both modality/domain-dependent and modality/domain-independent mechanisms during semantic object memory retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Operational support assists users while process instances are being executed, by making predictions about the instance completion, or recommending suitable actions, resources or routing decisions, on the basis of the already completed instances, stored as execution traces in the event log. In this paper, we propose a case-based retrieval approach to business process management operational support, where log traces are exploited as cases. Once past traces have been retrieved, classical statistical techniques can be applied to them, to support prediction and recommendation. The framework enables the user to submit queries able to express complex patterns exhibited by the current process instance. Such queries can be composed by several simple patterns (i.e., single actions, or direct sequences of actions), separated by delays (i.e., actions we do not care about). Delays can also be imprecise (i.e., the number of actions can be given as a range). The tool also relies on a tree structure, adopted as an index for a quick retrieval from the available event log. Our approach is highly innovative with respect to the existing literature panorama, since it is the first work that exploits case-based retrieval techniques in the operational support context; moreover, the possibility of retrieving traces by querying complex patterns and the indexing strategy are major departures also with respect to other existing trace retrieval tools proposed in the case based reasoning area. Thanks to its characteristics and methodological solutions, the tool implements operational support tasks in a flexible and efficient way, as demonstrated by our experimental results.",

In recent years, with an increasing amount of high resolution remote sensing images, it becomes more and more urgent to find a way to retrieve them. In this case, a few methods based on the statistical information of the local features are proposed, which have achieved good performances. However, most of the methods do not take the topological structure of the features into account. In this paper, we propose a new method to represent these images, by taking the structural information into consideration. The main contributions of this paper include: (1) mapping the features into a manifold space by a Lipschitz smooth function to enhance the representation ability of the features; (2) training an anchor set with several regularization constrains to get the intrinsic manifold structure. In the experiments, the method is applied to two challenging remote sensing image datasets: \\{UC\\} Merced land use dataset and Sydney dataset.

        "abstract": "Abstract The perceived value of information can influence one's motivation to successfully remember that information. This study investigated how information value can affect memory search and evaluation processes (i.e., retrieval monitoring). In Experiment 1, participants studied unrelated words associated with low, medium, or high values. Subsequent memory tests required participants to selectively monitor retrieval for different values. False memory effects were smaller when searching memory for high-value than low-value words, suggesting that people more effectively monitored more important information. In Experiment 2, participants studied semantically-related words, and the need for retrieval monitoring was reduced at test by using inclusion instructions (i.e., endorsement of any word related to the studied words) compared with standard instructions. Inclusion instructions led to increases in false recognition for low-value, but not for high-value words, suggesting that under standard-instruction conditions retrieval monitoring was less likely to occur for important information. Experiment 3 showed that words retrieved with lower confidence were associated with more effective retrieval monitoring, suggesting that the quality of the retrieved memory influenced the degree and effectiveness of monitoring processes. Ironically, unless encouraged to do so, people were less likely to carefully monitor important information, even though people want to remember important memories most accurately.",

It makes the medical search technologies become critical to find useful patient information in the large medical dataset.

With the support of medical domain ontologies, we first mine all the potential semantics (concepts and relations between them) from a user query and consume them to model the multiple query aspects. Then, we propose a novel diversification strategy, which considers not only the aspect importance but also the aspect similarity, to perform the diversity-aware \\{EMR\\} ranking. A real-world pilot study, which utilizes the proposed medical search approach to improve the second use of the EMRs, is reported.

        "abstract": "Abstract The way memory questions are framed influences the information that is searched, retrieved, and monitored during remembering. This fMRI study aimed at clarifying how the format of the retrieval query shapes the neural basis of source recollection. During encoding, participants made semantic (pleasantness) or perceptual (number of letters) judgments about words. Subsequently, in a source memory test, the retrieval query was manipulated such that for half of the items from each encoding task, the retrieval query emphasized the semantic source (i.e., semantic query format: \u201cIs this word from the pleasantness task?\u201d), whereas for the other half the retrieval query emphasized the alternate, perceptual source (i.e., perceptual query format: \u201cIs this word from the letter task?\u201d). The results showed that the semantic query format was associated with higher source recognition than the perceptual query format. This behavioral advantage was accompanied by increased activation in several regions associated to controlled semantic elaboration and monitoring of internally-generated features about the past event. In particular, for items semantically encoded, the semantic query, relative to the perceptual query, induced activation in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampal, parahippocampal and middle temporal cortex. Conversely, for items perceptually encoded, the semantic query recruited the lateral \\{PFC\\} and occipital-fusiform areas. Interestingly, the semantic format also influenced the processing of new items, eliciting greater L lateral and medial \\{PFC\\} activation. In contrast, the perceptual query format (versus the semantic format) only prompted greater activation in R orbitofrontal cortex and the R inferior parietal lobe, for items encoded in a perceptual manner and for new items, respectively. The results highlight the role of the retrieval query format in source remembering, showing that the retrieval query that emphasizes the semantic source promotes the use of semantic strategies via medial and L lateral \\{PFC\\} activations. These frontal activations are accompanied by differential recruitment of more posterior regions, depending on the type of information that had been encoded.",

Hence, Recommender Systems (RSs) are used to find the users\u2019 most favorite items. Finding these items relies on items or users similarities. Though, many factors like sparsity and cold start user impress the recommendation quality. In some systems, attached tags are used for searching items (e.g. videos) as personalized recommendation. Different views, incomplete and inaccurate tags etc. can weaken the performance of these systems. Considering the advancement of computer vision techniques can help improving RSs. To this end, content based search can be used for finding items (here, videos are considered). In such systems, a video is taken from the user to find and recommend a list of most similar videos to the query one. Due to relating most videos to humans, we present a novel low complex scalable method to recommend videos based on the model of included action. This method has recourse to human action retrieval approaches. For modeling human actions, some interest points are extracted from each action and their motion information are used to compute the action representation. Moreover, a fuzzy dissimilarity measure is presented to compare videos for ranking them.

Given that search engines play such a key role in the access to health information, it is important to specifically know \u2013 in connection to national health authorities \u2013 whether health information offered is easily available to the population, and whether this information is well-ranked in search engines. Methods Quantitative methods were used to gather data on the institutional presence of national health authorities on the web. An exploratory and descriptive research served to analyze and interpret data and information obtained quantitatively from different perspectives, including an analysis by country, and also by leading causes of death. A total of 18 web pages were analyzed. Information on leading causes of death was searched on websites of national health authorities in the week of August 10\u201314, 2015. Results The probability of finding information of national health authorities on the 10 leading causes of death in a country, among the top 10 results on Google, is 6.66%.

Since the uniqueness of phase retrieval solution requires more than a single oversampled coded diffraction pattern, the extra information is imposed in either of the following forms: 1) the sector condition on the object; 2) another oversampled diffraction pattern, coded or uncoded. For both settings, the uniqueness of projected fixed point is proved and for setting 2) the local, geometric convergence is derived with a rate given by a spectral gap condition. Numerical experiments demonstrate global, power-law convergence of \\{FDR\\} from arbitrary initialization for both settings as well as for 3 or more coded diffraction patterns without oversampling. In practice, the geometric convergence can be recovered from the power-law regime by a simple projection trick, resulting in highly accurate reconstruction from generic initialization.",

Despite the key role of the amygdala during memory acquistion and consolidation, the participation of neurotransmitter signals in memory retrieval is poorly understood. Hence, we used conditioned taste aversion and in vivo microdialysis to evaluate changes in glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations within the amygdala during memory retrieval. We observed that exposure to an aversive-conditioned stimulus induced an augmentation in glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine levels within the amygdala, while exposure to a familiar and safe stimulus did not induce changes in these neurotransmitters levels. Also, we evaluated the amygdalar blockade of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), \u03b2-adrenergic and dopamine \\{D1\\} receptors in memory retrieval and updating. Results showed that during retrieval, behavioural expression was impaired by intra-amygdalar blockade of \\{AMPA\\} and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, whereas NMDA, \\{D1\\} and \u03b2-adrenergic receptors blockade hindered memory updating. In summary, during conditioned taste aversion retrieval there was an increase in the extracellular levels of glutamate, norepinephrine and dopamine within the amygdala, and their receptors activity were differentially involved in the behavioural expression and memory updating during retrieval.",

Most state-of-the-art shape retrieval methods are based on local features matching and ranking. Their retrieval performance is not robust since they may retrieve globally dissimilar shapes in high ranks. To overcome this challenge, we decompose the decision process into two stages. In the first irrelevant cluster filtering (ICF) stage, we consider both global and local features and use them to predict the relevance of gallery shapes with respect to the query. Irrelevant shapes are removed from the candidate shape set. After that, a local-features-based matching and ranking (LMR) method follows in the second stage. We apply the proposed \\{TSR\\} system to MPEG-7, Kimia99 and Tari1000 three datasets and show that it outperforms all other existing methods.

However, the query is processed in binary, and the distances between the adjacent regions are usually assumed to be equal, resulting in the accuracy loss of the computed distance between the data and the query. To tackle the above problems, in this paper an approach is proposed to process the query and the data asymmetrically. By representing the data with the expectation value of the region where the data belong and preserving the query in original form, the distance between the query and the data can be computed accurately. A specific asymmetric approach with non-parametric multi-bit quantization is further developed for the \\{PCA\\} (Principle Component Analysis) hashing method. With the special consideration of \\{PCA\\} characteristic, every projected dimension is adaptively divided into a certain number of the regions according to the minimal variance. The results of the experiments have shown that the better performance can be obtained in the asymmetric hashing approach with multi-bit quantization than that in the other approaches, and can be improved further in the specific asymmetric approach with non-parametric multi-bit quantization with respect to the \\{PCA\\} hashing method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a statistical modeling algorithm is developed to achieve automatic detection of object classes and image concepts via partial similarity matching. For a given image, its statistical image model is automatically learned by using a finite mixture model to approximate the distribution of its image pixels in the 10-dimensional feature space. Such statistical image modeling process can also achieve automatic image segmentation implicitly. To achieve more precise matching between the mixture components and the local distributions of the relevant image pixels, an adaptive \\{EM\\} algorithm is developed to simultaneously select the model structure (i.e., the optimal number of mixture components) and estimate the model parameters (i.e., locations and statistical properties of the mixture components) according to the local distributions of the relevant image pixels. For a given image concept or object class of interest, its statistical concept model is automatically learned from the statistical image models for the labeled training images. Finally, similarity matching for automatic detection of object classes and image concepts is treated as a partial model matching problem, i.e., matching between the statistical image model for a given test image and all the statistical concept models for the object classes and image concepts of interest. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our statistical modeling algorithm can achieve very competitive results on both automatic image segmentation and classification.",

The work proposed in this paper introduces a framework to enable reusability of manufacturing knowledge through inference rules applied on manufacturing ontologies. Initially, a mechanism is used to access a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and through a rule-based approach, it exports the analogous ontological schema. The ontology constitutes the knowledge base and is stored in a knowledge repository. An inference engine is then used to query this repository and derive additional assertions, which are entailed from the base schema, on product, process, and resource. The method is developed in a web app, which offers to the users the capability to create, activate, and share rules and results on engineering topics.

Poor object and action naming with spared morphosyntax were associated with non-overlapping lesions (inferior occipitotemporal and fronto-temporal, respectively).

The original image retrieval scheme is converted into a 2-dimensional optimization problem, during which image enhancement, a preprocessing step, is implemented to ease the template matching procedure. Image enhancement is achieved via lateral inhibition. Fundamental issues in this topic are investigated in this paper: (1) whether it is sensible to adopt an evolutionary algorithm to search for the best-match result, given that the concerned optimization problem has merely two dimensions; (2) how lateral inhibition takes effect to facilitate image retrieval.

While there is some empirical support for this view, a notable exception is the absence of evidence for the flexible use of retrieval control in functional neuroimaging experiments requiring frequent switches between tasks with different cognitive demands. This absence is troublesome in so far as frequent switches between tasks mimic some of the challenges that are typically placed on memory outside the laboratory. In this experiment we instructed participants to alternate frequently between three episodic memory tasks requiring item recognition or retrieval of one of two different kinds of contextual information encoded in a prior study phase (screen location or encoding task). Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by unstudied items in the two tasks requiring retrieval of study context were reliably different, demonstrating for the first time that \\{ERPs\\} index task-specific processing of retrieval cues when retrieval goals change frequently. The inclusion of the item recognition task was a novel and important addition in this study, because only the \\{ERPs\\} elicited by unstudied items in one of the two context conditions diverged from those in the item recognition condition. This outcome constrains functional interpretations of the differences that emerged between the two context conditions and emphasises the utility of this baseline in functional imaging studies of retrieval processing operations.",

The main idea is to use these features to select the best expansion terms in a machine learning-based query expansion approach. Specifically, we apply rigorous statistical exploratory analysis of spatial point patterns to extract the geo-spatial features. We use the features both to summarize the spatial characteristics of the spatial distribution of a single term, and to determine the similarity between the spatial profiles of two terms \u2013 i.e., term-to-term spatial similarity. To further improve our approach, we investigate the effect of combining our geo-spatial features with temporal features on choosing the expansion terms.

Past studies identified asteroids which could be efficiently injected into manifolds which wind onto periodic orbits around collinear Lagrangian points of the Sun-Earth system. However, the trajectories are unstable, and errors in the capture maneuver would lead to complete mission failure, with potential danger of collision with the Earth, if uncontrolled. This paper investigates the controllability of some asteroids along the transfers and the periodic orbits, assuming the use of a solar-electric low-thrust system shepherding the asteroid. Firstly, an analytical approach is introduced to estimate the stability of the trajectories from a dynamical point of view; then, a numerical control scheme based on a linear quadratic regulator is proposed, where the gains are optimized for each trajectory through a genetic algorithm. A stochastic simulation with a Monte Carlo approach is used to account for different perturbed initial conditions and the epistemic uncertainty on the asteroid mass. Results show that only a small subset of the considered combinations of trajectories/asteroids are reliably controllable, and therefore controllability must be taken into account in the selection of potential targets.",

The support vector machine (SVM) based \\{RF\\} mechanisms have been used in different fields of image retrieval, but they often treat all positive and negative feedback samples equally, which will inevitably degrade the effectiveness of SVM-based \\{RF\\} approaches for CBIR. In fact, positive and negative feedback samples, different positive feedback samples, and different negative feedback samples all always have distinct properties. Moreover, each feedback interaction process is usually tedious and time-consuming because of complex visual features, so if too many times of iteration of feedback are asked, users may be impatient to interact with the \\{CBIR\\} system. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a new SVM-based \\{RF\\} approach using probabilistic feature and weighted kernel function in this paper. Firstly, the probabilistic features of each image are extracted by using principal components analysis (PCA) and the adapted Gaussian mixture models (AGMM) based dimension reduction, and the similarity is computed by employing Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence. Secondly, the positive feedback samples and negative feedback samples are marked, and all feedback samples\u2019 weight values are computed by utilizing the samples-based Relief feature weighting.

In Study 1, learners reduced their predictions following moderately difficult retrieval practice whereas judges increased their predictions. In Study 2, learners made lower adjusted predictions than judges following both easy and difficult retrieval practice. In Study 3, judge-like participants used analytic processes to report adjusted predictions. Overall, the results suggested non-analytic processes play a key role for participants to reduce their predictions after retrieval practice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The rapid development of 3D digital technology has led to an increasing volume of 3D model data. In addressing the management of such large scale data, effective content-based 3D model retrieval and recognition methods are highly desirable. In 3D model retrieval and recognition tasks, the distance measure between two 3D models plays an important role. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D model retrieval and recognition method that employs both a distance histogram and 3D moment invariants as features that are invariant to 3D object scaling, translation, and rotation. Disjoint information is used to measure the distance between the feature histograms, and the Euclidean distance is applied in calculating the distance between two moment features. These measures are then combined as the 3D model distance. Using this distance measure, the relationships between all 3D models in the dataset are formulated as a graph structure. A semi-supervised learning process is then conducted to estimate the relevance among the 3D models, and this is employed for 3D model retrieval and classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct experiments on two datasets. Experimental results and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved performance for 3D model retrieval and recognition tasks.",

Recently several graph-based image retrieval systems have been proposed to fuse different representations, with excellent results. However, most of them use one very precise representation, which does not scale as well as global dense representations with an increasing number of images, hurting time and memory requirements as the database grows. We researched how to attain a comparable precision, while greatly reducing the memory and time requirements by avoiding the use of a main precise representation. To accomplish this objective, we proposed a novel graph-based query fusion approach\u2014where we combined several compact representations based on aggregating local descriptors such as Fisher Vectors\u2014using distance and neighborhood information jointly to evaluate the individual importance of each element in a query adaptive manner. The performance was analyzed in different time and memory constrained scenarios, ranging from less than a second to several seconds for the complete search process while needing only a fraction of the memory compared to other similar performing methods. Experiments were performed on 4 public datasets, namely UKBench, Holidays, Corel-5K and MIRFLICKR-1M, obtaining state-of-the-art effectiveness.",

This approach offers a single-dimensional arrangement of the architectural knowledge. Knowledge retrieval from file-based architecture documentation is efficient if the organisation of knowledge supports the needs of the readers; otherwise it can be difficult. In this paper, we compare the organisation and retrieval of architectural knowledge in a file-based documentation approach and an ontology-based documentation approach.

In Experiment 1, participants performed mini-events and nominated memories of recent autobiographical events in response to cue words. Next, they described their memory for each event and rated its phenomenological characteristics. Over the following three weeks, they repeatedly retrieved half of the mini-event and cue-word memories. No instructions were given about how to retrieve the memories. In Experiment 2, participants were asked to adopt either a first- or third-person perspective during retrieval. One month later, participants retrieved all of the memories and again provided phenomenology ratings. When first-person visual details from the event were repeatedly retrieved, this information was retained better and the shift in perspective was slowed.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Increasing amounts of informal spoken content are being collected, e.g. recordings of meetings, lectures and personal data sources. The amount of this content being captured and the difficulties of manually searching audio data mean that efficient automated search tools are of increasing importance if its full potential is to be realized. Much existing work on speech search has focused on retrieval of clearly defined document units in ad hoc search tasks. We investigate search of informal speech content using an extended version of the \\{AMI\\} meeting collection. A retrieval collection was constructed by augmenting the \\{AMI\\} corpus with a set of ad hoc search requests and manually identified relevant regions of the recorded meetings. Unlike standard ad hoc information retrieval focussing primarily on precision, we assume a recall-focused search scenario of a user seeking to retrieve a particular incident occurring within meetings relevant to the query. We explore the relationship between automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy, automated segmentation of the meeting into retrieval units and retrieval behaviour with respect to both precision and recall. Experimental retrieval results show that while averaged retrieval effectiveness is generally comparable in terms of precision for automatically extracted segments for manual content transcripts and \\{ASR\\} transcripts with high recognition accuracy, segments with poor recognition quality become very hard to retrieve and may fall below the retrieval rank position to which a user is willing search. These changes impact on system effectiveness for recall-focused search tasks. Varied \\{ASR\\} quality across the relevant and non-relevant data means that the rank of some well-recognized relevant segments is actually promoted for \\{ASR\\} transcripts compared to manual ones. This effect is not revealed by the averaged precision based retrieval evaluation metrics typically used for evaluation of speech retrieval. However such variations in the ranks of relevant segments can impact considerably on the experience of the user in terms of the order in which retrieved content is presented. Analysis of our results reveals that while relevant longer segments are generally more robust to \\{ASR\\} errors, and consequentially retrieved at higher ranks, this is often at the expense of the user needing to engage in longer content playback to locate the relevant content in the audio recording. Our overall conclusion being that it is desirable to minimize the length of retrieval units containing relevant content while seeking to maintain high ranking of these items.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Previous event-related potential (ERP) and neuroimaging evidence suggests that directing attention toward single item-context associations compared to intra-item features at encoding improves context memory performance and reduces demands on strategic retrieval operations in young and older adults. In everyday situations, however, there are multiple event features competing for our attention. It is not currently known how selectively attending to one contextual feature while attempting to ignore another influences context memory performance and the processes that support successful retrieval in the young and old. We investigated this issue in the current \\{ERP\\} study. Young and older participants studied pictures of objects in the presence of two contextual features: a color and a scene, and their attention was directed to the object's relationship with one of those contexts. Participants made context memory decisions for both attended and unattended contexts and rated their confidence in those decisions. Behavioral results showed that while both groups were generally successful in applying selective attention during context encoding, older adults were less confident in their context memory decisions for attended features and showed greater dependence in context memory accuracy for attended and unattended contextual features (i.e., hyper-binding). \\{ERP\\} results were largely consistent between age groups but older adults showed a more pronounced late posterior negativity (LPN) implicated in episodic reconstruction processes. We conclude that age-related suppression deficits during encoding result in reduced selectivity in context memory, thereby increasing subsequent demands on episodic reconstruction processes when sought after details are not readily retrieved.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Acute stress and elevated glucocorticoid hormone levels are well known to impair the retrieval of hippocampus-dependent \u2018declarative\u2019 memory. Recent findings suggest that stress might also impair the retrieval of non-hippocampal memories. In particular, stress shortly before retention testing was shown to impair the retrieval of striatal stimulus-response associations in humans. However, the mechanism underlying this stress-induced retrieval impairment of non-hippocampal stimulus-response memory remains elusive. In the present study, we investigated whether an acute elevation in glucocorticoid levels mediates the impairing effects of stress on retrieval of stimulus-response memory. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a stimulus-response task in an eight-arm radial maze until they learned to associate a stimulus, i.e., cue, with a food reward in one of the arms. Twenty-four hours after successful acquisition, they received a systemic injection of vehicle, corticosterone (1 mg/kg), the corticosterone-synthesis inhibitor metyrapone (35 mg/kg) or were left untreated 1 h before retention testing. We found that the corticosterone injection impaired the retrieval of stimulus-response memory. We further found that the systemic injection procedure per se was stressful as the vehicle administration also increased plasma corticosterone levels and impaired the retrieval of stimulus-response memory. However, memory retrieval was not impaired when rats were tested 2 min after the systemic vehicle injection, before any stress-induced elevation in corticosterone levels had occurred. Moreover, metyrapone treatment blocked the effect of injection stress on both plasma corticosterone levels and memory retrieval impairment, indicating that the endogenous corticosterone response mediates the stress-induced memory retrieval impairment. None of the treatments affected rats\u2019 locomotor activity or motivation to search for the food reward within the maze. These findings show that stress may affect memory processes beyond the hippocampus and that these stress effects are due to the action of glucocorticoids.",

Maintaining currency of practice and attaining annual licensure with the Australian Health Practitioners Regulatory Authority (AHPRA) present challenges for individual nurses and midwives and for their health service managers. Engagement with information and communication technologies, in order for geographically isolated clinicians to access ongoing education and training, is considered a useful strategy to address such challenges. This paper presents a pre- and post-test study design. It examines the impact of an online continuing professional development (CPD) program on Australian rural nurses and midwives.

Findings from the study demonstrate that participants who complete a relevant \\{CPD\\} program gain confidence in the use of information and communication technologies.

Encoding and retrieval are supported by the engagement of both distinct neural pathways across the cortex and common structures within the medial temporal lobes. However, the degree to which memory performance can be determined by neural processing that is common to encoding and retrieval remains to be determined. To identify neural signatures of successful memory function, we administered a delayed free-recall task to 187 neurosurgical patients implanted with subdural or intraparenchymal depth electrodes. We developed multivariate classifiers to identify patterns of spectral power across the brain that independently predicted successful episodic encoding and retrieval. During encoding and retrieval, patterns of increased high frequency activity in prefrontal, MTL, and inferior parietal cortices, accompanied by widespread decreases in low frequency power across the brain predicted successful memory function. Using a cross-decoding approach, we demonstrate the ability to predict memory function across distinct phases of the free-recall task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classifiers that combine information from both encoding and retrieval states can outperform task-independent models. These findings suggest that the engagement of a core memory network during either encoding or retrieval shapes the ability to remember the past, despite distinct neural interactions that facilitate encoding and retrieval.",

While these approaches are very efficient when dealing with texts, applied to log files (i.e. semi-structured data containing both numerical and symbolic information) they usually provide irrelevant or useless results. Nevertheless one appealing way for improving the results could be to consider query expansions that aim at adding automatically or semi-automatically additional information in the query to improve the reliability and accuracy of the returned results. In this paper, we present a new approach for enhancing the relevancy of queries during a passage retrieval in log files. It is based on two relevance feedback steps. In the first one, we determine the explicit relevance feedback by identifying the context of the requested information within a learning process. The second step is a new kind of pseudo relevance feedback. Based on a novel term weighting measure it aims at assigning a weight to terms according to their relatedness to queries. This measure, called \\{TRQ\\} (Term Relatedness to Query), is used to identify the most relevant expansion terms. The main advantage of our approach is that is can be applied both on log files and documents from general domains.

A novel retrieval methodology for such data is introduced in this paper. The proposed methodology automatically detects specific facial landmarks and uses them to create a descriptor. This descriptor is the concatenation of three sub-descriptors which capture topological as well as geometric information of the 3D face scans. The motivation behind the proposed hybrid facial expression descriptor is the fact that some facial expressions, like happiness and surprise, are characterized by obvious changes in the mouth topology while others, like anger, fear and sadness, produce geometric but no significant topological changes. The proposed retrieval scheme exploits the Dynamic Time Warping technique in order to compare descriptors corresponding to different 3D facial sequences. A detailed evaluation of the introduced retrieval scheme is presented showing that it outperforms previous state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. Experiments have been conducted using the six prototypical expressions of the standard dataset BU-4DFE and the eight prototypical expressions of the recently available dataset BP4D-Spontaneous. Finally, a majority voting scheme based on the retrieval results is used to achieve unsupervised dynamic 3D facial expression recognition.

The detrimental effects on energy consumption and response time can be alleviated by scheduling the retrieval of data items in an order that reduces the number of passes over the air channels and channel switching between the parallel channels. In this paper, several scheduling algorithms are proposed and analyzed that achieve the aforementioned objectives. To further improve energy consumption and response time, the scope of our scheduling algorithms has been enhanced by replication of popular data items. The proposed scheduling algorithms, both with and without replication, have been simulated, and simulation results are presented and analyzed. These results show that the proposed scheduling algorithms, compared to some heuristic based methods, have greater impact in reducing energy consumption and response time. This reduction is shown to be more pronounced with replication of data items.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT) is a collection of \\{GRASS\\} \\{GIS\\} modules for carrying out pattern-based geospatial analysis of images and other spatial datasets. The need for pattern-based analysis arises when images/rasters contain rich spatial information either because of their very high resolution or their very large spatial extent. Elementary units of pattern-based analysis are scenes \u2013 patches of surface consisting of a complex arrangement of individual pixels (patterns). GeoPAT modules implement popular \\{GIS\\} algorithms, such as query, overlay, and segmentation, to operate on the grid of scenes. To achieve these capabilities GeoPAT includes a library of scene signatures \u2013 compact numerical descriptors of patterns, and a library of distance functions \u2013 providing numerical means of assessing dissimilarity between scenes. Ancillary GeoPAT modules use these functions to construct a grid of scenes or to assign signatures to individual scenes having regular or irregular geometries. Thus GeoPAT combines knowledge retrieval from patterns with mapping tasks within a single integrated \\{GIS\\} environment. GeoPAT is designed to identify and analyze complex, highly generalized classes in spatial datasets. Examples include distinguishing between different styles of urban settlements using \\{VHR\\} images, delineating different landscape types in land cover maps, and mapping physiographic units from DEM. The concept of pattern-based spatial analysis is explained and the roles of all modules and functions are described. A case study example pertaining to delineation of landscape types in a subregion of \\{NLCD\\} is given. Performance evaluation is included to highlight GeoPAT's applicability to very large datasets.

        "abstract": "Abstract Several fMRI studies have shown a correspondence between the brain regions activated during encoding and retrieval, consistent with the view that memory retrieval involves hippocampally-mediated reinstatement of cortical activity. With the limited temporal resolution of fMRI, the precise timing of such reactivation is unclear, calling into question the functional significance of these effects. Whereas reactivation influencing retrieval should emerge with neural correlates of retrieval success, that signifying post-retrieval monitoring would trail retrieval. The present study employed \\{EEG\\} to provide a temporal landmark of retrieval success from which we could investigate the sub-trial time course of reactivation. Pattern-classification analyses revealed that early-onsetting reactivation differentiated the outcome of recognition-memory judgments and was associated with individual differences in behavioral accuracy, while reactivation was also evident in a sustained form later in the trial. The \\{EEG\\} findings suggest that, whereas prior fMRI findings could be interpreted as reflecting the contribution of reinstatement to retrieval success, they could also indicate the maintenance of episodic information in service of post-retrieval evaluation.",

Different types of invariant features are represented in multiple scales, which makes the following metric learning algorithm effective. To reduce the effect of noise and improve the computing efficiency, an adaptive discrete contour evolution method is also proposed to extract the salient feature points of object. The recognition algorithm is explored based on metric learning method and the object features are summarized as histograms inspired from the Bag of Words (BoW). The metric learning methods are employed to learn object features according to their scales. The proposed method is invariant to rotation, scale variation, intra-class variation, articulated deformation and partial occlusion. The recognition process is fast and robust for noise.

Point pairs that are close in this vector space are frequently similar, not only in terms of the dialog activities, but also in topic. Using proximity in this space as an indicator of similarity, we built support for a query-by-example function. Searchers were happy to use this function, and it provided value on a large testset.

In the meantime, it is also used with the corresponding observation experiment of synchronization satellite to check the theoretical model.

We examine the moderating effects of what is arguably the most fundamental distinction to be made about retrieval: whether a retrieval attempt results in success or failure. After reviewing research on this topic, we conclude that retrieval practice is beneficial even when the retrieval attempt is unsuccessful. This finding appears to hold true in a variety of laboratory and real-world contexts and applies to learners across the lifespan. Based on these findings we outline a two-stage model in which learning from retrieval involves (1) a retrieval attempt and then (2) processing the answer. We then turn to a second issue: Does retrieval success even matter for learning? Recent findings suggest that retrieval failure followed by feedback leads to the same amount of learning as retrieval success. In light of these findings, we propose that separate mechanisms are not needed to explain the effect of retrieval success and retrieval failure on learning. We then review existing theories of retrieval and comment on their compatibility with extant data, and end with theoretical conclusions for researchers as well as practical advice for learners and teachers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Vegetation indices derived from satellite image time series have been extensively used to estimate the timing of phenological events like season onset. Medium spatial resolution (\u2265250 m) satellite sensors with daily revisit capability are typically employed for this purpose. In recent years, phenology is being retrieved at higher resolution (\u226430 m) in response to increasing availability of high-resolution satellite data. To overcome the reduced acquisition frequency of such data, previous attempts involved fusion between high- and medium-resolution data, or combinations of multi-year acquisitions in a single phenological reconstruction. The objectives of this study are to demonstrate that phenological parameters can now be retrieved from single-season high-resolution time series, and to compare these retrievals against those derived from multi-year high-resolution and single-season medium-resolution satellite data. The study focuses on the island of Schiermonnikoog, the Netherlands, which comprises a highly-dynamic saltmarsh, dune vegetation, and agricultural land. Combining \\{NDVI\\} series derived from atmospherically-corrected images from RapidEye (5 m-resolution) and the \\{SPOT5\\} Take5 experiment (10m-resolution) acquired between March and August 2015, phenological parameters were estimated using a function fitting approach.

Retrieved phenological parameters from combined RapidEye/SPOT5 displayed spatially consistent results and a large spatial variability, providing complementary information to existing vegetation community maps. Retrievals that combined four years of Landsat observations into a single synthetic year were affected by the inclusion of years with warmer spring temperatures, whereas adjustment of the average phenology to 2015 observations was only feasible for a few pixels due to cloud cover around phenological transition dates. The Proba-V and \\{MODIS\\} phenology retrievals scaled poorly relative to their high-resolution equivalents, indicating that medium-resolution phenology retrievals need to be interpreted with care, particularly in landscapes with fine-scale land cover variability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Human motion retrieval plays an important role in many motion data based applications. In the past, many researchers tended to use a single type of visual feature as data representation. Because different visual feature describes different aspects about motion data, and they have dissimilar discriminative power with respect to one particular class of human motion, it led to poor retrieval performance. Thus, it would be beneficial to combine multiple visual features together for motion data representation. In this article, we present an Adaptive Multi-view Feature Selection (AMFS) method for human motion retrieval. Specifically, we first use a local linear regression model to automatically learn multiple view-based Laplacian graphs for preserving the local geometric structure of motion data. Then, these graphs are combined together with a non-negative view-weight vector to exploit the complementary information between different features. Finally, in order to discard the redundant and irrelevant feature components from the original high-dimensional feature representation, we formulate the objective function of \\{AMFS\\} as a general trace ratio optimization problem, and design an effective algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Extensive experiments on two public human motion database, i.e., \\{HDM05\\} and \\{MSR\\} Action3D, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed \\{AMFS\\} over the state-of-art methods for motion data retrieval.

Annotation also has important applications in the automatic generation of structured radiology reports. Much of the prior research work has focused on annotating images with properties such as the modality of the image, or the biological system or body region being imaged. However, many challenges remain for the annotation of high-level semantic content in medical images (e.g., presence of calcification, vessel obstruction, etc.) due to the difficulty in discovering relationships and associations between low-level image features and high-level semantic concepts. This difficulty is further compounded by the lack of labelled training data. In this paper, we present a method for the automatic semantic annotation of medical images that leverages techniques from content-based image retrieval (CBIR). \\{CBIR\\} is a well-established image search technology that uses quantifiable low-level image features to represent the high-level semantic content depicted in those images. Our method extends \\{CBIR\\} techniques to identify or retrieve a collection of labelled images that have similar low-level features and then uses this collection to determine the best high-level semantic annotations. We demonstrate our annotation method using retrieval via weighted nearest-neighbour retrieval and multi-class classification to show that our approach is viable regardless of the underlying retrieval strategy. We experimentally compared our method with several well-established baseline techniques (classification and regression) and showed that our method achieved the highest accuracy in the annotation of liver computed tomography (CT) images.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A study is performed to analyze the daily retrieval of soil moisture from the synergy of active and passive microwave data using observations from the \\{ASCAT\\} scatterometer and AMSR-E radiometer. The objective is to identify the information provided by each sensor and to analyze preprocessing methods \u2013 such as the day/night average, diurnal difference and microwave polarization difference index for AMSR-E and the incidence angle normalization and backscatter temporal index for \\{ASCAT\\} \u2013 to maximize the amount of soil moisture information extracted. Additionally, the data fusion and a posteriori synergy methodologies are compared to determine how to optimally exploit this combined information. This study is performed using a neural network (NN) to estimate soil moisture from a set of AMSR-E and \\{ASCAT\\} observations. ERA-interim/Land surface soil moisture fields are used to train the \\{NN\\} as well as to evaluate the performance of the different retrieval input datasets. It is shown that using the AMSR-E 7 GHz, 11 GHz, 19 \\{GHz\\} and 37 \\{GHz\\} channels with the three preprocessing methods highlights various surface contributions in the signal, in particular the soil moisture and surface temperature information, and greatly helps the retrieval in disentangling them. For ASCAT, the synergy effect is less significant and data preprocessed with the two methods analyzed yields very similar information. The information provided by the active and passive microwave sensors is found to be very complementary, such that a soil moisture retrieval using the combined active and passive information shows a significant improvement between 5% and 19% in the temporal correlation and a reduction of the retrieval uncertainty by 7%. The improvement in the spatial structure is smaller with a correlation increase of 2%. It is demonstrated that the choice of synergy method strongly impacts the retrieval improvement that can be achieved. Data fusion methods are shown to be better suited than a posteriori combination methods, due to their ability to exploit information complementarity. These results could help improve future active/passive soil moisture retrievals, such as from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission, through the application of similar preprocessing and synergy methods in order to better extract the soil moisture information provided.",

The intended method combines the various features from a mixture of color spaces, the local mesh patterns of the input image. \\{LMCTP\\} descriptor discriminates information between the spatial color textural patterns of multi-spectral channels within the local region. It determines the relationship between surrounding neighbors of the opponent color channel. Beside this, a merged color space, I1QCb, is constructed by combining the \\{I1\\} part of the \\{I1I2I3\\} color space and the chromatic component images, Cb and Q, of the \\{YCbCr\\} and \\{YIQ\\} color spaces correspondingly so as to exploit the effect of joint color texture feature.

        "abstract": "Abstract Clickthrough data from image search engines provide a massive and continuously generated source of user feedback that can be used to model how the search engine users perceive the visual content. Image clickthrough data have been successfully used to build concept detectors without any manual annotation effort, although the generated annotations suffer from labeling errors. Previous research efforts therefore focused on modeling the sample uncertainty in order to improve concept detector effectiveness. In this paper, we study the problem in an online learning setting using streaming clickthrough data where each click is treated seperately when it becomes available; the concept detector model is therefore continuously updated without batch retraining. We argue that sample uncertainty can be incorporated in the online learning setting by exploiting the repetitions of incoming clicks at the classifier level, where these act as an implicit importance weighting mechanism. For online concept detector training we use the \\{LASVM\\} algorithm. The inferred weighting approximates the solution of batch trained concept detectors using weighted \\{SVM\\} variants that are known to achieve improved performance and high robustness to noise compared to the standard SVM. Furthermore, we evaluate methods for selecting negative samples using a small number of candidates sampled locally from the incoming stream of clicks. The selection criteria aim at drastically improving the performance and the convergence speed of the online concept detectors. To validate our arguments we conduct experiments for 30 concepts on the Clickture-Lite dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that: (a) the proposed online approach produces effective and noise resilient concept detectors that can take advantage of streaming clickthrough data and achieve performance that is equivalent to Fuzzy \\{SVM\\} concept detectors with sample weights and 78.6% improved compared to standard \\{SVM\\} concept detectors; and (b) the selection criteria speed up convergence and improve effectiveness compared to random negative sampling even for a small number of available clicks (up to 134% after 100 clicks).",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cloud computing enables a revolutionary paradigm of consuming \\{ICT\\} services. However, due to the inadequately described service information, users often feel confused while trying to find the optimal services. Although some approaches are proposed to deal with cloud service retrieval and recommendation issues, they would only work for certain restricted scenarios in dealing with basic service specifications. Indeed, the missing extent is that most of the cloud services are \u201cagile\u201d whilst there are many vague service terms and descriptions. This paper proposes an agility-oriented and fuzziness-embedded cloud service ontology model, which adopts agility-centric design along with \\{OWL2\\} (Web Ontology Language) fuzzy extensions. The captured cloud service specifications are maintained in an open and collaborative manner, as the fuzziness in the model accepts rating updates from users on the fly. The model enables comprehensive service specification by capturing cloud concept details and their interactions, even across multiple service categories and abstraction levels. Utilizing the model as a knowledge base, a service recommendation system prototype is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the approach can outperform existing practices by achieving effective service search, retrieval and recommendation outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Previous research has shown that memories cued by concrete concepts, such as objects, are retrieved faster than those cued by more abstract concepts, such as emotions. This effect has been explained by the fact that more memories are directly retrieved from object versus emotion cues. In the present study, we tested whether \\{RT\\} differences between memories cued by emotion versus object terms occur not only because object cues elicit direct retrieval of more memories (Uzer, Lee, &amp; Brown, 2012), but also because of differences in memory generation in response to emotions versus objects. One hundred university students retrieved memories in response to basic-level (e.g. orange), superordinate-level (e.g. plant), and emotion (e.g. surprised) cues. Retrieval speed was measured and participants reported whether memories were directly retrieved or generated on each trial. Results showed that memories were retrieved faster in response to basic-level versus superordinate-level and emotion cues because a) basic-level cues elicited more directly retrieved memories, and b) generating memories was more difficult when cues were abstract versus concrete. These results suggest that generative retrieval is a cue generation process in which additional cues that provide contextual information including the target event are produced. Memories are retrieved more slowly in response to emotion cues in part because emotion labels are less effective cues of appropriate contextual information. This particular finding is inconsistent with the idea that emotion is a primary organizational unit for autobiographical memories. In contrast, the difficulty of emotional memory generation implies that emotions represent low-level event information in the organization of autobiographical memory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Since each visual feature only reflects a unique characteristic about a 3-dimensional (3D) model and different visual features have diverse discriminative power in model representation, it would be beneficial to fuse multiple visual features in 3D model retrieval. To this end, we propose a fast view-based 3D model retrieval framework in this article. This framework comprises two parts: the first one is an Unsupervised Multiple Feature Fusion algorithm (UMFF), which is used to learn a compact yet discriminative feature representation from the original multiple visual features; and the second one is an efficient Online Projection Learning algorithm (OPL), which is designed to fast transfer the input multiple visual features of a newcome model into its corresponding low-dimensional feature representation. In this framework, many existing ranking algorithms such as the simple distance-based ranking method can be directly adopted for sorting all 3D models in the database using the learned new feature representation and returning the top ranked models to the user. Extensive experiments on two public 3D model databases demonstrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed approach over its competitors. The proposed framework cannot only dramatically improve the retrieval performance but also reduce the computational cost in dealing with the newcome models.",

Different from the traditional shape context method, the \\{MSC\\} descriptor is built based on the charts without angular bins and the shape distributions in local domains, which makes it not only simple but also efficient. To reduce the cost of shape representation, we detect a sparse set of feature points and design an improved bags-of-word model to encode the \\{MSC\\} descriptors.

        "abstract": "Abstract With an increasing attempt of finding latent semantics in a video dataset, trajectories have become key components since they intrinsically include concise characteristics of object movements. An approach to analyze a trajectory dataset has concentrated on semantic region retrieval, which extracts some regions in which have their own patterns of object movements. Semantic region retrieval has become an important topic since the semantic regions are useful for various applications, such as activity analysis. The previous literatures, however, have just revealed semantically relevant points, rather than actual regions, and have less consideration of temporal dependency of observations in a trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel model for trajectory analysis and semantic region retrieval. We first extend the meaning of semantic regions that can cover actual regions. We build a model for the extended semantic regions based on a hierarchically linked infinite hidden Markov model, which can capture the temporal dependency between adjacent observations, and retrieve the semantic regions from a trajectory dataset. In addition, we propose a sticky extension to diminish redundant semantic regions that occur in a non-sticky model. The experimental results demonstrate that our models well extract semantic regions from a real trajectory dataset.",

There are numerous kinds of such phenomenon currently described in the literature, but their role in the development of information pathways in neural networks with recurrent architectures is still not completely clear. In this paper we study the role of an activity-based process, called pre-synaptic dependent homeostatic scaling, in the organization of networks that yield precise-timed spiking patterns. It encodes spatio-temporal information in the synaptic weights as it associates a learned input with a specific response. We introduce a correlation measure to evaluate the precision of the spiking patterns and explore the effects of different inhibitory interactions and learning parameters. We find that large learning periods are important in order to improve the network learning capacity and discuss this ability in the presence of distinct inhibitory currents.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Manually collecting, identifying, archiving and retrieving specimen images is an expensive and time-consuming work for entomologists. There is a clear need to introduce fast systems integrated with modern image processing and analysis algorithms to accelerate the process. In this paper, we describe the development of an automated moth species identification and retrieval system (SPIR) using computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. The core of the system is a probabilistic model that infers Semantically Related Visual (SRV) attributes from low-level visual features of moth images in the training set, where moth wings are segmented into information-rich patches from which the local features are extracted, and the \\{SRV\\} attributes are provided by human experts as ground-truth. For the large amount of unlabeled test images in the database or added into the database later on, an automated identification process is evoked to translate the detected salient regions of low-level visual features on the moth wings into meaningful semantic \\{SRV\\} attributes. We further propose a novel network analysis based approach to explore and utilize the co-occurrence patterns of \\{SRV\\} attributes as contextual cues to improve individual attribute detection accuracy. Working with a small set of labeled training images, the approach constructs a network with nodes representing the \\{SRV\\} attributes and weighted edges denoting the co-occurrence correlation. A fast modularity maximization algorithm is proposed to detect the co-occurrence patterns as communities in the network. A random walk process working on the discovered co-occurrence patterns is applied to refine the individual attribute detection results. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in automated moth identification and attribute-based image retrieval. In addition, a novel image descriptor called \\{SRV\\} attribute signature is introduced to record the visual and semantic properties of an image and is used to compare image similarity. Experiments are performed on an existing entomology database to illustrate the capabilities of our proposed system. We observed that the system performance is improved by the \\{SRV\\} attribute representation and their co-occurrence patterns.",

We propose a retrieval method based on a bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) to identify discriminative characteristics between different medical images with Pruned Dictionary based on Latent Semantic Topic description. We refer to this as the PD-LST retrieval. Our method has two main components. First, we calculate a topic-word significance value for each visual word given a certain latent topic to evaluate how the word is connected to this latent topic. The latent topics are learnt, based on the relationship between the images and words, and are employed to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics. These latent topics describe the images and words semantically and can thus facilitate more meaningful comparisons between the words. Second, we compute an overall-word significance value to evaluate the significance of a visual word within the entire dictionary. We designed an iterative ranking method to measure overall-word significance by considering the relationship between all latent topics and words. The words with higher values are considered meaningful with more significant discriminative power in differentiating medical images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets and it showed improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency.",

For an image, we consider not only its similarity with the query image, but also the relationship between other dataset images. We integrate these information as image attributes via an extended image graph and propose a graph traversal algorithm to efficiently obtain their values. By comprehensively considering these attributes, we propose an attribute similarity measure for re-ranking, which brings much performance improvement. We further use our method for the multiple-query retrieval with a simple extension of the virtual query. The experimental results show that our method significantly improve the baseline approach and achieves competitive performance compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our re-ranking method requires only a little extra memory space and time costs.",

In this study, the \\{LPRM\\} parameterization is globally updated for \\{SMOS\\} against modelled \u03b8 from MERRA-Land (MERRA) and ERA-Interim/Land (ERA) over the period of July 2010\u2013December 2010, mainly focusing on two parameters: the single scattering albedo (\u03c9) and the roughness (h). The Pearson's coefficient of correlation (r) increased rapidly when increasing the \u03c9 up to 0.12 and reached a steady state from thereon, no significant spatial pattern was found in the estimation of the single scattering albedo, which could be an artifact of the used parameter estimation procedure, and a single value of 0.12 was therefore used globally. The h was defined as a function of \u03b8 and varied slightly for the different angle bins, with maximum values of 1.1\u20131.3 as the angle changes from 42.5\u00b0 to 57.5\u00b0.This resulted in an average r of 0.51 and 0.47, with a bias (m3 m\u22123) of \u22120.02 and \u22120.01 and an unbiased root mean square error (ubrmse in m3 m\u22123) of 0.054 and 0.056 against \\{MERRA\\} (ascending and descending). For \\{ERA\\} this resulted in an r of 0.61 and 0.53, with a bias of \u22120.03 and an ubrmse 0.055 and 0.059. The resulting parameterization was then used to run \\{LPRM\\} on \\{SMOS\\} observations over the period of July 2010\u2013December 2013 and evaluated against \\{SMOS\\} Level 3 (L3) \u03b8 and available in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). The comparison with \\{L3\\} shows that the \\{LPRM\\} \u03b8 retrievals are very similar, with for the ascending set very high r of over 0.9 in large parts of the globe, with an overall average of 0.85 and the descending set performing less with an average of 0.74, mainly due to the negative r over the Sahara. The mean bias is 0.03, with an ubrmse of 0.038 and 0.044. In this study there are three major areas where the \\{LPRM\\} retrievals do not perform well: very dry sandy areas, densely forested areas and over high latitudes, which are all known limitations of LPRM. The comparison against in situ measurement from the \\{ISMN\\} give very similar results, with average r for \\{LPRM\\} of 0.65 and 0.61 (0.64 and 0.59 for L3) for the ascending and descending sets, while having a comparable bias and ubrmse over the different networks.

As an example, abundant photos recording every aspect of human life are available through social media. Among tremendous amount of photos, a significant fraction contains human faces. Faces are usually salient features of the photos. To understand and extract useful information from such gigantic data corpus, efficient and effective retrieval algorithms are demanded. Most face retrieval techniques rely on low-level image features to compare faces based on visual similarity. However, as humans we tend to simplify the recognition task by utilizing human attributes such as gender or race to help differentiate people on a higher semantic level. In this paper, we propose to use human attributes as high-level semantic cues to determine people\u05f3s identities. To this end, we develop discriminative image features with attribute information encoded to achieve more accurate face image retrieval. To guarantee scalability, we propose using a binary coding scheme for the proposed attributed-based features.

We achieve these goals with frames consisting of N = 6 d \u2212 3 vectors spanning a d-dimensional complex Hilbert space. The two algorithms we use, phase propagation or the kernel method, are polynomial time in the dimension d. To ensure a successful approximate recovery, we assume that the noise is sufficiently small compared to the squared norm of the vector to be recovered. In this regime, we derive an explicit error bound that is inverse proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio, with a constant of proportionality that depends only on the dimension d.

        "abstract": "Abstract The recent overwhelming increase in the amount of available visual information, especially digital images, has brought up a pressing need to develop efficient and accurate systems for image retrieval. State-of-the-art systems for image retrieval use the bag-of-visual-words representation of images. However, the computational bottleneck in all such systems is the construction of the visual codebook, i.e., obtaining the visual words. This is typically performed by clustering hundreds of thousands or millions of local descriptors, where the resulting clusters correspond to visual words. Each image is then represented by a histogram of the distribution of its local descriptors across the codebook. The major issue in retrieval systems is that by increasing the sizes of the image databases, the number of local descriptors to be clustered increases rapidly: Thus, using conventional clustering techniques is infeasible. Considering this, we propose to construct the visual codebook by using predictive clustering trees (PCTs), which can be constructed and executed efficiently and have good predictive performance. Moreover, to increase the stability of the model, we propose to use random forests of predictive clustering trees. We create a random forest of \\{PCTs\\} that represents both the codebook and the indexing structure. We evaluate the proposed improvement of the bag-of-visual-words approach on three reference datasets and two additional datasets of 100 K images and 1 M images, compare it to two state-of-the-art methods based on approximate k-means and extremely randomized tree ensembles. The results reveal that the proposed method produces a visual codebook with superior discriminative power and thus better retrieval performance while maintaining excellent computational efficiency.",

We develop an embedded Markov chain based analysis approach to estimate the first and second moment of inter-departure times from the load-dependent station within a semi-open queuing network.

These sub-models are linked to form an integrated queuing network model, which is solved using an iterative algorithm.

The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that these automated compiled procedures are restricted to small quantities that do not exceed the size of the focus of attention (i.e., 4 elements). For this purpose, we analyzed the response times of ninety adult participants when solving the 81 additions with operands from 1 to 9. Even when focusing on small problems (i.e. with sums \u2a7d10) reported by participants as being solved by direct retrieval, chronometric analyses revealed a strong size effect. Response times increased linearly with the magnitude of the operands testifying for the involvement of a sequential multistep procedure. However, this size effect was restricted to the problems involving operands from 1 to 4, whereas the pattern of response times for other small problems was compatible with a retrieval hypothesis. These findings suggest that very fast responses routinely interpreted as reflecting direct retrieval of the answer from memory actually subsume compiled automated procedures that are faster than retrieval and deliver their answer while the subject remains unaware of their process, mistaking them for direct retrieval from long-term memory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Episodic autobiographical memory (ABM) has been found to be impaired from the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous works have focused on how \\{ABM\\} decreases over the lifespan, but no study has deeply investigated whether the extent of episodic autobiographical amnesia is mediated by the retrieval frequency of the episodic trace itself. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the frequency of trace retrieval has an effect on the quality of autobiographical incidents recall and whether the extent of this contribution changes over time. For this purpose, the episodic component of \\{ABM\\} was assessed in patients in the early stage of \\{AD\\} through a questionnaire which allowed evaluating memory of past personal incidents as a function of both their age of acquisition and retrieval frequency. We found that both \\{AD\\} patients and healthy controls took advantage of greater retrieval frequency across all time segments, because of their better memory performance on frequently retrieved episodes than less frequently retrieved ones. Although in the \\{AD\\} group the retrieval frequency effect (i.e., higher scores on the episodes rated as more frequently retrieved) was found in all time segments, the extent of its beneficial effect on memory performance was temporally-graded and inversely related to the time course. Our findings provide new evidence that the combined action of both age of memory and retrieval frequency could provide a valuable framework for predicting patterns of \\{ABM\\} loss, at least in early \\{AD\\} patients. In line with the Multiple Trace Theory, we speculated that retrieval frequency protects episodic trace recall against hippocampal damage by reinforcing the neural representation of personal context-rich memories, which consequently are easier to access and recall. Furthermore, the age of memory should change the amplitude of this beneficial effect as a function of the remoteness of the trace.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Benzodiazepines (BDZs) are anxiolytic drugs that impair memory acquisition. Previous studies using the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PMDAT, which assesses memory and anxiety concomitantly) indicated that the effects of \\{BDZs\\} on anxiety and acquisition are related to each other. The possible influence of the anxiolytic action of \\{BDZs\\} on their effects on memory retrieval and extinction are poorly understood. This is relevant considering the relationship between aversive memories and anxiety disorders. We designed a modified protocol of \\{PMDAT\\} that evaluates anxiety during retrieval and extinction of the task. Male Wistar rats were trained in the \\{PMDAT\\} (plus-maze with two open and two enclosed arms) using a standard or a modified protocol. In the standard protocol, the aversive stimuli were presented in one of the enclosed arms during training, and the animal had free access to the whole apparatus. In the modified protocol, the open arms were blocked with glass walls. Twenty-four hours after training, the animals subjected to each of the protocols were treated with saline or 2.0 mg/kg of diazepam (DZP) 30 min before the test. There was a third session in the maze (retest) 24 h after the test. During the test, \\{DZP\\} impaired and improved retrieval in rats that had been trained in the standard and the modified protocol when compared to the respective saline-treated groups. In addition, treatment with \\{DZP\\} prior to the test induced anxiolysis, but only in the animals that were not pre-exposed to the open arms of the apparatus (modified protocol). In these animals, \\{DZP\\} impaired extinction, which was evaluated during retest session. The impairing effect of \\{DZP\\} on extinction seems to be related to its anxiolytic action during the test (extinction learning). Further, we suggest that aversive memory retrieval depends on both the treatment and the arousal elicited by exposure to the apparatus.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIntroduction The angular gyrus (AG) is consistently reported in neuroimaging studies of episodic memory retrieval and is a fundamental node within the default mode network (DMN). Its specific contribution to episodic memory is debated, with some suggesting it is important for the subjective experience of episodic recollection, rather than retrieval of objective episodic details. Across studies of episodic retrieval, the left \\{AG\\} is recruited more reliably than the right. We explored functional connectivity of the right and left \\{AG\\} with the \\{DMN\\} during rest and retrieval to assess whether connectivity could provide insight into the nature of this laterality effect. Methods Using data from the publically available 1000 Functional Connectome Project, 8 min of resting fMRI data from 180 healthy young adults were analysed. Whole-brain functional connectivity at rest was measured using a seed-based Partial Least Squares (seed-PLS) approach (McIntosh and Lobaugh, 2004) with bilateral \\{AG\\} seeds. A subsequent analysis used 6-min of rest and 6-min of unconstrained, silent retrieval of autobiographical events from a new sample of 20 younger adults. Analysis of this dataset took a more targeted approach to functional connectivity analysis, consisting of univariate pairwise correlations restricted to nodes of the DMN. Results The seed-PLS analysis resulted in two Latent Variables that together explained ~86% of the shared cross-block covariance. The first \\{LV\\} revealed a common network consistent with the \\{DMN\\} and engaging the \\{AG\\} bilaterally, whereas the second \\{LV\\} revealed a less robust, yet significant, laterality effect in connectivity \u2013 the left \\{AG\\} was more strongly connected to the DMN. Univariate analyses of the second sample again revealed better connectivity between the left \\{AG\\} and the \\{DMN\\} at rest. However, during retrieval the left \\{AG\\} was more strongly connected than the right to non-medial temporal (MTL) nodes of the DMN, and \\{MTL\\} nodes were more strongly connected to the right AG. Discussion The multivariate analysis of resting connectivity revealed that the left and right \\{AG\\} show similar connectivity with the DMN. Only after accounting for this commonality were we able to detect a left laterality effect in \\{DMN\\} connectivity. Further probing with univariate connectivity analyses during retrieval demonstrates that the left preference we observe is restricted to the non-MTL regions of the DMN, whereas the right \\{AG\\} shows significantly better connectivity with the MTL. These data suggest bilateral involvement of the \\{AG\\} during retrieval, despite the focus on the left \\{AG\\} in the literature. Furthermore, the results suggest that the contribution of the left \\{AG\\} to retrieval may be separable from that of the MTL, consistent with a role for the left \\{AG\\} in the subjective aspects of recollection in memory, whereas the \\{MTL\\} and the right \\{AG\\} may contribute to objective recollection of specific memory details.",

The standard local binary patterns (LBP) and local ternary patterns (LTP) encode the gray scale relationship between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in two dimensional (2D) local region of an image whereas the former descriptor encodes the gray scale relationship among the neighbors for a given center pixel with three selected directions of mess patterns which is generated from 2D image and later descriptor encodes the spatial relation between any pair of neighbors in a local region along the given directions (i.e., 0\u030a, 45\u030a, 90\u030a and 135\u030a) for a given center pixel in an image. The novelty of the proposed descriptors is that they use ternary patterns from images to encode more spatial structure information which lead to better retrieval. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the new techniques in terms of average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) over state-of-the-art feature extraction techniques (like LBP, LTP, LQEP, \\{LMeP\\} etc.) on three different types of benchmark biomedical databases.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Memory for contextual fear conditioning relies upon the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) regardless of how long ago conditioning occurred, whereas areas connected to the RSC, such as the dorsal hippocampus (DH) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) appear to play time-limited roles. To better understand whether these brain regions functionally interact during memory processing and how the passage of time affects these interactions, we simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from these three regions as well as anterior dorsal thalamus (ADT), which provides one of the strongest inputs to RSC, and measured coherence of oscillatory activity within the theta (4\u201312 Hz) and gamma (30\u201380 Hz) frequency bands. We identified changes of theta coherence related to encoding, retrieval, and extinction of context fear, whereas changes in gamma coherence were restricted to fear extinction. Specifically, exposure to a novel context and retrieval of recently acquired fear conditioning memory were associated with increased theta coherence between \\{RSC\\} and all three other structures. In contrast, RSC\u2013DH and RSC\u2013ADT theta coherence were decreased in mice that successfully retrieved, relative to mice that failed to retrieve, remote memory. Greater RSC\u2013ADT theta and gamma coherence were observed during recent, compared to remote, extinction of freezing responses. Thus, the degree of coherence between \\{RSC\\} and connected brain areas may predict and contribute to context memory retrieval and retrieval-related phenomena such as fear extinction. Importantly, although theta coherence in this circuit increases during memory encoding and retrieval of recent memory, failure to decrease RSC\u2013DH theta coherence might be linked to retrieval deficit in the long term, and possibly contribute to aberrant memory processing characteristic of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

        "abstract": "Abstract X-ray grating interferometry can provide substantially increased contrast over traditional attenuation-based techniques in biomedical applications, and therefore novel and complementary information. Recently, special attention has been paid to quantitative phase retrieval in X-ray grating interferometry, which is mandatory to perform phase tomography, to achieve material identification, etc. An innovative approach, dubbed \u201cReverse Projection\u201d (RP), has been developed for quantitative phase retrieval. The \\{RP\\} method abandons grating scanning completely, and is thus advantageous in terms of higher efficiency and reduced radiation damage. Therefore, it is expected that this novel method would find its potential in preclinical and clinical implementations. Strictly speaking, the reverse projection method is applicable for objects exhibiting only absorption and refraction. In this contribution, we discuss the phase retrieval with the reverse projection method for general objects with absorption, refraction and scattering simultaneously. Especially, we investigate the influence of the object's scattering on the retrieved refraction signal. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are performed. The results show that the retrieved refraction signal is the product of object's refraction and scattering signals for small values. In the case of a strong scattering, the reverse projection method cannot provide reliable phase retrieval. Those presented results will guide the use of the reverse projection method for future practical applications, and help to explain some possible artifacts in the retrieved images and/or reconstructed slices.",

In this paper, we evaluated biomass estimation from L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle \\{SAR\\} (UAVSAR) and the improvement of accuracy by adding canopy height information derived from stereo imagery acquired by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Panchromatic Remote Sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM) on-board the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS). Various models for prediction of forest biomass from \\{UAVSAR\\} data were investigated at pixel sizes of 1/4 ha (50 m \u00d7 50 m) and 1 ha. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for each of the explanatory variables in multivariable regression models to assess the multi-collinearity between explanatory variables. In addition, the t- and p-values were used to interpret the significance of the coefficients of each explanatory variables. The R2, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), bias and Akaike information criterion (AIC), and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) and bootstrapping were used to validate models. At 1/4-ha scale, the \\{R2\\} and \\{RMSE\\} of biomass estimation from a model using a single track of polarimetric \\{UAVSAR\\} data were 0.59 and 52.08 Mg/ha. With canopy height from \\{PRISM\\} as additional independent variable, \\{R2\\} increased to 0.76 and \\{RMSE\\} decreased to 39.74 Mg/ha (28.24%). At 1-ha scale, the \\{RMSE\\} of biomass estimation based on \\{UAVSAR\\} data of a single track was 39.42 Mg/ha with a \\{R2\\} of 0.77. With the canopy height from PRISM, \\{R2\\} increased to 0.86 and \\{RMSE\\} decreased to 29.47 Mg/ha (20.18%). The models using \\{UAVSAR\\} data alone underestimated biomass at levels above ~ 150 Mg/ha showing the saturation phenomenon. Adding canopy height from \\{PRISM\\} stereo imagery significantly improved the biomass estimation and elevated the saturation level in estimating biomass. Combined use of \\{UAVSAR\\} data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation. Combined use of \\{UAVSAR\\} data acquired from opposite directions (odd and even tracks) slightly improved the biomass estimation at 1/4-ha scale, \\{R2\\} increased from 0.59 to 0.66 and \\{RMSE\\} reduced from 52.08 to 48.57 Mg/ha. Averaging multiple acquisitions of \\{UAVSAR\\} data from the same look azimuth direction did not improve biomass estimation. A biomass map derived from NASA's \\{LVIS\\} (Laser Vegetation Imaging System) waveform data was used as a reference for evaluation of the biomass maps from these models. The study has also shown that the errors decreased when deciduous, evergreen, and mixed forests were modeled separately but the improvement was not significant.",

To support the retrieval of assembly models, the extracted information are formalized and capitalized in a newly proposed hierarchical assembly model descriptor. Results of the application of the method are also provided to show the system capabilities.

Fourier descriptors are a very efficient shape description method used in shape-based image retrieval tasks. In order to achieve invariance under rotation and starting point change, most Fourier descriptor implementations disregard the phase of Fourier coefficients, consequently losing valuable information about the shape. This paper proposes a novel method of extracting Fourier descriptors that preserve the phase of Fourier coefficients. We introduce specific points, called pseudomirror points, and use them as a shape orientation reference. They facilitate the extraction of phase-preserving Fourier descriptors which are invariant under translation, scaling, rotation and starting point change. The proposed descriptor was tested on four popular benchmarking datasets: \\{MPEG7\\} CE-1 Set B, Swedish leaf, ETH-80 and Kimia99 datasets.

To address this issue, we put forward a novel cross-modal hashing method named Semantic Boosting Cross-Modal Hashing (SBCMH).

To further narrow the semantic gap between different modalities, we then use a joint boosting framework to learn hash functions, and finally transform the mapped data representations into a measurable binary subspace.

Hapke (2012b) designed a photometric model providing an approximate analytical solution of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of a particulate medium: he introduced the effect of surface roughness as a correction factor of the \\{BRDF\\} of a smooth surface. This photometric roughness is defined as the mean slope angle of the facets composing the surface, integrated over all scales from the grain size to the local topography. Yet its physical meaning is still a question at issue, as the scale at which it occurs is not clearly defined. This work aims at better understanding the relative influence of roughness scales on soil \\{BRDF\\} and to test the ability of the Hapke model to retrieve a roughness that depicts effectively the ground truth. We apply a wavelet transform on millimeter digital terrain models (DTM) acquired over volcanic terrains. This method allows splitting the frequency band of a signal in several sub-bands, each corresponding to a spatial scale. We demonstrate that sub-centimeter surface features dominate both the integrated roughness and the \\{BRDF\\} shape. We investigate the suitability of the Hapke model for surface roughness retrieval by inversion on optical data. A global sensitivity analysis of the model shows that soil \\{BRDF\\} is very sensitive to surface roughness, nearly as much as the single scattering albedo according to the phase angle, but also that these two parameters are strongly correlated. Based on these results, a simplified two-parameter model depending on surface albedo and roughness is proposed. Inversion of this model on \\{BRDF\\} data simulated by a ray-tracing code over natural targets shows a good estimation of surface roughness when the assumptions of the model are verified, with a priori knowledge on surface albedo.",

These studies suggest that older adults exhibit a reduction in frequency of both mind-wandering and involuntary autobiographical memory, whereas findings regarding intrusive thoughts have been more mixed. Additionally, there is some preliminary evidence that spontaneous prospective memory retrieval may be relatively preserved in aging. We consider the roles of age-related differences in cognitive resources, motivation, current concerns and emotional regulation in accounting for these findings.

        "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, the problem of shape based image retrieval is addressed by proposing a hybrid shape descriptor. The proposed descriptor conforms to human visual perception along with its low computational complexity. Since global features are related to the holistic characteristics of images, whereas local features describe the finer details within objects of images, in the proposed hybrid descriptor both global and local features of images are used to describe the entire aspects of image shape. For global features extraction, we use angular radial transform, which is also adopted by MPEG-7 as a region based shape descriptor. On the other hand, for local feature extraction, a novel local descriptor is proposed, which is referred to as histograms of spatially distributed points (HSDP). It is based on two components: radial distance and differential coefficient, which are used to build 2D histograms. Global and local features are combined using effective distance measures viz. Min-Max and Bray-Curtis. Their superiority is validated by experimental results. Apart from that, an extensive range of image databases is employed to assess the performance of the proposed hybrid descriptor. These databases represent several characteristics of shape such as partial occlusion, distortion, subject change, gray scale objects, rotated and noise affected objects, unstructured images, trademarks, blurred images, Corel images, etc. The results of wide range of experiments reveal that the fusion of \\{ART\\} and \\{HSDP\\} significantly improves the image retrieval accuracy and provides a robust and invariant solution for effective shape matching.",

Hence, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has become one of the most active research areas for the last few decades. However, it is still an open issue to narrow down the gap between the high level semantics in the human minds and the low level features computable by machines. This paper proposes a multiple-instance learning based decision neural network (MI-BDNN) that attempts to bridge the semantic ga in CBIR. Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is a variation of supervised learning, where the training set is composed of many bags, and each bag contains many instances. If a bag contains at least one positive instance, it is labelled as a positive bag; otherwise, it is labelled as a negative bag. A novel discriminant function and learning schemes are employed in the MI-BDNN to learn the concept from the training bags. The proposed approach considers the image retrieval problem as a \\{MIL\\} problem, where a user\u05f3s preferred image concept is learned by training MI-BDNN with a set of exemplar images, each of which is labelled as conceptual related (positive) or conceptual unrelated (negative) image.

First, we quantize the color space using a GMM, which is learned by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm from the training images. The number of Gaussian components (i.e., the number of quantized color bins) is determined automatically according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Second, we incorporate the spatiogram representation with the quantized Gaussian mixture color model. Intuitively, a spatiogram is a histogram in which the distribution of colors is spatially weighted by the locations of the pixels contributing to each color bin. We have modified the spatiogram representation to fit our framework, which employs Gaussian color components instead of discrete color bins. Finally, the comparison between two images is achieved by measuring the similarity between two spatiograms, for which purpose we propose a new measurement adopting the Jensen\u2013Shannon Divergence (JSD).

Memory performance and fMRI activity during a recognition task were compared between a young group and two older groups characterized by a low (old-low group) vs. high (old-high group) level of executive functioning. Participants first encoded pictures, presented once (Hard condition) or twice (Easy condition), and then completed a recognition memory task. Old-low adults had poorer memory performance than the two other groups, which did not differ, in both levels of task demands. In the Easy condition, even though older adults demonstrated reduced activity compared to young adults in several regions, they also showed additional activations in the right superior frontal gyrus and right parietal lobule (positively correlated to memory accuracy) for the old-high group and in the right precuneus (negatively correlated to memory accuracy), right anterior cingulate gyrus and right supramarginal gyrus for the old-low group. In the Hard condition, some regions were also more activated in the young group than in the older groups. Vice versa, old-high participants demonstrated more activity than either the young or the old-low group in the right frontal gyrus, associated with more accurate memory performance, and in the left frontal gyrus. In sum, the present study clearly showed that age differences in the neural correlates of retrieval success were modulated by task difficulty, as suggested by the \\{CRUNCH\\} model, but also by interindividual variability, in particular regarding executive functioning.",

For example, \\{O3\\} spectra in the stratosphere are stronger during the day than at night.

Although this technique achieves high retrieval accurateness, the precision value is low down. In order to enhance the efficiency and precision value even more higher a Haar wavelet based \\{LTRP\\} technique is proposed in this paper. To extract the object feature instead of earlier new watershed segmentation(NWS) method, Haar wavelet based \\{LTRP\\} technique is used. In the proposed technique, at first the visual features are removed from the images by means of the spatial spectral heterogeneity technique. Afterwards the object features are removed by applying the Haar wavelet and the object features are extracted from the wavelet band by developing \\{LTRP\\} method and the Extracted object features are classified by Neuro-Fuzzy system typically known as ANFIS. Subsequently Scene semantic models are used for the recovery of parallel scene images from the database. The projected \\{RSIR\\} system based on Haar wavelet-LTRP and \\{ANFIS\\} technique are executed in working platform of MATLAB. The performance is measured by utilizing a compilation of remote sensing images taken from the database. In addition the recital is examined by comparing the projected Haar wavelet-LTRP method with the \\{NWSRSIR\\} and the usual \\{SBRSIR\\} method in terms of performance estimate metrics such as precision, recall and F-Measure rate. The implementation effects show the competence of projected Haar wavelet based \\{LTRP\\} method in Remote sensing image retrieval method.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Graphs are frequently used to provide a powerful representation for structured data. However, it is still a challenging task to model 3D human motions due to its large spatio-temporal variations. This paper proposes a novel graph-based method for real time 3D human motion retrieval. Firstly, we propose a novel graph construction method which connects the joints that are deemed important for a given motion. In particular, the top-N Relative Ranges of Joint Relative Distances (RRJRD) were proposed to determine which joints should be connected in the resulting graph because these measures indicate the normalized activity levels among the joint pairs. Different motions may thus result in different graph structures so the construction of the graphs is made adaptive to the characteristics of a given motion and is able to represent a meaningful spatial structure. In addition to the spatial structure, the temporal pyramid of covariance descriptors was adopted to preserve certain level of spatio-temporal local features. The graph kernel is computed by matching the walks from each of the two graphs to be matched. Furthermore, multiple kernel learning was applied to determine the optimal weights for combining the graph kernels to measure the overall similarity between two motions. The experimental results show that our method is robust under several variations, and demonstrates superior performance in comparison to three state-of-the-art methods.",

We use the \\{FK\\} representation to explicitly capture temporal variation in video via frame-based features taken at different time intervals. While the \\{GMM\\} is being trained, a user selects from the top examples those which he is looking for. This feedback is used to train a Support Vector Machine on the \\{FK\\} representation, which is then applied to re-rank the top retrieved results.

The key idea of hashing is to learn a hash function that maps high dimensional data into compact binary codes while preserving the similarity structure in the original feature space. In this paper, we propose a new method called the Kernelized Sparse Hashing, which generates sparse hash codes with \u21131 and non-negative regularizations. Compared to traditional hashing methods, our method only activates a small number of relevant bits on the hash code and hence provides a more compact and interpretable representation of data. Moreover, the kernel trick is introduced to capture the nonlinear similarity of features, and the local geometrical structure of data is explicitly considered in our method to improve the retrieval accuracy. Extensive experiments on three large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method over the examined state-of-the-art techniques.",

Since each visual feature reflects a unique characteristic about the model, they have unequal discriminative power with respect to a specific category of 3D model, and they are complementary to each other in model representation. Thus, it would be beneficial to combine multiple visual features together in 3D model retrieval. In light of this, we propose an efficient Semi-supervised Multiple Feature Fusion (SMFF) method for view-based 3D model retrieval in this paper. Specifically, We first extract multiple visual features to describe both the local and global appearance characteristics of multiple 2D projected images that are generated from 3D models. Then, \\{SMFF\\} is adopted to learn a more compact and discriminative low-dimensional feature representation via multiple feature fusion using both the labeled and unlabeled 3D models. Once the low-dimensional features have been learned, many existing methods such as \\{SVM\\} and \\{KNN\\} can be used in the subsequent retrieval phase. Moreover, an out-of-sample extension of \\{SMFF\\} is provided to calculate the low-dimensional features for the newly added 3D models in linear time. Experiments on two public 3D model datasets demonstrate that using such a learned feature representation can significantly improve the performance of 3D model retrieval and the proposed method outperforms the other competitors.",

In the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well as in the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) water transparency is used for ecological status classification of inland, coastal and open sea waters and it is regarded as an indicator for eutrophication in Baltic Sea management (HELCOM, 2007). We developed and compared different empirical and semi-analytical algorithms for lakes and coastal Nordic waters to retrieve Secchi depth (ZSD) from remote sensing data (MERIS, 300 m resolution). The algorithms were developed in water bodies with high coloured dissolved organic matter absorption (aCDOM(442) ranging 1.7\u20134.0 m\u22121), Chl a concentration (0.5\u201373 mg m\u22123) and total suspended matter (0.7\u201337.5 g m\u22123) and validated against an independent data set over inland and coastal waters (0.6 m &lt; \\{ZSD\\} &lt; 14.8 m). The results indicate that for empirical algorithms, using longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum as a reference band decreases the \\{RMSE\\} and increases the coefficient of determination (R2). The accuracy increased (R2 = 0.75, \\{RMSE\\} = 1.33 m, n = 134) when \\{ZSD\\} was retrieved via an empirical relationship between \\{ZSD\\} and Kd(490). The best agreement with in situ data was attained when \\{ZSD\\} was calculated via both the diffuse and the beam attenuation coefficient (R2 = 0.89, \\{RMSE\\} = 0.77 m, n = 89). The results demonstrate that transparency can be retrieved with high accuracy over various optical water types by the means of ocean color remote sensing, improving both the spatial and temporal coverage.

If dlPFC is causally involved in retrieval, then transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of this brain region should increase recollection accuracy, especially when recollection is difficult and requires cognitive control. Here, we report the first brain stimulation experiment to directly test this hypothesis. We administered tDCS to dlPFC immediately after studying to-be-learned material but just prior to recollection testing, thereby targeting retrieval processes. We found that stimulation of dlPFC significantly increased recollection accuracy, relative to a no-stimulation sham condition and also relative to active stimulation of a comparison region in left parietal cortex. There was no significant difference in the size of this increase between hemispheres. Moreover, these dlPFC stimulation effects were behaviorally selective, increasing accuracy only when participants needed to recollect difficult information. Electrically stimulating dlPFC allowed people to more accurately recollect specific details of their experiences, demonstrating a causal role of dlPFC in the retrieval of episodic memories.",

The common modality used for image search on the web is based on text, the assumption being that the tags and the textual descriptions associated with photos are powerful ways to describe and retrieve images. The results are usually obtained by simply matching the terms of the query to an index of terms associated to the images in a corpus. The efficiency of this technique depends strongly on the tags associated to pictures, as well as their accuracy. Trying to search for images with bridges in this kind of systems, the result set will only contain images explicitly annotated with this term, but will fail to include images with Pont Neuf or Ponte Vecchio, if their tags do not contain the noun bridge.

The proposed algorithm first determines the truly relevant photos according to visual similarity in mobile end, then learns salient visual words by exploring saliency from these relevant images, and finally determines the contribution order of salient visual words to carry out scalable retrieval. Moreover, to improve the retrieval performance, soft spatial verification is proposed to re-rank the results. Compared to the existing approaches of mobile image retrieval, our approach transmits less data and reduces the computational cost of spatial verification.

But it remains to be determined which neural systems are functionally affected during memory retrieval after one night of recovery sleep. To investigate this issue, we evaluated memory for pairs of famous people's faces with the same or different profession (i.e., semantically congruent or incongruent faces) after one night of undisturbed sleep in subjects who either underwent 4 hours of acute sleep restriction (ASR, N = 20) or who slept 8 hours the pre-training night (controls, N = 20). \\{EEG\\} recordings were collected during the recognition memory task in both groups, and the cortical sources generating this activity localized by applying a spatial beamforming filter in the frequency domain. Even though sleep restriction did not affect accuracy of memory performance, controls showed a much larger decrease of alpha power relative to a baseline period when compared to sleep-deprived subjects. These group differences affected a widespread frontotemporoparietal network involved in retrieval of episodic/semantic memories. Regression analyses further revealed that associative memory in the \\{ASR\\} group was negatively correlated with alpha power in the occipital regions, whereas the benefit of congruency in the same group was positively correlated with delta power in the left lateral prefrontal cortex. Retrieval-related decreases of alpha power have been associated with the reactivation of material-specific memory representations, whereas increases of delta power have been related to inhibition of interferences that may affect the performance of the task. We can therefore draw the conclusion that a few hours of sleep loss in the pre-training night, though insufficient to change the memory performance, is sufficient to alter the processes involved in retrieving and manipulating episodic and semantic information.",

Additionally, through an offline learning step, a visual dictionary is built by clustering a large set of feature descriptors. Then, each 3D shape is described by a histogram of these visual words occurrences weighted using the number of their local descriptors.

In this problem, a team of initially co-located agents must report data from all safe nodes of the network to the homebase, infinitely often. The malicious host can choose whether to kill visiting agents or allow them to pass through (gray hole). In another variation of the model, the malicious host can, in addition, alter its whiteboard contents in order to deceive visiting agents. The goal is to design a protocol for Periodic Data Retrieval using as few agents as possible. In this paper, we present the first nontrivial lower bounds on the number of agents for Periodic Data Retrieval in asynchronous ring networks. Specifically, we show that at least 4 agents are needed when the malicious host is a gray hole, and at least 5 agents are needed when the malicious host whiteboard is unreliable. This improves the previous lower bound of 3 in both cases and answers an open question posed in the aforementioned paper. On the positive side, we propose an optimal protocol for Periodic Data Retrieval in asynchronous rings with a gray hole, which solves the problem with only 4 agents. This improves the previous upper bound of 9 agents and settles the question of the optimal number of agents in the gray-hole case. Finally, we propose a protocol with 7 agents when the whiteboard of the malicious host is unreliable, significantly improving the previously known upper bound of 27 agents. Along the way, we set forth a detailed framework for studying networks with malicious hosts of varying capabilities.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Increasingly many social images with tags are available on photo sharing websites. Due to the subjectivity and diversity of social tagging behaviors, noisy and missing tags for images are inevitable. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a novel factor analysis model, named ProjecTive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (PTNMF) with \u2113 2 , 1 -norm regularization, which introduces linear transformation and \u2113 2 , 1 -norm minimization into a joint framework of NMF. For tagging data, a new interpretation is adopted to distinguish the relevant tags and irrelevant tags instead of the typically used binary scheme. In our model, the image latent representation is assumed to be projected from its original feature representation with an orthogonal transformation matrix. The projection makes convenient to embed any images including out-of-samples into the latent space. That is, the proposed method enables to handle the out-of-sample problem. The \u2113 2 , 1 -norm regularization makes the transformation matrix suitable for selecting the effective features. Local geometry preservations of image space (tag space) are explored as constraints in order to make image similarity (tag correlation) consistent in the original space and the corresponding latent space. We investigate the performance of the proposed method on image retrieval and compare it to existing work on the challenging NUS-WIDE dataset. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness and potentials of the proposed method in real-world applications.",

Modularity is also widely used in shoulder arthroplasty implants, but little information exists about the potential for tribocorrosion. This study hypothesized that there would be mild or no tribocorrosion in a series of retrieved shoulder implants. Methods A total of 28 implants with a mean implantation time of 6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0years were evaluated using a validated damage scoring method. Implant tapers on the head and stem were divided into upper (deepest) and lower zones and independently scored for fretting and corrosion damage from 1 (none) to 4 (severe). Results Corrosion was present on 32% of heads and 38% of stems, whereas fretting was present on 36% of heads and 46% of stems. There was significantly greater (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) corrosion in the lower zone of the retrieved stems (1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5) than there was in the upper zone (1.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3). Correlation between the head and stem corrosion for lower zone was moderate (r\u00a0=\u00a00.41; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Discussion Tribocorrosion was present on the heads and stems of some of the retrieved shoulder implants examined in this study. The incidence of tribocorrosion in shoulder implants was lower than in reported cases of retrieved hip implants. The greatest damage was in the lower zone of the taper, where the connection may be exposed to the surrounding joint fluid. It remains to be seen whether this leads to any clinical presentation of trunnionosis.",

User tests with radiologists using a search system for images in the medical literature are presented. The goal of the tests is to assess the usability of the system, identify system and interface aspects that need improvement and useful additions. Another objective is to investigate the system's added value to radiology information retrieval. The study provides an insight into required specifications and potential shortcomings of medical image retrieval systems through a concrete methodology for conducting user tests. Methods User tests with a working image retrieval system of images from the biomedical literature were performed in an iterative manner, where each iteration had the participants perform radiology information seeking tasks and then refining the system as well as the user study design itself. During these tasks the interaction of the users with the system was monitored, usability aspects were measured, retrieval success rates recorded and feedback was collected through survey forms. Results In total, 16 radiologists participated in the user tests. The success rates in finding relevant information were on average 87% and 78% for image and case retrieval tasks, respectively. The average time for a successful search was below 3 min in both cases. Users felt quickly comfortable with the novel techniques and tools (after 5 to 15 min), such as content-based image retrieval and relevance feedback. User satisfaction measures show a very positive attitude toward the system's functionalities while the user feedback helped identifying the system's weak points. The participants proposed several potentially useful new functionalities, such as filtering by imaging modality and search for articles using image examples. Conclusion The iterative character of the evaluation helped to obtain diverse and detailed feedback on all system aspects. Radiologists are quickly familiar with the functionalities but have several comments on desired functionalities. The analysis of the results can potentially assist system refinement for future medical information retrieval systems. Moreover, the methodology presented as well as the discussion on the limitations and challenges of such studies can be useful for user-oriented medical image retrieval evaluation, as user-oriented evaluation of interactive system is still only rarely performed. Such interactive evaluations can be limited in effort if done iteratively and can give many insights for developing better systems.",

An original image is decomposed into three complementary components: amplitude, orientation and phase by monogenic signal representation. The monogenic variation in each local region and monogenic feature in each pixel are encoded, and then the statistical features of the local features encoded are calculated. In order to overcome the problem of high feature dimensionality, the local statistical features extracted from the complementary monogenic components are projected by block-based fisher discriminant analysis, which not only reduces the dimensionality of the features extracted, but also enhances its discriminative power. Finally, these features reduced are fused for effective image retrieval.

Answers which can then be answered by other users who are often knowledgeable on the subject. cQA is increasingly popular on the Web, due to its convenience and effectiveness in connecting users with queries and those with answers. In this article, we study the problem of finding previous queries (e.g., posed by other users) which may be similar to new queries, and adapting their answers as the answers to the new queries. A key challenge here is to the bridge the lexical gap between new queries and old answers. For example, \u201ccompany\u201d in the queries may correspond to \u201cfirm\u201d in the answers. To address this challenge, past research has proposed techniques similar to machine translation that \u201ctranslate\u201d old answers to ones using the words in the new queries. However, a key limitation of these works is that they assume queries and answers are parallel texts, which is hardly true in reality. As a result, the translated or rephrased answers may not look intuitive. In this article, we propose a novel approach to learn the semantic representation of queries and answers by using a neural network architecture. The learned semantic level features are finally incorporated into a learning to rank framework. We have evaluated our approach using a large-scale data set. Results show that the approach can significantly outperform existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract For over a century, memory researchers have extensively studied the differences between retrieving memories that were encoded in the remote past as opposed to recently. Although this work has largely focused on the changes that these memory traces undergo over time, an unexplored issue is whether retrieval attempts and other strategic processes might be differentially oriented in order to effectively access memories of different ages. The current study addressed this issue by instructing participants to retrieve words that were encoded either one week (remote) or about 30 minutes earlier (recent). To maximize the possibility that participants adopted distinct retrieval orientations, separate blocks of the memory test employed exclusion task procedures in which the words from only one encoding period were targeted at a given time, in the face of distractors from the other period. Event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by correctly-rejected new items were contrasted to minimize confounding effects of retrieval success. The new-item \\{ERPs\\} revealed differences according to the targeted week, such that the \\{ERPs\\} over posterior scalp were more positive-going for the recent compared to remote blocks. Furthermore, using multiple methods, these \\{ERP\\} effects were dissociated from differences in difficulty across the two conditions. The findings provide novel evidence that knowledge about when a memory was initially encoded leads to differences in the adoption of retrieval processing strategies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The \\{FLuorescence\\} \\{EXplorer\\} (FLEX) satellite mission, candidate of ESA's 8th Earth Explorer program, is explicitly optimized for detecting the sun-induced fluorescence emitted by plants. It will allow consistent measurements around the O2-B (687 nm) and O2-A (760 nm) bands, related to the red and far-red fluorescence emission peaks respectively, the photochemical reflectance index, and the structural-chemical state variables of the canopy. The sun-induced fluorescence signal, overlapped to the surface reflected radiance, can be accurately retrieved by employing the powerful spectral fitting technique. In this framework, a set of fluorescence retrieval algorithms optimized for \\{FLEX\\} are proposed in this study. Two main retrieval approaches were investigated: i) the optimization of the spectral fitting for retrieving fluorescence at the oxygen absorption bands; ii) the extension of the spectral fitting to a broader spectral window to retrieve the full fluorescence spectrum in the range from 670 to 780 nm. The accuracy of the retrieval algorithms is assessed by employing atmosphere-surface radiative transfer simulations obtained by coupling \\{SCOPE\\} and \\{MODTRAN5\\} codes. The simulated dataset considers more realistic conditions because it includes directional effects, and the top-of-atmosphere radiance spectra are resampled to the current specifications of the \\{FLuORescence\\} Imaging Spectrometer (FLORIS) planned to serve as the primary instrument aboard FLEX. The retrieval accuracy obtained at the O2-A band is strongly affected by directional effects, and better performance is found in cases where directional effects are lower. However, the best performing algorithms tested provided similar performance, the \\{RMSE\\} (RRMSE) is 0.044 mW m\u2212 2 sr\u2212 1 nm\u2212 1 (6.2%) at the O2-A band, 0.018 mW m\u2212 2 sr\u2212 1 nm\u2212 1 (2.9%) at the O2-B band, and 6.225 mW m\u2212 2 sr\u2212 1 (6.4%) for the spectrally integrated fluorescence emission.

The standard local binary pattern (LBP) collects the sign edge (binary code) information between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in an image. Further, the concept of \\{LBP\\} is extended to local maximum edge binary pattern (LMEBP) which collects the sign code (binary code) using the magnitude edges. These magnitude edges are collected based on the maximum edges between the center pixel and its surrounding neighbors in an image. In this paper, we propose a new feature descriptor, octal code which is coded based on the maximum edge positions (MEP) on Gabor responses. Specially, each pixel of every Gabor response gains eight edges based on the relationship between the referenced pixel and its neighbors. \\{LGMEPOP\\} utilizes the first three dominant (maximum) edge positions in an octal code generation. Then, these three maximum edge positions are encoded into three-eight octal numbers to produce the LGMEPOP. Further, the \\{LGMEPOP\\} is classified into two categories which are named as sign maximum edge position octal pattern (SMEPOP) and magnitude maximum edge position octal pattern (MMEPOP). The \\{SMEPOP\\} and \\{MMEPOP\\} are coded based on the sign and magnitudes of dominant edges respectively. The performance of the proposed method is tested on two benchmark databases. The results after being investigated show a significant improvement as compared to other existing methods (LBP and \\{LBP\\} variants) in terms of average retrieval precision (ARP) and average retrieval rate (ARR) on Corel-5000 and Corel-10000 databases.",

In this paper we propose a dimension reduction method called Meta object-Group Component (MGC) to tackle this problem. \\{MGC\\} aims at discovering the hidden relations of objects by examining the correlations between dimensions in the BoW features and maximizing the relations of the members in a meta object-group. By exchanging message passing between object-groups, meta object-groups are identified for a dataset. A meta object-group does not only contain visually similar objects, but also includes objects that are likely to co-occur with each other. As the meta object groups are obtained, group-specific dimension reduction is performed to obtain denser representations for efficient retrieval. We evaluate the framework on the NUS-Wide image dataset with approximately 270,000 images represented by BoW features, and demonstrate its advantage over existing method.",

However, most approaches focus on feature extraction from 2D images while ignoring the spatial information of the 3D model. In order to improve the effectiveness of view-based methods on 3D model retrieval, this paper proposes a novel method for characteristic view extraction and similarity measurement. First, the graph clustering method is used for view grouping and the random-walk algorithm is applied to adaptively update the weight of each view. The spatial information of the 3D object is utilized to construct a view-graph model, thus enabling each characteristic view to represent the discriminative visual feature in terms of specific spatial context. Next, by considering the view set as a graph model, the similarity measurement of two models can be converted into a graph matching problem. This problem is solved by mathematically formulating it as a Rayleigh quotient maximization with affinity constraints for similarity measurement. Extensive comparison experiments were conducted on the popular ETH, NTU, PSB, and MV-RED 3D model datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

We here develop the first processing system to identify active fires and retrieve their fire radiative power (FRP) from \\{AHI\\} data, based on the geostationary Fire Thermal Anomaly (FTA) algorithm and \\{FRP\\} retrieval method originally developed for use with Meteosat \\{SEVIRI\\} over Africa and Europe. This scheme detects active fires covering as little as 10\u2212 3 to 10\u2212 4 of an \\{AHI\\} pixel, and we compare performance to the same scheme applied to data from the forerunner geostationary \\{MTSAT\\} imager and the FengYun-2 (FY-2) Stretched Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (S-VISSR), and also to 1 km (at nadir) polar-orbiting \\{MODIS\\} active fire data. We find major benefits of Himawari-8 \\{AHI\\} over both \\{MTSAT\\} and FY-2, being able to detect a substantially greater proportion of fire activity and with little impact from sensor saturation. AHI-derived \\{FRP\\} retrievals of detected fires show a very strong agreement and a low (3 MW) bias with respect to near-simultaneous \\{MODIS\\} retrievals, though fires having \\{FRP\\} \u2264 40 \\{MW\\} are undercounted by \\{AHI\\} due to its 4 \u00d7 larger pixel area (at nadir) than MODIS. Large parts of Asia are characterised by smaller/lower \\{FRP\\} fires associated with e.g. agricultural residue burning, meaning many are at or below this \\{AHI\\} minimum \\{FRP\\} detection limit, and during June 2015 \\{AHI\\} fails to detect around 66% of the hotspots that \\{MODIS\\} detects when both sensors view the same area simultaneously. However, \\{AHI\\} provides 144 observation opportunities per day compared to 4 typical observations from MODIS, and shows a low (8%) active fire detection error of commission. We demonstrate the unique value of the geostationary \\{FRP\\} retrievals made from \\{AHI\\} data for full fire diurnal cycle assessment and for Fire Radiative Energy (FRE) calculations. We conclude that these \\{FRP\\} data demonstrate major benefits for studies of active fires over Asia and Australia, and expect them to become an important component of the global geostationary active fire observation system.",

Since \\{VLAD\\} usually adopts a small-size codebook, the clusters are coarse and residuals not discriminative. To address this problem, this paper proposes to generate a number of residual codebooks descended from the original clusters. After quantizing local descriptors with these codebooks, we pool the resulting secondary residuals as well as the primary ones to obtain the fine residuals. We show that, with two-step aggregation, the fine-residual \\{VLAD\\} has the same dimension as the original.

Hence, it is worthy to try improving and developing new learning algorithms for \\{RBFNNs\\} in order to get better results. This paper presents a new learning method for RBFNNs. An improved algorithm for center adjustment of \\{RBFNNs\\} and a novel algorithm for width determination have been proposed to optimize the efficiency of the Optimum Steepest Decent (OSD) algorithm. To initialize the radial basis function units more accurately, a modified approach based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is presented. The obtained results show fast convergence speed, better and same network response in fewer train data which states the generalization power of the improved neural network. The Improved PSO\u2013OSD and Three-phased PSO\u2013OSD algorithms have been tested on five benchmark problems and the results have been compared. Finally, using the improved radial basis function neural network we propose a new method for object image retrieval. The images to be retrieved are object images that can be divided into foreground and background.

The processing requirements for such large data streams involve processing techniques enabling the spatio-temporally explicit quantification of vegetation properties. Typically retrieval must be accurate, robust and fast. Hence, there is a strict requirement to identify next-generation bio-geophysical variable retrieval algorithms which can be molded into an operational processing chain. This paper offers a review of state-of-the-art retrieval methods for quantitative terrestrial bio-geophysical variable extraction using optical remote sensing imagery. We can categorize these methods into (1) parametric regression, (2) non-parametric regression, (3) physically-based and (4) hybrid methods. Hybrid methods combine generic capabilities of physically-based methods with flexible and computationally efficient methods, typically non-parametric regression methods. A review of the theoretical basis of all these methods is given first and followed by published applications. This paper focusses on: (1) retrievability of bio-geophysical variables, (2) ability to generate multiple outputs, (3) possibilities for model transparency description, (4) mapping speed, and (5) possibilities for uncertainty retrieval. Finally, the prospects of implementing these methods into future processing chains for operational retrieval of vegetation properties are presented and discussed.",

Traditional methods of calculating texture features ignore the texture features caused by chroma differences. A new method of calculating chroma texture features is proposed in this paper. Large numbers of experiments were performed and proved that the chroma texture feature was a very important complement to the traditional luminance texture. The effectiveness of the image retrieval is improved significantly by combination of luminance texture and chroma texture with a lower-dimensional vector.

Methods Fifty \\{RTSA\\} systems, retrieved from 44 patients, with 50 polyethylene (PE) liners, 30 glenospheres, 21 glenoid baseplates, 13 modular humeral metaphases, and 17 humeral stems, were examined for damage modes, including abrasion, burnishing, dishing, embedding, scratching, and pitting. \\{PE\\} liners were also analyzed for delamination and edge deformation. Charts were reviewed for patient, surgical, and functional data. Pre-revision radiographs were analyzed for scapular notching and loosening. Results Average term of implantation was 20\u00a0months (range, 0-81 months). Metallic components exhibited abrasion, burnishing, dishing, pitting, and scratching. \\{PE\\} liners displayed all damage modes. Damage was exhibited on 93% of glenospheres and 100% of \\{PE\\} liners. Of 29 aseptic shoulders, 13 showed evidence of scapular notching and 5 of humeral loosening. There was a moderate correlation between radiographically observed implant failure or dissociation and \\{PE\\} embedding (r\u00a0=\u00a00.496; P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.001). There were weak and moderate correlations between scapular notching severity and \\{PE\\} dishing (r\u00a0=\u00a00.496; P\u00a0=\u00a0.006), embedding (r\u00a0=\u00a00.468; P\u00a0=\u00a0.010), and delamination (r\u00a0=\u00a00.384; P\u00a0=\u00a0.040). Conclusions To date, this is the largest series of retrieved \\{RTSA\\} components and the first to relate damage modes to radiographic and clinical data. Most damage was observed on the \\{PE\\} liners, on both the articular surface and rim, and glenosphere components.

An important research effort has been the automated classification of calling bird species. In this paper we examine a related task, retrieval of birdcalls from a database of audio recordings, similar to a user supplied query call. Such a retrieval task can sometimes be more useful than an automated classifier. We compare three approaches to similarity-based birdcall retrieval using spectral ridge features and two kinds of gradient features, structure tensor and the histogram of oriented gradients. The retrieval accuracy of our spectral ridge method is 94% compared to 82% for the structure tensor method and 90% for the histogram of gradients method.

However, these methods still have some limitations: (1) the methods that define directly texture in color space put more emphasis on color than texture feature; (2) traditional descriptors based on histogram statistics disregard the spatial correlation between structure elements; (3) the descriptors based on structure element correlation (SEC) disregard the occurring probability of structure elements. To solve these problems, we propose a novel image descriptor, called Global Correlation Descriptor (GCD), to extract color and texture feature respectively so that these features have the same effect in CBIR. In addition, we propose Global Correlation Vector (GCV) and Directional Global Correlation Vector (DGCV) which can integrate the advantages of histogram statistics and \\{SEC\\} to characterize color and texture features respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that \\{GCD\\} is more robust and discriminative than other image descriptors in CBIR.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Most image encodings achieve orientation invariance by aligning the patches to their dominant orientations and translation invariance by completely ignoring patch position or by max-pooling. Albeit successful, such choices introduce too much invariance because they do not guarantee that the patches are rotated or translated consistently. In this paper, we propose a geometric-aware aggregation strategy, which jointly encodes the local descriptors together with their patch dominant angle or location. The geometric attributes are encoded in a continuous manner by leveraging explicit feature maps. Our technique is compatible with generic match kernel formulation and can be employed along with several popular encoding methods, in particular Bag-of-Words, \\{VLAD\\} and the Fisher vector. The method is further combined with an efficient monomial embedding to provide a codebook-free method aggregating local descriptors into a single vector representation. Invariance is achieved by efficient similarity estimation of multiple rotations or translations, offered by a simple trigonometric polynomial. This strategy is effective for image search, as shown by experiments performed on standard benchmarks for image and particular object retrieval, namely Holidays and Oxford buildings.",

The characteristics were analyzed based on remote sensing reflectance, and an automatic cluster two-step method was applied for water classification. The inland waters could be clustered into three types, which we labeled water types I, \\{II\\} and III. From water types I to III, the effect of the phytoplankton on the optical characteristics gradually decreased. Four chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms for Case \\{II\\} water, a two-band, three-band, four-band and \\{SCI\\} (Synthetic Chlorophyll Index) algorithm were evaluated for three water types based on the \\{MERIS\\} bands. Different \\{MERIS\\} bands were used for the three water types in each of the four algorithms. The four algorithms had different levels of retrieval accuracy for each water type, and no single algorithm could be successfully applied to all water types. For water types I and III, the three-band algorithm performed the best, while the four-band algorithm had the highest retrieval accuracy for water type II. However, the three-band algorithm is preferable to the two-band algorithm for turbid eutrophic inland waters. The \\{SCI\\} algorithm is recommended for highly turbid water with a higher concentration of total suspended solids.

Based on this private phase key, another interim image is converted to the ciphertext with white noise distribution in the Yang-Gu amplitude-phase retrieval process. In the process of encryption and decryption, the images both in spatial domain and gyrator domain are nonlinear and disorder by using high dimension chaotic system. Moreover, the ciphertext image is only a real-valued function which is more convenient for storing and transmitting, and the security of the proposed encryption scheme is enhanced greatly because of high sensitivity of initial values of Chen system and rotation angle of gyrator transform.

Guided by more recent work that demonstrated both detrimental and beneficial effects of selective memory retrieval in individuals, the present research explored the effects of selective remembering in social groups when access to the encoding context at retrieval was maintained or impaired. In each of three experiments, selective retrieval by the speaker impaired recall of the listener when access to the encoding context was maintained, but it improved recall of the listener when context access was impaired. The results suggest the existence of two faces of selective memory retrieval in social groups, with a detrimental face when the encoding context is still active at retrieval and a beneficial face when it is not. The role of silence in social recall thus seems to be more complex than was indicated in prior work, and mnemonic silences on the part of a speaker can be \u201cgolden\u201d for the memories of a listener under some circumstances, but not be \u201cgolden\u201d under others.",

The retrieved \\{SM\\} from \\{SMAP\\} (referred to here as SMAP_Reg) was compared to: (i) the operational \\{SMAP\\} \\{L3\\} \\{SM\\} (SMAP_SCA), retrieved using the baseline Single Channel retrieval Algorithm (SCA); and (ii) the operational \\{SMOSL3\\} SM, derived from the multiangular inversion of the L-MEB model (L-MEB algorithm) (SMOSL3). This inter-comparison was made against in situ soil moisture measurements from &gt; 400 sites spread over the globe, which are used here as a reference soil moisture dataset. The in situ observations were obtained from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN; https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/) in North of America (PBO_H2O, SCAN, SNOTEL, iRON, and USCRN), in Australia (Oznet), Africa (DAHRA), and in Europe (REMEDHUS, SMOSMANIA, FMI, and RSMN). The agreement was analyzed in terms of four classical statistical criteria: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Bias, Unbiased \\{RMSE\\} (UnbRMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). Results of the comparison of these various products with in situ observations show that the performance of both \\{SMAP\\} products i.e. SMAP_SCA and SMAP_Reg is similar and marginally better to that of the \\{SMOSL3\\} product particularly over the PBO_H2O, SCAN, and \\{USCRN\\} sites. However, \\{SMOSL3\\} \\{SM\\} was closer to the in situ observations over the \\{DAHRA\\} and Oznet sites. We found that the correlation between all three datasets and in situ measurements is best (R &gt; 0.80) over the Oznet sites and worst (R = 0.58) over the \\{SNOTEL\\} sites for SMAP_SCA and over the \\{DAHRA\\} and \\{SMOSMANIA\\} sites (R = 0.51 and R = 0.45 for SMAP_Reg and SMOSL3, respectively). The Bias values showed that all products are generally dry, except over RSMN, DAHRA, and Oznet (and \\{FMI\\} for SMAP_SCA). Finally, our analysis provided interesting insights that can be useful to improve the consistency between \\{SMAP\\} and \\{SMOS\\} datasets.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the digital world, secure data communication has an important role in mass media and Internet technology. With the increase in modern malicious technologies, confidential data are exposed at a greater risk during data communication. For secured communication, recent technologies and the Internet have introduced steganography, a new way to hide data. Steganography is the growing practice of concealing data in multimedia files for secure data transfer. Nowadays, videos are more commonly chosen as cover media than other multimedia files because of the moving sequence of images and audio files. Despite its popularity, video steganography faces a significant challenge, which is a lack of a fast retrieval system of the hidden data. This study proposes a novel video steganography technique in which an enhanced hidden Markov model (EHMM) is employed to improve the speed of retrieving hidden data. \\{EHMM\\} mathematical formulations are used to enhance the speed of embedding and extracting secret data. The data embedding and retrieving operations were performed using the conditional states and the state transition dynamics between the video frames. The proposed \\{EHMM\\} is extensively evaluated using three benchmark functions, and experimental evaluations are conducted to test the speed of data retrieval using differently sized cover-videos. Results indicate that the proposed \\{EHMM\\} yields better results by reducing the data hiding time by 3\u201350%, improving the data retrieval rate by 22\u201377% with a minimum computational cost of 20\u201391%, and improving the security by 4\u201377% compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Formal grammatical theories make extensive use of syntactic relations (e.g. c-command, Reinhart, 1983) in the description of constraints on antecedent-anaphor dependencies. Recent research has motivated a model of processing that exploits a cue-based retrieval mechanism in content-addressable memory (e.g. Lewis, Vasishth, &amp; Van Dyke, 2006) in which item-to-item syntactic relations such as c-command are difficult to use as retrieval cues. As such, the c-command constraints of formal grammars are predicted to be poorly implemented by the retrieval mechanism. We tested whether memory access mechanisms are able to exploit relational information by investigating the processing of bound variable pronouns, a form of anaphoric dependency that imposes a c-command restriction on antecedent-pronoun relations. A quantificational \\{NP\\} (QP, e.g., no janitor) must c-command a pronoun in order to bind it. We contrasted the retrieval of \\{QPs\\} with the retrieval of referential \\{NPs\\} (e.g. the janitor), which can co-refer with a pronoun in the absence of c-command. In three off-line judgment studies and two eye-tracking studies, we show that referential \\{NPs\\} are easily accessed as antecedents, irrespective of whether they c-command the pronoun, but that quantificational \\{NPs\\} are accessed as antecedents only when they c-command the pronoun. These results are unexpected under theories that hold that retrieval exclusively uses a limited set of content features as retrieval cues. Our results suggest either that memory access mechanisms can make use of relational information as a guide for retrieval, or that the set of features that is used to encode syntactic relations in memory must be enriched.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Venus\u05f3 surface emissivity data in the infrared can serve to explore the planet\u05f3s geology. The only global data with high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution and coverage at present is supplied by nightside emission measurements acquired by the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer VIRTIS-M-IR ( 1.0 \u2013 5.1 \u03bc m ) aboard ESA\u05f3s Venus Express. A radiative transfer simulation and a retrieval algorithm can be used to determine surface emissivity in the nightside spectral transparency windows located at 1.02, 1.10, and 1.18 \u03bc m . To obtain satisfactory fits to measured spectra, the retrieval pipeline also determines auxiliary parameters describing cloud properties from a certain spectral range. But spectral information content is limited, and emissivity is difficult to retrieve due to strong interferences from other parameters. Based on a selection of representative synthetic VIRTIS-M-IR spectra in the range 1.0 \u2013 2.3 \u03bc m , this paper investigates emissivity retrieval errors that can be caused by interferences of atmospheric and surface parameters, by measurement noise, and by a priori data, and which retrieval pipeline leads to minimal errors. Retrieval of emissivity from a single spectrum is shown to fail due to extremely large errors, although the fits to the reference spectra are very good. Neglecting geologic activity, it is suggested to apply a multi-spectrum retrieval technique to retrieve emissivity relative to an initial value as a parameter that is common to several measured spectra that cover the same surface bin. Retrieved emissivity maps of targets with limited extension (a few thousand km) are then additively renormalized to remove spatially large scale deviations from the true emissivity map that are due to spatially slowly varying interfering parameters. Corresponding multi-spectrum retrieval errors are estimated by a statistical scaling of the single-spectrum retrieval errors and are listed for 25 measurement repetitions. For the best of the studied retrieval pipelines, temporally varying interfering atmospheric parameters (cloud parameters, minor gas abundances) contribute errors in the order of 3%\u201310% of the true emissivity, depending on the surface window, the reference spectrum, and assuming statistical independence of the parameters. Temporally constant interfering parameters that spatially vary on a scale of 100 km (surface elevation, interfering emissivities) add 9%\u201316%. Measurement noise with a standard deviation of 10 \u2212 4 W / ( m 2 sr \u03bc m ) leads to additional 1%\u20134%. Reasonable modifications of a priori mean values have negligible impacts. Retrieved maps are most reliable at 1.02 \u03bc m . There is an overall tendency for better results for cases with small cloud opacity, high surface elevation, high emissivity, and small observation angle, but this depends on the emissivity window, retrieval pipeline, and measurement repetition number. Calibration, preprocessing, and simulation errors can lead to additional errors. Based on the presented results, a subsequent paper will discuss emissivity data retrieval for a selected surface target.",

We present a graph representation model called Cost Constrained Graph (CCG) for representing scientific workflows with cost constraints. A distance measure is defined for accurate workflow retrieval. The \\{CCGs\\} representing candidate workflows can be ranked by comparing the similarity among them. We also theoretically prove that this measure satisfies all the four properties of distance.

        "abstract": "Abstract Naming and word-retrieval deficits, which are common characteristics of primary progressive aphasia (PPA), differentially affect production across word classes (e.g., nouns, verbs) in some patients. Individuals with the agrammatic variant (PPA-G) often show greater difficulty producing verbs whereas those with the semantic variant (PPA-S) show greater noun deficits and those with logopenic \\{PPA\\} (PPA-L) evince no clear-cut differences in production of the two word classes. To determine the source of these production patterns, the present study examined word-finding pauses as conditioned by lexical variables (i.e., word class, frequency, length) in narrative speech samples of individuals with PPA-S (n=12), PPA-G (n=12), PPA-L (n=11), and cognitively healthy controls (n=12). We also examined the relation between pause distribution and cortical atrophy (i.e., cortical thickness) in nine left hemisphere regions of interest (ROIs) linked to word production. Results showed higher overall pause rates for \\{PPA\\} compared to unimpaired controls; however, greater naming severity was not associated with increased pause rate. Across all groups, more pauses were produced before lower vs. higher frequency words, with no independent effects of word length after controlling for frequency. With regard to word class, the PPA-L group showed a higher rate of pauses prior to production of nouns compared to verbs, consistent with noun-retrieval deficits arising at the lemma level of word production. Those with PPA-G and PPA-S, like controls, produced similar pause rates across word classes; however, lexical simplification (i.e., production of higher-frequency and/or shorter words) was evident in the more-impaired word class: nouns for PPA-S and verbs for PPA-G. These patterns are consistent with conceptual and/or lemma-level impairments for PPA-S, predominantly affecting objects/nouns, and a lemma-level verb-retrieval deficit for PPA-G, with a concomitant impairment in phonological encoding and articulation affecting overall pause rates. The greater tendency to pause before nouns was correlated with atrophy in the left precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule, whereas the greater tendency to pause before less frequent and longer words was associated with atrophy in left precentral and inferior parietal regions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Cognitive control includes processes that facilitate execution of effortful cognitive tasks, including associative memory. Regions implicated in cognitive control during associative memory include the dorsal prefrontal (dPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Here we investigated the relative degrees of network-related interactions originating in the dPFC and dACC during oscillating phases of associative memory: encoding and cued retrieval. Volunteers completed an established object-location associative memory paradigm during fMRI. Psychophysiological interactions modeled modulatory network interactions from the dPFC and dACC during memory encoding and retrieval. Results were evaluated in second level analyses of variance with seed region and memory process as factors. Each seed exerted differentiable modulatory effects during encoding and retrieval. The dACC exhibited greater modulation (than the dPFC) on the fusiform and parahippocampal gyrus during encoding, while the dPFC exhibited greater modulation (than the dACC) on the fusiform, hippocampus, dPFC and basal ganglia. During retrieval, the dPFC exhibited greater modulation (than the dACC) on the parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, superior parietal lobule, and dPFC. The most notable finding was a seed by process interaction indicating that the dACC and the dPFC exerted complementary modulatory control on the hippocampus during each of the associative memory processes. These results provide evidence for differentiable, yet complementary, control-related modulation by the dACC and dPFC, while establishing the primacy of dPFC in exerting network control during both associative memory phases. Our approach and findings are relevant for understanding basic processes in human memory and psychiatric disorders that impact associative memory-related networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The importance of maternal care on offspring development has received considerable attention, although more recently, researchers have begun to focus on the significance of paternal contributions. In the monogamous and bi-parental California mouse, fathers provide high levels of care, and therefore serve as a model system for studying paternal effects on behavior and underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms. Paternal retrievals in this species influence long term changes in brain (expression of arginine vasopressin\u2014AVP) and behavior (aggression and parenting) in adult male offspring. Further, paternal retrievals induce a transient increase in testosterone (T) in male offspring, which is thought to mediate the relationship between paternal retrievals and \\{AVP\\} expression. Although the father\u2013son relationship has been well characterized, few studies have examined father\u2013daughter interactions. In California mice, paternal retrievals increase aggression in female offspring. Although T has been implicated in the regulation of female aggression, it remains unclear whether T may underlie long-term changes in female offspring aggression in response to paternal retrievals. In the current study, we examined the influence of paternal retrievals on T in both male and female offspring. Retrievals were manipulated experimentally by displacement of the pup and trunk blood was collected from retrieved, non-retrieved, and non-manipulated (baseline) pups. We found that fathers expressed similar levels of retrievals towards sons and daughters, and that T levels were elevated in retrieved, as compared to non-retrieved offspring. Similar to what has been previously described in male offspring and replicated here, female offspring that were retrieved had higher T levels than non-retrieved females. Neither females nor males experienced a change in corticosterone levels in response to retrievals suggesting offspring do not mount a stress response to paternal care. Therefore, our data suggest that paternal retrievals may serve similar functions in shaping adult behavior in both male and female offspring via modulation of hormone levels.",

This paper introduces two novel methods as image descriptors. The basis of the proposed methods is built upon scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) algorithm. After extracting image features using SIFT, k-means clustering is applied on feature matrix extracted by SIFT, and then two new kinds of dimensionality reductions are applied to make \\{SIFT\\} features more efficient and realistic for image retrieval problem. Using the proposed strategies we cannot only take the advantage of \\{SIFT\\} features but also we can highly decrease the memory storage used by \\{SIFT\\} features.

Finally, proposed methods are compared with two popular methods namely, color auto-correlogram and wavelet transform. As a result, our proposed retrieval system is fast and accurate and it can efficiently manage large databases.

Application of such artificial intelligence can be used to perform automatic document retrieval and interpretation by a robot through query.

For this purpose, in this paper we propose a system for automatic date field extraction from multi-lingual (English, Devnagari and Bangla scripts) handwritten documents. The date is a key piece of information, which can be used in various robotic applications such as date-wise document indexing/retrieval. In order to design the system, first the script of the document is identified, and based on the identified script, word components of each text line are classified into month and non-month classes using word-level feature extraction and classification. Next, non-month words are segmented into individual components and labelled into one of text, digit, punctuation or contraction categories. Subsequently, the date patterns are searched using the labelled components. Both numeric and semi-numeric regular expressions have been used for date part extraction. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and profile feature-based approaches are used for classification of month/non-month words. Other date components such as numerals and punctuation marks are recognised using a gradient-based feature and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The experiments are performed on English, Devnagari and Bangla document datasets and the encouraging results obtained from the system indicate the effectiveness of the proposed system.",

Due to the super-quadratic computational complexity, canonical forms can only be computed for low-resolution meshes. We suggest a linear time complexity method for computing a canonical form, using Euclidean distances between pairs of a small subset of vertices.

Data gaps and spatial and temporal inconsistencies exist in most of the existing global \\{LAI\\} products derived from single-satellite data because of their limited information content. Furthermore, the accuracy of current \\{LAI\\} products may not meet the requirements of certain applications. Therefore, \\{LAI\\} retrieval from multiple satellite data is becoming popular. An existing \\{LAI\\} inversion scheme using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique is further extended in this study to integrate temporal, spectral, and angular information from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), SPOT/VEGETATION, and Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) data. The recursive update of \\{LAI\\} climatology with the retrieved \\{LAI\\} and the coupling of a canopy radiative-transfer model and a dynamic process model using the EnKF technique can fill in missing data and produce a consistent accurate time-series \\{LAI\\} product. During each iteration, we defined a 5 \u2217 1 sliding window and compared the \\{RMSEs\\} in the selected window to determine the minimum. Validation results at six sites demonstrate that the combination of temporal information from multiple sensors, spectral information provided by red and near-infrared (NIR) bands, and angular information from \\{MISR\\} bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) data can provide a more accurate estimate of \\{LAI\\} than previously available.",

However recent research suggests that memories are often retrieved directly, without effortful search. We investigated whether direct and generative retrieval differed in the characteristics of memories recalled, or only in terms of retrieval latency. Participants recalled autobiographical memories in response to cue words. For each memory, they reported whether it was retrieved directly or generatively, rated its visuo-spatial perspective, and judged its accompanying recollective experience. Our results indicated that direct retrieval was commonly reported and was faster than generative retrieval, replicating recent findings. The characteristics of directly retrieved memories differed from generatively retrieved memories: directly retrieved memories had higher field perspective ratings and lower observer perspective ratings. However, retrieval mode did not influence recollective experience. We discuss our findings in terms of cue generation and content construction, and the implication for reconstructive models of autobiographical memory.",

In this study, the accuracy of AVHRR-derived cloud properties cloud mask, cloud-top height, cloud phase and cloud liquid water path is assessed using three state-of-the-art retrieval schemes. In addition, the same retrieval schemes are applied to the \\{AVHRR\\} heritage channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to create AVHRR-like retrievals with higher spatial resolution and based on presumably more accurate spectral calibration. The cloud property retrievals were collocated and inter-compared with observations from CloudSat, \\{CALIPSO\\} and AMSR-E The resulting comparison exhibited good agreement in general. The schemes provide correct cloud detection in 82 to 90% of all cloudy cases. With correct identification of clear-sky in 61 to 85% of all clear areas, the schemes are slightly biased towards cloudy conditions. The evaluation of the cloud phase classification shows correct identification of liquid clouds in 61 to 97% and a correct identification of ice clouds in 68 to 95%, demonstrating a large variability among the schemes. Cloud-top height (CTH) retrievals were of relatively similar quality with standard deviations ranging from 2.1 km to 2.7 km. Significant negative biases in these retrievals are found in particular for cirrus clouds. The biases decrease if optical depth thresholds are applied to determine the reference \\{CTH\\} measure. Cloud liquid water path (LWP) is also retrieved well with relative low standard deviations (20 to 28 g/m2), negative bias and high correlations. Cloud ice water path (IWP) retrievals of \\{AVHRR\\} and \\{MODIS\\} exhibit a relative high uncertainty with standard deviations between 800 and 1400 g/m2, which in relative terms exceed 100% when normalized with the mean IWP. However, the global histogram distributions of \\{IWP\\} were similar to the reference dataset. \\{MODIS\\} retrievals are for most comparisons of slightly better quality than AVHRR-based retrievals. Additionally, the choice of different near-infrared channels, 3.7 \u03bcm as opposed to 1.6 \u03bcm, can have a significant impact on the retrieval quality, most pronounced for IWP, with better accuracy for the 1.6 \u03bcm channel setup. This study presents a novel assessment of the quality of cloud properties derived from \\{AVHRR\\} channels, which quantifies the accuracy of the considered retrievals based on common approaches and validation data. Furthermore, it assesses the capabilities of AVHRR-like spectral information for retrieving cloud properties in the light of generating climate data records of cloud properties from three decades of \\{AVHRR\\} measurements.",

Up to date no \\{TMS\\} studies have been carried out in order to investigate the effect of personal memories with negative emotional value on corticospinal excitability.

Furthermore, we investigated whether \\{TMS\\} responses during retrieval of negative \\{AM\\} are associated with specific personality traits. Twelve healthy subjects were asked to recall either a negative or a neutral \\{AM\\} across two different days in a randomized order. During this memory retrieval, the following \\{TMS\\} parameters were recorded: MEPs; Short- interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and Intracortical facilitation (ICF); Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) and Long- latency afferent inhibition (LAI). Personality traits were assessed by using the Big Five scale. Statistical analysis was performed using factorial \\{ANOVAs\\} and multiple linear regression models. When compared to retrieval of neutral AM, recollection of negative \\{AM\\} induced a larger increase in \\{MEP\\} amplitude, an increase in ICF, and a decrease in SAI. The neuroticism personality trait was a significant predictor of the \\{MEP\\} amplitude increase during retrieval of negative AM. Altogether these results indicate that cortical excitability and sensorimotor integration are selectively modulated by the valence of AM.

Thus, many techniques and approaches for \\{CBIR\\} were developed in literature. The \\{CBIR\\} approach works on the visual features of the image rather than a descriptive text. Therefore, it provides more effective and efficient retrieval.

This article introduces a technique for content-based image classification and retrieval using PCNN. The proposed technique uses an optimized Pulse-Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) to extract the visual features of the image in a form of a numeric vector called image signature. An optimization mechanism was applied to the \\{PCNN\\} parameters in order to improve the signature quality. Thus improving the classification and retrieval results. Additionally, it employs the K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm for classification and matching. By applying classification before retrieval, the number of images in the search space is optimized to include one category instead of multiple categories. Moreover, we developed a \\{CBIR\\} prototype to validate our technique. The results show that our technique can retrieve and classify images efficiently. Furthermore, we evaluated our prototype against one of the widely used techniques and it was proven that the proposed technique can enhance the search results and improve the accuracy by 3.5%.",

Firstly, different visual features, including 2D Zernike moments, 2D Fourier descriptor and 2D Krawtchouk moments, are extracted to describe each view of a 3D object. Then the Hausdorff distance is computed to measure the similarity between two 3D objects with multiple views. Finally we construct multiple graphs based on different features and learn the optimized weights of each graph automatically for feature fusion task.

        "abstract": "AbstractObjective In medical information retrieval research, semantic resources have been mostly used by expanding the original query terms or estimating the concept importance weight. However, implicit term-dependency information contained in semantic concept terms has been overlooked or at least underused in most previous studies. In this study, we incorporate a semantic concept-based term-dependence feature into a formal retrieval model to improve its ranking performance. Design Standardized medical concept terms used by medical professionals were assumed to have implicit dependency within the same concept. We hypothesized that, by elaborately revising the ranking algorithms to favor documents that preserve those implicit dependencies, the ranking performance could be improved. The implicit dependence features are harvested from the original query using MetaMap. These semantic concept-based dependence features were incorporated into a semantic concept-enriched dependence model (SCDM). We designed four different variants of the model, with each variant having distinct characteristics in the feature formulation method. Measurements We performed leave-one-out cross validations on both a clinical document corpus (TREC Medical records track) and a medical literature corpus (OHSUMED), which are representative test collections in medical information retrieval research. Results Our semantic concept-enriched dependence model consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art retrieval methods. Analysis shows that the performance gain has occurred independently of the concept\u2019s explicit importance in the query. Conclusion By capturing implicit knowledge with regard to the query term relationships and incorporating them into a ranking model, we could build a more robust and effective retrieval model, independent of the concept importance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recently, the bag-of-features (BoF) representation has attracted substantial interest in large scale image retrieval. In BoF representation, images are treated as collections of local invariant descriptors. A visual codebook is constructed by quantizing the local descriptors into clusters, whose centers are called codewords. Then each image could be represented by the frequency histogram over the codebook, and existing text retrieval techniques such as inverted indexing could be applied to image retrieval. It has been recognized that the quality of the codebook is critical to the performance of BoF-based image retrieval systems, and codeword selection is therefore a fundamental problem. Many of the existing approaches for codeword selection make use of the label information of the images. However, collecting the labels of a large amount of images is very expensive. In this paper, we investigate the problem of codeword selection in the absence of labels. Inspired from the techniques of statistical design, we propose two novel unsupervised learning algorithms to select the codewords for an image retrieval system. Specifically, we assume that the relationship between the relevance score and the BoF representation of an image could be expressed by a linear regression model, and select the codewords which can improve the regression model the most. In other words, if the selected codewords are used to train the regression model, the expected prediction error can be minimized. Extensive experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methods.",

In this paper we (1) present a methodology for a self-consistent simultaneous retrieval of temperature/pressure, Tk(p), and \\{CO2\\} volume mixing ratio (VMR) from the broadband infrared limb measurements in the 15 and 4.3 \u03bc m channels, and (2) qualitatively describe the first results on the \\{CO2\\} \\{VMR\\} and Tk obtained from application of this technique to the \\{SABER\\} 15 and 4.3 \u03bc m channels, including issues, which demand additional constraints to be applied. The self-consistent two-channel retrieval architecture updates parameters at all altitudes simultaneously, and it is built upon iterative switching between two retrieval modules, one for \\{CO2\\} and one for Tk. A detailed study of sensitivity, stability and convergence was carried out to validate the algorithm. The Tk/CO2 \\{VMR\\} distribution can be reliably retrieved without biases connected with this non-linear inverse problem starting with an initial guess as far as \u00b120% of \\{CO2\\} \\{VMR\\} and \u00b115 K from the solution (as global shift, or somewhat larger if only local deviations are considered). In polar summer toward high latitudes the retrieved \\{CO2\\} \\{VMR\\} profile shows a local peak around 90 km. We discuss details of this feature and show that: (a) it is not an algorithm artifact or instability, (b) additional a priori constraints are needed in order to obtain a physical profile and to remove this peak, and (c) several possibilities are explored as to uncover the real cause of this feature, but no firm conclusion can be reached at this time. This algorithm has been applied to all available daytime \\{SABER\\} measurements since 2002, and the first results of the mean \\{CO2\\} \\{VMR\\} profiles and their distribution is discussed. In particular, the \\{CO2\\} \\{VMR\\} profiles depart from a well mixed value at altitudes of 65\u201370 km during equinoxes at high and mid-latitudes, but in the summer hemisphere solstice period the \\{SABER\\} data is more consistent with a well mixed \\{VMR\\} conditions extend up to 87\u201390 km especially toward high latitudes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The land parameter retrieval model (LPRM) is a methodology that retrieves soil moisture from low frequency dual polarized microwave measurements and has been extensively tested on C-, X- and Ku-band frequencies. Its performance on L-band is tested here by using observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite. These observations have potential advantages compared to higher frequencies: a low sensitivity to cloud and vegetation contamination, an increased thermal sampling depth and a greater sensitivity to soil moisture fluctuations. These features make it desirable to add SMOS-derived soil moisture retrievals to the existing European Space Agency (ESA) long-term climatological soil moisture data record, to be harmonized with other passive microwave soil moisture estimates from the LPRM. For multi-channel observations, \\{LPRM\\} infers the effective soil temperature (Teff) from higher frequency channels. This is not possible for a single channel mission like \\{SMOS\\} and therefore two alternative sources for Teff were tested: (1) MERRA-Land and (2) \\{ECMWF\\} numerical weather prediction systems, respectively. \\{SMOS\\} measures brightness temperature at a range of incidence angles, different incidence angle bins (45\u00b0, 52.5\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) were tested for both ascending and descending swaths. Three \\{LPRM\\} algorithm parameters were optimized to match remotely sensed soil moisture with ground based observations: the single scattering albedo, roughness and polarization mixing factor. The soil moisture retrievals were optimized and evaluated against ground-based data from the Murrumbidgee Soil Moisture Monitoring Network (OzNet) in southeast Australia. The agreement with single-angle \\{SMOS\\} \\{LPRM\\} retrievals was close to the official \\{SMOS\\} \\{L3\\} product, provided the three parameters were optimized for the OzNet dataset, with linear correlation of 0.70\u20130.75 (0.75\u20130.77 for \\{SMOS\\} L3), root-mean-square error of 0.069\u20130.085 m3 m\u2212 3 (0.084\u20130.106 m3 m\u2212 3 for \\{SMOS\\} L3) and small bias of \u2212 0.02\u20130.01 m3 m\u2212 3 (0.03\u20130.06 m3 m\u2212 3 for \\{SMOS\\} L3).

        "abstract": "Abstract The striatum has been associated with successful memory retrieval but the precise functional link still remains unclear. One hypothesis is that striatal activity reflects an active evaluation process of the retrieval outcome dependent on the current behavioral goals rather than being a consequence of memory reactivation. We have recently shown that the striatum also correlates with confidence in memory recognition, which could reflect high subjective value ascribed to high certainty decisions. To examine whether striatal activity during memory recognition reflects subjective value indeed, we conducted an fMRI study using a recognition memory paradigm in which the participants rated not only the recognition confidence but also indicated the pleasantness associated with the previous memory retrieval. The results demonstrated a high positive correlation between confidence and pleasantness both on the behavioral and brain activation level particularly in the striatum. As almost all of variance in the striatal confidence signal could be explained by experienced pleasantness, this part of the striatal memory recognition response probably corresponds to greater subjective value of high confidence responses. While perceived oldness was also strongly correlated with striatal activity, this activation pattern was clearly distinct from that associated with confidence and pleasantness and thus could not be explained by higher subjective value to detect \u201cold\u201d items. Together, these results show that at least two independent processes contribute to striatal activation in recognition memory: a more flexible evaluation response dependent on context and goals captured by memory confidence and a potentially retrieval-related response captured by perceived oldness.",

In this paper, we proposed a geometric reasoning approach to generate hierarchy for B-rep model retrieval. We extracted the winged-edge data structure to support series algorithms for underlying geometric reasoning, which is mainly composed of 3 steps to build hierarchy: partitioning, assembling and simplifying. This hierarchical representation is featured with level of detail ( L O D ) retaining geometric and topological information which is proved to be efficient in both global and partial retrieval. Our approach is based on the standard for the exchange of product information ( S T E P ) , which is suitable for data exchange between heterogeneous \\{CAD\\} systems.

        "abstract": "Abstract The standard model of memory system consolidation supports the temporal reorganization of brain circuits underlying long-term memory storage, including interactions between the dorsal hippocampus and extra-hippocampal structures. In addition, several brain regions have been suggested to be involved in the retrieval of spatial memory. In particular, several authors reported a possible role of the ventral portion of the hippocampus together with the thalamus or the striatum in the persistence of this type of memory. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the contribution of different cortical and subcortical brain regions, and neural networks involved in spatial memory retrieval. For this purpose, we used cytochrome c oxidase quantitative histochemistry as a reliable method to measure brain oxidative metabolism. Animals were trained in a hidden platform task and tested for memory retention immediately after the last training session; one week after completing the task, they were also tested in a memory retrieval probe. Results showed that retrieval of the previously learned task was associated with increased levels of oxidative metabolism in the prefrontal cortex, the dorsal and ventral striatum, the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus and the dentate gyrus of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. The analysis of functional interactions between brain regions suggest that the dorsal and ventral dentate gyrus could be involved in spatial memory retrieval. In addition, the results highlight the key role of the extended hippocampal system, thalamus and striatum in this process. Our study agrees with previous ones reporting interactions between the dorsal hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex during spatial memory retrieval. Furthermore, novel activation patterns of brain networks involving the aforementioned regions were found. These functional brain networks could underlie spatial memory retrieval evaluated in the Morris water maze task.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Satellite data are increasingly used to provide observation-based estimates of the effects of aerosols on climate. The Aerosol-cci project, part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (CCI), was designed to provide essential climate variables for aerosols from satellite data. Eight algorithms, developed for the retrieval of aerosol properties using data from \\{AATSR\\} (4), \\{MERIS\\} (3) and POLDER, were evaluated to determine their suitability for climate studies. The primary result from each of these algorithms is the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at several wavelengths, together with the \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m exponent (AE) which describes the spectral variation of the \\{AOD\\} for a given wavelength pair. Other aerosol parameters which are possibly retrieved from satellite observations are not considered in this paper. The \\{AOD\\} and \\{AE\\} (AE only for Level 2) were evaluated against independent collocated observations from the ground-based \\{AERONET\\} sun photometer network and against \u201creference\u201d satellite data provided by \\{MODIS\\} and MISR. Tools used for the evaluation were developed for daily products as produced by the retrieval with a spatial resolution of 10 \u00d7 10 km2 (Level 2) and daily or monthly aggregates (Level 3). These tools include statistics for \\{L2\\} and \\{L3\\} products compared with AERONET, as well as scoring based on spatial and temporal correlations. In this paper we describe their use in a round robin (RR) evaluation of four months of data, one month for each season in 2008. The amount of data was restricted to only four months because of the large effort made to improve the algorithms, and to evaluate the improvement and current status, before larger data sets will be processed. Evaluation criteria are discussed. Results presented show the current status of the European aerosol algorithms in comparison to both \\{AERONET\\} and \\{MODIS\\} and \\{MISR\\} data. The comparison leads to a preliminary conclusion that the scores are similar, including those for the references, but the coverage of \\{AATSR\\} needs to be enhanced and further improvements are possible for most algorithms. None of the algorithms, including the references, outperforms all others everywhere. \\{AATSR\\} data can be used for the retrieval of \\{AOD\\} and \\{AE\\} over land and ocean. \\{PARASOL\\} and one of the \\{MERIS\\} algorithms have been evaluated over ocean only and both algorithms provide good results.",

To answer the questions, the proposed method leverages the local context of the conversation along with semantic resources, either WordNet or word embeddings from word2vec. The method first represents the local context by extracting keywords from the transcript of the conversation, which is obtained from a real-time Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system and may contain noise. It then expands the queries with keywords that best represent the topic of the query, i.e. expansion keywords accompanied by weights indicating their topical similarity to the query. Finally, semantically related terms are added, using two options: either synonymous terms drawn from WordNet or similar words based on distributed representations in a low-dimensional word embedding space learned using word2vec. To evaluate the system, we introduce a dataset (named \\{AREX\\} for \\{AMI\\} Requests for Explanations) and an evaluation metric based on relevance judgments collected by crowdsourcing.

Through corresponding changes in re-encoding, the retrieval effect of cortisol might translate into a persistent change of the retrieved memory. We tested whether partial suppression of morning cortisol synthesis by metyrapone, leading to intermediate, circadian nadir-like levels with presumed predominant \\{MR\\} activation, improves retrieval, particularly of emotional memory, and persistently changes the memory. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject cross-over design, 18 men were orally administered metyrapone (1 g) vs. placebo at 4:00 \\{AM\\} to suppress the morning cortisol rise. Retrieval of emotional and neutral texts and pictures (learned 3 days earlier) was assessed 4 h after substance administration and a second time one week later. Metyrapone suppressed endogenous cortisol release to circadian nadir-equivalent levels at the time of retrieval testing. Contrary to our expectations, metyrapone significantly impaired free recall of emotional texts (p &lt; .05), whereas retrieval of neutral texts or pictures remained unaffected. One week later, participants still showed lower memory for emotional texts in the metyrapone than placebo condition (p &lt; .05).

However, few research works have been conducted in image retrieval. Existing \\{QDE\\} methods in image retrieval mainly explore the statistical characteristics (coherence, specificity, etc.) of the returned images to derive a value for indicating the query difficulty degree. To the best of our knowledge, little research has been done to directly estimate the real search performance, such as average precision. In this paper, we propose a novel query difficulty estimation approach which automatically estimates the average precision of the image search results. Specifically, we first adaptively select a set of query relevant and query irrelevant images for each query via modified pseudo relevance feedback. Then a simple but effective voting scheme and two estimation methods (hard estimation and soft estimation) are proposed to estimate the relevance probability of each image in the search results. Based on the images\u05f3 relevance probabilities, the average precision for each query is derived. The experimental results on two benchmark image search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

In this paper, we propose a Markov random field (MRF) based probabilistic retrieval framework.

Then, the prior and the likelihood are combined to improve retrieval performance. Further, we present an approximate belief propagation algorithm as well as a subgraph extraction algorithm for efficient inference in MRF. Finally, we design a new image retrieval system under our framework. This system can be considered as an extended bag-of-visual-words retrieval system with the probabilistic based re-ranking module. We evaluate our method on three standard datasets: Oxford-5K, Oxford-105K and Paris-6K.

In the proposed combination, the \\{MST\\} is used to seek the initial location of the target candidate model and then \\{IEML\\} is used to adaptively change the location and scale of the target candidate model to include the relevant region and exclude the irrelevant region as far as possible. In order to improve the performance and effectiveness using \\{IEML\\} to track the target candidate model, a new similarity measure is built based on spatial and colour features and a new image retrieval framework for this new environment is proposed. Extensive experiments confirm that compared with the latest developed approaches, such as the generalized Hough transform (GHT) and EM-like tracking methods, our method can provide a much better performance in effectiveness. On the other hand, for the IEML, the new similarity measure model also substantially decreases computational complexity and improves the precision tracking of the target candidate model. Compared with the conventional ROI-based image retrieval methods, the most significant highlight is that the proposed method can directly find the target candidate model in the candidate image without pre-segmentation in advance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It has been suggested that retrieving episodic information can involve adopting a cognitive state or set: retrieval mode. In a series of studies, an event-related potential (ERP) index of retrieval mode has been identified in designs which cue participants on a trial-by-trial basis to switch between preparing for and then completing an episodic or non-episodic retrieval task. However, a confound in these studies is that along with task type the content of what is to be retrieved has varied. Here we examined whether the \\{ERP\\} index of retrieval mode remains when the contents of an episodic and non-episodic task are highly similar \u2013 both requiring a location judgement. In the episodic task participants indicated the screen location where words had been shown in a prior study phase (left/right/new); whereas in the perceptual task they indicated the current screen location of the word (top/middle/bottom). Consistent with previous studies the \\{ERPs\\} elicited while participants prepared for episodic retrieval were more positive-going at right-frontal sites than when they prepared for the perceptual task. This index was observed, however, on the first trial after participants had switched tasks, rather than on the second trial, as has been observed previously. Potential reasons for this are discussed, including the critical manipulation of similarity in contents between tasks, as well as the use of a predictable cue sequence.",

A commonly stated metric of quality for \\{SST\\} daytime retrievals is 0.5 \u00b0C; thus dust contents that produce errors greater than this value should be of concern. Here we report on significant correlation between potential \\{SST\\} error and observed aerosol optical depths (AOD) that was found in the tropical region dominated by Saharan dust. Utilizing a radiative transfer model with variable dust contents and typical vertical distributions, errors greater than the desired 0.5 \u00b0C accuracy are observed for dust \\{AODs\\} as low as 0.05. Errors of over 1 \u00b0C occur with 0.25 AOD.

To promote this research area, two Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) tracks on large scale comprehensive and sketch-based 3D model retrieval have been organized by us in 2014. Both tracks were based on a unified large-scale benchmark that supports multimodal queries (3D models and sketches). This benchmark contains 13680 sketches and 8987 3D models, divided into 171 distinct classes. It was compiled to be a superset of existing benchmarks and presents a new challenge to retrieval methods as it comprises generic models as well as domain-specific model types. Twelve and six distinct 3D shape retrieval methods have competed with each other in these two contests, respectively. To measure and compare the performance of the participating and other promising Query-by-Model or Query-by-Sketch 3D shape retrieval methods and to solicit state-of-the-art approaches, we perform a more comprehensive comparison of twenty-six (eighteen originally participating algorithms and eight additional state-of-the-art or new) retrieval methods by evaluating them on the common benchmark.

A large number of patches collected from shapes in a dataset are encoded into patch words by virtue of locality-constrained sparse coding under the consideration of local smooth sparsity.

In our Corr-RBM, two \\{RBMs\\} built for image and text, respectively are connected at their individual hidden representation layers by a correlation loss function. A single objective function is constructed to trade off the correlation loss and likelihoods of both modalities. Through the optimization of this objective function, our Corr-RBM is able to capture the correlations between two modalities and learn the representation of each modality simultaneously. Furthermore, we construct two deep neural structures using Corr-RBM as the main building block for the task of cross-modal retrieval.

        "abstract": "Abstract Intelligent image retrieval is a challenging technology in multimedia applications where bridging the gap between user\u05f3s expectation and low level features is typically hard for computing systems. In the proposed approach, a unique method is projected which integrates support vector machine based learning with an evolutionary stochastic algorithm, called firefly algorithm as a relevance feedback approach into a region based image retrieval system. This system overcomes the semantic gap through optimized iterative learning and also provides a better exploration of solution space. Support vector machine learning automatically updates the weights of preferences for relevant images based on the both relevant and irrelevant feedback images. The firefly optimizer guides the swarm agents to move towards the cluster of relevant images in the exploration of the search space based on user\u05f3s feedback. This research study has a focused approach to increase the performance by optimizing region feature with the firefly algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed approach is experimented on the standard subset of Corel, Caltech and Pascal database images. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with other existing retrieval methods like particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm, support vector machine and query point movement to identify the excellence with regard to the model in terms of precision and recall.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In this chapter, we review and interpret research on multidimensional source memory paradigms. We focus in particular on research in which two source dimensions (e.g., color and location of a word stimulus), or features, or context attributes, are encoded and subsequently retrieved. We cover some of the basic empirical outcomes of interest, notably the finding of stochastic dependence among retrieval of source dimensions. Such dependence implies that retrieval of one source dimension is related to the retrievability of the other source dimension. Many research papers have established that stochastic dependence is supported by encoding factors that help bind items to context, and perhaps even context to context. Yet the finding of, and degree of, stochastic dependence at retrieval does not always relate predictably to other manipulations, such as when people are focused on one or the other source dimension in an encoding phase. Moreover, other theoretical proposals target retrieval processes, apart from encoding processes, as producing such dependence. Research that has included retrieval manipulations, such as external cuing of source dimensions at test, suggests that retrieval-specific causes of stochastic dependence have not been established. We also discuss other paradigms that are relevant to the retrieval of multiple object features and whether their retrieval is dependent or independent of one another. Mixed evidence results from this work, with some arguing for relative independence of object features, but others arguing for strong associative relationships among elements that predict somewhat all-or-none retrieval of items and their contexts or features (i.e., dependence). We attempt to integrate these various research paradigms and draw some broad, albeit tentative, conclusions about this collective work. We also suggest areas of research that should be considered as future work in multidimensional source memory.",

        "abstract": "Summary Soil moisture plays a key role in most environmental processes, as evaporation and transpiration are heavily dependent on soil moisture variability. While it is one of the few important hydrological variables that can be directly observed, the high spatial and temporal variability makes it difficult to measure globally or even regionally. Reliance is therefore placed on land surface models to predict the evolution of soil moisture using low-resolution soil property information or typical values. But to make predictions with the required accuracy, more reliable and detailed soil parameter data are required than those currently available. This paper demonstrates the ability to retrieve soil hydraulic parameters from near-surface measurements, using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) observations disaggregated to 1 km resolution for a demonstration area the size of a single \\{SMOS\\} footprint. The disaggregated soil moisture product was first assessed against in-situ soil moisture observations, before testing the retrieval methodology using the disaggregated soil moisture data for individual soil columns co-located with three long-term monitoring sites in the Murrumbidgee Catchment. The retrieval methodology was then applied to the entire 40 km \u00d7 40 km demonstration area at 5 km spatial resolution. The results suggest that spatially variable soil hydraulic properties exist in the study area, while published soil texture maps show only a single soil type, meaning that a single set of soil hydraulic parameters would normally be used in soil moisture prediction models for this region. Use of a single set of soil hydraulic parameters, rather than the spatially variables ones, was estimated to have an approximate 0.06 m3/m3 impact on the soil moisture prediction.",

It first retrieves the phase line integral from the DPC-CT projections.

        "abstract": "Abstract The demand for container terminal yards is growing significantly faster than the supply of available land; therefore, containers are typically stacked high to better utilize the land space in container yards. However, in the process of container retrieval, non-productive reshuffling may be required to relocate the containers that are stacked on top of the target container. Container retrieval is directly related to the operational efficiency of terminals. Because the industry has become increasingly competitive, it has become critical to introduce a systematic approach to retrieving containers. In this study, we develop a heuristic that can generate feasible working plans for rail-mounted gantry cranes (RMGC) in container yards to minimize the number of container movements while taking the \\{RMGC\\} working time into consideration. The methodology takes into consideration the case that containers are grouped in terms of their retrieval order. Multi-lift \\{RMGC\\} models also are studied. Comprehensive numerical experiments reveal that the method runs faster than other methods published in the literature by several orders of magnitude; additionally, our method is able to solve instances larger than practical use. The number of movements approaches a theoretical lower bound, and the numerical results clearly demonstrate the tradeoff between the number of movements and the working time, and provide useful insights for yard planning.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Neuroinflammation is implicated in impairments in neuronal function and cognition that arise with aging, trauma, and/or disease. Therefore, understanding the underlying basis of the effect of immune system activation on neural function could lead to therapies for treating cognitive decline. Although neuroinflammation is widely thought to preferentially impair hippocampus-dependent memory, data on the effects of cytokines on cognition are mixed. One possible explanation for these inconsistent results is that cytokines may disrupt specific neural processes underlying some forms of memory but not others. In an earlier study, we tested the effect of systemic administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on retrieval of hippocampus-dependent context memory and neural circuit function in \\{CA3\\} and \\{CA1\\} (Czerniawski and Guzowski, 2014). Paralleling impairment in context discrimination memory, we observed changes in neural circuit function consistent with disrupted pattern separation function. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that acute neuroinflammation selectively disrupts memory retrieval in tasks requiring hippocampal pattern separation processes. Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats given \\{LPS\\} systemically prior to testing exhibited intact performance in tasks that do not require hippocampal pattern separation processes: novel object recognition and spatial memory in the water maze. By contrast, memory retrieval in a task thought to require hippocampal pattern separation, context\u2013object discrimination, was strongly impaired in LPS-treated rats in the absence of any gross effects on exploratory activity or motivation. These data show that \\{LPS\\} administration does not impair memory retrieval in all hippocampus-dependent tasks, and support the hypothesis that acute neuroinflammation impairs context discrimination memory via disruption of pattern separation processes in hippocampus.",

The \\{SMAP\\} sensor, based on a large mesh reflector 6 m in diameter providing a conically scanning antenna beam with a surface incidence angle of 40\u00b0, was launched in January of 2015. Over the last decade, an intense scientific activity has focused on the development of the \\{SM\\} retrieval algorithms for the two missions. This activity has relied on many field (mainly tower-based) and airborne experimental campaigns, and since 2010\u20132011, on the \\{SMOS\\} and Aquarius space-borne L-band observations. It has relied too on the use of numerical, physical and semi-empirical models to simulate the microwave brightness temperature of natural scenes for a variety of scenarios in terms of system configurations (polarization, incidence angle) and soil, vegetation and climate conditions. Key components of the inversion models have been evaluated and new parameterizations of the effects of the surface temperature, soil roughness, soil permittivity, and vegetation extinction and scattering have been developed. Among others, global maps of select radiative transfer parameters have been estimated very recently.

Two days later, they were either asked to recall the objects, given a subtle reminder, or were not reminded of the first learning session. Then, participants learned a second list of objects or performed a distractor task. After another two days, retention of List 1 was tested. Although retrieval enhanced List 1 memory, learning a second list impaired memory in all conditions. This shows that testing did not protect memory from RI. While a subtle reminder before List 2 learning caused List 2 items to later intrude into List 1 recall, very few such intrusions were observed in the testing and the no reminder conditions.

        "abstract": "Abstract Indexing methods have been widely used for fast data retrieval on large scale datasets. When the data are represented by high dimensional vectors, hashing is often used as an efficient solution for approximate similarity search. When a retrieval task does not involve supervised training data, most hashing methods aim at preserving data similarity defined by a distance metric on the feature vectors. Hash codes generated by these approaches normally maintain the Hamming distance of the data in accordance with the similarity function, but ignore the local details of the distribution of data. This objective is not suitable for k-nearest neighbor search since the similarity to the nearest neighbors can vary significantly for different data samples. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive similarity measure which is consistent with k-nearest neighbor search, and prove that it leads to a valid kernel if the original similarity function is a kernel function. Next we propose a method which calculates hash codes using the kernel function. With a low-rank approximation, our hashing framework is more effective than existing methods that preserve similarity over an arbitrary kernel. The proposed similarity function, hashing framework, and their combination demonstrate significant improvement when compared with several alternative state-of-the-art methods.",

Here, we approach this question by investigating the nature of trial-by-trial dynamics of selective \\{LTM\\} retrieval, i.e., in how far retrieval in one trial has detrimental or facilitatory effects on selective retrieval in the following trial. Participants first learned associations between retrieval cues and targets, with one cue always being linked to three targets, forming small associative networks. In successive trials, participants had to access either the same or a different target belonging to either the same or a different cue. We found that retrieval times were faster for targets that had already been relevant in the previous trial, with this facilitatory effect being substantially weaker when the associative network changed in which the targets were embedded. Moreover, staying within the same network still had a facilitatory effect even if the target changed, which became evident in a relatively higher memory performance in comparison to a network change. Furthermore, event-related brain potentials (ERPs) showed topographically and temporally dissociable correlates of these effects, suggesting that they result from combined influences of distinct processes that aid memory retrieval when relevant and irrelevant targets change their status from trial to trial. Taken together, the present study provides insight into the different processing stages of memory retrieval when fast switches between retrieval targets are required.",

However, the application is limited to global- and regional-scale studies, which may not be applicable for urban areas due to its low spatial resolution. To overcome the limitation, this paper proposed an improved aerosol retrieval algorithm for Landsat images (ImAero-Landsat) at spatial resolution of 30 m. This ImAero-Landsat algorithm has been improved in the following two aspects: (i) it does not require a comprehensive look up table and thus it is more efficient in \\{AOT\\} retrieval; and (ii) it can be operated in both bright and dark surfaces.

Neural activity and connectivity during retrieval of titles associated with positive and negative images were compared with age (treated as a continuous variable) included as a regressor of interest. Aging was associated with increased prefrontal activation for retrieval of positive and negative memories, but this pattern was more widespread for negative memories. Aging also was associated with greater negative connectivity between a left hippocampal seed region and multiple regions of prefrontal cortex, but this effect of age occurred during negative retrieval only. These findings demonstrate that age-related changes in prefrontal recruitment and connectivity during retrieval depend on memory valence.

The abnormalities in \\{DNA\\} methylation can occur in various types of cancer and some genetic diseases. The measurement of \\{DNA\\} methylation is therefore important and there is a range of methodologies used to detect \\{DNA\\} methylation. Many methods based on bisulfite treatment appeared with a lack of specificity after recent discoveries of various modifications of methylated cytosine, however there are new treatments developed to overcome this limitation. Immunofluorescence is currently known to be able to specifically detect \\{DNA\\} methylation as it uses different antibodies against 5meC and its derivatives, but it is a semi-quantitative method. Immunofluorescence protocols commonly include fixation of cells followed by permeabilisation, antigen retrieval, and treatments with antibodies.

With the wide popularity of somatosensory equipment (Kinect for example), more and more dynamic 3D depth data are shared on the Internet, which results in an urgent need to retrieve these data efficiently and effectively. In this paper, we propose a generalized strategy for dynamic 3D depth data matching and apply this strategy in action retrieval task. Firstly, an improved 3D shape context descriptor (3DSCD) is proposed to extract features of each static depth frame. Then we employ dynamic time warping (DTW) to measure the temporal similarity between two 3D dynamic depth sequences. Experimental results on our collected dataset consisting of 170 dynamic 3D depth video clips show that the proposed 3DSCD has a rich descriptive power on depth data and that the method using 3DSCD and \\{DTW\\} achieves high matching accuracy. Finally, to address the matching efficiency problem, we utilize the bag of word (BoW) model to quantize the 3DSCD of each static depth frame into visual word packages. So the original feature matching problem is simplified into a two-histogram matching problem. The results demonstrate the matching efficiency of our proposed method, while still maintaining high matching accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The accuracy of snow depth retrieval by remote sensing depends heavily on the characteristics of the snow, and both passive microwave and visible/infrared sensors can contribute to the acquisition of this information. A method integrating these two remotely sensed data sets is presented in this study. Snow depth retrieval is performed using microwave brightness temperature at 19 and 37 \\{GHz\\} from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Image/Sounder (SSMI/S), and visible/infrared surface reflectance from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroadiometer (MODIS) products. Microwave brightness temperature provides information about the volume of snow pack, and visible/infrared surface reflectance can indicate snow presence and surface grain size. With these two remote sensing data sets, snow depth is retrieved by a nonlinear data mining technique, the modified sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm for support vector machine (SVM) regression. The proposed method is tested by using 16,329 records of dry snow measured at 54 meteorological stations in Xinjiang, China over an area of 1.6 million km2 from 2000 to 2009. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative \\{RMSE\\} and the correlation coefficient of our method are 6.21 cm, 0.64 and 0.87, respectively. These results are better than those obtained using only brightness temperature data (8.80 cm, 0.90 and 0.73), the traditional spectral polarization difference (SPD) algorithm (15.07 cm, 1.54 and 0.58), a modified Chang algorithm in \\{WESTDC\\} (9.80 cm, 1.00 and 0.62), or the multilayer perceptron classifier of artificial neural networks (ANN) (9.23 cm, 0.94 and 0.72). The daily snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieved by this method has an \\{RMSE\\} of 8.05 mm and a correlation of 0.84, which are better than those of \\{NASA\\} \\{NSIDC\\} (32.87 mm and 0.47) or Globsnow (19.07 mm and 0.59).

        "abstract": "Abstract Assimilation of hyperspectral sounder data into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models has proven vital to generating accurate model analyses of tropospheric temperature and humidity where few conventional observations exist. Applications to storm-scale models are limited since the low temporal resolution provided by polar orbiting sensors cannot adequately sample rapidly changing environments associated with high impact weather events. To address this limitation, hyperspectral sounders have been proposed for geostationary orbiting satellites, but these have yet to be built and launched in part due to much higher engineering costs and a lack of a definite requirement for the data. This study uses an Observation System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) approach to simulate temperature and humidity profiles from a hypothetical geostationary-based sounder from a nature run of a high impact weather event on 20 May 2013. The simulated observations are then assimilated using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter approach, testing both hourly and 15 minute cycling to determine their relative effectiveness at improving the near storm environment. Results indicate that assimilating both temperature and humidity profiles reduced mid-tropospheric both mean and standard deviation of analysis and forecast errors compared to assimilating conventional observations alone. The 15 minute cycling generally produced the lowest errors while also generating the best 2\u20134 hour updraft helicity forecasts of ongoing convection. This study indicates the potential for significant improvement in short-term forecasting of severe storms from the assimilation of hyperspectral geostationary satellite data. However, more studies are required using improved \\{OSSE\\} designs encompassing multiple storm environments and additional observation types such as radar reflectivity to fully define the effectiveness of assimilating geostationary hyperspectral observations for high impact weather forecasting applications.",

They have interesting advantages, the majors of which are a high throughput, efficient use of space and improvement of safety. All the disadvantages of AS/RS are related to economic factors such as high initial investments and difficulty to change layout. This implies the importance of careful design of the AS/RS by taking into account all constraints. The latter may be linked either to the AS/RS dimensions or to products. The evaluation of average travel time that the S/R machine takes to store and retrieve a product is necessary for an optimal design. The present paper is devoted to a particular configuration of AS/RS said flow-rack AS/RS. The flow-rack AS/RS consists of only one deep rack and two machines; the first is used for storing operations and the second for retrieval operations. Our aim is to model mathematically the average travel time of the retrieval machine under random storage. The mathematical model proposed hereunder is certainly function of the physical parameters of the flow-rack AS/RS such as length, width, depth, etc.; but it is also function of the variety of products stored in the system and of their proportions. The mathematical model could be useful for performance evaluation and for design considerations of the flow-rack AS/RS in real world applications. The validation of the model is done by simulation.",

Retrieval of memories under strong competition conditions is pervasive in human memory and some have suggested that inhibitory control is used to overcome interference between competing stimuli. In the present study, we used the retrieval practice paradigm to investigate if competition among personal representations (such as facial features and names) is also resolved by inhibitory mechanisms. This question is theoretically relevant, since personal representations have been said to have a special status on cognition. Moreover, some models of face recognition assume that interference can arise between different representations, but that this interference would be automatically and rapidly solved, with no need for a controlled inhibitory mechanism to act. In two experiments we showed \\{RIF\\} for facial features and familiar names, but only when participants had to actively retrieve some information. This suggests that personal information is subject to mechanisms of inhibitory control, which could help explain everyday life difficulties in processes such as face feature recognition or name retrieval.",

Materials and Methods A cohort of fresh in\u00a0vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles (n\u00a0=\u00a0858) was analyzed from January 2001 to September 2014. Females from whom zero, one, two, or three oocytes were retrieved following ovarian stimulation were examined. Univariate analyses were performed to determine the association of pregnancy rate with potential confounding variables. Multiple logistic regression analysis was subsequently performed to identify factors that affected the occurrence of pregnancy. Results The clinical pregnancy rate was higher in women aged &lt; 40\u00a0years, long protocol, and high embryo score in univariate analysis. After adjusting for confounding factors in multivariate analysis, the maternal age [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.91], primary or secondary infertility (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.99), number of matured oocytes retrieved (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.64), and score of embryos transferred (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.39) were significantly associated with the clinical pregnancy rate per cycle and per transfer.

Despite the success, for conventional \\{SVM\\} active learning, the users are usually not so patience to label a large number of training instances in the relevance feedback round. To overcome this limitation, a new SVM-based active feedback using ensemble multiple classifiers is proposed in this paper. Firstly, we select the most informative images by using active learning method for user to label, and quickly learn a boundary that separates the images that satisfy the user\u05f3s query concept from the rest of the dataset. Then, a set of moderate accurate one-class \\{SVM\\} classifiers are trained separately by using different sub-features vectors. Finally, we compute the weight vector of component \\{SVM\\} classifiers dynamically by using the parameters for positive and negative samples, and combine the results of the component classifiers to form an output code as a hypothesized solution to the overall image retrieval problem.

The proposed motif representation is entirely different from existing motif. The \\{DLMXoRP\\} presents a novel technique for the calculation of motif using 1 \u00d7 3 grids. The proposed motif (1 \u00d7 3) representation is having a flexible structure; hence it can able to extract all directional information.

Further, the XoR operation is performed on the transformed new motif images which are not present in the literature (local binary patterns (LBP) and motif co-occurrence matrix (MCM)).

Previous research has suggested that selection demands are higher for related sets, especially after repetition, since participants experience competition from the activation of semantic neighbours. In contrast, retrieval demands are greater for unrelated sets in the absence of semantic priming, particularly on the first cycle when the target names have not been previously activated. Therefore, this paradigm can reveal independent effects of (i) retrieval demands (i.e., the ease of accessing picture names from visual input) and (ii) selection/competition. We found that rTMS to \\{LIFG\\} and pMTG produced similar behavioural effects: stimulation of both sites disrupted picture naming performance on early cycles (when participants were less practised at producing the picture names) and for semantically-related sets (when there was the potential for increased competition and yet also facilitation from semantic neighbours).

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether microgrooved stem tapers result in greater fretting corrosion damage than smooth stem tapers. Methods A matched cohort of 120 retrieved head-stem pairs from metal-on-polyethylene bearings was created controlling for implantation time, flexural rigidity, apparent length of engagement, and head size. There were 2 groups of 60 heads each, mated with either smooth or microgrooved stem tapers. A high-precision roundness machine was used to measure and categorize the surface morphology. Fretting corrosion damage at the head-neck junction was characterized using the Higgs-Goldberg scoring method. Fourteen of the most damaged heads were analyzed for the maximum depth of material loss and focused ion beam cross-sectioned to view oxide and base metal. Results Fretting corrosion damage was not different between the 2 cohorts at the femoral head (P\u00a0= .14, Mann-Whitney) or stem tapers (P\u00a0= .35). There was no difference in the maximum depths of material loss between the cohorts (P\u00a0= .71).

Children in the retrieval practice condition recalled the words based on their definitions.

        "abstract": "Abstract Retrieval of consolidated memories induces a labile phase during which memory can be disrupted or updated through a reconsolidation process. A central component of behavioral updating during reconsolidation using a retrieval\u2013extinction manipulation (Ret + Ext) is the synaptic removal of a calcium-permeable-\u03b1-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptor (CP-AMPARs) in the lateral amygdala\u2014a metabotropic GluR1 receptor (mGluR1) dependent mechanism. In the present study, we investigate the effect of Ret + Ext on the expression of molecular markers that could play a role in the reconsolidation process. Specifically, we tested the effects of Ret + Ext on the global expression of zinc-finger 268 protein (Zif268), a marker previously found to be implicated in memory reconsolidation, to confirm its occurrence after retrieval (Ret) and Ret + Ext. We also evaluated the global expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein \\{S6\\} (rpS6P), here proposed as a marker of the mGluR1-mediated memory process induced by Ret + Ext. The expression of both markers (zif268, rpS6P) was assessed by immunolocalization in prelimbic cortex (PRL), infralimbic cortex (IL), ventral subdivision of the lateral amygdala (LA) and hippocampus \\{CA1\\} (CA1) in fear-conditioned rats. Our results showed that retrieval and Ret + Ext, but not extinction alone, increased Zif268 expression in prefrontal cortex and lateral amygdala. Ret + Ext, but not retrieval, retrieval followed by context exposure or extinction alone, increased the expression of rpS6P in prefrontal cortex and LA. In summary, (i) Zif268 increased after retrieval confirming that reconsolidation is engaged in our conditions, (ii) Zif268 increased after Ret + Ext confirming that it does not simply reflect an extinction or reconsolidation disruption (Zif268 level of expression should be lower in both cases) and (iii) rpS6P increased after Ret + Ext, but not after extinction, suggesting, as expected, a potential mGluR1 mediated molecular mechanism specific for Ret + Ext. Together with the Zif268 increase, our results suggest that the Ret + Ext induced memory process is more similar to reconsolidation updating than extinction facilitation.",

Once the parameters have been computed, the \\{VPR\\} approach requires as input only the SEVIRI-TIR radiances of the bands centered at 8.7, 10.8, and 12.0 \u03bcm, together with the plume temperature and altitude. The \\{VPR\\} returns maps of plume particles' effective radius, aerosol optical depth at 550 nm, and columnar abundance of ash and SO2. A new procedure for estimating wind speed and direction is also presented. Since the ash and \\{SO2\\} abundance maps, and wind speed at the plume altitude are known, it is possible to reconstruct the ash and \\{SO2\\} fluxes emitted during the eruption through time. The \\{VPR\\} procedure, applied to \\{TIR\\} \\{SEVIRI\\} data, allows for fast and reliable ash and \\{SO2\\} retrieval with high temporal resolution during both day and night, and is thus suitable for operational use during a volcanic crisis.",

In this encryption process, firstly, the \\{QR\\} code is generated from the information to be encrypted; and then the generated \\{QR\\} code is placed in the input plane of 4-f system to have a double random phase encryption. For only one intensity distribution in the output plane is recorded as the ciphertext, the encryption process is greatly simplified. In the decryption process, the corresponding \\{QR\\} code is retrieved using phase retrieval algorithm. A priori information about \\{QR\\} code is used as support constraint in the input plane, which helps solve the stagnation problem. The original information can be recovered without distortion by scanning the \\{QR\\} code. The encryption process can be implemented either optically or digitally, and the decryption process uses digital method. In addition, the security of the proposed optical encryption technology is analyzed. Theoretical analysis and computer simulations show that this optical encryption system is invulnerable to various attacks, and suitable for harsh transmission conditions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract With the fast expansion of social image sharing websites, the tag-based image retrieval (TBIR) becomes important and prevalent for Internet users to search the social images. However, some user-provided tags of social images are too incomplete and ambiguous to facilitate the social image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a regularized optimization framework to complete the missing tags for social images (tag completion). Within the regularized optimization framework, the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and the holistic visual diversity minimization are used jointly to make the tag-image matrix completed as the relationships of images and tags are represented to a tag-image matrix. The non-negative matrix factorization casts the tag-image matrix into a latent low-rank space and utilizes the semantic relevance of tags to partially complete the insufficient tags. To take the visual content of images into account, the other objective term representing the holistic visual diversity is appended with the \\{NMF\\} to leverage the content-similar images. Moreover, to ensure the proper corrections and sparseness of tag-image matrix, two regularized factors are also included into the optimization framework. Through conducting the experiments on the benchmark image set with the adequate ground truth, we verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Inhibitory control is thought to serve an adaptive function in controlling behavior, with individual differences predicting variation in numerous cognitive functions. However, inhibition is more properly construed as inducing both benefits and costs to performance. Benefits arise at the point when inhibition prevents expression of an unwanted or contextually inappropriate response; costs arise later, when access to the inhibited representation is required by other processes. Here we illustrate how failure to consider both the costs and benefits of inhibition has generated confusion in the literature on individual differences in cognitive control. Using retrieval-induced forgetting as a model case, we illustrate this by showing that changing the way that retrieval-induced forgetting is measured to allow greater expression of the benefits of inhibition together with the costs can reduce and even reverse the theoretically predicted correlation between motor and memory inhibition. Specifically, we show that when the final test in a retrieval-induced forgetting procedure employs item-specific cues (i.e., category-plus-stem cued recall and item-recognition) that better isolate the lingering costs of inhibition, better motor response inhibition (faster stop-signal reaction times) predicts greater retrieval-induced forgetting. In striking contrast, when the final test is less well controlled, allowing both the costs and benefits of inhibition to contribute, motor response inhibition has the opposite relationship with retrieval-induced forgetting. These findings underscore the importance of considering the correlated costs and benefits problem when studying individual differences in inhibitory control. More generally, they suggest that a shared inhibition mechanism may underlie people\u2019s ability to control memories and actions.",

Dimensionality reduction is an effective method to overcome it. In this paper, six commonly-used dimensionality reduction methods are compared and analyzed to examine their respective performance in image retrieval. The six methods include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA), Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis (LFDA), Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). For comparison, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) and color histogram in Hue, Saturation, Value (HSV) color space are firstly extracted as image features, meanwhile \\{SIFT\\} feature extraction procedure is optimized to reduce the number of \\{SIFT\\} features. Then, PCA, FLDA, LFDA, ISOMAP, LLE, and \\{LPP\\} are respectively applied to reduce the dimensions of feature vectors, which can be used to generate vocabulary trees. Finally, we can process large-scale image retrieval based on the inverted index built by vocabulary trees. In the experiments, the performance of various dimensionality reduction methods are analyzed comprehensively by comparing the retrieval performance, advantages and disadvantages, computational complexity and time-consuming of image retrieval. Through a series of experiments, we can conclude that dimensionality reduction method of \\{LLE\\} and \\{LPP\\} can effectively reduce computational complexity of image retrieval, while maintaining high retrieval performance.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The contents of memory can be updated when information from the current episode is bound with content retrieved from previous episodes. Little is known regarding factors that determine the memory content that is subject to this across-episode binding. We tested whether across-episode binding preferentially occurs for memory content that is currently \u201cactive\u201d and identified relevant neural correlates. After studying objects at specific locations on scene backgrounds, subjects performed one of two retrieval tasks for the objects on different scene backgrounds. In an active condition, subjects recalled object locations, whereas subjects merely dragged objects to predetermined locations in a passive condition. Immediately following each object-location retrieval event, a novel face appeared on a blank screen. We hypothesized that the original episode content would be active in memory during face encoding in the active condition, but not in the passive condition (despite seeing the same content in both conditions). A ramification of the active condition would thus be preferential binding of original episode content to novel faces, with no such across-episode binding in the passive condition. Indeed, memory for faces was better when tested on the original background scenes in the active relative to passive condition, indicating that original episode content was bound with the active condition faces, whereas this occurred to a lesser extent for the passive condition faces. Likewise, early-onset negative \\{ERP\\} effects reflected binding of the face to the original episode content in the active but not the passive condition. In contrast, binding in the passive condition occurred only when faces were physically displayed on the original scenes during recognition testing, and a very similar early-onset negative \\{ERP\\} effect signaled binding in this condition. \\{ERP\\} correlates of binding were thus similar for across-episode and within-episode binding (and were distinct from other encoding and retrieval \\{ERP\\} signals in both cases), indicating that active retrieval modulated when binding occurred, not the nature of the binding process per se. These results suggest that active retrieval promotes binding of new information with contents of memory, whereas without active retrieval, these unrelated pieces of information might be bound only when they are physically paired.",

The method has two stages of learning and reasoning. In the learning stage, information extracted from retrieval sessions is saved as cases and in the reasoning stage, information of cases is utilized to improve the results of the retrieval sessions. The main components of CB-LTL method are \u2018key of query\u2019 which represents the desire of the user, a \u2018trigger function\u2019 which is used to find a similar case with a query, and \u2018semantic frame\u2019 which is a structure for saving cases.

It allows estimators to exploit existing knowledge to make predictions that are considerably better than without its use.

One particular area of sensitivity is the retrieval phase, i.e. the way in which the \\{CBR\\} determines the closeness between the new and the existing cases. In this paper, \\{CBR\\} is used to make estimates of resources for construction projects, and the use of the nearest neighbor technique to identify the similarity for the retrieval phase to predict the construction material quantities (CMQs) in concrete structures is investigated. Two types of distances, i.e. 1) the City-block distance and 2) the Euclidean distance, and four different types of weights, based on regression analysis and feature counting, to account for the relative importance of the different parameters, are investigated. The four different types of weights used were 1) the adjusted unstandardized coefficients from the regression models, 2) the unadjusted unstandardized coefficients from the regression models, 3) the standardized coefficients from the regression models, and 4) equal weights (i.e., feature counting), in which the weights applied are 1/k, and k is the number of parameter being compared to determine the distance. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to evaluate each combination investigated.

In Experiment 2, irrelevant pictures reduced the number of specific memories but only in response to low imageability cues. Irrelevant pictures also increased response times to both high and low imageability cues. The findings are in line with previous work suggesting that disrupting executive resources may impair generative, but not direct, retrieval of autobiographical memories.

In the proposed work, we successfully integrate semantic human-centric features derived from natural stimulus fMRI data and low-level visual-audio features to facilitate video clustering and retrieval, which is a significant innovation compared to the previous works relying on either fMRI-derived features or low-level visual-audio features. Our system consists of several algorithmic modules. First, fMRI data when the subjects are watching video shot samples are acquired. Then a newly developed brain networks localization system is employed to locate the cortical regions of interests (ROIs) for each individual subject. The functional interactions computed by wavelet transform coherence are quantified, from which the human-centric features are derived. Afterwards, the Gaussian process regression model mapping visual-audio feature space to an fMRI-derived feature space is trained, given the training samples. The trained model is then adopted to predict fMRI-derived features for videos without the fMRI data. Finally, the multi-modal spectral clustering and multi-modal ranking algorithm are adopted and proposed to integrate these two heterogeneous features for video clustering and retrieval, respectively. Our experiment on \\{TRECVID\\} database has demonstrated the precision of video clustering and retrieval can be substantially improved by integration of visual-audio features and fMRI-derived features.",

This paper develops a new control strategy to retrieve the tethered satellite system stably and quickly using the fractional order control theory. The governing equation of the tethered satellite system and classic linear feedback tension control law were first reviewed and examined as a benchmark. Then, a new fractional order tension control law has been to avoid the tethered satellite winds around the main satellite near the end of retrieval by existing integer order tension control laws. The newly proposed control law has been discretized and implemented by the Laplace transform and Tustin operator. Unlike the existing integer order control laws, which are based on the feedback of current state and memoryless, the fractional order control law has the memory of previous states and thus controls the tether retrieval more smoothly while maintaining the retrieving speed. The effectiveness and advantage of the new fractional order tension control law is demonstrated numerically by comparing with its integer order counterpart. The results show that the new control law not only retrieves the subsatellite without winding around the main satellite, but also provides a better control performance with smaller in-plane libration angles.",

The results demonstrate that retrieval dynamics depend critically on situation, indicating that quite often in daily life, retrieval may be a self-propagating, rather than a self-limiting process.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The dynamic and flexible nature of memories is evident in our ability to adopt multiple visual perspectives. Although autobiographical memories are typically encoded from the visual perspective of our own eyes they can be retrieved from the perspective of an observer looking at our self. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of shifting visual perspective during long-term memory retrieval and its influence on online and subsequent memories using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants generated specific autobiographical memories from the last five years and rated their visual perspective. In a separate fMRI session, they were asked to retrieve the memories across three repetitions while maintaining the same visual perspective as their initial rating or by shifting to an alternative perspective. Visual perspective shifting during autobiographical memory retrieval was supported by a linear decrease in neural recruitment across repetitions in the posterior parietal cortices. Additional analyses revealed that the precuneus, in particular, contributed to both online and subsequent changes in the phenomenology of memories. Our findings show that flexibly shifting egocentric perspective during autobiographical memory retrieval is supported by the precuneus, and suggest that this manipulation of mental imagery during retrieval has consequences for how memories are retrieved and later remembered.",

        "abstract": "AbstractBackground Cannabinoids constitute a varied group of lipophilic substances able to infiltrate the blood\u2013brain barrier and influence neuronal processes. Clinical observations supported by experimental data have revealed that these compounds exert a deleterious effect on cognitive processes. The present study was carried out to determine the influence of a single systemic administration of CP55,940, a potent synthetic agonist of cannabinoid receptors, on spatial memory retrieval assessed in a Morris water maze. Methods C57BL/6J male mice were submitted to three consecutive days of training to find a hidden platform in the water maze. CP55,940 was given intraperitoneally once, at doses of 0.025, 0.125 or 0.25 mg/kg on the fourth day, 30 min before testing memory retrieval, and in separate groups before testing psychomotor activity and anxiety level in a hole-board test. Results CP55,940 only at the highest dose of 0.25 mg/kg significantly altered all parameters used to assess spatial memory. It increased the latency in the first crossing of the former platform location (target area), decreased the number of target area crossings and shortened the time spent in the target quadrant. Moreover, CP55,940 at doses of 0.25 and 0.125 mg/kg attenuated motor and exploratory activity in hole-board test. Conclusion Since the attenuated psychomotor activity after a dose of 0.125 mg/kg did not interfere with memory retrieval, we assume that the impairment of spatial memory observed after the highest dose of CP55,940 (0.25 mg/kg) was exerted by its influence on cognitive processes, however, the impact on locomotion could not be excluded.",

However, the lack of spatial and structural information suppresses its performance in applications. In this paper, we introduce a multi-cues description by fusing structural, content and spatial information for partial-duplicate image retrieval. Firstly, we propose a rotation-invariant Local Self-Similarity Descriptor (LSSD), which captures the internal structural layouts in the local textural self-similar regions around interest points. Then, based on the spatial pyramid model, we make use of both \\{LSSD\\} and \\{SIFT\\} to construct an image representation with multi-cues.

The purpose is to find out a detailed slotting rule that makes utilisation high by reducing the fragmentation of the available storage space into small and unusable gaps. For this purpose, the paper constructs and analyses a detailed slotting rule which is based on a best fit rule, but which aligns the cartons being handled to both ends of the shelf and next to a longer carton. The rule is compared to the first fit rule and to different aligning options in order to validate its performance. The simulation results show that the rule thus constructed can give as much as a 10% saving in the utilisation when compared to the first fit rule without aligning. Aligning next to a longer carton instead of next to a shorter carton gives a 1% benefit.",

No significant differences were observed between emotional and neutral memories for duration and amplitude of saccades. Positive and negative retrieval triggered similar eye movement (i.e., similar number of fixations and saccades, fixation duration, duration of saccades, and amplitude of saccades). Interestingly, the participants reported higher visual imagery for emotional memories than for neutral memories.

The observed advantage of retrieval practice may be exaggerated because low motivation may result in deficient processing during (usually passive) rereading. Thus, when subjects are motivated to learn the material, the type of study strategy (whether retrieval practice or rereading) might be less important. To test this hypothesis, we conducted 3 experiments in which we manipulated the incentives (using monetary bonuses or time savings) for learning Swahili\u2013English word pairs. Items that had undergone retrieval practice were better recalled than reread items on a final test 2 days later, but this effect did not interact with incentive level.

The comparison was based on a brightness temperature (TB) data set acquired since 2010 by the L-band radiometer ELBARA-II over a vineyard field at the Valencia Anchor Station (VAS) site. ELBARA-II, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) within the scientific program of the \\{SMOS\\} (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission, measures multiangular \\{TB\\} data at horizontal and vertical polarization for a range of incidence angles (30\u00b0\u201360\u00b0). Based on a three year data set (2010\u20132012), several \\{SM\\} retrieval approaches developed for spaceborne missions including AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS), \\{SMAP\\} (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and \\{SMOS\\} were compared. The approaches include: the Single Channel Algorithm (SCA) for horizontal (SCA-H) and vertical (SCA-V) polarizations, the Dual Channel Algorithm (DCA), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) and two simplified approaches based on statistical regressions (referred to as \u2018Mattar\u2019 and \u2018Saleh\u2019). Time series of vegetation indices required for three of the algorithms (SCA-H, SCA-V and \u2018Mattar\u2019) were obtained from \\{MODIS\\} observations. The \\{SM\\} retrievals were evaluated against reference \\{SM\\} values estimated from a multiangular 2-Parameter inversion approach. As no in situ \\{SM\\} data was used, the evaluation made here is relative to the use of this specific reference data set. The results obtained with the current base line algorithms developed for \\{SMAP\\} (SCA-H and -V) are in very good agreement with the \u2018reference\u2019 \\{SM\\} data set derived from the multi-angular observations (R2 \u2248 0.90, \\{RMSE\\} varying between 0.035 and 0.056 m3/m3 for several retrieval configurations). This result showed that, provided the relationship between vegetation optical depth and a remotely-sensed vegetation index can be calibrated, the \\{SCA\\} algorithms can provide results very close to those obtained from multi-angular observations in this study area. The approaches based on statistical regressions provided similar results and the best accuracy was obtained with the \u2018Saleh\u2019 methods based on either bi-angular or bipolarization observations (R2 \u2248 0.93, \\{RMSE\\} \u2248 0.035 m3/m3).

We formalize the news matching problem as two independent tasks: closed captions segmentation and news retrieval. The system segments closed captions by using a windowing scheme: sliding or tumbling window. Next, it uses each segment to build a query by extracting representative terms. The query is used to retrieve previously indexed news articles from a search engine. To detect when a new article should be surfaced, the system compares the set of retrieved articles with the previously retrieved one. The intuition is that if the difference between these sets is large enough, it is likely that the topic of the newscast currently on air has changed and a new article should be displayed to the user. In order to evaluate IntoNews, we build a test collection using data coming from a second screen application and a major online news aggregator.

        "abstract": "Abstract Computer-assisted image retrieval applications can assist radiologists by identifying similar images in archives as a means to providing decision support. In the classical case, images are described using low-level features extracted from their contents, and an appropriate distance is used to find the best matches in the feature space. However, using low-level image features to fully capture the visual appearance of diseases is challenging and the semantic gap between these features and the high-level visual concepts in radiology may impair the system performance. To deal with this issue, the use of semantic terms to provide high-level descriptions of radiological image contents has recently been advocated. Nevertheless, most of the existing semantic image retrieval strategies are limited by two factors: they require manual annotation of the images using semantic terms and they ignore the intrinsic visual and semantic relationships between these annotations during the comparison of the images. Based on these considerations, we propose an image retrieval framework based on semantic features that relies on two main strategies: (1) automatic \u201csoft\u201d prediction of ontological terms that describe the image contents from multi-scale Riesz wavelets and (2) retrieval of similar images by evaluating the similarity between their annotations using a new term dissimilarity measure, which takes into account both image-based and ontological term relations. The combination of these strategies provides a means of accurately retrieving similar images in databases based on image annotations and can be considered as a potential solution to the semantic gap problem. We validated this approach in the context of the retrieval of liver lesions from computed tomographic (CT) images and annotated with semantic terms of the RadLex ontology. The relevance of the retrieval results was assessed using two protocols: evaluation relative to a dissimilarity reference standard defined for pairs of images on a 25-images dataset, and evaluation relative to the diagnoses of the retrieved images on a 72-images dataset. A normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) score of more than 0.92 was obtained with the first protocol, while \\{AUC\\} scores of more than 0.77 were obtained with the second protocol. This automatical approach could provide real-time decision support to radiologists by showing them similar images with associated diagnoses and, where available, responses to therapies.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Brain-inspired computing is an interdisciplinary field, which aims to use the capabilities of the human brain. The brain is remarkable for large memory capacity and robust memory retrieval. These characteristics are due to the specific structure of the brain. In this paper, an associative memory with large capacity and robust retrieval is introduced that is inspired by the cortical structure. The proposed model is called Columnar-Organized Memory (COM). Its architecture is based on the spiking winner-take-all (WTA): There are lateral excitatory connections between the \\{WTAs\\} and lateral inhibitory connections between the neurons of a WTA. Training of \\{COM\\} involves a two-phase algorithm: pattern storage phase and pattern association phase. The pattern storage phase is based on a spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) rule and the pattern association phase is compatible with the classic Hebbian rule. The key characteristics of the proposed model are storing a large number of messages and retrieving them accurately. These properties are related to its structure notably; robust retrieval is a consequence of the lateral excitatory connections. Also, the overall effect of the lateral inhibitory connections is large storage capacity.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a detailed study about a biomedical image retrieval framework by extracting Phase Congruency (PC) features from L*a*b* triplets of images (query, target) and representing them in fuzzy feature space. These features correspond to an edge-corner map of the given image. The resulting map is then processed by Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to derive keypoints, that are invariant to affine transformations. The ensuing features were vector quantized to build a codebook of keypoints. The codebook was produced using a Spherical Self-Organizing Map (SOM) built with a geodesic data structure termed as GeoSOM. Then keypoints of the query image are mapped with the codebook and their occurrences are counted to formulate a histogram termed as Phase Congruency-based Bag of Keypoints (PC-BoK). This histogram is generated offline for target images and a similarity measure was performed with the query image to yield the nearest match based on a global fuzzy membership function. Exhaustive experiments of the proposed framework named as \\{BIRS\\} (Biomedical Image Retrieval System) were performed on a diverse medical image collection (NBIA, MESSIDOR, DRIVE). Finally, performance of \\{BIRS\\} demonstrates the advantage of the proposed image representation approach in terms of Precision (P)\u2013Recall (R) parameters. Furthermore relative comparison of the proposed scheme with existing feature descriptors depicts improved P\u2013R values. The proposed feature extraction and representation scheme was also robust against quantization errors.",

Two robust approaches to model texture features are Gabor and curvelet features. Although both features are close to human visual perception, sufficient information needs to be extracted from their sub-bands for effective texture classification. Moreover, shape irregularity can be a problem since Gabor and curvelet transforms can only be applied on the regular shapes. In this paper, we propose an approach that uses both the Gabor wavelet and the curvelet transforms on the transferred regular shapes of the image regions. We also apply a fitting method to encode the sub-bands\u2019 information in the polynomial coefficients to create a texture feature vector with the maximum power of discrimination. Experiments on texture classification task with ImageCLEF and Outex databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Introduction There is a hypothesis in cognitive psychology that long-term memory retrieval is improved by intermediate testing than by restudying the information. The effect of testing has been investigated with the use of a variety of stimuli. However, almost all testing effect studies to date have used purely verbal materials such as word pairs, facts and prose passages. Objective Here byzantine music symbol\u2013word pairs were used as to-be-learned materials to demonstrate the generalisability of the testing effect to symbol learning in participants with and without depressive symptoms. Method Fifty healthy (24 women, M age = 26.20, \\{SD\\} = 5.64) and forty volunteers with high depressive symptomatology (20 women, M age = 27.00, \\{SD\\} = 1.04) were examined. The participants did not have a music education. The examination material was completely new for them: 16 byzantine music notation stimuli, paired with a verbal label (the ancient Greek name of the symbol). Half of the participants underwent intermediate testing and the others restudied the information in a balanced design. Results Results indicated that there were no statistically significant differences in final memory test performance after a retention interval of 5 minutes for both groups of participants with low and high level depressive symptomatology (P &gt; 0.005). After a retention interval of a week, tested pairs were retained better than repeatedly studied pairs for high and low depressive symptomatology groups (P &lt; 0.005). Conclusions This research suggests that the effect of testing time on later memory retrieval can also be obtained in byzantine symbol learning.",

As one of the promising approaches, salient point based image retrieval has attracted many researchers. However, the related work is usually very time consuming, and some salient points always may not represent the most interesting subset of points for image indexing. Based on fast and performant salient point detector, and the salient point expansion, a novel content-based image retrieval using local visual attention feature is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the salient image points are extracted by using the fast and performant \\{SURF\\} (Speeded-Up Robust Features) detector. Then, the visually significant image points around salient points can be obtained according to the salient point expansion. Finally, the local visual attention feature of visually significant image points, including the weighted color histogram and spatial distribution entropy, are extracted, and the similarity between color images is computed by using the local visual attention feature. Experimental results, including comparisons with the state-of-the-art retrieval systems, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal.",

The frame of this work is the development of a decision-support system to work out an assignment strategy between scheduling problems, mathematical modelling options and appropriate solving methods. The system must answer the question about which model and which solution method should be applied to solve a new scheduling problem in the most convenient way.

The three major contributions of this paper are: (i) the proposition of an extended and a more exhaustive classification and notation scheme in order to obtain an efficient scheduling case representation (based on previous ones), (ii) a method for bibliographic analysis used to perform a deep study to fill the case base on the one hand, and to examine the topics the more or the less examined in the scheduling domain and their evolution over time on the other hand, and (iii) the proposition of criteria to extract relevant past experiences during the retrieval step of the CBR.

The task required determining if a particular object could be retrieved when two visual words representing object features were presented. Both age groups had comparable accuracy although response times were longer in older adults. In both groups a left fronto-temporal negative potential occurred at around 750 ms during object retrieval, consistent with previous findings (Brier, Maguire, Tillman, Hart, &amp; Kraut, 2008). In only older adults, a later positive frontal potential was found peaking between 800 and 1000 ms during no retrieval.

The original problem asks whether a function u is uniquely determined by its modulus | u | and the modulus of its Fourier transform | F u | up to a constant phase factor. Here we extend this problem by considering the uniqueness of the phase retrieval problem for the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) of variable order. This problem occurs naturally in optics and quantum physics. More precisely, we show that if u and v are such that fractional Fourier transforms of order \u03b1 have same modulus | F \u03b1 u | = | F \u03b1 v | for some set \u03c4 of \u03b1's, then v is equal to u up to a constant phase factor. The set \u03c4 depends on some extra assumptions either on u or on both u and v. Cases considered here are u, v of compact support, pulse trains, Hermite functions or linear combinations of translates and dilates of Gaussians. In this last case, the set \u03c4 may even be reduced to a single point (i.e. one fractional Fourier transform may suffice for uniqueness in the problem).",

At each position in the image, and for each resolution level, we consider both vertical and horizontal wavelet detail coefficients as the components of a bivariate random vector.

At each level the empirical histogram of magnitudes is modeled by a Generalized Gamma distribution, and the empirical histogram of angles is modeled by a different version of the von Mises distribution that accounts for histograms with 2 modes. Each texture is characterized by few parameters. A new distance is presented (based on the Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence) that allows giving relative importance to each model and to each resolution level. This distance is later conveniently adapted to provide for rotation invariance, by establishing equivalence classes over distributions of angles. Through a broad set of experiments on three different image databases, we demonstrate that our new descriptor and distance measure can be successfully applied in the context of texture retrieval.

Anatomical images (T1-weighted MRI) were converted to a standardized index by using a high-dimensional image transformation method followed by atlas-based parcellation of the entire brain. We investigated how the indexed anatomical data captured the anatomical features of healthy controls and a population with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). \\{PPA\\} was chosen because patients have apparent atrophy at different degrees and locations, thus the automated quantitative results can be compared with trained clinicians' qualitative evaluations. We explored and tested the power of individual classifications and of performing a search for images with similar anatomical features in a database using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The agreement between the automated z-score and the averaged visual scores for atrophy (r\u00a0=\u00a00.8) was virtually the same as the inter-evaluator agreement. The \\{PCA\\} plot distribution correlated with the anatomical phenotypes and the PLS-DA resulted in a model with an accuracy of 88% for distinguishing \\{PPA\\} variants.

These approaches are formulated on both word and subword lattices, and a complete framework of using them in open vocabulary retrieval of spoken content is presented. Significant improvements for these approaches with both in-vocabulary and out-of-vocabulary queries were observed in preliminary experiments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Extinction training is a form of inhibitory learning that allows an organism to associate a previously aversive cue with a new, safe outcome. Extinction does not erase a fear association, but instead creates a competing association that may or may not be retrieved when a cue is subsequently encountered. Characterizing the conditions under which extinction learning is expressed is important to enhancing the treatment of anxiety disorders that rely on extinction-based exposure therapy as a primary treatment technique. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which plays a critical role in the expression of extinction memory, has been shown to be functionally impaired after stress exposure. Further, recent work in rodents has demonstrated that exposure to stress leads to deficits in extinction retrieval, although this has yet to be tested in humans. To explore how stress might influence extinction retrieval in humans, participants underwent a differential aversive learning paradigm, in which one image was probabilistically paired with an aversive shock while the other image denoted safety. Extinction training directly followed, at which point reinforcement was omitted. A day later, participants returned to the lab and either completed an acute stress manipulation (i.e., cold pressor), or a control task, before undergoing an extinction retrieval test. Skin conductance responses and salivary cortisol concentrations were measured throughout each session as indices of fear arousal and neuroendocrine stress response, respectively. The efficacy of our stress induction was established by observing significant increases in cortisol for the stress condition only. We examined extinction retrieval by comparing conditioned responses during the last trial of extinction (day 1) with that of the first trial of re-extinction (day 2). Groups did not differ on initial fear acquisition or extinction, however, a day later participants in the stress group (n = 27) demonstrated significantly lower extinction retrieval (i.e., greater fear recovery) than those in the control group (n = 25). Our results suggest that acute stress impairs the retrieval of extinction learning and offers insight into why treatment strategies used in the clinic may be challenging to recruit in daily life where stress is pervasive.",

In this paper, we propose a new automatic shot based keyframe extraction for video indexing and retrieval applications. Initially, the frames are sequentially clustered into shots by using feature extraction, continuity value construction steps of shot boundary detection process and the shot frame clustering technique. The cluster having a larger dispersion rate is selected for inter cluster similarity analysis (ICSA) and the sub-shot based keyframes are extracted using ICSA. The proposed shot boundary detection algorithm and video keyframe extraction technique are implemented and evaluated on publicly available ecological video datasets. Compared with existing related algorithms, our method yields better F1-score of 94.2% for shot boundary detection and better results for keyframe extraction.

However, few studies investigated the neurochemical mechanisms that mediate the prefrontal retrieval process. In the current study, we examined whether N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in the mPFC were necessary for retrieval of a well-learned spatial location on the basis of partial or degraded spatial cues. Rats were initially trained to find a hidden platform in the Morris water maze using four extramaze cues in the surrounding environment. Their retrieval performance was subsequently tested under different cue conditions. Infusions of DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV), a \\{NMDAR\\} antagonist, significantly disrupted memory retrieval when three of the original cues were removed. By contrast, \\{APV\\} injections into the mPFC did not affect animals\u2019 retrieval performance when the original cues were presented or when three novels landmarks were added alongside the original cues. These results indicate that prefrontal \\{NMDARs\\} are required for memory retrieval when allocentric spatial information is degraded.

Since FrMT is a non-linear integral transform, its use enhances the system security. We also add further security features by carrying out spatial filtering in the frequency domain by using a combination of two phase masks: a toroidal zone plate (TZP) and a radial Hilbert mask (RHM). These masks together increase the key space making the system more secure. The phase key used in decryption has been obtained by applying an iterative phase retrieval algorithm based on the fractional Fourier transform. The algorithm uses amplitude constraints of secret target image and the ciphertext (encrypted image) obtained from multiplication of fractional Mellin transformed arbitrary input image and the two phase masks (TZP and RHM). The proposed encryption scheme has been validated for a few grayscale images, by numerical simulations. The efficacy of the scheme has been evaluated by computing mean-squared-error (MSE) between the secret target image and the decrypted image. The sensitivity analysis of the decryption process to variations in various encryption parameters has also been carried out.",

Retrieval practice involves attempting to reinstate a prior learning context, and when retrieval is successful, the representation of context is updated to include features of retrieved contexts and the current context. Future retrieval is enhanced because updated context representations can be used to restrict the search set and hone in on a desired target.

We found that administration of \\{NBQX\\} in the \\{BLA\\} blocked retrieval, whereas \\{APV\\} blocked reconsolidation in the BLA, and consolidation in the CeA. When we administered both \\{NBQX\\} and \\{APV\\} into the \\{BLA\\} before the second acquisition trial, results showed impairment of both retrieval and reconsolidation. These results further support the idea that reconsolidation is independent of retrieval, since retrieval blockade in the \\{BLA\\} did not impair memory reconsolidation. These results suggest that glutamate receptors have different participation on retrieval and reconsolidation of \\{CTA\\} and further support the hypothesis that these two processes could be independent.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) is the phenomenon that \u2018retrieval-practice\u2019, the repeated retrieval of a subset of initially learned material, can impair the recall of episodically related memories. Previous studies showed that \\{RIF\\} is eliminated when retrieval-practice is carried out under psycho-social stress, anxiety, or in negative mood. However, pharmacological manipulation by hydrocortisone did not eliminate the effect. This study investigated the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on stress-induced modulations of RIF, addressing possible interactive effects of the glucocorticoid and sympatho\u2013adrenomedullary systems. Participants learned categorized word lists and then received either 60 mg propranolol or a placebo. After 90 min they were exposed to the TSST. A third group did not receive any medication and performed a non-stressful control task with the same timing as the other two groups. Finally, all participants underwent retrieval-practice and final recall. Both \\{TSST\\} groups exhibited a stress-induced increase in cortisol-levels, and the placebo group also exhibited large increases in markers of sympathetic nervous system activity and more psychological distress at the time of retrieval-practice. Although, overall recall was poorer under stress, an overall \\{RIF\\} effect emerged irrespective of group and showed no clear modulation by stress with or without beta-adrenergic blockade. In previous demonstrations of \\{RIF\\} elimination by negative emotion, state induction and retrieval-practice followed very briefly after initial learning. Given that both the previous study of hydrocortisone effects on \\{RIF\\} and the present study used longer delays between learning and retrieval-practice, the possibility that stress effects on retrieval-practice eliminate \\{RIF\\} only relatively briefly after learning is discussed.",

This paper proposes a novel sketch-based 3D model retrieval approach which utilizes both global feature-based and local feature-based techniques. Unlike current approaches which use either global or local features, as well as do not take into account semantic relations between local features, we extract these two kinds of feature information from the representative 2D views of 3D models that can facilitate semantic description and retrieval for 3D models. Global features represent the gross exterior boundary shape information, and local features describe the interior details by compact visual words. Specifically, an improved bag-of-features method is provided to extract local features and their latent semantic relations. In addition, an efficient two-stage matching strategy is used to measure the distance between the query sketch and 3D models for selection and refinement. Experiment results demonstrate that our approach which combines these two kinds of complementary features significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.",

For the case of complex M-dimensional signals, we construct a measurement ensemble of size 4 M \u2212 4 which yields injective intensity measurements; this is conjectured to be the smallest such ensemble.

Traditional pairwise similarity measure ignores the contextual information, and the Graph Transduction (GT) has been proposed as a contextual similarity learning algorithm to utilize the contextual information, which is embedded in a nearest neighbor graph. On main shortage of this method is that it is difficult to choose the optimal graph since different graphs may focus on different aspects of the objects. Co-Transduction (CT) is lately proposed by fusing two different graphs. In this paper, we generalize this problem by using the ensemble of many candidate graphs with different models and parameters for transduction, by assuming that the optimal graph could be obtained by the weighted linear ensemble of these candidate graphs. The similarities and graph weights are modeled within one unified objective function, and optimized alternately in an iterative algorithm.

The recently proposed Local Tetra Pattern (LTrP) represents the image by the directional information and gives promising results.

        "abstract": "Abstract Retrieval orientation refers to a process where participants strategically alter how a memory cue is processed in response to different task demands. In the present study we explored whether retrieval orientation is influenced by knowing when an old stimulus was first encoded. Participants completed separate remember/know test blocks for old items from a recent delay (40 min) and old items from a remote delay (48 h). Manipulations at encoding ensured that performance levels were matched between these two blocks, thus avoiding confounds with differences in retrieval effort. Importantly, a third test block comprised old items from both delays randomly intermixed. As the nature of the old items varies unpredictably in the mixed block, it should not be possibly to adopt a specific retrieval orientation and the mixed block therefore acts as a control condition. Participants saw the words \u201cmixed,\u201d \u201crecent\u201d or \u201cremote\u201d prior to each test block. Comparing \\{ERPs\\} from the recent and remote blocks permitted an investigation of whether participants alter their retrieval orientation in response to the specific length of the retention interval. Comparing \\{ERPs\\} from the pure (recent and remote) test blocks to \\{ERPs\\} from the mixed block permitted an investigation of whether delay information per se led to differences in retrieval strategy. Analysis of the \\{ERP\\} data found no differences between the recent and remote blocks. However, \\{ERPs\\} from these pure blocks were significantly less positive than \\{ERPs\\} from the mixed block from 200 ms towards the end of the epoch. The findings suggest that the delay information was useful in a general sense and encouraged retrieval strategies distinct from those engaged in the mixed block.

More specifically, \\{SEH\\} firstly generates sparse representations in a data-driven way, and then learns a projection matrix, taking sparse representing, affinity preserving and linear embedding into account. In order to make the learned compact features locality sensitive, \\{SEH\\} employs the matrix factorization technique to approximate the Euclidean structures of the original data. The usage of the matrix factorization enables the decomposed matrix to be constructed from either visual or textual features depending on which kind of Euclidean structure is preserved. Due to this flexibility, our \\{SEH\\} framework could handle both single-modal retrieval and cross-modal retrieval simultaneously. Experimental evidence shows this method achieves much better performance in both single- and cross-modal retrieval tasks as compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

It is essentially a multi-query ranking problem where the user submitted image and provided positive examples are considered as queries. Most of the existing approaches either merge the multiple queries into a single query or consider them independently, and then the geodesic distances on the image manifold are used to measure the similarities between the query image and the other images in database. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Query Parallel Field Ranking (MQPFR) which finds an optimal ranking function whose gradient field is as parallel as possible. In this way, the obtained ranking function varies linearly along the geodesics of the data manifold, and achieves the highest value at the multiple queries simultaneously.

        "abstract": "Abstract Healthy aging is accompanied by a decline in spatial working memory that is related to functional cerebral changes within the spatial working memory network. In the last decade, important findings were presented concerning the location (e.g., prefrontal), kind (e.g., \u2018underactivation,\u2019 \u2018overactivation\u2019), and meaning (e.g., functional deficits, compensation) of these changes. Less is known about how functional connections between specific brain regions are affected by age and how these changes are related to behavioral performance. To address these issues, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine retrieval-related brain activation and functional connectivity in 18 younger individuals and 18 older individuals. We assessed working memory with a modified version of the Corsi Block-Tapping test, which requires the storage and reproduction of spatial target sequences. Analyses of group differences in brain activation and functional connectivity included comparisons between younger individuals, older individuals, older high-performers, and older low-performers. In addition, we conducted a functional connectivity analysis by using a seed region approach. In comparison to younger individuals, older individuals showed lower right-hemispheric dorsolateral prefrontal activation and lower functional connectivity between the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the bilateral orbitofrontal cortex. Older high-performers showed higher right dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex activation than older low-performers, as well as higher functional connectivity between these brain regions. The present results suggest age-related reductions of prefrontal activation during spatial working memory retrieval. Moreover, task-related functional connectivity appears to be lower in older adults. Performance accuracy in older adults is associated with right dorsolateral and anterior prefrontal cortex activation, and with the functional connection between these regions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In query-by-semantic-example image retrieval, images are ranked by similarity of semantic descriptors. These descriptors are obtained by classifying each image with respect to a pre-defined vocabulary of semantic concepts. In this work, we consider the problem of improving the accuracy of semantic descriptors through cross-modal regularization, based on auxiliary text. A cross-modal regularizer, composed of three steps, is proposed. Training images and text are first mapped to a common semantic space. A regularization operator is then learned for each concept in the semantic vocabulary. This is an operator which maps the semantic descriptors of images labeled with that concept to the descriptors of the associated texts. A convex formulation of the learning problem is introduced, enabling the efficient computation of concept-specific regularization operators. The third step is the selection of the most suitable operator for the image to regularize. This is implemented through a quantization of the semantic space, where a regularization operator is associated with each quantization cell. Overall, the proposed regularizer is a non-linear mapping, implemented as a piecewise linear transformation of the semantic image descriptors to regularize. This transformation is a form of cross-modal domain adaptation. It is shown to achieve better performance than recent proposals in the domain adaptation literature, while requiring much simpler optimization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Semantic gap, which refers to the limitation that low-level hand-crafted visual features insufficiently encode high-level semantic concepts contained in the images, has been a challenging issue in image retrieval and significantly impairs the performance of real-world retrieval systems. Despite massive efforts that have been devoted to developing effective image signatures, e.g., Bag-of-Visual-Words (BOVW), the Fisher Vector (FV) and the Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD), these mid-level image features still fail to handle the problem of semantic gap and thus lead to suboptimal results. Towards this end, a large body of work focuses on introducing attribute learning into a variety of vision applications. As inherent nature that describes the intrinsic properties of objects, such as color, shape and rigidity, learned attributes serve as intermediate representations that bridge the semantic gap. However, conventional attribute embedding methods are generally developed for image global representation while ignoring local spatial cues, which prevents them from achieving desirable performance. In this paper, we attempt to encode weak spatial information into attribute embedding for effective image retrieval. Specifically, we partition the image into regular grids and extract Classemes attribute vector from each patch, which results in a large pool of Classemes descriptors followed by \\{VLAD\\} aggregation for generating holistic representation. In order to produce a compact and discriminative code, we employ a piecewise Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) for dimension reduction and concatenate all the compressed Classemes into a single vector coined Spatially Pooled Attributes (SPA).

Objectives To identify the most relevant \\{EIR\\} in UNAM's libraries and their access routes, especially the DML, to apply information search strategies through an example for efficient retrieval of information, and to help educate the academic community of the School of Medicine on the usefulness of resources available in their DML. Method A general overview of the UNAM's \\{EIR\\} was written. Some proposals for information search strategies were reviewed and implemented using the available \\{EIR\\} of the DML. Results were analysed to determine which strategies were better, according to their usefulness and relevance. Results Through a successful search strategy, it was possible to obtain reduced (and therefore more manageable) units of specific material. Through the DML, between 85 and 100% of the material was obtained in full text.

Six and five (nine in total) distinct sketch-based 3D shape retrieval methods have competed each other in these two contests, respectively. To measure and compare the performance of the top participating and other existing promising sketch-based 3D shape retrieval methods and solicit the state-of-the-art approaches, we perform a more comprehensive comparison of fifteen best (four top participating algorithms and eleven additional state-of-the-art methods) retrieval methods by completing the evaluation of each method on both benchmarks.

The advent of technologies like bistatic scatterometer can retrieve soil moisture information with high accuracy and hence used in present study. The radar data is acquired by specially designed ground based bistatic scatterometer system in the specular direction of 20\u201370\u00b0 incidence angles at steps of 5\u00b0 for \\{HH\\} and \\{VV\\} polarizations. This study provides first time comprehensive evaluation of different machine learning algorithms for the retrieval of soil moisture using the X-band bistatic scatterometer measurements. The comparison of different artificial neural network (ANN) models such as back propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), radial basis function artificial neural network (RBFANN), generalized regression artificial neural network (GRANN) along with linear regression model (LRM) are used to estimate the soil moisture. The performance indices such as %Bias, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) are used to evaluate the performances of the machine learning techniques. Among different models employed in this study, the \\{BPANN\\} is found to have marginally higher performance in case of \\{HH\\} polarization while \\{RBFANN\\} is found suitable with \\{VV\\} polarization followed by \\{GRANN\\} and LRM.

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent advances in convex optimization have led to new strides in the phase retrieval problem over finite-dimensional vector spaces. However, certain fundamental questions remain: What sorts of measurement vectors uniquely determine every signal up to a global phase factor, and how many are needed to do so? Furthermore, which measurement ensembles yield stability? This paper presents several results that address each of these questions. We begin by characterizing injectivity, and we identify that the complement property is indeed a necessary condition in the complex case. We then pose a conjecture that 4 M \u2212 4 generic measurement vectors are both necessary and sufficient for injectivity in M dimensions, and we prove this conjecture in the special cases where M = 2 , 3 . Next, we shift our attention to stability, both in the worst and average cases. Here, we characterize worst-case stability in the real case by introducing a numerical version of the complement property. This new property bears some resemblance to the restricted isometry property of compressed sensing and can be used to derive a sharp lower Lipschitz bound on the intensity measurement mapping. Localized frames are shown to lack this property (suggesting instability), whereas Gaussian random measurements are shown to satisfy this property with high probability. We conclude by presenting results that use a stochastic noise model in both the real and complex cases, and we leverage Cramer\u2013Rao lower bounds to identify stability with stronger versions of the injectivity characterizations.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is commonly assumed that stress impairs memory retrieval. Glucocorticoids, released with a delay of several minutes in response to stressful experiences, are thought to play a key role in the stress-induced retrieval impairment. Accordingly, most studies on the impact of stress on retrieval tested memory a considerable time after stressor exposure, when glucocorticoid levels were elevated. Here, we asked how stress affects memory when retrieval takes place under stress, that is, when stress is part of the retrieval situation and glucocorticoids are not yet increased at the time of testing. To contrast stress effects on ongoing and delayed memory retrieval, 72 participants learned first neutral and emotional material. Twenty-four hours later, half of the learned material was tested either in a stressful, oral examination-like testing situation or in a standard, non-stressful free recall test. Memory for the other half of the learned material was assessed 25 min after the first, stressful or non-stressful retention test. Significant increases in blood pressure and salivary cortisol confirmed the stress induction by the first, examination-like testing situation. Retrieval performance under stress was positively correlated with the blood pressure response to the stressor but unaffected by cortisol. Conversely, retrieval performance 25 min post stress was negatively correlated with the cortisol response to the stressor, particularly for emotional items. These results suggest that the same stressor may have opposite effects on ongoing and delayed memory retrieval, depending on the presence of autonomic arousal and glucocorticoids.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent studies have shown that image representations built upon deep convolutional layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have strong discriminative characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel and effective method to create compact binary codes (deep binary codes) based on deep convolutional features for image retrieval. Deep binary codes are generated by comparing the response from each feature map and the average response across all the feature maps on the deep convolutional layers. Additionally, a spatial cross-summing strategy is proposed to directly generate bit-scalable binary codes. As the deep binary codes on different deep layers can be obtained by passing the image through the \\{CNN\\} and each of them makes a different contribution to the search accuracy, we then present a dynamic, on-the-fly late fusion approach where the top N high quality search scores from deep binary codes are automatically determined online and fused to further enhance the retrieval precision. Two strengths of the proposed methods are that the generation of deep binary codes is based on a generic model, which does not require additional training for new image domains, and that the dynamic late fusion scheme is query adaptive. Extensive experimental results on well known benchmarks show that the performance of deep binary codes are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches for large scale image retrieval. Moreover, it is shown that the dynamic late fusion scheme significantly enhances the search accuracy.",

However, it is difficult to measure image content similarity due to visual changes caused by varying viewpoint and environment. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient method to more effectively measure content similarity from image measurements. Our method is based on the ranking information available from existing retrieval systems. We observe that images within the set which, when used as queries, yield similar ranking lists are likely to be relevant to each other and vice versa. In our method, ranking consistency is used as a verification method to efficiently refine an existing ranking list, in much the same fashion that spatial verification is employed. The efficiency of our method is achieved by a list-wise min-Hash scheme, which allows rapid calculation of an approximate similarity ranking. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Latent topic model such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been designed for text processing and has also demonstrated success in the task of audio related processing. The main idea behind \\{LDA\\} assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary. When applying the original \\{LDA\\} to process continuous data, the word-like unit need be first generated by vector quantization (VQ). This data discretization usually results in information loss. To overcome this shortage, this paper introduces a new topic model named Gaussian-LDA for audio retrieval. In the proposed model, we consider continuous emission probability, Gaussian instead of multinomial distribution. This new topic model skips the vector quantization and directly models each topic as a Gaussian distribution over audio features. It avoids discretization by this way and integrates the procedure of clustering. The experiments of audio retrieval demonstrate that Gaussian-LDA achieves better performance than other compared methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Biochemical and structural leaf properties such as chlorophyll content (Chl), nitrogen content (N), leaf water content (LWC), and specific leaf area (SLA) have the benefit to be estimated through nondestructive spectral measurements. Current practices, however, mainly focus on a limited amount of wavelength bands while more information could be extracted from other wavelengths in the full range (400\u20132500 nm) spectrum. In this research, leaf characteristics were estimated from a field-based multi-species dataset, covering a wide range in leaf structures and Chl concentrations. The dataset contains leaves with extremely high Chl concentrations (&gt;100 \u03bcg cm\u22122), which are seldom estimated. Parameter retrieval was conducted with the machine learning regression algorithm Gaussian Processes (GP), which is able to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting for complex datasets. Moreover, insight in relevant bands is provided during the development of a regression model. Consequently, the physical meaning of the model can be explored. Best estimates of SLA, \\{LWC\\} and Chl yielded a best obtained normalized root mean square error of 6.0%, 7.7%, 9.1%, respectively. Several distinct wavebands were chosen across the whole spectrum. A band in the red edge (710 nm) appeared to be most important for the estimation of Chl. Interestingly, spectral features related to biochemicals with a structural or carbon storage function (e.g. 1090, 1550, 1670, 1730 nm) were found important not only for estimation of SLA, but also for LWC, Chl or N estimation. Similar, Chl estimation was also helped by some wavebands related to water content (950, 1430 nm) due to correlation between the parameters. It is shown that leaf parameter retrieval by \\{GP\\} regression is successful, and able to cope with large structural differences between leaves.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is one of the most important indicators of atmospheric pollution. It can be retrieved from satellite imagery using several established methods, such as the dark dense vegetation method and the deep blue algorithm. All of these methods require estimation of surface reflectance prior to retrieval, and are applicable to a certain pre-designated type of surface cover. Such limitations can be overcome by using a synergetic method of retrieval proposed in this study. This innovative method is based on the fact that the ratio K of surface reflectance at different angles/geometries is independent of wavelength as reported by Flowerdew and Haigh (1995). An atmospheric radiative transfer model was then established and resolved with the assistance of the ratio K obtained from two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) spectral bands acquired from the twin satellites of Terra and Aqua whose overpass is separated by three hours. This synergetic method of retrieval was tested with 20 pairs of \\{MODIS\\} images. The retrieved \\{AOD\\} was validated against the ground observed \\{AOD\\} at the Taihu station of the \\{AErosol\\} \\{RObotic\\} \\{NETwork\\} (AERONET). It is found that they are correlated with the observations at a coefficient of 0.828 at 0.47 \u03bcm and 0.921 at 0.66 \u03bcm wavelengths. The retrieved \\{AOD\\} has a mean relative error of 25.47% at 0.47 \u03bcm and 24.3% at 0.66 \u03bcm. Of the 20 samples, 15 and 17 fall within two standard error of the line based observed \\{AOD\\} data on the ground at the 0.47 \u03bcm and 0.66 \u03bcm, respectively.

        "abstract": "AbstractObjective Poor retrieval rates for retrievable inferior vena cava filters (R-IVCFs) have been reported throughout the literature, with poor follow-up a common cause. In 2009, we reported a retrieval rate of 18% despite an initial follow-up rate of 85%. Use of a registry has been shown to improve retrieval rates. As a quality improvement project, in May 2012, the vascular surgery fellowship implemented a reiterative registry to track R-IVCFs placed at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center to improve retrieval rates. We report the results in 125 patients after 38 months. Methods Patients receiving an R-IVCF were entered into a registry. All patients were reviewed monthly using an electronic health record. When there was no longer an indication for the R-IVCF, the patient was scheduled for an outpatient appointment with a vascular surgeon followed by retrieval. Rates of retrieval, technical success, dwell time, indication, complications, and demographics were collected. Results There were 125 R-IVCFs placed between May 2012 and June 2015; 52 filters were placed for therapeutic and 73 for prophylactic indications. Our follow-up rate improved to 94%. A total of 79 filters were retrieved (63% absolute retrieval rate). Excluding patients who died before retrieval and patients with a permanent indication, 77% of filters were retrieved. The average dwell time was 101.5 days (7-460 days), and 63% of successful R-IVCF retrievals were within 3 months of placement. Technical success for retrieval was 92%. There were two major complications from retrievals (1.5% of retrievals). Conclusions The creation of an R-IVCF registry promoted ongoing follow-up with patients. In our earlier experience, retrieval rates were poor despite a high follow-up rate. The use of a reiterative registry improved our retrieval rate by 45% and increased our follow-up rate to 94%.

To create a fast K-means algorithm for this study, first a level histogram of statistics for the image database is made. The level histogram is used with the K-means algorithm for clustering data. A fast K-means algorithm not only shortens the length of time spent on training the image database cluster centers, but it also overcomes the cluster center re-training problem since large numbers of images are continuously added into the database. For the experiment, we use gray and color image database sets for performance comparisons and analyzes, respectively. The results show that the fast K-means algorithm is more effective, faster, and more convenient than the traditional K-means algorithm. Moreover, it overcomes the problem of spending excessive amounts of time on re-training caused by the continuous addition of images to the image database.

Indeed, one of the main challenge of \\{P2P\\} storage systems has traditionally been how to guarantee that stored data can always be retrieved within some time frame. To meet this challenge, existing systems store objects with high amounts of data redundancy, rendering data availability values close to 100%, which in turn ensure optimal retrieval times (only constrained by network limits). Unfortunately, this redundancy reduces the overall net capacity of the system and increases data maintenance costs. To alleviate these problems data redundancy can be reduced at the expense of lengthening retrieval times. The problem is that both the rewards and disadvantages of doing so are not well understood.

Using this approach, we tested the degree to which differences in encoding might contribute to recollection impairments, or whether group differences in memory primarily emerge at retrieval. Following encoding of scenes, participants were asked to distinguish between old and similar lure scenes and provide \u2018remember\u2019/\u2018familiar\u2019 responses. Intentional encoding increased eye movements and subsequent recollection in both groups to a similar degree, but the \\{ASD\\} group were impaired overall at the memory task and used recollection less frequently. In controls, eye movements at encoding predicted subsequent correct responses and subsequent recollection on a trial-by-trial basis, as expected. In contrast, despite a similar pattern of eye movements during encoding in the two groups, eye movements did not predict trial-by-trial subsequent memory in ASD. Furthermore, recollection was associated with lower similarity between encoding- and retrieval-related eye movements in the \\{ASD\\} group compared to the control group. The eye-tracking results therefore provide novel evidence for a dissociation between encoding and recollection-based retrieval in ASD.",

In the proposed scheme, each sensor node is assigned a selection probability derived from a Robust Soliton Distribution (RSD) in a distributed fashion. Source nodes then disseminate their data over the storage network randomly, in accordance with the selection probabilities. The proposed scheme is compared to similar schemes in the literature by means of simulations. We evaluate the energy required for building the storage as well as the energy needed for data retrieval from the storage system. Results show that energy consumption can be substantially reduced while achieving the required storage requirements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract With the ever explosive growth of multimedia visual data on the Web, content-based visual retrieval has been attracting sufficient attention in both the academia and the industry. Based on the pioneering work of invariant local \\{SIFT\\} feature and the classic Bag-of-Visual-Words model, the last decade has witnessed the fast advance in content-based visual retrieval in the computer vision and multimedia community. The notable characteristic that distinguishes multimedia content-based retrieval from other visual processing problems lies in emphasizing on the scalability to million- or billion-scale database and the query response in real time. Due to the well-known semantic gap problem, most content-based visual retrieval methods target at specific object/scene image retrieval or partial-duplicate Web image retrieval, and great success has been achieved. This chapter investigates the general framework of the multimedia content-based visual retrieval. It overviews the general visual search pipeline and discusses five key modules of the pipeline separately in detail. A series of methods addressing the key issues in each module are introduced. In this chapter, we are focused on discussing the key problems, defining the algorithms, and illustrating the main idea with the goal of scalable retrieval in large-scale image database.",

        "abstract": "Summary Soil moisture is a key variable that controls the exchange of water and energy fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. However, the temporal evolution of soil moisture is neither easy to measure nor monitor at large scales because of its high spatial variability. This is mainly a result of the local variation in soil properties and vegetation cover. Thus, land surface models are normally used to predict the evolution of soil moisture and yet, despite their importance, these models are based on low-resolution soil property information or typical values. Therefore, the availability of more accurate and detailed soil parameter data than are currently available is vital, if regional or global soil moisture predictions are to be made with the accuracy required for environmental applications. The proposed solution is to estimate the soil hydraulic properties via model calibration to remotely sensed soil moisture observation, with in situ observations used as a proxy in this proof of concept study. Consequently, the feasibility is assessed, and the level of accuracy that can be expected determined, for soil hydraulic property estimation of duplex soil profiles in a semi-arid environment using near-surface soil moisture observations under naturally occurring conditions. The retrieved soil hydraulic parameters were then assessed by their reliability to predict the root zone soil moisture using the Joint \\{UK\\} Land Environment Simulator model. When using parameters that were retrieved using soil moisture observations, the root zone soil moisture was predicted to within an accuracy of 0.04 m3/m3, which is an improvement of \u223c0.025 m3/m3 on predictions that used published values or pedo-transfer functions.",

In recent years, some methods for similarity measure with multiple formats of attribute values can be found in the practical \\{CBR\\} applications, but the in-depth study is still lacking. The objective of this paper is to develop a new method for hybrid similarity measure with five formats of attribute values: crisp symbols, crisp numbers, interval numbers, fuzzy linguistic variables and random variables. First, for each format of the attribute values, the calculation formula to measure the attribute similarity is presented. Then, the method for measuring hybrid similarity between each historical case and the target case is given by aggregating attribute similarities using the simple additive weighting method, and the proper historical case(s) can be retrieved according to the obtained hybrid similarities afterwards. Finally, a case study in the field of emergency response towards gas explosion is introduced to illustrate the use of the proposed method.",

Although a large series of protein kinases involved in memory processes have been reported, information on phosphoproteins is limited. It was therefore the aim of the study to determine a partial and differential phosphoproteome along with the corresponding network in hippocampus of a wild caught mouse strain with excellent performance in several paradigms of spatial memory. Apodemus sylvaticus mice were trained in the Barnes maze, a non-invasive test system for spatial memory and untrained mice served as controls. Animals were sacrificed 6 h following memory retrieval, hippocampi were taken, proteins extracted and in-solution digestion was carried out with subsequent iTRAQ double labelling. Phosphopeptides were enriched by a TiO2-based method and semi-quantified using two fragmentation principles on the LTQ-orbitrap Velos. In hippocampi of trained animals phosphopeptide levels representing signalling, neuronal, synaptosomal, cytoskeletal and metabolism proteins were at least twofold reduced or increased. Furthermore, a network revealing a link to pathways of ubiquitination, the androgen receptor, small \\{GTPase\\} Rab5 and \\{MAPK\\} signaling as well as synucleins was constructed.

Analysis of hit lists revealed counter-intuitive instances in the top ranks for good classifiers. In this study, we propose that two functions need to be optimised: (a) in order to reduce a massive set of instances to a likely subset among ten thousand or more classes, separability is required. However, the results need to be intuitive after ranking, reflecting (b) the prototypicality of instances. By optimising these requirements sequentially, the number of distracting images is strongly reduced, followed by nearest-centroid based instance ranking that retains an intuitive (low-edit distance) ranking. We show that in handwritten word-image retrieval, precision improvements of up to 35 percentage points can be achieved, yielding up to 100% top hit precision and 99% top-7 precision in data sets with 84 000 instances, while maintaining high recall performances.

Dominant color and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) based texture features are extracted from these regions. Feature vectors together with their region codes are stored and indexed in the database. During retrieval, feature vectors of regions having region codes similar to the query image region are used for comparison.

        "abstract": "Abstract The remote sounding of infrared emission from planetary atmospheres using limb-viewing geometry is a powerful technique for deriving vertical profiles of structure and composition on a global scale. Compared with nadir viewing, limb geometry provides enhanced vertical resolution and greater sensitivity to atmospheric constituents. However, standard limb profile retrieval techniques assume spherical symmetry and are vulnerable to biases produced by horizontal gradients in atmospheric parameters. We present a scheme for the correction of horizontal gradients in profile retrievals from limb observations of the martian atmosphere. It characterizes horizontal gradients in temperature, pressure, and aerosol extinction along the line-of-sight of a limb view through neighboring measurements, and represents these gradients by means of two-dimensional radiative transfer in the forward model of the retrieval. The scheme is applied to limb emission measurements from the Mars Climate Sounder instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Retrieval simulations using data from numerical models indicate that biases of up to 10 K in the winter polar region, obtained with standard retrievals using spherical symmetry, are reduced to about 2 K in most locations by the retrieval with two-dimensional radiative transfer. Retrievals from Mars atmospheric measurements suggest that the two-dimensional radiative transfer greatly reduces biases in temperature and aerosol opacity caused by observational geometry, predominantly in the polar winter regions.",

While working with digital images, quite often it is necessary to search for a specific image for a particular situation based on the visual contents of the image. This task looks easy if you are dealing with tens of images but it gets more difficult when the number of images goes from tens to hundreds and thousands, and the same content-based searching task becomes extremely complex when the number of images is in the millions. To deal with the situation, some intelligent way of content-based searching is required to fulfill the searching request with right visual contents in a reasonable amount of time.

        "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we address the retrieval of multi-modality medical volumes, which consist of two different imaging modalities, acquired sequentially, from the same scanner. One such example, positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT), provides physicians with complementary functional and anatomical features as well as spatial relationships and has led to improved cancer diagnosis, localisation, and staging. The challenge of multi-modality volume retrieval for cancer patients lies in representing the complementary geometric and topologic attributes between tumours and organs. These attributes and relationships, which are used for tumour staging and classification, can be formulated as a graph. It has been demonstrated that graph-based methods have high accuracy for retrieval by spatial similarity. However, na\u00efvely representing all relationships on a complete graph obscures the structure of the tumour-anatomy relationships. We propose a new graph structure derived from complete graphs that structurally constrains the edges connected to tumour vertices based upon the spatial proximity of tumours and organs. This enables retrieval on the basis of tumour localisation. We also present a similarity matching algorithm that accounts for different feature sets for graph elements from different imaging modalities. Our method emphasises the relationships between a tumour and related organs, while still modelling patient-specific anatomical variations. Constraining tumours to related anatomical structures improves the discrimination potential of graphs, making it easier to retrieve similar images based on tumour location. We evaluated our retrieval methodology on a dataset of clinical PET-CT volumes. Our results showed that our method enabled the retrieval of multi-modality images using spatial features. Our graph-based retrieval algorithm achieved a higher precision than several other retrieval techniques: gray-level histograms as well as state-of-the-art methods such as visual words using the scale- invariant feature transform (SIFT) and relational matrices representing the spatial arrangements of objects.",

It should be noted that the features used for the binary image and grayscale image may not be efficiently applicable to the color images. Obtained results indicate the same and it additionally shows that irrespective of numbers of images in database, developed Image Retrieval Systems retrieve images in very short period of time with high accuracy.

The increasing demand for individual and more flexible workflows asks for new methods that support domain experts to create, monitor, and adapt workflows. The emergent field of process-oriented case-based reasoning addresses this problem by proposing methods for reasoning with workflows based on experience. New workflows can be constructed by reuse of already available similar workflows from a repository. Hence, methods for the similarity assessment of workflows and for the efficient retrieval of similar workflows from a repository are of core importance. To this end, we describe a new generic model for representing workflows as semantically labeled graphs, together with a related model for knowledge intensive similarity measures. Further, new algorithms for workflow similarity computation, based on A\u204e search are described.

One of the important issues in real-time animation is that the existing motion retrieval techniques generally have a high matching time because they are typically based on matching time-series, making them less suitable for use with large motion databases. In this paper, we propose a different approach to motion retrieval, called Eigen-based Motion Retrieval (or EigenMR), to address this limitation of the existing methods by performing motion retrieval in the transform domain instead of the time domain. To differentiate the motion of different body parts, we propose to perform the matching on individual body parts as well as on the whole body. Our approach has the important advantage that each body part can be represented by an index of fixed size, consisting of a number of eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues. As a result, our approach has constant time complexity based on the number of motion files in the database instead of the size of the database. The experimental results show that our approach is both efficient and accurate compared with some of the latest methods. When applied to a motion database of 4 \\{GB\\} in size, our method requires approximately 20% of the standard time, making it more suitable for real-time animation.",

We compared the fretting and corrosion behavior of a group of modular neck designs to that of a design that had been recalled for risks associated with fretting and corrosion at the modular neck junction. Methods We previously analyzed fretting and corrosion on 60 retrieved Rejuvenate modular neck-stem implants. Here we compare those results to results from 26 retrieved implants from 7 other modular neck designs. For the 26 additional cases, histology slides of tissue collected at revision were reviewed and graded for aseptic lymphocyte-dominated vasculitis-associated lesion (ALVAL). Multivariate analyses were performed to assess differences in fretting and corrosion, adjusting for confounding factors (eg,\u00a0length of implantation). Results The Rejuvenate design had higher damage and corrosion scores than the other 7 designs (P\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.01). Histologic samples from the recalled design were 20 times more likely to show \\{ALVAL\\} than samples from the other designs (P &lt; .01). Mixed metal couples had higher fretting (P &lt; .01) and corrosion (P\u00a0= .02) scores than non-mixed metal couples. Conclusion Fretting and corrosion occurred on all modular neck-stem retrievals regardless of design. However, mixed metal couples suffered more corrosion than homogenous couples. This may be due to the lower modulus of the titanium alloy used for the stem, allowing for increased metal transfer and surface damage when loaded against a cobalt alloy modular neck, which in turn could account for the higher \\{ALVAL\\} and corrosion scores. Due to increased corrosion risk with mixed metals and increased neck fracture risk with non-mixed metal stem and necks, we suggest that clinicians avoid implantation of modular neck-stem systems.",

The estimates are derived for measuring the inversion error, the degree of model fit towards measurements (model determination coefficient) and the confidence intervals for the retrieved point source parameters (mainly, location and strength). The inversion error is reflected through an angular estimate which measures the deviation between the measured and predicted concentrations. The uncertainty estimation methodology is evaluated for point source reconstruction studies, using real measurements from two field experiments, known as Fusion Field Trials 2007 (FFT07) in flat terrain and Mock Urban Setting Test (MUST) in urban like terrain. In \\{FFT07\\} and \\{MUST\\} experiments, the point source location is retrieved with an average Euclidean distance of 22\u00a0m and 15\u00a0m respectively. The source strength is retrieved, on average, within a factor of 1.5 in both the datasets. The inversion error is observed as 24 o and 21 o in \\{FFT07\\} and \\{MUST\\} experiment, respectively.

We study conditions under which x 0 can be stably recovered from the measurements. In the noise-free setting we show that the number of measurements needed to ensure a unique and stable solution depends on the set T through its Gaussian mean-width, which can be computed explicitly for many sets of interest. In particular, for k-sparse inputs, O ( k log ( n / k ) ) measurements suffice, while if x 0 is an arbitrary vector in R n , O ( n ) measurements are sufficient. In the noisy case, we show that if the empirical risk is bounded by a given, computable constant that depends only on statistical properties of the noise, the error with respect to the true input is bounded by the same Gaussian parameter (up to logarithmic factors). Therefore, the number of measurements required for stable recovery is the same as in the noise-free setting up to log factors. It turns out that the complexity parameter for the quadratic problem is the same as the one used for analyzing stability in linear measurements under very general conditions. Thus, no substantial price has to be paid in terms of stability when there is no knowledge of the phase of the measurements.",

        "abstract": "Abstract There are many applications in business process management that require measuring the similarity between business processes, such as workflow retrieval and process mining, etc. However, most existing approaches and models cannot represent variable constraints and achieve data oriented workflow retrieval of considering different QoS requirements, and also fail to allow users to express arbitrary constraints based on graph structures of workflows. These problems will impede the customization and reuse of workflows, especially for data oriented workflows. In this paper, we will be towards workflow retrieval with variable time constraints. We propose a graph distance based approach for measuring the similarity between data oriented workflows with variable time constraints. First, a formal structure called Time Dependency Graph (TDG) is proposed and further used as representation model of workflows. Similarity comparison between two workflows can be reduced to computing the similarity between their TDGs. Second, we detect whether two \\{TDGs\\} of workflows for similarity comparison are compatible. A distance based measure is proposed for computing their similarity by their normalization matrices established based on their TDGs. We theoretically proof that the proposed measure satisfies the all the properties of distance. In addition, some exemplar processes are studied to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach of similarity comparison for workflows.",

In this work we introduce an improved theoretical model that describes light propagation in multilayered, turbid cylinders with a infinitely thick bottom layer, which simplifies calculations and reduces computation times. Our approach was validated with Monte Carlo simulations and single distance, time-resolved experiments on a three-layered phantom, where the absorption of the deepest layer was gradually modified. We were able to retrieve both, the scattering and absorption coefficient of this layer within reasonable errors. Hereby, changes in scattering were found to have less effect on the experimental data than absorption changes, making the reliable estimation of the reduced scattering coefficient more difficult in comparison to absorption. Stability of the implemented fitting routine was thoroughly analyzed, revealing that special care is needed to obtain accurate values for the reduced scattering coefficient.",

There exist linear-space data structures, that is, using O ( n ) words, that answer such queries in optimal O ( p + k ) time for an ample set of notions of relevance. However, using linear space is not sufficiently good for large text collections. In this paper we explore how far the space/time tradeoff for this problem can be pushed. We obtain three results: (1) When relevance is measured as term frequency (number of times P appears in a document T i ), an index occupying | \\{CSA\\} | + o ( n ) bits answers the query in time O ( t search ( p ) + k lg 2 k lg \u03b5 n ) , where \\{CSA\\} is a compressed suffix array indexing D , t search ( p ) is its time to find the suffix array interval of P, and \u03b5 &gt; 0 is any constant.

However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere system and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime Ta exclusively from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of daytime Ta under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous Ta under clear sky conditions (Ta , clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature (TaS) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (Ts) retrieved from MOD06_L2 product. Then a regression model between Ta , clear and Ts was established, and the instantaneous Ta under cloudy sky conditions (Ta , cloudy) was estimated by applying the regression model to Ts retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved the accuracy of Ta , clear retrievals with \\{MAE\\} = 1.95 \u00b0C, \\{RMSE\\} = 2.50 \u00b0C, and B = 0.02 in the EQB, and \\{MAE\\} = 2.02 \u00b0C, \\{RMSE\\} = 2.56 \u00b0C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The Ta , cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with Ta observations in both regions with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of \\{RMSE\\} calculated for the \\{EQB\\} and \\{SGP\\} were 3.42 \u00b0C and 2.91 \u00b0C, respectively.

In this paper, we address within a new framework the problem of 3D shape representation and shape similarity in human video sequences. Our shape representation is formulated using extremal human curve (EHC) descriptor extracted from the body surface. It allows taking benefits from Riemannian geometry in the open curve shape space and therefore computing statistics on it. It also allows subject pose comparison regardless of geometrical transformations and elastic surface change. Shape similarity is performed by an efficient method which takes advantage of a compact \\{EHC\\} representation in open curve shape space and an elastic distance measure. Thanks to these main assets, several important exploitations of the human action analysis are performed: shape similarity computation, video sequence comparison, video segmentation, video clustering, summarization and motion retrieval. Experiments on both synthetic and real 3D human video sequences show that our approach provides an accurate static and temporal shape similarity for pose retrieval in video, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, local 3D video retrieval is performed using motion segmentation and dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm in the feature vector space. The obtained results are promising and show the potential of this approach.",

In recent years, the support vector machine (SVM) based relevance feedbacks have been popular because they can outperform many other classifiers when the size of the training set is small, but they are often very complex and some unsatisfactory relevance of results occur frequently. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a \\{SVM\\} relevance feedback \\{CBIR\\} algorithm based on feature reconstruction, in which the covariance matrix based kernel empirical orthogonal complement component analysis is utilized. Firstly, the original input image space is projected nonlinearly onto a high-dimensional feature space by using nonlinear analysis approaches. Secondly, the covariance matrix of the positive feedback images are calculated, and the kernel empirical orthogonal complement components of the covariance matrix are also calculated. Thirdly, the new features of positive feedback images, negative feedback images, and all the remaining images are reconstructed by utilizing the kernel empirical orthogonal complement components of positive feedback images. Finally, a \\{SVM\\} classifier is constructed and all the images are resorted based on the new reconstructed image feature. Experiments on large databases show that the proposed algorithms are significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches.",

In a \\{RIF\\} paradigm, participants are trained on category\u2013exemplar pairs in Phase 1. Then, some exemplars from select categories (Rp+ items) receive further practice in Phase 2. At test, impaired recall for non-practiced exemplars of the practiced categories (Rp\u2212 items) is observed relative to exemplars from non-practiced categories (Nrp items). This difference constitutes RIF. Prior reports of spontaneous recovery from \\{RIF\\} indicate that \\{RIF\\} represents a lapse rather than a loss of memory. Empirical analogs and theoretical considerations suggest that \\{RIF\\} should also be reversible through a change of context between Phase 2 and testing (i.e., renewal). We conducted two experiments using human participants to evaluate the context dependency of RIF. In both experiments, Phases 1 and 2 occurred in distinctly different contexts with subsequent testing occurring in either the Phase 1 context or the Phase 2 context. \\{RIF\\} was observed in both experiments. Experiment 1 additionally found that the magnitude of \\{RIF\\} was not reduced by testing in the Phase 1 context relative to testing in the Phase 2 context. Experiment 2 further tested context dependency of \\{RIF\\} by (1) increasing the dissimilarity between the two contexts and (2) inserting a retention interval between Phase 2 and test for half of the participants in each test context condition. The data again indicated no effect of the context manipulation. Thus, no renewal from \\{RIF\\} was observed in either experiment; moreover, these null findings were supported by Bayesian analyses.

We apply day-specific calibrations of \\{AOD\\} data to predict PM2.5 concentrations within the New England area of the United States. To improve the accuracy of our model, land use and meteorological variables were incorporated. We used inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for nonrandom missingness of \\{AOD\\} and nested regions within days to capture spatial variation. With this approach we can control for the inherent day-to-day variability in the AOD-PM2.5 relationship, which depends on time-varying parameters such as particle optical properties, vertical and diurnal concentration profiles and ground surface reflectance among others. Out-of-sample \u201cten-fold\u201d cross-validation was used to quantify the accuracy of model predictions.

This finding is difficult to explain because there is no episode that binds the remembered item to the experimenter-controlled context features. The current study examines the neural correlates of false context retrieval when the context features can be traced to encoding episodes of semantically-similar items. Our neuroimaging results support a \u201cdissociated source\u201d mechanism for context borrowing in false memory. We found that parahippocampal cortex (PHc) activation, thought to indicate context retrieval, was greater during trials that involved context borrowing (an incorrect, but plausible source decision) than during baseline correct context retrieval. In contrast, hippocampal activation, thought to indicate retrieval of an episodic binding, was stronger during correct source retrieval than during context borrowing. Vivid context retrieval during false recollection experiences was also indicated by increased activation in visual perceptual regions for context borrowing as compared to other incorrect source judgments. The pattern of findings suggests that context borrowing can arise when unusually strong activation of a semantically-related item's contextual features drives relatively weak retrieval of the associated episodic binding with failure to confirm the item information within that binding. This dissociated source retrieval mechanism suggests that context-driven episodic retrieval does not necessarily lead to retrieval of specific item details. That is, source information can be retrieved in the absence of item memory.",

Research suggests that resemblance of a new situation to one or more in memory can lead to the sense of recognition when retrieval fails. The process responsible for this sense during retrieval failure is likely feature matching, whereby features in a current situation are matched to features stored in memory to produce a sense of familiarity. This supports the long-held idea that memory traces are basically sets of features or elements from earlier experiences. However, the work presented here goes beyond merely suggesting the existence of features within memory traces; the focus of the work presented here is on the following questions: What is a feature? What exactly are the features or elements of experiences that are somehow tied together within memory traces?

The present study examined whether \\{VBC\\} lesions affect motor function, conditioned place preference (CPP; implicit memory), and spatial learning (explicit memory) in the acquisition and retrieval phases. The results showed that rats with \\{VBC\\} lesions exhibited thermal hyperalgesia in the acquisition and retrieval phases, indicating that these lesions can induce CPSP. During these phases, the rats with \\{VBC\\} lesions exhibited enhanced (morphine-induced) \\{CPP\\} learning. These lesions did not affect the rats\u2019 total distance travelled, time spent, or velocity in the spatial learning tasks. The lesions also did not affect motor function in the rotarod task. Altogether, \\{VBC\\} lesions resulted in \\{CPSP\\} and facilitated \\{CPP\\} (implicit memory). However, the lesions did not affect spatial learning (explicit memory) or motor function. The relationship between \\{CPSP\\} and learning and memory is important for patients who suffer from such central pain. The implications of the present study may provide insights into helping reduce \\{CPSP\\} and its associated symptoms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The ever increasing Internet image collection densely samples the real world objects, scenes, etc. and is commonly accompanied with multiple metadata such as textual descriptions and user comments. Such image data has potential to serve as a knowledge source for large-scale image applications. Facilitated by such publically available and ever-increasing loosely annotated image data on the Internet, we propose a scalable data-driven solution for annotating and retrieving Web-scale image data. We extrapolate from large-scale loosely annotated images a compact and informative representation, namely ObjectPatchNet. Each vertex in ObjectPatchNet, which is called as an ObjectPatchNode, is defined as a collection of discriminative image patches annotated with object category labels. The edge linking two ObjectPatchNodes models the co-occurrence relationship among different objects in the same image. Therefore, ObjectPatchNet models not only probabilistically labeled image patches, but also the contextual relationship between objects. It is well suited to scalable image annotation task. Besides, we further take ObjectPatchNet as a visual vocabulary with semantic labels, and hence are able to easily develop inverted file indexing for efficient semantic image retrieval. ObjectPatchNet is tested on both large-scale image annotation and large-scale image retrieval applications. Experimental results manifest that ObjectPatchNet is both discriminative and efficient in these applications.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Adopting effective model to access the desired images is essential nowadays with the presence of a huge amount of digital images. The present paper introduces an accurate and rapid model for content based image retrieval process depending on a new matching strategy. The proposed model is composed of four major phases namely: features extraction, dimensionality reduction, \\{ANN\\} classifier and matching strategy. As for the feature extraction phase, it extracts a color and texture features, respectively, called color co-occurrence matrix (CCM) and difference between pixels of scan pattern (DBPSP). However, integrating multiple features can overcome the problems of single feature, but the system works slowly mainly because of the high dimensionality of the feature space. Therefore, the dimensionality reduction technique selects the effective features that jointly have the largest dependency on the target class and minimal redundancy among themselves. Consequently, these features reduce the calculation work and the computation time in the retrieval process. The artificial neural network (ANN) in our proposed model serves as a classifier so that the selected features of query image are the input and its output is one of the multi classes that have the largest similarity to the query image. In addition, the proposed model presents an effective feature matching strategy that depends on the idea of the minimum area between two vectors to compute the similarity value between a query image and the images in the determined class. Finally, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that the proposed model provides accurate retrieval results and achieve improvement in performance with significantly less computation time compared with other models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the independent pixel approximation (IPA), radiative transfer computations involving cloudy scenes require two separate calls to the radiative transfer model (RTM), one call for a clear sky scenario, the other for an atmosphere containing clouds. In this paper, clouds are considered as an optically homogeneous layer. We present two novel methods for \\{RTM\\} performance enhancement with particular application to trace gas retrievals under cloudy conditions. Both methods are based on reusing results from clear-sky \\{RTM\\} calculations to speed up corresponding calculations for the cloud-filled scenario. The first approach is numerically exact, and has been applied to the discrete-ordinate with matrix exponential (DOME) RTM. Results from the original clear sky computation can be saved in the memory and reused for the non-cloudy layers in the second computation. In addition, for the whole-atmosphere boundary-value approach to the determination of the intensity field, we can exploit a \u2019telescoping technique\u2019 to reduce the dimensionality (and hence the computational effort for the solution) of the boundary value problem in the absence of Rayleigh scattering contributions for higher azimuthal components of the radiation field. The second approach is (for the cloudy scenario) to generate a spectral correction applied to the radiation field from a fast two-stream RTM. This correction is based on the use of principal-component analysis (PCA) applied to a given window of spectral optical property data, in order to exploit redundancy in the data and confine the number of full-stream multiple scatter computations to the first few \\{EOFs\\} (Empirical Orthogonal Functions) arising from the PCA. This method has been applied to the \\{LIDORT\\} RTM; although the method involves some approximation, it provides accuracy better than 0.2%, and a speed-up factor of approximately 2 compared with two calls of RTM.",

Our method is characterized by the following two points: (1) it requires no special device such as special paper other than a camera-pen to recover handwritings, (2) if the handwriting is on a printed document, the method is capable of localizing it onto an electronic equivalent of the printed document. The above points are enabled by the following processing. The handwriting is recovered by the \\{LK\\} tracking to trace the move of the pen-tip. The recovered shape is localized onto the corresponding part of the electronic document with the help of document image retrieval called \\{LLAH\\} (locally likely arrangement hashing). A new framework for stably estimating the homography from a camera-captured image to the corresponding electronic document allows us to localize the recovered handwritings accurately. We experimentally evaluate the accuracy, processing time and memory usage of the proposed method using 30 handwritings. From the comparison to other methods that implement alternative ways for realizing the same functionality, we have confirmed that the proposed method is superior to those other methods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Process-based ecophysiological models, which simulate carbon exchange at the land-surface, are powerful and indispensable tools for understanding how vegetation behaves under present and future climate. However, these models are necessarily complex, containing numerous biophysical parameters which are often poorly defined. The current study develops a novel retrieval of Rubisco-limited top-of-canopy photosynthetic capacity (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate, V cmax 25 , toc ), which is one of the most critical parameters in the calculation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The retrieval combines standard remote sensing satellite products of Leaf Area Index (LAI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with a hyperspectral index of total canopy chlorophyll concentration from the \\{MEdium\\} Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Monthly values of V cmax 25 , toc are determined over a 9 year period for 296 global \\{FLUXNET\\} sites (catalogue made available online) and 8 Plant Functional Types (PFTs). \\{PFT\\} averages agree favourably with compilations of field-based measurements. However, according to a Monte Carlo analysis, our method is still currently subject to large systematic uncertainties (25\u201330%), much of which arises from the empirical relationship between maximum electron transport and leaf chlorophyll content. For all 8 PFTs, except tropical broadleaf forest, V cmax 25 , toc varies considerably across the season (generally a factor of 1.6). Similarly, variability between sites of the same \\{PFT\\} is significant (interquartile range is 40% of the median). This suggests an important additional role for satellites in the spatial and temporal parameterisation of carbon models. Inclusion of this temporal and spatial variability in a process-based ecophysiological model produces, respectively, an impact of 11% and 12% on simulated GPP.",

The findings suggested that early chronic Pb exposure altered the development of critical exploratory functions needed for learning and survival. Behaviors exhibited in novel spatial and novel object zone perimeters suggested that the Object-in-Place task is a valid measure of visual spatial and visual object memory in pre-adolescent C57BL/6J mice.

As such, the inconsistency between observations of its abundance and estimated sources and sinks is an important problem requiring urgent attention (Carpenter et al., 2014) [5]. Satellite remote-sensing has a role to play, particularly limb sounders which can provide vertical profiles into the stratosphere and therefore validate stratospheric loss rates in atmospheric models. This work is in two parts. The first describes new and improved high-resolution infra-red absorption cross sections of carbon tetrachloride/dry synthetic air over the spectral range 700\u2013860 cm\u22121 for a range of temperatures and pressures (7.5\u2013760 Torr and 208\u2013296 K) appropriate for atmospheric conditions. This new cross-section dataset improves upon the one currently available in the \\{HITRAN\\} and \\{GEISA\\} databases. The second describes a new, preliminary ACE-FTS carbon tetrachloride retrieval that improves upon the v3.0/v3.5 data products, which are biased high by up to ~20\u201330% relative to ground measurements.

This paper reports the findings of a user study that explored temporal information searching behaviour and strategies in a laboratory setting. Information needs were grouped into three temporal classes (Past, Recency, and Future) to systematically study their characteristics. The main findings of our experiment are as follows. (1) It is intuitive for people to augment topical keywords with temporal expressions such as history, recent, or future as a tactic of temporal search. (2) However, such queries produce mixed results and the success of query reformulations appears to depend on topics to a large extent. (3) Search engine interfaces should detect temporal information needs to trigger the display of temporal search options. (4) Finding a relevant Wikipedia page or similar summary page is a popular starting point of past information needs. (5) Current search engines do a good job for information needs related to recent events, but more work is needed for past and future tasks. (6) Participants found it most difficult to find future information. Searching for domain experts was a key tactic in Future search, and file types of relevant documents are different from other temporal classes.

Its objective is to retrieve a set of homogeneous blocks from a two-dimensional storage by minimizing the waiting times during their retrieval. An integer programming model and a heuristic algorithm are developed to solve this optimization problem. The mathematical model is able to solve small-size cases to optimality in reasonable computational times. Unfortunately, it requires large computational times when tackling medium and large-size scenarios. For its part, the heuristic algorithm overcomes the problems associated with the computational burden of the model by bringing forward the availability of blocks to retrieve from the storage. With this goal in mind, several look ahead strategies dedicated to perform the most promising predictive block relocation movements are proposed.

Two physical pretreatments were performed at pilot scale in order to recover electrodic powders: the first including crushing, milling, and sieving and the second granulation, and sieving. Recovery yield of electrodic powder was significantly influenced by the type of pretreatment. About 50% of initial \\{LIB\\} wastes was recovered by the first treatment (as electrodic powder with size &lt;0.5 mm, Sample 1), while only 37% of powder with size &lt;1 mm (Sample 2) can be recovered by the second treatment.

Leaching tests of both powders were performed in order to determine optimized conditions for metal extraction. Solid/liquid ratios and sulfuric acid concentrations were changed according to factorial designs at constant temperature (80 \u00b0C). Optimized conditions for quantitative extraction (&gt;99%) of Co and Li from Sample 1 are 1/10 g/mL as solid/liquid ratio and +50% stoichiometric excess of acid (1.1 M). Using the same solid/liquid ratio, +100% acid excess (1.2 M) is necessary to extract 96% of Co and 86% of Li from Sample 2. Best conditions for leaching of Sample 2 using glucose are +200% acid excess (1.7 M) and 0.05 M glucose concentration. Optimized conditions found in this work are among the most effective reported in the literature in term of Co extraction and reagent consumption.",

Both the encoding and retrieval tasks were completed in the fMRI scanner. Conjunction analyses were used to reveal the overlap between encoding and retrieval processing. These results revealed that, compared to positive or neutral contexts, words that were recollected and previously encoded in a negative context showed greater encoding-to-retrieval overlap, including in the ventral visual stream and amygdala.

        "abstract": "Abstract Remote sensing has mainly relied on measurements of scalar radiance and its spectral and angular features to retrieve micro- and macro-physical properties of aerosols/hydrosols. However, it is recognized that measurements that include the polarimetric characteristics of light provide more intrinsic information about particulate scattering. To take advantage of this, we used vector radiative transfer (VRT) simulations and developed an analytical relationship to retrieve the macro and micro-physical properties of the oceanic hydrosols. Specifically, we investigated the relationship between the observed degree of linear polarization (DoLP) and the ratio of attenuation-to-absorption coefficients (c/a) in water, from which the scattering coefficient can be readily computed (b = c \u2212 a), after retrieving a. This relationship was parameterized for various scattering geometries, including sensor zenith/azimuth angles relative to the Sun's principal plane, and for varying Sun zenith angles. An inversion method was also developed for the retrieval of the microphysical properties of hydrosols, such as the bulk refractive index and the particle size distribution. The DoLP vs c/a relationship was tested and validated against in-situ measurements of underwater light polarization obtained by a custom-built polarimeter and measurements of the coefficients a and c, obtained using an in-water \\{WET\\} Labs ac-s instrument package. These measurements confirmed the validity of the approach, with retrievals of attenuation coefficients showing a high coefficient of determination depending on the wavelength. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the DoLP at the Top of Atmosphere (TOA) over coastal waters showing the possibility of polarimetric remote sensing application for ocean color.",

Coherent and incoherent crop height estimation methods are discussed for the first time with a unique TanDEM-X dataset acquired over rice cultivation areas. Indeed, with its polarimetric and interferometric capabilities, the TanDEM-X mission enables the tracking of crop height through interferometric \\{SAR\\} (InSAR), polarimetric interferometric \\{SAR\\} (PolInSAR) and the inversion of radiative transfer-based backscattering model. The paper evaluates the three aforementioned techniques simultaneously with a data set acquired in September 2014 and 2015 over rice fields in Turkey during their reproductive stage. The assessment of the absolute height accuracy and the limitations of the approaches are provided. In-situ measurements conducted in the same cultivation periods are used for validation purposes. The PolInSAR and morphological backscattering model results showed better performance with low \\{RMSEs\\} (12 and 13 cm) compared to the differential InSAR result having \\{RMSE\\} of 18 cm. The spatial baseline, i.e. the distance between satellites, is a key parameter for coherent methods such as InSAR and PolInSAR. Its effect on the absolute height accuracy is discussed using TanDEM-X pairs separated by a baseline of 101.7m and 932m. Although the InSAR based approach is demonstrated to provide sufficient crop height accuracy, the availability of a precise vegetation-free digital elevation model and a structurally dense crop are basic requirements for achieving high accuracy. The PolInSAR approach provides reliable crop height estimation if the spatial baseline is large enough for the inversion. The impact of increasing spatial baseline on the absolute accuracy of the crop height estimation is evident for both methods. However, PolInSAR is more cost-efficient, e.g. there is no need for phase unwrapping and any external vegetation free surface elevation data. Instead, the usage of radiative transfer based backscattering models provides not only crop height but also other biophysical properties of the crops with consistent accuracy. The efficient retrieval of crop height with backscattering model is achieved by metamodelling, which makes the computational cost of backscattering inversion comparable to the ones of the coherent methods. However, effectiveness depends on not only the backscattering model, but also the integration of agronomic crop growth rules. Motivated by these results, a combination of backscattering and PolInSAR inversion models would provide a successful method of future precision farming studies.",

We start with deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA), a deep approach for mapping text and image pairs into a common latent space. We first propose a novel progressive framework and embed \\{DCCA\\} in it. In our progressive framework, a linear projection loss layer is inserted before the nonlinear hidden layers of a deep network. The training of linear projection and the training of nonlinear layers are combined to ensure that the linear projection is well matched with the nonlinear processing stages and good representations of the input raw data are learned at the output of the network. Then we introduce a hypergraph semantic embedding (HSE) method, which extracts latent semantics from texts, into \\{DCCA\\} to regularize the latent space learned by image view and text view. In addition, a search-based similarity measure is proposed to score relevance of image-text pairs. Based on the above ideas, we propose a model, called DCCA-PHS, for cross-modal retrieval. Experiments on three publicly available data sets show that DCCA-PHS is effective and efficient, and achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised scenario.",

        "abstract": "Abstract To determine aerosol optical thickness, AOT, and other geophysical parameters describing conditions in the atmosphere and at the earth's surface by inversion of remote sensing measurements from space based instrumentation, it is necessary to separate ground scenes into cloud free and cloudy or cloud contaminated. Identifying the presence of cloud in a ground scene and establishing an accurate and adequate cloud mask is a challenging task. In this study, measurements by the European Space Agency (ESA) \\{MEdium\\} Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) have been used to develop a cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm for preprocessing prior to application of the new algorithm called eXtensible Bremen \\{AErosol\\} Retrieval (XBAER), which retrieves AOT. The new \\{XBAER\\} cloud identification and cloud mask algorithm is called XBAER-CM. This uses thresholds of the reflectance and reflectance ratios measured by \\{MERIS\\} at Top Of Atmosphere (TOA). In this study the parameters used to determine the presence of cloud in ground scenes are i) the brightness of the scenes, ii) the homogeneity or variability of the radiance and iii) cloud height or altitude information. The threshold values used to identify the presence of cloud are selected by using accurate radiative transfer modeling with different surface and atmospheric scenarios. A histogram analysis has been used for different cloud (thin, thick, two-layers, aerosol contaminated cloud), aerosol (dust and biomass burning) and surface scenarios (vegetation, urban, desert and water). Additionally, a snow/ice detection algorithm has been adapted from MerIs Cloud fRation fOr Sciamachy (MICROS) algorithm. A validation for the resulting cloud mask data products has been undertaken. This comprised i) comparison of regions scenes, which have been manually generated by experts and ii) more global comparison with cloud identification data products from surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP).

In remembering texts, people can retrieve some of the specific words and idea content of the message but most robust is their memory of the situation to which the message alluded. This enables people to recall and recognize text content long after the original reading. The basic cognitive mechanisms of remembering text and of learning from text are examined. Regarding the memories that enable comprehension, each successive text segment can remind the reader of what preceded and of relevant world knowledge. Access to these memories is regulated by the current segment's similarity to and distance from the prior text, and of the typicality and distinctiveness of that text. Throughout, the mechanisms of text memory are regarded as common to rather than distinct from memory in other cognitive domains.",

Here we investigate whether verbal labels can scaffold flexible memory retrieval when task difficulty increases and consider the mechanism responsible for the effect of language cues on early memory flexibility. Twelve-month-old infants were provided with English, Chinese, or empty language cues during a difficult imitation task, a combined change in the puppet\u2019s colour and form at the test (Hayne et al., 1997). Imitation performance by infants in the English language condition only exceeded baseline performance after the 10-min delay. Thus, verbal labels facilitated flexible memory retrieval on this task. There were no correlations between infants\u2019 language comprehension and imitation performance. Thus, it is likely that verbal labels facilitate both attention and categorisation during encoding and retrieval.",

This paper deals with the knowledge representation, retrieval and reuse supporting the design stage of product families. Usually, the methods in the literature do not focus on the retrieve and the reusability of the knowledge. In other words, they do not ensure if a non-expert user can effectively retrieve and reuse the represented knowledge. To cope with this point, here, the aim is to apply an anti-logicist approach for the unambiguous design-knowledge representation to support the unambiguous retrieval and the automatic reuse of the knowledge during a product family design stage. The retrieval is unambiguous because the link between the knowledge models and the requirements is based on a syntax comparison, e.g. intervals of numbers, units of measure. An algorithm for the automatic reuse has been developed: provided an unambiguous definition of the new requirements related to the product family, the algorithm\u2019s outputs are the functional and physical definitions of all the products included in the product families, i.e. performances and \\{CAD\\} files.

        "abstract": "Summary Memories about sensory experiences are tightly linked to the context in which they were formed. Memory contextualization is fundamental for the selection of appropriate behavioral reactions needed for survival, yet the underlying neuronal circuits are poorly understood. By combining trans-synaptic viral tracing and optogenetic manipulation, we found that the ventral hippocampus (vHC) and the amygdala, two key brain structures encoding context and emotional experiences, interact via multiple parallel pathways. A projection from the vHC to the basal amygdala mediates fear behavior elicited by a conditioned context, whereas a parallel projection from a distinct subset of vHC neurons onto midbrain-projecting neurons in the central amygdala is necessary for context-dependent retrieval of cued fear memories. Our findings demonstrate that two fundamentally distinct roles of context in fear memory retrieval are processed by distinct vHC output pathways, thereby allowing for the formation of robust contextual fear memories while preserving context-dependent behavioral flexibility.",

We tested participants' memory for complex laboratory events (LEs) that differed in perceptual content: short stories were either presented as perceptually rich film clips or as perceptually impoverished narratives. Participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while retrieving these \\{LEs\\} (narratives and clips), as well as events from their personal life (autobiographical memories). In a group of healthy adults, a conjunction analysis showed that both real-life and laboratory memories engaged overlapping regions from an autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval network, indicating that laboratory memories mimicked autobiographical events successfully. A direct contrast between the film clip and the narrative laboratory conditions identified regions activated by the retrieval of perceptual memory content, which included the right hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, middle occipital gyrus and precuneus. In individuals with medial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) originating from the right hippocampus, the magnitude of this \u201cperceptually rich\u201d signal was reduced significantly, which is consistent with evidence of reduced perceptual memory content in this clinical population. In healthy controls, right hippocampal activation also correlated positively with a behavioral measure of perceptual content in the clip condition. Thus, right hippocampal activity contributed to the retrieval of perceptual episodic memory content in the healthy brain, while right hippocampal damage disrupted activation in regions that process perceptual memory content. Our results suggest that the hippocampus contributes to recollection by retrieving and integrating perceptual details into vivid memory constructs.",

How social information is stored into long-term social memory, however, is still under debate. Here, brain c-Fos expression was measured after adult mice were exposed to familiar or novel juveniles and expression was compared in several memory and socially relevant brain areas. Machine Learning algorithm Random Forest was then used to predict the social interaction category of adult mice based on c-Fos expression in these areas. Interaction with a familiar co-specific altered brain activation in the olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus, lateral septum and medial prefrontal cortex. Remarkably, Random Forest was able to predict interaction with a familiar juvenile with 100% accuracy. Activity in the olfactory bulb, amygdala, hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex were crucial to this prediction. From our results, we suggest long-term social memory depends on initial social olfactory processing in the medial amygdala and its output connections synergistically with non-social contextual integration by the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex top-down modulation of primary olfactory structures.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Successful memory for an image can be supported by retrieval of one\u2019s personal reaction to the image (i.e., internal vividness), as well as retrieval of the specific details of the image itself (i.e., external vividness). Prior research suggests that memory vividness relies on regions within the medial temporal lobe, particularly the hippocampus, but it is unclear whether internal and external vividness are supported by the hippocampus in a similar way. To address this open question, the current study examined hippocampal connectivity associated with enhanced internal and external vividness ratings during retrieval. Participants encoded complex visual images paired with verbal titles. During a scanned retrieval session, they were presented with the titles and asked whether each had been seen with an image during encoding. Following retrieval of each image, participants were asked to rate internal and external vividness. Increased hippocampal activity was associated with higher vividness ratings for both scales, supporting prior evidence implicating the hippocampus in retrieval of memory detail. However, different patterns of hippocampal connectivity related to enhanced external and internal vividness. Further, hippocampal connectivity with medial prefrontal regions was associated with increased ratings of internal vividness, but with decreased ratings of external vividness. These findings suggest that the hippocampus may contribute to increased internal and external vividness via distinct mechanisms and that external and internal vividness of memories should be considered as separable measures.",

Using multi-spectral RapidEye imagery allowed Chll to be retrieved with a Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of 7.9 \u03bcg cm\u2212 2 (16%), based upon in-situ measurements conducted in fields of alfalfa, Rhodes grass and maize over the course of a growing season. \\{LAI\\} and Chll compensation effects on canopy reflectance were largely avoided by informing the inversion process with ancillary \\{LAI\\} inputs established empirically on the basis of a statistical machine learning technique.

Results highlighted the considerable challenges associated with the translation of at-sensor radiance observations to surface bidirectional reflectances in dryland environments, where issues such as high aerosol loadings and large spatial gradients in surface reflectance from bright desert soils to dark vegetated fields are often present. Indeed, surface reflectances in the visible bands were reduced by up to 60% after correction for such adjacency effects. In addition, dust deposition on leaves required explicit modification of the reflectance sub-model to account for its influence. By implementing these model refinements, \\{REGFLEC\\} demonstrated its utility for within-field characterization of vegetation conditions over the challenging landscapes typical of dryland agricultural regions, offering a means through which improvements can be made in the management of these globally important systems.",

The information content in these hyperspectral measurements is analyzed for 6 principal components (PCs) of surface spectra and a total of 14 aerosol parameters that describe the columnar aerosol volume V total , fine-mode aerosol volume fraction, and the size distribution and wavelength-dependent index of refraction in both coarse and fine mode aerosols. Forward simulations of atmospheric radiative transfer are conducted for 5 surface types (green vegetation, bare soil, rangeland, concrete and mixed surface case) and a wide range of aerosol mixtures. It is shown that the \\{PCs\\} of surface spectra in the atmospheric window channel could be derived from the top-of-the-atmosphere reflectance in the conditions of low aerosol optical depth (AOD \u2264 0.2 at 550 nm), with a relative error of 1%. With degree freedom for signal analysis and the sequential forward selection method, the common bands for different aerosol mixture types and surface types can be selected for aerosol retrieval. The first 20% of our selected bands accounts for more than 90% of information content for aerosols, and only 4 \\{PCs\\} are needed to reconstruct surface reflectance.

Recent research shows that na\u00efve concepts acquired during childhood persist in long-term memory long after learning the scientifically correct concepts in school. In this study, we investigated the effects of stress on the retrieval of these conceptual representations. To this end, 40 healthy men were randomly assigned to either psychosocial stress or a control condition and evaluated, as quickly and accurately as possible, statements that were compatible with scientific concepts or incompatible with those concepts. Some of these statements were true and some were false. Incompatible statements in this case are statements which are in line with adults\u2019 scientific concepts, but not with children\u2019s na\u00efve theories. In contrast, compatible statements are in line with both. Stress induction was successful as evidenced by increases in blood pressure and cortisol concentrations in the stress group compared to the control group. Responses were delayed and less accurate for incompatible compared to compatible statements. Psychosocial stress had no main effect on retrieval, but abolished reaction time differences on false- vs. true-incompatible statements. This effect was mirrored in correlations between individuals\u2019 cortisol increases and reaction times. These results suggest that stress, as embodied by increases in cortisol concentrations, interferes with the retrieval of conceptual knowledge.

The most well-known term weighting approach, the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF) method, is often used to assign term weights that support such applications. Thomson Reuters reports pertinent incoming news (e.g., the refugee crisis in Europe) over a given period of time, and the most prominent terms (e.g., \u201crefugee\u201d) are thus frequently found in a large collection of news stories. When term weights are measured via the \\{TFIDF\\} method, such weights must be heavily compromised while the collection of news is sufficiently large. As the \\{TFIDF\\} approach is vulnerable to biases because the most important terms are typically referred to as noise, thus leading lower term weights, news retrieval without the use of the most important terms is difficult and ineffective. We thus present a new distance-based term weighting method for overcoming this bias by considering a basic characteristic whereby each news article must be similar or different from others while processing big news that include large amounts of news. All news must not be considered to contribute equally to the weighting of a particular term. In this study, the weight of a particular term is assessed based on its distance in an article to other instances of the same term, and this weight is highly sensitive to whether similar articles cause a term to occur and to whether different articles cause a term to disappear. The most important terms are thus delivered in large news corpora when studying similarities between news stories. In addition, we create a two-stage learning algorithm to refine the term's weights, and we develop an intelligent model that applies our term weighting method to Reuters news analyses based upon classification and clustering problems. The experimental results show that our methods perform better performance than \\{TFIDF\\} in terms of news classification and clustering.",

Both geometry and spatial information descriptions are critical for a 3D local descriptor, while most previous studies concentrate on the former one. This paper investigates on how the characterization of spatial information would affect a 3D local descriptor in terms of descriptiveness, robustness, compactness and efficiency. The evaluation process is deployed as follows. First, based on the analysis of representative spatial information characterization methods of existing local shape descriptors, six typical characterization methods with different spatial dimensions and partition principles of spatial information are presented. Second, three geometric attributes, i.e., normal deviation, local depth and shape index, are respectively assigned to each point in the local surface for local geometry description, creating a total of 18 different feature descriptors. Then, a quantitative analysis of performance (i.e., descriptiveness, robustness, compactness and efficiency) for these descriptors is carried out on three benchmark datasets. Grounded on the experimental outcomes, the traits, merits and demerits of each spatial information encoding approach are eventually summarized. This study reveals that different spatial information encoding approaches would bring significant effect on a local shape descriptor with respect to its discriminative power, stability, compactness and efficiency.",

Then, the plain image is encrypted to the ciphertext with the white noise distribution by using the phase-truncated Fourier-transform-based encoding scheme with the previous encryption keys. The encryption process is nonlinear in which no iterative calculation is involved, while the decryption process is linear which can be easily implemented with the 4 f optical system. Moreover, less constraints makes the specific attack unusable. Simulation results are given to verify the feasibility and robustness of the proposed encryption scheme.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Quantification of vegetation properties plays an important role in the assessment of ecosystem functions with leaf dry mater content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) being two key functional traits. For the first time, these two leaf traits have been estimated from the airborne images (HySpex) using the \\{INFORM\\} radiative transfer model and Continuous Wavelet Analysis (CWA). Ground truth data, were collected for 33 sample plots during a field campaign in July 2013 in the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, concurrent with the hyperspectral overflight. The \\{INFORM\\} model was used to simulate the canopy reflectance of the test site and the simulated spectra were transformed to wavelet features by applying CWA. Next, the top 1% strongly correlated wavelet features with the \\{LDMC\\} and \\{SLA\\} were used to develop predictive (regression) models. The two leaf traits were then retrieved using the \\{CWA\\} transformed HySpex imagery and the predictive models. The results were validated using \\{R2\\} and the \\{RMSE\\} of the estimated and measured variables. Our results revealed strong correlations between six wavelet features and LDMC, as well as between four wavelet features and SLA. The wavelet features at 1741 nm (scale 5) and 2281 nm (scale 4) were the two most strongly correlated with \\{LDMC\\} and \\{SLA\\} respectively. The combination of all the identified wavelet features for \\{LDMC\\} yielded the most accurate prediction (R2 = 0.59 and \\{RMSE\\} = 4.39%). However, for \\{SLA\\} the most accurate prediction was obtained from the single most correlated feature: 2281 nm, scale 4 (R2 = 0.85 and \\{RMSE\\} = 4.90). Our results demonstrate the applicability of Continuous Wavelet Analysis (CWA) when inverting radiative transfer models, for accurate mapping of forest leaf functional traits.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the blogosphere, different actors express their opinions about multiple topics. Users, companies or editors socially interact by commenting, recommending and linking blogs and posts. These social media contents are increasingly growing. As a matter of fact, the size of the blogosphere is estimated to double every six months. In this context, the problem of finding a topically relevant blog to subscribe to becomes a Big Data challenge. Moreover, combining multiple types of evidence is essential for this search task. In this paper we propose a group of textual and social-based signals, and apply different Information Fusion algorithms for a blog distillation search task. Information fusion through the combination of the different types of evidence requires optimisation for appropriately weighting each source of evidence. To this end, we analyse well-established population-based search methods. Namely, global search (Particle Swarm Optimisation and Differential Evolution) and a local search method (Line Search) that has been effective in various Information Retrieval tasks. Moreover, we propose hybrid combinations between the global search and the local search method and compare all the alternatives following a standard methodology. Efficiency is an imperative here and, therefore, we focus not only on achieving high search effectiveness but also on designing efficient solutions.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background: Co-change prediction makes developers aware of which artifacts will change together with the artifact they are working on. In the past, researchers relied on structural analysis to build prediction models. More recently, hybrid approaches relying on historical information and textual analysis have been proposed. Despite the advances in the area, software developers still do not use these approaches widely, presumably because of the number of false recommendations. We conjecture that the contextual information of software changes collected from issues, developers\u2019 communication, and commit metadata captures the change patterns of software artifacts and can improve the prediction models. Objective: Our goal is to develop more accurate co-change prediction models by using contextual information from software changes. Method: We selected pairs of files based on relevant association rules and built a prediction model for each pair relying on their associated contextual information. We evaluated our approach on two open source projects, namely Apache \\{CXF\\} and Derby. Besides calculating model accuracy metrics, we also performed a feature selection analysis to identify the best predictors when characterizing co-changes and to reduce overfitting. Results: Our models presented low rates of false negatives (\u223c8% average rate) and false positives (\u223c11% average rate). We obtained prediction models with \\{AUC\\} values ranging from 0.89 to 1.00 and our models outperformed association rules, our baseline model, when we compared their precision values. Commit-related metrics were the most frequently selected ones for both projects. On average, 6 out of 23 metrics were necessary to build the classifiers. Conclusions: Prediction models based on contextual information from software changes are accurate and, consequently, they can be used to support software maintenance and evolution, warning developers when they miss relevant artifacts while performing a software change.",

The methodology that is illustrated assumes that post-event damage assessments are useful to verify to what extent hazard and risk assessments that were available to planners to make decisions before the disaster were correct and if they were actually used as a basis for locational and zoning choices. Our contribution is aimed at the creation and design of knowledge bases accounting for the dynamic evolution of disasters. New web based technologies provide the opportunity to collect and analyse dynamic territorial crisis data using crowdsourcing and crowdmapping platforms. The proposed methodology permits to sort and classify a very large set of different types of data generated through the web. Semantic conceptualization using ontologies is performed to identify and select the information produced during the emergency that can support spatial planning in the post disaster reconstruction. The city of Tacloban in the Philippines, affected by the Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 constitutes the test case for applying the methodology that has been developed.",

Extracting spatiotemporal and semantic information from a set of Web documents enables us to build a rich representation of geographic knowledge described in text, capturing where, when, or what events have occurred. This work investigates the role ontologies play as a key component in the process of semantic information extraction. We show how ontologies can be used in conjunction with natural language gazetteers in order to process semantic information about hazard events and augment spatiotemporal extraction with semantics. We are interested in capturing the spatiotemporal patterns of hazard-related events from online news reports to track the occurrences and evolution of natural hazards, such as severe storms. A hazard ontology has been created to assist the spatiotemporal information extraction process, especially with the automatic detection of different kinds of events at multiple granularities from unstructured texts revealing relationships between the events over space\u2013time. The extraction and retrieval of semantic information about event dynamics provides information about the progression of events using both natural and human perspectives.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recognition of a previously experienced item or object depends upon the successful retrieval of memory for the object. The neural mechanisms that support object recognition memory in the mammalian brain are not well understood. The rodent hippocampus plays a well-established role in spatial memory, and we previously demonstrated that temporary inactivation of the mouse hippocampus impairs object memory, as assessed with a novel object preference (NOP) test. The present studies were designed to test some remaining issues regarding the contribution of the \\{CA1\\} sub-region of the mouse dorsal hippocampus to long-term object memory. Specifically, we examined whether the retrieval of spatial memory (as assessed by the Morris water maze; MWM) and object recognition memory are differentially sensitive to inactivation of the \\{CA1\\} region. The current study used pre-test local microinfusion of muscimol directly into the \\{CA1\\} region of dorsal hippocampus to temporarily interrupt its function during the respective retrieval phases of both behavioral tasks, in order to compare the contribution of the \\{CA1\\} to object memory and spatial memory. Histological analyses revealed that local intra-CA1 injection of muscimol diffused within, and not beyond, the \\{CA1\\} region of dorsal hippocampus. The degree of memory retrieval impairment induced by muscimol was comparable in the two tasks, supporting the view that object memory and spatial memory depend similarly on the \\{CA1\\} region of rodent hippocampus. Further, we confirmed that the muscimol-induced impairment of \\{CA1\\} function is temporary. First, mice that exhibited impaired object memory retrieval immediately after intra-CA1 muscimol, subsequently exhibited unimpaired retrieval of object memory when tested 24 h later. Secondly, a cohort of mice that exhibited impaired object memory retrieval after intra-CA1 muscimol later acquired spatial memory in the \\{MWM\\} comparable to that of control mice. Together, these results offer further support for the involvement of the \\{CA1\\} region of mouse hippocampus in object recognition memory, and provide evidence to suggest that the \\{NOP\\} task is as much a test of hippocampal function as the classic \\{MWM\\} test.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Studies in our laboratory have characterized the putative neuromodulatory effects of a standardized extract of the green leaves of Ginkgo biloba (EGb), which comprises a formulation of 24% ginkgo-flavoglycosides and 6% ginkgo-terpenoid lactones, on conditioned suppression. This model comprises a suitable animal model for investigating the behavioral changes and pharmacological mechanisms that underlie fear memory and anxiety. The characterization of the effects on distinct stages of fear memory or fear extinction will help illustrate both the beneficial and harmful effects. Three hundred adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 30 groups according to the treatment as follows: i\u2013ii) control groups (CS-US and CSno-US); iii) vehicle group (12% Tween\u00ae80); and iv\u2013vi) \\{EGb\\} groups (250, 500 and 1000 mg kg\u2212 1); or experimental procedures designed to assess the effects of \\{EGb\\} treatment prior to the acquisition (n = 20 per group) and retrieval of conditioned fear (n = 10 per group) or prior to the extinction training (n = 10 per group) and extinction retention test (n = 10 per group). Furthermore, to better understand the effects of acute \\{EGb\\} treatment on fear memory, we conducted two additional analyses: the acquisition of within- and between-session extinction of fear memory (short- and long-term memory, respectively). No difference was identified between the control and treatment groups during the retention test (P &gt; 0.05), with the exception of the CSno-US group in relation to all groups (P &lt; 0.05). A between-session analysis indicated that \\{EGb\\} at 250 mg kg\u2212 1 facilitated the acquisition of extinction fear memory, which was verified by the suppression ration in the first trial of extinction training (SR = 0.39) and the extinction retention test session (SR = 0.53, P &lt; 0.05), without impairments in fear memory acquisition, which were evaluated during the retention test (SR = 0.79). Moreover, \\{EGb\\} administered at 1000 mg kg\u2212 1 prior to conditioning did not enhance the long-term extinction memory, i.e., it did not prevent the return of extinguished fear memory in the extinction retention test, in which the spontaneous recovery of fear was demonstrated (SR = 0.63, P &lt; 0.05); however, it significantly facilitated short-term memory as verified by data from the within-session extinction (1 to 8\u201310 trials) during the retention test (SR = 0.73 to \\{SR\\} = 0.59; P &lt; 0.05) and the extinction retention test (SR = 0.63 to \\{SR\\} = 0.41; P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, spontaneous recovery was identified in response to a higher dose of \\{EGb\\} when administered prior to extinction training (SR = 0.75, P &lt; 0.05) and the extinction retention test (SR = 0.70; P &lt; 0.05). At dose of 500 mg kg\u2212 1 \\{EGb\\} reduced the suppression ratio when administered prior to the retention test (SR = 0.57) and extinction training (SR = 0.55; P &lt; 0.05) without preventing the acquisition of fear memory, which suggests that \\{EGb\\} has anti-anxiety effects. Taken together, the current findings suggest that \\{EGb\\} differentially modulates short- and long-term memory, as well as anxiety-like behavior. The actions of \\{EGb\\} may provide information regarding the beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of neurocognitive impairments and anxiety disorders. Additional analyses are necessary to facilitate an understanding of these effects; however, previous data from our group suggest that GABAergic, serotoninergic and glutamatergic receptors are potential targets of the effects of \\{EGb\\} on conditioned suppression.",

Furthermore, greenhouse gases (GHG) are one of construction emissions that should be investigated to calculate the overall emissions. Therefore, estimating construction emissions is very important in order to keep emissions at an acceptable level. This paper presents a building information modeling (BIM)-based model that enables the estimation of six types of emissions including: greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, particular matter, eutrophication particles, ozone depleting particles and smog. As such, the total direct and indirect emissions can be calculated where these emissions are produced from construction activities during the overall project life cycle phases which are: manufacturing phase, transportation phase, construction phase, operation phase, maintenance phase, and deconstruction/demolition phase. The methods of calculating direct and indirect emissions are extensively described in the paper. A case study is presented to illustrate the use of the proposed BIM-based model.",

The current study used Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis (ALE) as well as resting-state and task-related functional connectivity analyses to better characterize cerebellar activation in relation to AM. The \\{ALE\\} meta-analysis was run on 32 neuroimaging studies of \\{AM\\} retrieval. The results revealed a cluster of reliable AM-related activity within the Crus I lobule of the right posterior cerebellum. Using the peak \\{ALE\\} coordinate within Crus I as a seed region, both task-related and resting state functional connectivity analyses were run on fMRI data from 38 healthy participants. To determine the specificity of connectivity patterns to Crus I, we also included a cerebellar seed region in right Lobule \\{VI\\} previously identified in an \\{ALE\\} meta-analysis as associated with working memory. Resting-state functional connectivity analyses indicated that Crus I was intrinsically connected with other areas of the \\{AM\\} network as well as surrounding and contralateral cerebellar regions. In contrast, the Lobule \\{VI\\} seed was functionally connected with cerebral and cerebellar regions typically associated with working memory.

During a semantic control task, both Crus I and Lobule \\{VI\\} showed significant correlations with a network of regions that was largely distinct from the \\{AM\\} network.

Clothing image annotation is a challenging task due to large variations in clothing appearance, human body pose and background. In this paper, we explore part-based clothing image annotation in a search and mining framework. Similar image search is first conducted to discover visual neighbors for a query image. The impact of large variations of clothing is alleviated by pose detection and part-based feature alignment. Tag relevance and tag saliency are taken into consideration to obtain the candidate tags. The relevance of candidate tags is identified by mining visual neighbors of a query image, while the saliency is determined according to the relationship between query image parts and part clusters on the whole training set. Experiments on a dataset with 1.1 million clothing images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A social network is a typical scale-free network with power-law degree distribution characteristics. It demonstrates several natural imbalanced clusters when it is abstracted as a graph, and expands quickly under its generative mechanism. Hypergraph is superior for modeling multi-user operations in social networks, and partitioning the hypergraph modeled social networks could ease the scaling problems. However, today's popular hypergraph partitioning tools are not sufficiently scalable; thus, unable to achieve high partitioning quality for naturally imbalanced datasets. Recently proposed hypergraph partitioner, hyperpart, replaces the balance constraint with an entropy constraint to achieve high-fidelity partitioning solutions, but it is not tailored for scale-free networks, like social networks. In order to achieve scalable and high quality partitioning results for hypergraph modeled social networks, we propose a partitioning method, EQHyperpart, which utilizes information-Entropy-based modularity Q value (EQ) to direct the hypergraph partitioning process. This \\{EQ\\} considers power-law degree distribution while describing the \u201cnatural\u201d structure of scale-free networks. We then apply simulated annealing and introduce a new definition of hyperedge cut, micro cut, to avoid the local minima in convergence of partitioning, developing \\{EQHyperpart\\} into two specific partitioners, namely: EQHyperpart-SA and EQHyperpart-MC. Finally, we evaluate the utility of our proposed method using classical social network datasets, including Facebook dataset. Findings show that \\{EQHyperpart\\} partitioners are more scalable than competing approaches, achieving a tradeoff between modularity retaining and cut size minimizing under balance constraints, and an auto-tradeoff without balance constraints for hypergraph modeled social networks.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is proposed that successful word retrieval involves lateral inhibition of lexical competitors, and suppression of the non-target language in bilingual speakers. Thus cognitive control is crucial for word production. Given that word retrieval difficulty is a hallmark feature of aphasia, the relationship between word retrieval and cognitive control in aphasia has not been sufficiently explored. This study examined whether persons with aphasia show 1) evidence of a cognitive control deficit, 2) bilingual status interacts with cognitive control deficit in persons with aphasia, and (3) a relationship between measures of word naming and cognitive control. Thirty-eight persons with aphasia were administered a task of cognitive control (Stroop color-word task) and two word production tasks (picture naming and category fluency). We found weakened cognitive control in aphasia relative to age-matched neurologically healthy adults. A bilingual advantage in cognitive control was found in neurologically healthy adults and in one group of bilingual speakers with aphasia, but not the other group. Word retrieval in persons with aphasia was not correlated with Stroop task performance. These findings show that cognitive control performance (as measured by the Stroop task) is compromised in persons with aphasia, irrespective of bilingual status. There was a bilingual advantage in two out of three groups, showing a general support for the bilingual inhibitory control advantage (BICA) hypothesis.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Internet these days have been extensively used to access and search health information supplementing or substituting the traditional sources of online health information (OHI) like health professionals. With the increase in online health information search the production of health information on internet is also rapidly increasing. Due to the enormous volume of health information available on internet, it is hard to locate, process and manage the required valuable information effectively often overloading health information seekers. Information overload phenomenon occurs when more information is presented than the ability of information seekers to process and handle the information. Researchers argue that information overload phenomenon is significantly associated with health-related issues of information seekers. Therefore, the aim of this study is to empirically examine how \\{OHI\\} related information overload impacts the psychological state of information seekers and their behavioral intention to continue the use of \\{OHI\\} search. A research model based on Information Processing Theory and Theory of Planned Behavior is developed and tested using the data collected from 380 survey responses. The results show that perceived information overload has a positive impact on information seekers\u2019 psychological ill-being influencing their behavioral intention to discontinue the use of \\{OHI\\} search.

        "abstract": "Abstract With current and upcoming imaging spectrometers, automated band analysis techniques are needed to enable efficient identification of most informative bands to facilitate optimized processing of spectral data into estimates of biophysical variables. This paper introduces an automated spectral band analysis tool (BAT) based on Gaussian processes regression (GPR) for the spectral analysis of vegetation properties. The GPR-BAT procedure sequentially backwards removes the least contributing band in the regression model for a given variable until only one band is kept. GPR-BAT is implemented within the framework of the free ARTMO's \\{MLRA\\} (machine learning regression algorithms) toolbox, which is dedicated to the transforming of optical remote sensing images into biophysical products. GPR-BAT allows (1) to identify the most informative bands in relating spectral data to a biophysical variable, and (2) to find the least number of bands that preserve optimized accurate predictions. To illustrate its utility, two hyperspectral datasets were analyzed for most informative bands: (1) a field hyperspectral dataset (400\u20131100 nm at 2 nm resolution: 301 bands) with leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and green leaf area index (gLAI) collected for maize and soybean (Nebraska, US); and (2) an airborne HyMap dataset (430\u20132490 nm: 125 bands) with \\{LAI\\} and canopy water content (CWC) collected for a variety of crops (Barrax, Spain). For each of these biophysical variables, optimized retrieval accuracies can be achieved with just 4 to 9 well-identified bands, and performance was largely improved over using all bands. A \\{PROSAIL\\} global sensitivity analysis was run to interpret the validity of these bands. Cross-validated R \\{CV\\} 2 (NRMSECV) accuracies for optimized \\{GPR\\} models were 0.79 (12.9%) for LCC, 0.94 (7.2%) for gLAI, 0.95 (6.5%) for \\{LAI\\} and 0.95 (7.2%) for CWC. This study concludes that a wise band selection of hyperspectral data is strictly required for optimal vegetation properties mapping.",

In this paper, we describe and test procedures devised to separate returns of ice from open water \u2014 a crucial step in the estimation of local sea levels for freeboard calculations. The two data sets used in these tests, one each from winter and summer, were acquired by a Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL) implemented to support pre-launch development of retrieval approaches. Our approach first identifies likely open water returns using surface photon and background count rates as proxy indicators of apparent surface reflectance. Since these measured rates are noisy estimates of expected reflectance, relative surface heights are used to refine the selection of the candidate sea surface samples. Results show that winter freeboard distributions are consistent with expected regional variability, and the nearly identical repeat-track freeboard distributions during summer show retrieval consistency. From coincident lidar coverage, variability of sea level samples identified in the \\{MABEL\\} and Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar profiles are 1.6 cm and 2.6 cm, with the overall difference between the distributions at 0.00 \u00b1 0.15 m. This demonstrates the viability of the algorithms. The parameters used in these procedures will serve as a baseline and as a guide for understanding algorithm reliability.

        "abstract": "Abstract Accurate remote sensing retrieval of water quality parameters in complex coastal environments is challenging due to variability of the coastal environment. For example, in the coastal waters of Hong Kong water quality varies from east to west. The currently existing water zones, defined by the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (EPD) are based on ease of access to sampling locations rather than on water quality alone. In this study an archive of fifty-seven Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and HJ-1 A/B Charged Couple Device (CCD) images over a 13-year period (January 2000\u2013December 2012) was used to define optically distinct water classes by Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) clustering. The clustering was applied by combining the Surface Reflectance (SR) derived from the first four bands of Landsat and HJ-1 scenes with 240 insitu samples of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Suspended Solid (SS) concentrations collected within 2 h of image acquisition. The \\{FCM\\} clustering suggested the existence of five optically different water classes in the region. The significance of the defined water classes was tested in terms of the water \\{SR\\} behaviour in each band. The \\{SR\\} for Classes 1 and 2 in bands 1\u20133 was lower than in other classes, and band 4 showed the lowest reflectance, indicating that these classes represent a clearer type of water. Class 3 showed intermediate reflectance in all bands, while Classes 4 and 5 showed overall higher reflectance indicating high sediment contribution from the Pearl River Delta. Application of water quality retrievals within individual classes showed much greater confidence with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.32 \u03bcg/l (1.21 mg/l) for Chl-a (SS) concentrations, compared with 5.97 \u03bcg/l (2.98 mg/l) when applied to the whole spectrum of different water types across the region.",

The algorithm assigns different weights and measures to each advertised \\{WS\\} profile parameter, depending on their relevance, type and nature. To do this we have extended Paolucci\u2019s Algorithm and adapted it to our scenario. We have added new similarity measures, in particular, the use of the \u2018sibling\u2019 relationship, to improve the recall, allowing relevant services to be discovered by the users yet not retrieved by other algorithms. Although we have increased the similarity concept relations, we have improved the run-time using a pre-process filter step that reduces the set of potentially useful WS.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the implementation of a new \\{IVC\\} filter retrieval protocol would increase the retrieval rate of appropriate \\{IVC\\} filters at our institution. Methods All consecutive patients who underwent an \\{IVC\\} filter placement at our institution between September 2003 and July 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. In August 2012, a multidisciplinary task force was established, and a new \\{IVC\\} filter retrieval protocol was implemented. Prospective data were collected using a centralized interdepartmental \\{IVC\\} filter registry for all consecutive patients who underwent an \\{IVC\\} filter placement between August 2012 and September 2014. Patients were chronologically categorized into preimplementation (PRE) and postimplementation (POST) groups.

Results In the \\{PRE\\} and \\{POST\\} groups, a total of 720 and 74 retrievable \\{IVC\\} filters were implanted, respectively.

The purpose of this study is to propose a shoeprint retrieval method based on core point alignment for pattern analysis. Method: The proposed method firstly detects contour points in a black-and-white shoeprint image. These reliable contour points are selected to simulate the left and right sidelines of the shoeprint by a curve fitting method. Subsequently, the most concave points along the left and right sidelines can determine the core point of the shoeprint, thereby partitioning the shoeprint into circular regions. Next, the Zernike moments of the circular regions are calculated for pattern descriptions of each region. Finally, the Euclidean distance is measured to match the shoeprints with the same pattern. Result: The highest \\{APR\\} = 0.726 is obtained from the first four Zernike moments with a radius of 90 pixels and three baselines. The experimental results also show that the Zernike method in any order always outperforms the compared moment invariant and \\{GLCM\\} method. The experimental results also indicate that the core point is more stable than the gravity center in the both sets, because the standard deviation values of the core point are less than that of the gravity center.

        "abstract": "Abstract To evaluate the performance of ocean-colour retrievals of total chlorophyll-a concentration requires direct comparison with concomitant and co-located in situ data. For global comparisons, these in situ match-ups should be ideally representative of the distribution of total chlorophyll-a concentration in the global ocean. The oligotrophic gyres constitute the majority of oceanic water, yet are under-sampled due to their inaccessibility and under-represented in global in situ databases. The Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) is one of only a few programmes that consistently sample oligotrophic waters. In this paper, we used a spectrophotometer on two \\{AMT\\} cruises (AMT19 and AMT22) to continuously measure absorption by particles in the water of the ship's flow-through system. From these optical data continuous total chlorophyll-a concentrations were estimated with high precision and accuracy along each cruise and used to evaluate the performance of ocean-colour algorithms. We conducted the evaluation using level 3 binned ocean-colour products, and used the high spatial and temporal resolution of the underway system to maximise the number of match-ups on each cruise. Statistical comparisons show a significant improvement in the performance of satellite chlorophyll algorithms over previous studies, with root mean square errors on average less than half (~ 0.16 in log10 space) that reported previously using global datasets (~ 0.34 in log10 space). This improved performance is likely due to the use of continuous absorption-based chlorophyll estimates, that are highly accurate, sample spatial scales more comparable with satellite pixels, and minimise human errors. Previous comparisons might have reported higher errors due to regional biases in datasets and methodological inconsistencies between investigators. Furthermore, our comparison showed an underestimate in satellite chlorophyll at low concentrations in 2012 (AMT22), likely due to a small bias in satellite remote-sensing reflectance data. Our results highlight the benefits of using underway spectrophotometric systems for evaluating satellite ocean-colour data and underline the importance of maintaining in situ observatories that sample the oligotrophic gyres.",

However, a disorganized growth of these repositories have hampered the search of Business Processes which is fundamental for reusing them. In this paper an approach for organizing and searching Business Processes is proposed, which is composed of two phases: First, an automatic and semantic categorization phase to classify Business Processes based on their functionality, and second a multimodal search phase in order to rank Business Processes based on structural and textual features. The proposed approach was tested in an evaluation over a closed repository collaboratively built by 20 expert evaluators. Initially, evaluators were asked to rate categories assigned by our approach to each Business Process in order to assess our results against the user perspective. Later, evaluators were asked to compare six queries against the repository in order to obtain a set of relevant Business Processes for each query. With these results, precision, recall and F-measure were calculated to evaluate the relevance and ranking concordance of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art algorithms for Business Process similarity search.

        "abstract": "Abstract Land surface temperature retrieved from Landsat is a valuable resource for understanding land cover change, monitoring the urban heat island effect, and modeling hydrological and carbon cycles, among other applications. However, this dataset is underutilized, in part because it is difficult to accurately correct for atmospheric interference, and in part because it is difficult to validate the resulting \\{LST\\} dataset. As a result, it is often challenging to verify the accuracy of \\{LST\\} calculated from historical data. Currently, three correction methods are commonly used to retrieve land surface temperature from single-band Landsat \\{TIR\\} data\u2014the radiative transfer equation (RTE), the mono-window algorithm (MWA), and the generalized single-channel (GSC) method. Based on current research, it is often unclear which method is best applied in different circumstances and what the actual achieved accuracy is\u2014especially when these methods are employed as they would be for actual applications, rather than under validation conditions. This study retrieves \\{LST\\} from two years\u2019 worth of clear-sky Landsat 5 \\{TM\\} data using all three methods, as well as \\{LST\\} with no atmospheric correction, and validates the results against on-the-ground skin temperature measurements from twenty-five Oklahoma Mesonet stations. Additionally, \\{LST\\} results using both modeled transmittance values and transmittance values based on precipitable water vapor are assessed, as are results from dates with both high and low precipitable water vapor. Results suggest that the \\{MWA\\} method using modeled transmittance is the most robust, with results statistically indistinguishable from Mesonet skin temperature for the complete dataset and a cloud-free subset, as well as for subsets above and below 2 g/cm2 precipitable water vapor. The \\{RTE\\} method using modeled atmospheric parameters is also appropriate in some circumstances.",

Results from its first deployment during the field campaign on Arctic sea ice north of Svalbard during summer 2012 are shown. Comparison of photogrammetrically derived digital elevation models (DEMs) with in situ measurements of sea ice topography made on melting first year sea ice demonstrated the ability of the method to accurately recover the topography of sea ice including melt ponds with depths down to at least 0.3m. The inter-comparison of the photogrammetrically derived \\{DEM\\} and in situ measured elevations yielded estimates of a root mean square error (RMS) of about 0.04m and bias of 0.03m, both for sea ice freeboard and melt pond depths. The bimodality of the probability density function of measured melt pond depths was also accurately reproduced in the reconstructed DEM. Discrepancies between the measured and \\{DEM\\} distributions were within the range of the inferred uncertainty of the photogrammetric and in situ techniques, with some of the bias likely associated with sea ice melt during the time elapsed between in situ and aerial measurements.",

The examination was operated in the case of four tree species (i.e. Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris, Populus tremula and Quercus robur) in a mixed forest, with their LAI-related reference data collected by using static terrestrial laser scanning (TLS). In light of the differences between ALS- and TLS-based \\{LAI\\} characterizations, the methods of voxelization of 3D scattered laser points, effective \\{LAI\\} (LAIe) that does not distinguish branches from canopies and unified cumulative \\{LAI\\} (ucLAI) that is often used to characterize the vertical profiles of crown leaf area densities (LADs) was used; then, the relationships between the ALS- and TLS-derived \\{LAIes\\} were determined, and so did ucLAIs.

They can provide domain knowledge to requirement engineers, are reusable software components for web applications or intelligent agent developers, and can facilitate semi-automatic model verification and validation.

Its learning process contains three steps: first we propose Hierarchical Multi-Modal Topic Learning (HMMTL) to detect multi-modal topics with semantic information. Then we use Robust Matrix Factorization (RMF) to transfer the multi-modal topics to hash codes which are more suited to quantization, and these codes form a unified hash space. Finally we learn hash functions to project all modalities into the unified hash space.

First, to operationally process the large amount of polarimetric data the data preparation tool was developed. The \\{AERONET\\} inversion code adapted for inversion of both intensity and polarization measurements was used for processing. Second, in order to estimate the effect from utilization of polarimetric information on aerosol retrieval results, both synthetic data and the real measurements were processed using developed routine and analyzed. The sensitivity study has been carried out using simulated data based on three main aerosol models: desert dust, urban industrial and urban clean aerosols. The test investigated the effects of utilization of polarization data in the presence of random noise, bias in measurements of optical thickness and angular pointing shift. The results demonstrate the advantage of polarization data utilization in the cases of aerosols with pronounced concentration of fine particles. Further, the extended set of \\{AERONET\\} observations was processed. The data for three sites have been used: GSFC, \\{USA\\} (clean urban aerosol dominated by fine particles), Beijing, China (polluted industrial aerosol characterized by pronounced mixture of both fine and coarse modes) and Dakar, Senegal (desert dust dominated by coarse particles). The results revealed considerable advantage of polarimetric data applying for characterizing fine mode dominated aerosols including industrial pollution (Beijing). The use of polarization corrects particle size distribution by decreasing overestimated fine mode and increasing the coarse mode. It also increases underestimated real part of the refractive index and improves the retrieval of the fraction of spherical particles due to high sensitivity of polarization to particle shape. Overall, the study demonstrates a substantial value of polarimetric data for improving aerosol characterization.",

        "abstract": "Abstract While contemporary semantic search systems offer to improve classical keyword-based search, they are not always adequate for complex domain specific information needs. The domain of prescription drug abuse, for example, requires knowledge of both ontological concepts and \u201cintelligible constructs\u201d not typically modeled in ontologies. These intelligible constructs convey essential information that include notions of intensity, frequency, interval, dosage, and sentiments, which could be important to the holistic needs of the information seeker. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach to domain specific information retrieval (or knowledge-aware search) that integrates ontology-driven query interpretation with synonym-based query expansion, and domain specific rules, to facilitate search. Our framework is based on a context-free grammar (CFG) that defines the query language of constructs interpretable by the search system. The grammar provides two levels of semantic interpretation: (1) a top-level \\{CFG\\} that facilitates retrieval of diverse textual patterns, which belong to broad templates and (2) a low-level \\{CFG\\} that enables interpretation of specific expressions that belong to such patterns. These low-level expressions occur as concepts from four different categories of data: (1) ontological concepts, (2) concepts in lexicons (such as emotions and sentiments), (3) concepts in lexicons with only partial ontology representation, called lexico-ontology concepts (such as side effects and routes of administration (ROA)), and (4) domain specific expressions (such as date, time, interval, frequency, and dosage) derived solely through rules. Our approach is embodied in a novel Semantic Web platform called PREDOSE, which provides search support for complex domain specific information needs in prescription drug abuse epidemiology. When applied to a corpus of over 1 million drug abuse-related web forum posts, our search framework proved effective in retrieving relevant documents when compared with three existing search systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates long-term (i.e., 2007\u20132014) fluctuations in ambient ozone formation regimes for cities adjacent to shale plays in the Northeast United States (U.S.). Ozone air quality in many cities of the Northeast U.S. does not meet the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), and understanding ambient ozone formation regimes is essential to develop effective air pollution mitigation strategies for cities violating the air quality standards. Since 2013, the U.S. has become the world\u2019s largest producer of tight oil and natural gas from shale rock, and previous studies show that emissions of air pollutant precursors from shale oil and gas-related activities would have the potential to affect ambient ozone air quality in adjacent cities of shale plays. This work leveraged (1) satellite-retrieved column densities of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from multiple instruments (i.e., Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2)); (2) photochemical air quality modeling and sensitivity analysis; and (3) ratios of satellite-retrieved air pollutant column densities to investigate ambient ozone formation regimes in neighboring cities of shale plays (i.e., Marcellus Shale) in the Northeast U.S. from 2007 to 2014. Our results show that ambient ozone formation in Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. (which are close to Marcellus Shale) was in the \\{NOx\\} -limited or transition regime during the period of study. Ambient ozone formation in New York City was in the transition regime during 2010\u20132013 and \\{VOC\\} -limited regime during 2007\u20132009 and in 2014. Based on the result of this study, we conclude that controls \\{NOx\\} emissions would mitigate ozone air pollution from 2007 to 2014 in most of the cities examined in this study. Controls of local \\{VOC\\} emissions would ease ozone air pollution in New York City during the study period. With projected increases in oil and gas production from shale plays in the Northeast U.S., air pollutant emissions from oil and gas-related activities are expected to increase in the future. The results of this study imply that controls of ozone precursor emissions from shale oil and gas-related activities could be a potential strategy for reducing ambient ozone formation in cities adjacent to the shale plays in Northeast U.S. in the future.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Using remotely-sensed data, various soil moisture estimation models have been developed for bare soil areas. Previous studies have shown that the brightness temperature (BT) measured by passive microwave sensors were affected by characteristics of the land surface parameters including soil moisture, vegetation cover and soil roughness. Therefore knowledge of vegetation cover and soil roughness is important for obtaining frequent and global estimations of land surface parameters especially soil moisture. In this study, a model called Simultaneous Land Parameters Retrieval Model (SLPRM) that is an iterative least-squares minimization method is proposed. The algorithm estimates surface soil moisture, land surface temperature and canopy temperature simultaneously in vegetated areas using AMSR-E (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS) brightness temperature data. The simultaneous estimations of the three parameters are based on a multi-parameter inversion algorithm which includes model construction, calibration and validation using observations carried out for the \\{SMEX03\\} (Soil Moisture Experiment, 2003) region in the South and North of Oklahoma. Roughness parameter has also been included in the algorithm to increase the soil parameters retrieval accuracy. Unlike other methods, the \\{SLPRM\\} method works efficiently in all land covers types. The study focuses on soil parameters estimation by comparing three different scenarios with the inclusion of roughness data and selects the most appropriate one. The difference between the resulted accuracies of scenarios is due to the roughness calculation approach. The analysis on the retrieval model shows a meaningful and acceptable accuracy on soil moisture estimation according to the three scenarios. The \\{SLPRM\\} method has shown better performance when the \\{SAR\\} (Synthetic Aperture RADAR) data are used for roughness calculation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Recent work in language production research suggests complex relationships between linguistic and motor processes. Typing is an interesting candidate for investigating further this issue. First, typing presumably relies on the same distributed left-lateralized brain network as handwriting and speech production. Second, typing has its own set of highly specific motor constraints, such as internal keystroke representations that hold information about both letter identity and spatial characteristics of the key to strike. The present study aims to further develop research on typed production, by targeting the dynamics between linguistic and motor neural networks. Specifically, we used a typed picture-naming task to examine the interplay between response retrieval and motor planning. To track processes associated with both linguistic processing and keystroke representation, we manipulated, respectively, the semantic context in which the target appeared and the side of the first keystrokes of the word. We recorded high-density electroencephalography (EEG) continuously from the presentation of a picture, to the typing of its name, and computed both event-related potentials (ERP) and beta-band power analyses. Non-parametric data-driven analysis revealed a clear pattern of response preparation over both hemispheres close to response time, in both the \\{ERP\\} and beta-band power modulations. This was preceded by a left-lateralized power decrease in the beta-band, presumably representing memory retrieval, and an early contrast in ERP, between left and right keystrokes\u2019 preparation. We discuss these results in terms of a dynamic access approach for internal keystroke representations, and argue for an integrative rather than separatist view of linguistic and motor processes.",

Methods Twenty-six lingual retainers bonded for different time periods (2.2-17.4\u00a0years) were retrieved from postorthodontic patients. Fifteen lingual retainers had been cemented by a chemically cured adhesive (Maximum Cure, Reliance Orthodontic Products, Itasca, Ill), and 11 were treated with a photo-cured adhesive (Flow-Tain, Reliance Orthodontic Products). The first group was in service for 2.8 to 17.4\u00a0years and the second for 2.2 to 5.4\u00a0years. Five specimens from each material were prepared and used as the control (or reference) group. The debonded surfaces from enamel were studied by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (n\u00a0=\u00a03 per material per group), low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis (n\u00a0=\u00a03 per material per group). All specimens were used for the assessment of Vickers hardness, indentation modulus, and elastic index with the instrumented indentation testing method. The values of Vickers hardness, indentation modulus, and elastic index were compared between the retrieved and the reference groups with 1-way analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Results The attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed that both retrieved composites demonstrated reduced unsaturation in comparison with the corresponding reference specimens. Some bonded surfaces showed development of organic integuments. All retrieved specimens showed reduced silicon content. Barium was identified only in the photo-cured group. No significant differences were found between the reference and retrieved groups in Vickers hardness, indentation modulus, and elastic index.

The automation of this process greatly reduces the human interference while converting books (specifically their covers where this task becomes extremely difficult) to readable and editable electronic format specifically for electronic book readers. To achieve this purpose we propose a technique which works on scanned images of documents. The image is first clustered to reduce the number of color variances, a suitable plane is identified and then text region is segmented using connected component based method. The text thus obtained is then enhanced to ameliorate the results.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Estimation of chlorophyll concentration in the marine biosphere has been the central topic of ocean color remote sensing since its advent. While various algorithms were proposed in the literature so far and tested for oceanic waters of diverse constituent composition, an independent algorithm evaluation is needed for local ocean waters that have dynamic variation in optically active water constituents such as colored dissolved organic matters (CDOM) and suspended particulate matter (SPM). This paper evaluates the performance of chlorophyll algorithms for Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) radiometric data, using in situ measurements collected at 491 stations around Korea Peninsula during 2010\u20132014 from which there were 130 match-ups with \\{GOCI\\} data. For the evaluation in areas with high variation in SPM, water samples were first classified into three levels of SPM, and then the coefficients of candidate algorithms were newly derived for the turbidity cases using the in situ and \\{GOCI\\} remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data. Functional forms of traditional band ratio algorithms (e.g. \\{OC\\} algorithms (O\u2032Reilly et al., 1998) and Tassan's algorithm (Tassan, 1994)), fluorescence line height algorithm, and near-infrared-to-red band ratio approach were tested. The evaluation results for the coincident in situ pairs of Rrs and chlorophyll measurements showed that the mean uncertainty was &lt; 35% with the correlation around 0.8 by using the \\{OC3\\} with turbidity consideration (OCT) and Tassan's algorithm with turbidity dependent coefficients (Tassan-TD). For the \\{GOCI\\} match-ups, the mean uncertainty for all turbidity levels was around 35% with correlation around 0.65, when \\{OCT\\} and Tassan-TD were used.",

In view of the fact that cognitive deficits in women who receive adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is a common health problem, using female animal models for investigating the cognitive effects of \\{TAM\\} administration may improve our knowledge of \\{TAM\\} therapy. Therefore, the present study assessed the role of dorsal hippocampal cholinergic nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) in the effect of \\{TAM\\} administration on memory retrieval in ovariectomized (OVX) and non-OVX female rats using a passive avoidance learning task. Our results showed that pre-test administration of \\{TAM\\} (2\u20136 mg/kg) impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of nicotine (0.3\u20130.5 \u03bcg/rat) reversed TAM-induced memory impairment. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of mecamylamine (0.1\u20130.3 \u03bcg/rat) plus 2 mg/kg (an ineffective dose) of \\{TAM\\} impaired memory retrieval. Pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of the same doses of nicotine and mecamylamine by themselves had no effect on memory retrieval. In \\{OVX\\} rats, the administration of \\{TAM\\} (6 mg/kg) produced memory impairment but pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of nicotine (0.5 \u03bcg/rat) had no effect on \\{TAM\\} response. Moreover, the administration of an ineffective dose of \\{TAM\\} (2 mg/kg) had no effect on memory retrieval in \\{OVX\\} rats, while pre-test intra-CA1 microinjection of mecamylamine (0.3 \u03bcg/rat) impaired memory retrieval. Taken together, it can be concluded that the impairing effect of \\{TAM\\} on memory formation may be modulated by nAChRs of the \\{CA1\\} regions.

        "abstract": "Abstract Current animal models of episodic memory are usually based on demonstrating integrated memory for what happened, where it happened, and when an event took place. These models aim to capture the testable features of the definition of human episodic memory which stresses the temporal component of the memory as a unique piece of source information that allows us to disambiguate one memory from another. Recently though, it has been suggested that a more accurate model of human episodic memory would include contextual rather than temporal source information, as humans\u2019 memory for time is relatively poor. Here, two experiments were carried out investigating human memory for temporal and contextual source information, along with the underlying dual process retrieval processes, using an immersive virtual environment paired with a \u2018Remember-Know\u2019 memory task. Experiment 1 (n = 28) showed that contextual information could only be retrieved accurately using recollection, while temporal information could be retrieved using either recollection or familiarity. Experiment 2 (n = 24), which used a more difficult task, resulting in reduced item recognition rates and therefore less potential for contamination by ceiling effects, replicated the pattern of results from Experiment 1. Dual process theory predicts that it should only be possible to retrieve source context from an event using recollection, and our results are consistent with this prediction. That temporal information can be retrieved using familiarity alone suggests that it may be incorrect to view temporal context as analogous to other typically used source contexts. This latter finding supports the alternative proposal that time since presentation may simply be reflected in the strength of memory trace at retrieval \u2013 a measure ideally suited to trace strength interrogation using familiarity, as is typically conceptualised within the dual process framework.",

Using short narratives and a probe-naming procedure, five hypotheses were examined: Text retention, text reactivation, inference retention, inference activation, and text and inference suppression. In addition, three types of \\{WM\\} span tests\u2014listening-, operation- and symmetry-span tests\u2014were used to examine whether the role of \\{WM\\} in inference generation is domain-specific for discourse items, domain-specific for verbal items, or domain-general, respectively. Different patterns of results were observed for high- and low-span groups only when participants were divided based on the listening-span test. High-span participants generated predictive inferences faster than low-span participants, and then quickly inhibited them when they became less relevant in the following sentence. Moreover, high-span participants generated more bridging inferences than low-span participants, possibly due to enhanced retention and reactivation of inference-evoking textual information. These findings support the inference activation, inference inhibition, text retention, text reactivation, and discourse-domain-specific hypotheses of WM's role in inference generation. The unique contribution of this study to the field is discussed in relation to existing findings and theories of WM.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nationwide health information exchange (NHIE) continues to be a persistent concern for government agencies, despite the many efforts and the conceived benefits of sharing patient data among healthcare providers. Difficulties in ensuring global connectivity, interoperability, and concerns on security have always hampered the government from successfully deploying NHIE. By looking at \\{NHIE\\} from a fresh perspective and bearing in mind the pervasiveness and power of modern mobile platforms, this paper proposes a new approach to \\{NHIE\\} that builds on the notion of consumer-mediated HIE, albeit without the focus on central health record banks. With the growing acceptance of smartphones as reliable, indispensable, and most personal devices, we suggest to leverage the concept of mobile personal health records (PHRs installed on smartphones) to the next level. We envision mPHRs that take the form of distributed storage units for health information, under the full control and direct possession of patients, who can have ready access to their personal data whenever needed. However, for the actual exchange of data with health information systems managed by healthcare providers, the latter have to be interoperable with patient-carried mPHRs. Computer industry has long ago solved a similar problem of interoperability between peripheral devices and operating systems. We borrow from that solution the idea of providing special interfaces between mPHRs and provider systems. This interface enables the two entities to communicate with no change to either end. The design and operation of the proposed approach is explained. Additional pointers on potential implementations are provided, and issues that pertain to any solution to implement \\{NHIE\\} are discussed.",

The results showed that the proposed framework achieves 65% and 77% accuracy in detecting the timeliness of the web content according to years and pre-determined time intervals respectively.

The uncertainty estimates are derived independently of in-situ data. This enables validation of both the retrieved \\{SSTs\\} and their uncertainty estimate using in-situ data records. The total uncertainty budget is comprised of a number of components, arising from uncorrelated (e.g. noise), locally systematic (e.g. atmospheric), large scale systematic and sampling effects (for gridded products). The importance of distinguishing these components arises in propagating uncertainty across spatio-temporal scales. We apply the method to \\{SST\\} data retrieved from the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and validate the results for two different \\{SST\\} retrieval algorithms, both at a per pixel level and for gridded data.

        "abstract": "Abstract During the last decade, web technologies and location sensing devices have evolved generating a form of crowdsourcing known as Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). \\{VGI\\} acted as a platform of spatial data collection, in particular, when a group of public participants are involved in collaborative mapping activities: they work together to collect, share, and use information about geographic features. \\{VGI\\} exploits participants\u2019 local knowledge to produce rich data sources. However, the resulting data inherits problematic data classification. In \\{VGI\\} projects, the challenges of data classification are due to the following: (i) data is likely prone to subjective classification, (ii) remote contributions and flexible contribution mechanisms in most projects, and (iii) the uncertainty of spatial data and non-strict definitions of geographic features. These factors lead to various forms of problematic classification: inconsistent, incomplete, and imprecise data classification. This research addresses classification appropriateness. Whether the classification of an entity is appropriate or inappropriate is related to quantitative and/or qualitative observations. Small differences between observations may be not recognizable particularly for non-expert participants. Hence, in this paper, the problem is tackled by developing a rule-guided classification approach. This approach exploits data mining techniques of Association Classification (AC) to extract descriptive (qualitative) rules of specific geographic features. The rules are extracted based on the investigation of qualitative topological relations between target features and their context. Afterwards, the extracted rules are used to develop a recommendation system able to guide participants to the most appropriate classification. The approach proposes two scenarios to guide participants towards enhancing the quality of data classification. An empirical study is conducted to investigate the classification of grass-related features like forest, garden, park, and meadow. The findings of this study indicate the feasibility of the proposed approach.",

The correlation between the new vegetation optical depth (VOD) product and the height of the forest estimated by \\{ICES\\} at \\{GLAS\\} lidar on a global scale is investigated. Over South American and African forests a good correspondence between the two variables is observed, with saturation occurring above about 30 m height. Moreover, the comparison between the \\{VOD\\} and the height of the forest shows good spatial and temporal stability, and the r2 correlation coefficient is within a 0.59\u20130.69 range. Conversely, discrepancies are observed in some Indonesian islands, particularly New Guinea.

To this aim, accurate estimates of forest biomass derived from airborne lidar over selected forests of Peru, Columbia and Panama are used.

Participants were observed interacting with two different \\{EHR\\} systems in inpatient settings. Data was collected around the use and creation of History and Physical (H&amp;P) notes, progress notes and discharge summaries. Results The highest variability in template styles was observed with progress notes and the least variability was within discharge summaries, while note-writing styles were most consistent for H&amp;P notes. The first sections to be read in a H&amp;P and progress note were the Chief Complaint and Assessment &amp; Plan sections, respectively. The greatest note retrieval variability, with respect to the order of how note sections were reviewed, was observed with H&amp;P and progress notes. Physician preference for adopting a certain reading/retrieval order appeared to be a function of what best fits their workflow while fulfilling the stimulus demands. The time spent entering H&amp;P, discharge summaries and progress notes were similar in both EHRs.

Methods English-speaking \\{ED\\} patients diagnosed as having acute infections and prescribed outpatient antibiotics were randomized to standard discharge instructions, standard instructions plus text-messaged instructions, or standard instructions plus voicemailed instructions targeting \\{ED\\} prescriptions. Health literacy was determined by validated instrument. Seventy-two-hour antibiotic retrieval, 30-day report of prescription completion, and discharge instructional modality preference were assessed. Results Nearly one-quarter of the 2521 participants demonstrated low health literacy. Low health literacy predicted decreased 72-hour antibiotic retrieval (\u03c72 = 9.56, P = .008). No significant association with antibiotic retrieval was noted across the 3 treatment groups (\u03c72 = 5.112, P = .078). However, patients randomized to the text message group retrieved antibiotic prescriptions within 72 hours more frequently than did those randomized to the voicemail treatment group (\u03c72 = 4.345, P = .037), and patients with low health literacy randomized to voicemailed instructions retrieved their antibiotic prescriptions less frequently than did those randomized to standard of care instructions (\u03c72 = 5.526, P = .019). Reported instructional modality preferences were inconsistent with the primary findings of the study.

        "abstract": "Summary Persistent long-term memory depends on successful stabilization and integration of new memories after initial encoding [1, 2]. This consolidation process is thought to require neuromodulatory factors such as dopamine, noradrenaline, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor [3\u20137]. Without the release of such factors around the time of encoding, memories will decay rapidly [3, 5, 6, 8]. Recent studies have shown that physical exercise acutely stimulates the release of several consolidation-promoting factors in humans [9\u201314], raising the question of whether physical exercise can be used to improve memory retention [15\u201317]. Here, we used a single session of physical exercise after learning to exogenously boost memory consolidation and thus long-term memory. Three groups of\u00a0randomly assigned participants first encoded a\u00a0set of picture-location associations. Afterward, one group performed exercise immediately, one 4\u00a0hr later, and the third did not perform any exercise. Participants otherwise underwent exactly the\u00a0same\u00a0procedures to control for potential experimental confounds. Forty-eight hours later, participants returned for a cued-recall test in a magnetic resonance scanner. With this design, we could investigate the\u00a0impact of acute exercise on memory consolidation and retrieval-related neural processing. We found that performing exercise 4\u00a0hr, but not immediately, after encoding improved the retention of picture-location associations compared to the no-exercise control group. Moreover, performing exercise after a delay\u00a0was associated with increased hippocampal pattern similarity for correct responses during delayed retrieval. Our results suggest that appropriately timed physical exercise can improve long-term memory and highlight the potential of exercise as an intervention in educational and clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Monitoring of learning is only accurate at some time after learning. It is thought that immediate monitoring is based on working memory, whereas later monitoring requires re-activation of stored items, yielding accurate judgements. Such interpretations are difficult to test because they require reverse inference, which presupposes specificity of brain activity for the hidden cognitive processes. We investigated whether multivariate pattern classification can provide this specificity. We used a word recall task to create single trial examples of immediate and long term retrieval and trained a learning algorithm to discriminate them. Next, participants performed a similar task involving monitoring instead of recall. The recall-trained classifier recognized the retrieval patterns underlying immediate and long term monitoring and classified delayed monitoring examples as long-term retrieval. This result demonstrates the feasibility of decoding cognitive processes, instead of their content.",

We examined fMRI data collected during episodic retrieval from a large sample (N = 126). Participants judged whether a stimulus had been encoded previously, and, if so, which of three scenes it had been paired with (i.e., source judgment). For 8- to 9-years-olds as well as low-performing 10- to 11-year-olds, hippocampal activations did not reliably differentiate between trials on which item-scene associations were correctly recalled (correct source), incorrectly recalled (incorrect source), or trials on which the item was forgotten (miss trials). For high-performing 10\u201311-year olds and low-performing adults, selective hippocampal activation was observed for correct source relative to incorrect source and miss trials; this effect was observed across the entire hippocampus. For high-performing adults, hippocampal activation also distinguished between correct and incorrect source trialsl, but only in the hippocampal head, suggesting that good performance in adults is associated with more focal hippocampal recruitment. Thus, both age and performance are important factors for understanding the development of memory and hippocampal function.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Earth Observation (EO) technology is today at a maturity level that allows deriving operational estimates of Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) from a variety of sensors; yet, such products are provided at present at a coarse spatial and/or temporal resolution, which restricts their use in local or regional scale studies and practical applications. Herein, a methodology to derive \\{SSM\\} estimates from space at previously unattained spatio-temporal resolutions is proposed. The method is based on a variant of the \u201ctriangle\u201d inversion technique leveraging on the strengths and synergies of \\{SMOS\\} (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission) microwave observations and geostationary optical/infrared data. The \\{SSM\\} retrieval technique allows for: i) enhancing the spatial resolution of \\{SMOS\\} \\{SSM\\} product estimates to 3 km spatial resolution, and, ii) providing a temporal average daytime \\{SM\\} product from the instantaneous fine-scale \\{SSM\\} estimates acquired every 15 min; the latter is allowing higher coverage in presence of clouds and representativeness (up to 96 estimates per day) in comparison to the instantaneous estimate at the time of satellite overpass. The proposed technique has been implemented to \\{SMOS\\} and \\{MSG\\} (Meteosat Second Generation) \\{SEVIRI\\} (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) observations acquired over the Iberian Peninsula and Southern France during year 2011. \\{SSM\\} instantaneous estimates at the time of \\{SMOS\\} overpass and daytime-averaged \\{SSM\\} estimates have been obtained and evaluated separately against collocated in-situ measurements acquired from a total of 40 stations belonging to the REMEDHUS, \\{VAS\\} and \\{SMOSMANIA\\} permanent soil moisture measurement networks. Statistical agreement between compared datasets has been evaluated both at individual stations and considering the network average on the basis of several statistical terms computed including correlation, bias, root-mean-squared errors, slope and intercept of linear regression. Results showed that the proposed method not only preserves the quality of \\{SMOS\\} \\{SSM\\} at finer spatial scales, but also allows achieving higher temporal coverage and representativeness in daytime averages.

The proposed method is based on the wavelength-matching method, where the idea is to find the maximum value of light transmittance of the suspension by scanning the irradiation wavelength. The samples were calcium fluoride (CaF2) powders manufactured by different global producers. The wavelength-matching method is suggested to be a relatively easy, economic and fast modality to retrieve the refractive index of particles. The wavelength-matching method is also considered to be independent on particle size and morphology.

Reflectance data of wheat crop, grown under different treatments, were measured by hand-held spectroradiometer and later integrated to LISS-3 reflectance using its band-wise relative spectral response function. Three inversion techniques were used and their performance was compared using different statistical parameters and target diagram. The inversion techniques tried were: a look up table with best solution (LUT-I), a look up table with mean of best 10% solutions (LUT-II) and an artificial neural network (ANN). All the techniques could estimate the biophysical variables by capturing variability in their observed values, though accuracy of estimation varied among the three techniques. Target diagram clearly depicted the superiority of LUT-II over the other two approaches indicating that a mean of best 10% solutions is a better strategy while \\{ANN\\} was worst performer showing highest bias for all the parameters. In all the three inversion techniques, the general order of retrieval accuracy was \\{LAI\\} &gt; Cab &gt; \\{CCC\\} &gt; Cw.

The meteorological parameters from the re-analysis data of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are applied to estimate the aerosol layer height (ALH) of the two-layer aerosol model via an automatic workflow. The estimated extinction coefficients near the surface by AOD/ALH over the single point of a lidar site in Shanghai agree well with those of the ground measurements from a visibility sensor, with a correlation coefficient of 0.86 and root mean squared error (RMS) of 0.19 km\u2212 1 for the data set from April 18, 2008 to April 30, 2014. The season-long spatial comparison demonstrates that most of the correlation coefficients (90%) are &gt; 0.6, and more than half of the samples (68%) have coefficients higher than 0.7 for the data set from January 1 to April 30, 2014. Dust transportation and higher relative humidity (RH) have been confirmed to be important factors in reducing the accuracy of estimated visibility, as these situations fail to meet the assumptions of the two-layer model. Additionally, the less-rigorous cloud mask algorithm of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/AOD might lead to overestimates of AOD, and further underestimating of the surface-level visibility. The spatial variation of temporal correlation coefficients shows that most comparison sites (&gt; 74%) of satellite estimations agree well with the surface-level visibility measurements, with correlation coefficients up to 0.6 during the study period.

The present study compared the cue-to-target \\{P3\\} ratios in neutral and visuospatial cueing, in order to estimate the contribution of valid visuospatial information from the cue to target stages of the task performance, in terms of cognitive load. The \\{P3\\} characteristics were also correlated with the results of individuals\u2019 performance of the visuospatial tasks, in order to estimate the relationship of the observed \\{ERP\\} with spatial reasoning. In 20 typically developing boys, aged 10\u201313 years (11.3 \u00b1 0.86), the intelligence quotient (I.Q.) was estimated by the Block Design and Vocabulary subtests from the WISC-III. The subjects performed the Attentional Network Test (ANT) accompanied by \\{EEG\\} recording. The cued two-choice task had three equiprobable cue conditions: No cue, with no information about the target; Neutral (temporal) cue, with an asterisk in the center of the visual field, predicting the target onset; and Spatial cues, with an asterisk in the upper or lower hemifield, predicting the onset and corresponding location of the target. The \\{ERPs\\} were estimated for the mid-frontal (Fz) and mid-parietal (Pz) scalp derivations. In the Pz, the Neutral cue \\{P3\\} had a lower amplitude than the Spatial cue P3; whereas for the target ERPs, the \\{P3\\} of the Neutral cue condition was larger than that of the Spatial cue condition. However, the sums of the magnitudes of the cue and target \\{P3\\} were equal in the spatial and neutral cueing, probably indicating that in both cases the equivalent information processing load is included in either the cue or the target reaction, respectively. Meantime, in the Fz, the analog \\{ERP\\} components for both the cue and target stimuli did not depend on the cue condition. The results show that, in the parietal site, the spatial cue \\{P3\\} reflects the processing of visuospatial information regarding the target position. This contributes to the subsequent \u201cdecision-making\u201d, thus reducing the information processing load on the target response, which is probably reflected in the lower P3.

This approach was first proposed by Brainerd et\u00a0al. in Brainerd et\u00a0al. (2013). The subadditivity of probability in focus arises as a violation of the disjunction rule of Boolean algebra. This phenomenon is viewed as a consequence of the co-existence of two types of memory traces: verbatim and gist. Instead of assuming that verbatim and gist trace can combine into a coherent memory state of superposition as is done in the \\{QEM\\} model, we propose to model gist and verbatim traces as Bohr complementary properties of memory. In mathematical terms, we represent the two types of memory as alternative bases of one and the same Hilbert Space. We argue that, in contrast with the \\{QEM\\} model, our model appeals to the one essential distinction between classical and quantum models of reality namely the existence of incompatible but complementary properties of a system. This feature is also at the heart of the quantum cognition approach to mental phenomena. We sketch an experiment that could separate the two models. We next test our model with data from the same word list experiment as the one used by Brainerd et\u00a0al. While our model entails significantly less degrees of freedom it yields a good fit to the experimental data.",

Recently, ubiquitin\u2013proteasome mediated protein degradation has been identified as a critical regulator of memory trace destabilization following retrieval, though the specific mechanisms controlling retrieval-induced changes in ubiquitin\u2013proteasome activity remain equivocal. Here, we found that proteasome activity is increased in the amygdala in a CaMKII-dependent manner following the retrieval of a contextual fear memory. We show that in vitro inhibition of CaMKII reversed retrieval-induced increases in proteasome activity. Additionally, in vivo pharmacological blockade of CaMKII abolished increases in proteolytic activity and activity related regulatory phosphorylation in the amygdala following retrieval, suggesting that CaMKII was \u201cupstream\u201d of protein degradation during the memory reconsolidation process. Consistent with this, while inhibiting CaMKII in the amygdala did not impair memory following retrieval, it completely attenuated the memory impairments that resulted from post-retrieval protein synthesis blockade.

Statistical and structural patterns have been proposed for image retrieval and browsing. In the proposed work, a new texture feature descriptor is developed. The proposed method uses local intensity of pixels based on three directions in the neighborhood and named as the local tri-directional pattern (LTriDP). Also, one magnitude pattern is merged for better feature extraction. The proposed method is tested on three databases, in which first two, Brodatz texture image database and \\{MIT\\} VisTex database are texture image databases and third one is the AT&amp;T face database. Further, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proven by comparing it with existing algorithms for image retrieval application.",

        "abstract": "AbstractGoals To evaluate the contribution of multiphase whole-body \\{CT\\} angiography (CTA) for identifying the contra-indications to multiorgan retrieval (MOR) and improving the preoperative organ harvesting strategy. Patients and methods One hundred and eleven consecutive patients who were clinically brain dead underwent multiphase whole-body \\{CTA\\} to confirm the diagnosis of brain death and for assessment of MOR. The \\{CTA\\} protocol included volumetric acquisitions of the brain and abdominopelvic cavity without \\{IV\\} administration of iodinated contrast material, then images of the thorax-abdomen-pelvis 25 s after \\{IV\\} contrast administration, of the brain at 60 s and finally an abdominopelvic \\{CT\\} acquisition at 90 s. The diagnosis of brain death was based on well-established criteria. The assessment of thorax, abdomen and pelvis was based on a systematic checklist. Post-processing imaging techniques were used in all patients. Results No organs were retrieved from 21\u00a0patients due to patient refusal (19%). Twenty-two potential \\{MOR\\} were denied because of general contra-indications including 12/22 (54%) based on \\{CTA\\} criteria alone. Finally, 68\u00a0patients were eligible for \\{MOR\\} and 160\u00a0organs were harvested. The exclusion of specific organs was based on \\{CTA\\} alone for 2/16 livers, 4/70 kidneys and 5/55 lungs. Fifty hearts and 58 pancreases were not harvested, none based on \\{CTA\\} results alone. Hepatic abnormalities and vascular anatomical variants were identified in 10% of patients. At least one renal artery variant was found in 28% of patients, 13% presented with a double renal vein and 8% with a hepato-mesenteric artery. Conclusion Multiphase whole-body \\{CTA\\} for \\{MOR\\} is based on the simultaneous association of cerebral \\{CTA\\} to determine brain death with \\{CTA\\} of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis. This rapid, standardized and easily accessible procedure has no harmful effects on harvested kidneys. It makes it possible to select the donors and the organs to be harvested and allows the retrieving surgeon to identify and anticipate technical difficulties.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Behavioral evidence has shown age-related impairments in overcoming proactive interference in memory, but it is unclear what underlies this deficit. Imaging studies in the young suggest overcoming interference may require several executive control processes supported by the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and dorsolateral \\{PFC\\} (DLPFC). The present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated whether age-related changes in dissociable executive control processes underlie deficits in overcoming proactive interference in associative memory during retrieval. Participants were tasked with remembering which associate (face or scene) objects were paired with most recently during study, under conditions of high or low proactive interference. Behavioral results demonstrated that, as interference increased, memory performance decreased similarly across groups, with slight associative memory deficits in older adults. Imaging results demonstrated that, across groups, left mid-VLPFC showed increasing activity with increasing interference, though activity did not distinguish correct from incorrect associative memory responses, suggesting this region may not directly serve in successful resolution of proactive interference, per se. Under conditions of high interference, older adults showed reduced associative memory accuracy effects in the \\{DLPFC\\} and anterior PFC. These results suggest that age-related \\{PFC\\} dysfunction may not be ubiquitous. Executive processes supported by ventral regions that detect mnemonic interference may be less affected than processes supported by dorsal and anterior regions that directly resolve interference.",

Object shape is a meaningful and informative cue in object recognition, where an effective shape descriptor plays an important role. To capture the invariant features of both local shape details and visual parts, we propose a novel invariant multi-scale descriptor for shape matching and retrieval. In this work, we define three types of invariants to capture the shape features from different aspects. Each type of the invariants is used in multiple scales from a local range to a semi-global part. An adaptive discrete contour evolution method is also proposed to extract the salient feature points of a shape contour for compact representation. Shape matching is performed using the dynamic programming algorithm. The proposed method is invariant to rotation, scale variation, intra-class variation, articulated deformation and partial occlusion. Our method is robust to noise as well. To validate the invariance and robustness of our proposed method, we perform experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, including MPEG-7, Kimia and articulated shape datasets. The competitive results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed method for shape matching and retrieval.",

In this context, we use the recently proposed finite mixture of generalized Gaussian distribution (MoGG) thanks to its ability to model accurately a wide range of wavelet sub-bands histograms. This model has already been relied on the approximation of Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence (KLD) which hinders significantly the retrieval process. To overcome this drawback, we introduce the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz divergence (CSD) between two MoGG distributions as a similarity measure. Hence, an analytic closed-form expression of this measure is developed in the case of fixed shape parameter. Otherwise, when the shape parameter is variable, two approximations are derived using the well-known stochastic integration with Monte-Carlo simulations and numerical integration with Simpson\u05f3s rule. Experiments conducted on a well known dataset show good performance of the \\{CSD\\} in terms of retrieval rates and the computational time improvement compared to the KLD.",

Secondary aims were to evaluate other clinical characteristics of the cohort and identify predictors of sperm retrieval. Study design Patients 12-25\u00a0years of age with Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) were recruited at the Boston Children's Hospital. Physical examination, biochemical evaluation, scrotal ultrasonography, and semen analysis were performed. Neurocognitive data were collected. Microdissection sperm extraction (unilateral micro-testicular sperm extraction) was offered to individuals with no sperm in their ejaculates. Given the small sample size, analysis was primarily descriptive. Results Fifteen patients were enrolled. None had sperm in their ejaculates. Ten patients underwent unilateral micro-testicular sperm extraction. Sperm retrieval rate was 50%. From a neurocognitive standpoint, subjects reported problems with peers, conduct, and overall difficulties. Incidentally, one-third of the patients were found to have testicular microlithiasis and 17% of subjects with renal ultrasound imaging had bilateral renal medullary nephrocalcinosis. Conclusions This pilot study suggests that sperm retrieval rates in adolescents and young adults with Klinefelter syndrome are comparable with those reported in older men.

According to error model, a 0.01 (1%) uncertainty of \\{LSE\\} may result in a 0.5 K error in \\{LST\\} under a moderate condition, while an obvious error (approximately 1 K) is possible under a warmer and less humid situation. Significant emissivity variations are presented among the anthropogenic materials in three spectral libraries, which raise a critical question that whether urban \\{LSE\\} can be estimated accurately to meet the needs for \\{LST\\} retrieval. Methods widely used for urban \\{LSE\\} estimation are investigated, including the classification-based method, the spectral-index based method, and the linear spectral mixture model (LSMM). Results indicate that the classification-based method may not be effectively applicable for urban \\{LSE\\} estimation, due mainly to the insignificant relation between the short-wave multispectral reflectance and the long-wave thermal emissivity shown by the spectra. Compared with the classification-based method, the \\{LSMM\\} shows relatively more accurate predictions, whereas, the performance of the \\{LSMM\\} largely depends on the determination of endmembers. Obvious uncertainties in \\{LSE\\} estimation likely appear if endmembers are determined improperly.

So far, it was unknown whether this results from the representation of specific stereoscopic information in memory or a more general representation of an object's depth structure. Therefore, we investigated whether continuous object rotation acting as depth cue during encoding results in a memory representation that can subsequently be accessed by stereoscopic information during retrieval. In Experiment 1, we found such transfer effects from continuous object rotation during encoding to stereoscopic presentations during retrieval. In Experiments 2a and 2b, we found that the continuity of object rotation is important because only continuous rotation and/or stereoscopic depth but not multiple static snapshots presented without stereoscopic information caused the extraction of an object's depth structure into memory. We conclude that an object's depth structure and not specific depth cues are represented in memory.",

Materials and methods In retrospective studies, information on the tooth position, the root canal curvature, and the depth and length of separated instruments were collected in 210 clinical cases with separated instruments in the lower segments of curved root canals. The correlations of these factors and the retrieval rate of separated instruments were analyzed. Two factors with significant correlations were chosen and a regression equation was established using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis. In the verification study, the efficiency of the statistical model was verified by 63 new cases. Results The root canal curvature and depth of the separated instruments are major factors affecting the retrieval rate of broken instruments. The retrieval rate of separated instruments decreased gradually with the increase of root canal curvature or the depth of the instrument. A regression equation was established correlating these two factors. The predicted accuracy rate of the regression equation was 94.3% for successful retrieval, and 80.0% for failed retrieval.

Experiment 1 demonstrated that people make both kinds of source-error during recall, but source errors are more common in the recall-partner task. This pattern was replicated in Experiments 2a and 2b with source-errors and intrusions increasing over a delay. Experiment 3 used an extended version of each recall task, in which participants reported all items that came to mind, whilst indicating which responses were goal-relevant. The tendency for source-errors to occur more for the recall-partner task was shown to be a function of both idea availability and output monitoring, whereas the tendency for source-errors to increase over a delay was shown to be due solely to output monitoring.

Aim Previous studies mainly focused on the analysis of the performances of IR-based traceability recovery methods and several enhancing strategies have been proposed to improve their accuracy. Very few papers investigate how developers (i) use IR-based traceability recovery tools and (ii) analyse the list of suggested links to validate correct links or discard false positives. We focus on this issue and suggest exploiting link count information in IR-based traceability recovery tools to improve the performances of the developers during a traceability recovery process. Method Two empirical studies have been conducted to evaluate the usefulness of link count information. The two studies involved 135 University students that had to perform (with and without link count information) traceability recovery tasks on two software project repositories. Then, we evaluated the quality of the recovered traceability links in terms of links correctly and erroneously traced by the students. Results The results achieved indicate that the use of link count information significantly increases the number of correct links identified by the participants. Conclusions The results can be used to derive guidelines on how to effectively use traceability recovery approaches and tools proposed in the literature.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Developing and improving methods to monitor forest carbon in space and time is a timely challenge, especially for tropical forests. The next European Space Agency Earth Explorer Core Mission \\{BIOMASS\\} will collect synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data globally from employing a multiple baseline orbit during the initial phase of its lifetime. These data will be used for tomographic \\{SAR\\} (TomoSAR) processing, with a vertical resolution of about 20 m, a resolution sufficient to decompose the backscatter signal into two to three layers for most closed-canopy tropical forests. A recent study, conducted in the Paracou site, French Guiana, has already shown that TomoSAR significantly improves the retrieval of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in a high biomass forest, with an error of only 10% at 1.5-ha resolution. However, the degree to which this TomoSAR approach can be transferred from one site to another has not been assessed. We test this approach at the Nouragues site in central French Guiana (ca 100 km away from Paracou), and develop a method to retrieve the top-of-canopy height from TomoSAR. We found a high correlation between the backscatter signal and \\{AGB\\} in the upper canopy layer (i.e. 20\u201340 m), while lower layers only showed poor correlations. The relationship between \\{AGB\\} and TomoSAR data was found to be highly similar for forests at Nouragues and Paracou. Cross validation using training plots from Nouragues and validation plots from Paracou, and vice versa, gave an error of 16\u201318% of \\{AGB\\} using 1-ha plots. Finally, using a high-resolution LiDAR canopy model as a reference, we showed that TomoSAR has the potential to retrieve the top-of-canopy height with an error to within 2.5 m. Our analyses show that the TomoSAR-AGB retrieval method is accurate even in hilly and high-biomass forest areas and suggest that our approach may be generalizable to other study sites, having a canopy taller than 30 m. These results have strong implications for the tomographic phase of the \\{BIOMASS\\} spaceborne mission.",

The complexity, diversity, and volume of government regulations are detrimental to business and hinder public understanding of government. The burden of complying with regulations can fall disproportionately on small businesses since these businesses may not have the expertise or resources to keep track of the regulations and the requirements. Regulations emanating from different agencies, each has its own objectives and scopes of concerns, may overlap on similar and related issues and may have inconsistency. The situation can potentially be improved by developing appropriate methodologies and tools that can help facilitate the development and analysis of regulatory documents as well as compliance process.

This approach simulates a coupling scenario between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical images through the Water Cloud Model (WCM). A time series of \\{SAR\\} (TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed) and optical (SPOT 4/5 and \\{LANDSAT\\} 7/8) images were acquired over an irrigated grassland region in southeastern France. An inversion technique based on multi-layer perceptron neural networks (NNs) was used to invert the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for soil moisture estimation. Three inversion configurations based on \\{SAR\\} and optical images were defined: (1) \\{HH\\} polarization, (2) \\{HV\\} polarization, and (3) both \\{HH\\} and \\{HV\\} polarizations, all with one vegetation descriptor derived from optical data. The investigated vegetation descriptors were the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index \u201cNDVI\u201d, Leaf Area Index \u201cLAI\u201d, Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation \u201cFAPAR\u201d, and the Fractional vegetation \\{COVER\\} \u201cFCOVER\u201d. These vegetation descriptors were derived from optical images. For the three inversion configurations, the \\{NNs\\} were trained and validated using a noisy synthetic dataset generated by the \\{WCM\\} for a wide range of soil moisture and vegetation descriptor values. The trained \\{NNs\\} were then validated from a real dataset composed of X-band \\{SAR\\} backscattering coefficients and vegetation descriptor derived from optical images. The use of X-band \\{SAR\\} measurements in \\{HH\\} polarization (in addition to one vegetation descriptor derived from optical images) yields more precise results on soil moisture (Mv) estimates. In the case of \\{NDVI\\} derived from optical images as the vegetation descriptor, the Root Mean Square Error on Mv estimates was 3.6 Vol.% for \\{NDVI\\} values between 0.45 and 0.75, and 6.1 Vol.% for \\{NDVI\\} between 0.75 and 0.90.

        "abstract": "Abstract The objective of this research is to use text similarity algorithms to enable retrieval and knowledge sharing of text-based assembly process plans. In distributed design-manufacturing enterprises, there exists a need to: (1) establish and use \u201cbest practice\u201d assembly process descriptions to ensure process design consistency across manufacturing locations and (2) leverage and adapt existing process design knowledge across product lines. In this research, the need for better communication is addressed by design knowledge reuse. Specifically, previously-authored assembly processes are retrieved from a centralized repository with a text-based similarity and retrieval algorithm. The similarity of forty-five text-based assembly work instruction pairs (obtained from ten work instruction sets) is computed using four text mining algorithms: (1) Word Overlap, (2) Jaccard Score, (3) TF\u2013IDF and (4) Latent Semantic Analysis. The similarity scores are used to compare and retrieve similar work instructions from a repository of existing assembly processes descriptions. A survey is conducted to develop a baseline quantification of assembly work instruction similarity. The scores from each text comparison method are compared to the scores from the survey. A statistical hypothesis test shows the Jaccard method mimics human interpretation of assembly work instruction similarity better than the three other text comparison methods. However, the Jaccard method is insensitive to synonymy and polysemy of words. The Latent Semantic Analysis method is relatively insensitive to synonymy and polysemy of words; and was found to have a difference of 0.1 with respect to survey data. This indicates that Latent Semantic Analysis can be used to retrieve assembly work instructions authored in free text. By doing so, engineers will be presented with similar variants of assembly work instructions have been authored. This will allow engineers to compare and assess the efficiency of their assembly process and gain insight into how other facilities are performing similar assembly operations.",

Two population sets were used to identify discriminating terms, that is, terms that appear frequently in the test set but infrequently in two population sets of references found in MEDLINE. We used text mining to conduct a frequency analysis of terms appearing in the titles and abstracts. Candidate terms were combined and tested in \\{MEDLINE\\} in various permutations, and the performance of strategies measured using sensitivity and precision. Results Two search strategies were developed: a sensitivity-maximizing strategy, achieving 93% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87, 96) and 7% precision (95% CI: 6, 8), and a sensitivity-and-precision\u2013maximizing strategy, achieving 66% sensitivity (95% CI: 58, 74) and 21% precision (95% CI: 17, 25).

To investigate this conceptual model of autobiographical fact knowledge, we analyzed the nature of autobiographical facts that were generated by 8 individuals with \\{MTL\\} amnesia and 12 control participants in a recent study of identity and memory [Grilli, M.D., &amp; Verfaellie, M.

Results revealed that \\{MTL\\} amnesic participants generated fewer experience-near autobiographical facts than controls. Experience-far autobiographical fact generation was not impaired in amnesic participants with damage restricted to the MTL, but there was preliminary evidence to suggest that it may be impaired in amnesic participants with damage to the \\{MTL\\} and anterior lateral temporal lobe. These results support a cognitive and neural distinction between experience-near and experience-far autobiographical facts and have implications for understanding the contribution of autobiographical fact knowledge to self-related cognition.",

As neuropsychological research has demonstrated that individuals with \\{OCD\\} tend to focus on details and miss the larger context, the construct of source (contextual) memory may be particularly relevant to memory complaints in OCD. Memory for object versus contextual information relies on partially distinct regions within the prefrontal cortex, parietal and medial temporal lobe, and may be differentially impacted by OCD. In the present study, we sought to test the hypothesis that individuals with \\{OCD\\} exhibit impaired source memory retrieval using a novel memory paradigm \u2013 The Memory for Rooms Test (MFRT) \u2013 a four-room memory task in which participants walk through four rooms and attempt to encode and remember objects. Demographically matched individuals with \\{OCD\\} and healthy controls studied objects in the context of four rooms, and then completed a memory retrieval test while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). While no differences were observed in source memory accuracy, individuals with \\{OCD\\} exhibited greater task related activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) relative to healthy controls during correct source memory retrieval. During correct object recognition, individuals with \\{OCD\\} failed to recruit the dorsolateral prefrontal(DLPFC)/premotor, left mPFC, and right parietal regions to the same extent as healthy controls. Our results suggest abnormal recruitment of frontal-parietal and \\{PCC\\} regions during source verses object memory retrieval in OCD. Within the \\{OCD\\} group, activation in the \\{PCC\\} and the premotor/DLPFC was associated with greater pathological doubt.

        "abstract": "Abstract The retrieval of motor memory requires a previous memory encoding and subsequent consolidation of the specific motor memory. Previous work showed that motor memory seems to rely on different memory components (e.g., implicit, explicit). However, it is still unknown if explicit components contribute to the retrieval of motor memories formed by dynamic adaptation tasks and which neural correlates are linked to memory retrieval. We investigated the lower and higher gamma bands of subjects' electroencephalography during encoding and retrieval of a dynamic adaptation task. A total of 24 subjects were randomly assigned to a treatment and control group. Both groups adapted to a force field A on day 1 and were re-exposed to the same force field A on day 3 of the experiment. On day 2, treatment group learned an interfering force field B whereas control group had a day rest. Kinematic analyses showed that control group improved their initial motor performance from day 1 to day 3 but treatment group did not. This behavioral result coincided with an increased higher gamma band power in the electrodes over prefrontal areas on the initial trials of day 3 for control but not treatment group. Intriguingly, this effect vanished with the subsequent re-adaptation on day 3. We suggest that improved re-test performance in a dynamic motor adaptation task is contributed by explicit memory and that gamma bands in the electrodes over the prefrontal cortex are linked to these explicit components. Furthermore, we suggest that the contribution of explicit memory vanishes with the subsequent re-adaptation while task automaticity increases.",

In the current study we investigated the efficacy of donepezil, risperidone and selective nicotinic \u03b17 and \u03b14\u03b22 receptor agonists to reverse a delay-induced deficit in recognition memory. Adult female Hooded Lister rats received drug treatments and were tested in the novel object recognition (NOR) task following a 6 h inter-trial interval (ITI). In all treatment groups, there was no preference for the left or right identical objects in the acquisition trial. Risperidone failed to enhance recognition memory in this paradigm whereas donepezil was effective such that rats discriminated between the novel and familiar object in the retention trial following a 6 h ITI. Although a narrow dose range of PNU-282987 and RJR-2403 was tested, only one dose of each increased recognition memory, the highest dose of PNU-282987 (10 mg/kg) and the lowest dose of RJR-2403 (0.1 mg/kg), indicative of enhanced cognitive performance. Interestingly, these compounds were also efficacious when administered either before the acquisition or the retention trial of the task, suggesting an important role for nicotinic receptor subtypes in the formation and retrieval of recognition memory.",

However, as we show in this study, na\u00efve application of \\{TC\\} to categorical target variables results in biased error estimates. The bias occurs because the categorical variable is usually bounded, introducing correlations between the errors and the truth, violating TC's assumptions. We introduce Categorical Triple Collocation (CTC), a variant of \\{TC\\} that relaxes these assumptions and may be applied to categorical target variables. The method estimates the rankings of the three measurement systems for each category with respect to their balanced accuracies (a binary-variable performance metric). As an example application, we estimate performance rankings of landscape freeze/thaw (FT) observations derived from model soil temperatures, in-situ station air temperatures and satellite-observed microwave brightness temperatures in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada. While rankings vary spatially, in most locations the model-based \\{FT\\} product is ranked the highest, followed by the satellite product and the in-situ air temperature product. These rankings are likely due to a combination of differences in measurement errors between \\{FT\\} products, and differences in scale.

        "abstract": "Abstract The high resolution provided by the current satellite \\{SAR\\} missions makes them an attractive solution for the detailed analysis of urban areas. Especially due to their weather and daylight independency, they can be employed when optical sensors come to their limits. Due to the specific oblique side-looking configuration of such \\{SAR\\} sensors, phenomena such as layover, double bounce and shadow appear at building location, which can be better understood with very high resolution (VHR) \\{SAR\\} data. The detection of those areas, as well as the retrieval of building parameters through a detailed analysis of the extracted structures, is a challenging task. Indeed, depending on the acquisition configuration, on building material and surroundings, those patterns are not always consistent in amplitude \\{SAR\\} images. They can be difficult to recognize and distinguish automatically. Considering InSAR phase images instead of amplitude images is very helpful for this task, as InSAR is more depending on the geometry. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the detection and extraction of building layover in InSAR phase images. Two complementing detectors are proposed, and their results are combined, in order to provide reliable building hypotheses. Based on the extracted segments, further analysis is conducted. Especially, the number of connected facades is analyzed. Characteristically geometrical shapes are finally fitted for each facade to permit the determination of the final building parameters as length, width, and height. Results of this approach are shown for three different datasets, first in terms of correctness and completeness of the extraction, and second in terms of accuracy of the extracted building parameters. For the considered datasets, the completeness and correctness are of about 70% and 90%, respectively. Eliminating clear outliers, the determined parameters present an accuracy up to 4 m (length), 2 m (height) and 3 \u00b0 (orientation).

        "abstract": "Abstract Surface emissivity maps in the infrared can contribute to explore Venus\u2019 geology. Nightside radiance spectra at Themis Regio acquired by the \\{IR\\} mapping channel of the Visible and InfraRed Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS-M-IR) aboard Venus \\{EXpress\\} (VEX) are used to derive emissivity data from the three accessible spectral surface windows at 1.02, 1.10, and 1.18 \u03bcm. The measured spectra are simulated by applying a full radiative transfer model. Neglecting geologic activity, a multi-spectrum retrieval algorithm is utilized to determine the emissivity maps of the surface target as parameter vectors that are common to many spectrally resolved images that cover this target. Absolute emissivity values are difficult to obtain due to strong interferences from other parameters. The true emissivity mean of the target cannot be retrieved, nor can the emissivity mean of a retrieved map be strictly preset. The retrieved map can exhibit trends with latitude and topography that are probably artificial. Once the trends have been removed in a post-processing step, it can be observed that the magnitude of the resulting spatial emissivity fluctuations around their mean value increases with increasing mean value. A linear transformation is applied that converts the de-trended map to exhibit a defined emissivity mean value called reference emissivity, here 0.5, yielding the \u2018renormalized emissivity map\u2019 with accordingly transformed fluctuations. It is verified that renormalized emissivity maps are largely independent of the emissivity mean before renormalization, of modifications to interfering atmospheric, surface, and instrumental parameters, and of selected details of the retrieval pipeline and data calibration and preprocessing. Extremely large emissivity retrieval errors due to imperfect or unconsidered forward model parameters are effectively avoided. If the absolute emissivity at a given bin of the target were known, the absolute emissivity map of the entire target could be computed according to the mentioned transformation, assuming absent true trends with latitude and topography. Until then, the renormalized emissivities are interpreted as spatial variations relative to the reference emissivity. They represent an important step toward the retrieval of absolute emissivities. Renormalized emissivity maps of Themis Regio at the three surface windows are determined from 64 measurement repetitions. Retrieval errors are estimated by a statistical evaluation of maps derived from various disjoint selections of spectra and using different assumptions on the interfering parameters. Double standard deviation errors for the three surface windows amount to 3%, 8%, and 4%, respectively, allowing geologic interpretation. A comparison to results from an earlier error analysis based on synthetic spectra shows that unconsidered time variations of interfering atmospheric parameters are a major error source. Spatial variations of the 1.02 \u03bcm surface emissivity of 20% that correspond to the difference between unweathered granitic and basaltic rocks would be easily detectable, but such variations are ruled out for the studied target area. Emissivity anomalies of up to 8% are detected at both 1.02 and 1.18 \u03bcm. At present sensitivity, no anomalies are identified at 1.10 \u03bcm, but anomalies exceeding the determined error level can be excluded. With single standard deviation significance, all three maps show interesting spatial emissivity variations.",

However, if we use the unsupervised method to achieve image retrieval, the accuracy of image retrieval is reduced obviously. Even if we use the supervised method, the computing time is too long because we need to learn quite a few learning instances. We use best feature descriptor selected, image optimization, deep learning technique to retrieve the target images that is similar to original image. On the one hand, we can see that the method makes full use of image information and select the most effective feature descriptors. On the other hand, we increase the accuracy through optimizing the target images and deep learning technique, so that it is convenient for us to extract more effective information directly. At last, we set up one big database that contains images from different categories. The images are as more complicated as possible.

        "abstract": "Abstract From the past few years, the size of the data grows exponentially with respect to volume, velocity, and dimensionality due to wide spread use of embedded and distributed surveillance cameras for security reasons. In this paper, we have proposed an integrated approach for biometric-based image retrieval and processing which addresses the two issues. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by the embedded and distributed surveillance cameras, and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on the user query. This paper addresses the first issue by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach based on contrast enhancement and colour balancing methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the colour balancing method helps to achieve a balanced colour. Importantly, in the colour balancing method, a new process for colour cast adjustment is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It adjusts the colour cast and maintains the luminance of the image. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The paper addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three features extraction methods namely colour, texture and shape. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images, the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics to improve the quality of the results further. The results show the proposed approaches perform better than the well-known existing approaches.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Episodic memory entails the ability to remember what happened when. Although the available evidence indicates that the hippocampus plays a role in structuring serial order information during retrieval of event sequences, information processed in the hippocampus must be conveyed to other cortical and subcortical areas in order to guide behavior. However, the extent to which other brain regions contribute to the temporal organization of episodic memory remains unclear. Here, we examined multivoxel activity pattern changes during retrieval of learned and random object sequences, focusing on a neocortical \u201ccore recollection network\u201d that includes the medial prefrontal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and angular gyrus, as well as on striatal areas including the caudate nucleus and putamen that have been implicated in processing of sequence information. The results demonstrate that regions of the core recollection network carry information about temporal positions within object sequences, irrespective of object information. This schematic coding of temporal information is in contrast to the putamen, which carried information specific to objects in learned sequences, and the caudate, which carried information about objects, irrespective of sequence context. Our results suggest a role for the cortical recollection network in the representation of temporal structure of events during episodic retrieval, and highlight the possible mechanisms by which the striatal areas may contribute to this process. More broadly, the results indicate that temporal sequence retrieval is a useful paradigm for dissecting the contributions of specific brain regions to episodic memory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Previous research has shown that there is considerable overlap in the neural networks mediating successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, little is known about how the relevant human brain regions interact during these distinct phases of memory or how such interactions are affected by memory deficits that characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that often precedes dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Here we employed multivariate Granger causality analysis using autoregressive modeling of inferred neuronal time series obtained by deconvolving the hemodynamic response function from measured blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time series data, in order to examine the effective connectivity between brain regions during successful encoding and/or retrieval of object location associations in \\{MCI\\} patients and comparable healthy older adults. During encoding, healthy older adults demonstrated a left hemisphere dominant pattern where the inferior frontal junction, anterior intraparietal sulcus (likely involving the parietal eye fields), and posterior cingulate cortex drove activation in most left hemisphere regions and virtually every right hemisphere region tested. These regions are part of a frontoparietal network that mediates top-down cognitive control and is implicated in successful memory formation. In contrast, in the \\{MCI\\} patients, the right frontal eye field drove activation in every left hemisphere region examined, suggesting reliance on more basic visual search processes. Retrieval in the healthy older adults was primarily driven by the right hippocampus with lesser contributions of the right anterior thalamic nuclei and right inferior frontal sulcus, consistent with theoretical models holding the hippocampus as critical for the successful retrieval of memories. The pattern differed in \\{MCI\\} patients, in whom the right inferior frontal junction and right anterior thalamus drove successful memory retrieval, reflecting the characteristic hippocampal dysfunction of these patients. These findings demonstrate that neural network interactions differ markedly between \\{MCI\\} patients and healthy older adults. Future efforts will investigate the impact of cognitive rehabilitation of memory on these connectivity patterns.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Passive microwave measurements have the potential to estimate vegetation optical depth (VOD), an indicator of aboveground vegetation water content. They are also sensitive to the vegetation scattering albedo and soil moisture. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve \\{VOD\\} and soil moisture from time series of dual-polarized L-band radiometric observations along with time-invariant scattering albedo. The method takes advantage of the relatively slow temporal dynamics of early morning vegetation water content and combines a number of consecutive observations to estimate a single VOD. It is termed the multi-temporal dual channel algorithm (MT-DCA). The soil dielectric constant (directly related to soil moisture) of each observation is also retrieved simultaneously. Additionally, the method retrieves a constant albedo, thereby providing for the first time information on global single-scattering albedo variations. The algorithm is tested using three years of L-band passive observations from the \\{NASA\\} Aquarius sensor. The global \\{VOD\\} distribution follows expected gradients of climate and canopy biomass conditions. Its seasonal dynamics follow expected behavior based on precipitation and land cover. The retrieved \\{VOD\\} is closely related to coincident cross-polarized backscatter coefficients. The \\{VOD\\} and dielectric retrievals from MT-DCA are compared to those obtained from implementing the commonly used Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm and shown to have less high-frequency noise. There is almost as much variation in MT-DCA retrieved albedo between pixels of a given land cover class than between land cover classes, suggesting the common approach of assigning albedo based on land cover class may not capture its spatial variability. Globally, albedo appears to be primarily sensitive to woody biomass. The proposed algorithm allows for a more accurate accounting of the effects of vegetation on radiometric soil moisture retrievals, and generates new observations of L-band \\{VOD\\} and effective single-scattering albedo. These new datasets are complementary to existing remotely sensed vegetation measurements such as fluorescence and optical-infrared indices.",

However, the notion that memory retrieval is necessary for reconsolidation has been recently challenged. Non-reinforced retrieval induces hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-dependent reconsolidation of spatial memory in the Morris water maze (MWM). We found that the effect of protein synthesis inhibition on this process is abolished when retrieval of the learned spatial preference is hindered through mPFC inactivation but not when it is blocked by deactivation of dorsal CA1. Our results do not fully agree with the hypothesis that retrieval is unneeded for reconsolidation. Instead, they support the idea that a hierarchic interaction between the hippocampus and the mPFC controls spatial memory in the MWM, and indicate that this cortex is sufficient to retrieve the information essential to reconsolidate the spatial memory trace, even when the hippocampus is inactivated.",

This study addresses this issue through a controlled meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies involving healthy participants. Various \\{EM\\} and \\{SM\\} task paradigms differ widely in the extent of default network involvement. Therefore, the issue at hand cannot be properly addressed without some control for this factor. In this regard, this study employs a two-stage analysis: a preliminary meta-analysis to select \\{EM\\} and \\{SM\\} task paradigms that recruit relatively extensive default network regions and a main analysis to compare the selected task paradigms. Based on a within-EM comparison, the default network contributed more to recollection/familiarity effects than to old/new effects, and based on a within-SM comparison, it contributed more to word/pseudoword effects than to semantic/phonological effects. According to a direct comparison of recollection/familiarity and word/pseudoword effects, each involving a range of default network regions, there were more overlaps than separations in default network subregions involved in these two effects. More specifically, overlaps included the bilateral posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, and left anteromedial prefrontal regions, whereas separations included only the hippocampal formation and the parahippocampal cortex region, which was unique to recollection/familiarity effects. These results indicate that \\{EM\\} and \\{SM\\} retrieval processes involving strong memory signals recruit extensive and largely overlapping default network regions and differ mainly in distinct contributions of hippocampus and parahippocampal regions to \\{EM\\} retrieval.",

        "abstract": "Objective To evaluate a single treatment center's experience with autologous \\{IVF\\} using vitrified and warmed oocytes, including fertilization, embryonic development, pregnancy, and birth outcomes, and to estimate the likelihood of live birth of at least one, two, or three children according to the number of mature oocytes cryopreserved by elective fertility preservation patients. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Private practice clinic. Patient(s) Women undergoing autologous \\{IVF\\} treatment using vitrified and warmed oocytes. Indications for oocyte vitrification included elective fertility preservation, desire to limit the number of oocytes inseminated and embryos created, and lack of available sperm on the day of oocyte retrieval. Intervention(s) Oocyte vitrification, warming, and subsequent \\{IVF\\} treatment. Main Outcome Measure(s) Post-warming survival, fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth rates. Result(s) A total of 1,283 vitrified oocytes were warmed for 128 autologous \\{IVF\\} treatment cycles. Postthaw survival, fertilization, implantation, and birth rates were all comparable for the different oocyte cryopreservation indications; fertilization rates were also comparable to fresh autologous intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles (70% vs. 72%). Implantation rates per embryo transferred (43% vs. 35%) and clinical pregnancy rates per transfer (57% vs. 44%) were significantly higher with vitrified\u2013warmed compared with fresh oocytes. However, there was no statistically significant difference in live birth/ongoing pregnancy (39% vs. 35%). The overall vitrified\u2013warmed oocyte to live born child efficiency was 6.4%. Conclusion(s) Treatment outcomes using autologous oocyte vitrification and warming are as good as cycles using fresh oocytes. These results are especially reassuring for infertile patients who must cryopreserve oocytes owing to unavailability of sperm or who wish to limit the number of oocytes inseminated. Age-associated estimates of oocyte to live-born child efficiencies are particularly useful in providing more explicit expectations regarding potential births for elective oocyte cryopreservation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study addresses the problem of the acoustic characterization of an inhomogeneous object such as a soft-tissue organ containing a cyst or tumor whose size and/or composition evolve either negatively due to increased disease or positively due to increased response to treatment. The so-called \u2018corrupted\u2019 binary object, probed by a transient, acoustic plane wave, is a tube composed of a homogenous fluid-like (or assumed as such) mantle (medium 1: three acoustic constitutive parameters, one geometric parameter) surrounding a homogeneous fluid-like (or assumed as such) core (medium 2: three acoustic constitutive parameters, one geometric parameter), immersed in a spatially-infinite, homogeneous fluid (host medium 0: two acoustic parameters). The complete inversion of the diffracted acoustic field response of this object involves the retrieval of seven (six acoustic and one geometric) parameters, assuming we know beforehand the outer radius of the tube and acoustic parameters of the host. An alternative to this time-consuming, hazardous (due to the ill-posed nature of the) procedure, is to minimize the discrepancy, between the full waveform response of the binary object to a transient plane wave and the response of a homogeneous cylinder (medium characterized by three acoustic parameters, one geometric parameter) to the same transient plane wave, so as to retrieve the (three so-called equivalent) acoustic parameters of the homogeneous object. Thus, the first inverse problem is replaced by a second one (same assumptions concerning the outer radius of the objects, the host medium, the probe radiation and the sensing configuration as the first one) involving the retrieval of only three (instead of six) acoustic parameters. This procedure is potentially useful if the variation of at least one of the three equivalent parameters is sensitive to the variation of a key parameter of the inhomogeneous body (usually the characteristic dimension or the wavespeed of the core) and this variation can be expressed in a simple algebraic form (such as by a mixing formula). It is shown that this situation can arise if the average frequency of the acoustic probe radiation is sufficiently low. A sidelight of this investigation is the discovery that the equivalent constitutive parameters of the homogeneous cylinder are dispersive even when the component materials of the tube are not dispersive.",

        "abstract": "Abstract While prior work has shown greater retrieval-related reactivation in the ventral visual stream for emotional stimuli compared to neutral stimuli, the effects of valence on retrieval-related recapitulation of successful encoding processes (Dm effects) have yet to be investigated. Here, seventeen participants (aged 19\u201335) studied line drawings of negative, positive, or neutral images followed immediately by the complete photo. After a 20-min delay, participants performed a challenging recognition memory test, distinguishing the studied line drawing outlines from novel ones. First, results replicated earlier work by demonstrating that negative and positive hits elicited greater ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOTC) activity than neutral hits during both encoding and retrieval. Moreover, the amount of activation in portions of the \\{VOTC\\} correlated with the magnitude of participants\u2019 emotional memory enhancement. Second, results revealed significant retrieval-related recapitulation of Dm effects (Hits&gt;Misses) in \\{VOTC\\} (anterior inferior temporal gyri) only for negative stimuli. Third, connectivity between the amygdala and fusiform gyrus during the encoding of negative stimuli increased the likelihood of fusiform activation during successful retrieval. Together, these results suggest that recapitulation in posterior \\{VOTC\\} reflects memory for the affective dimension of the stimuli (Emotional Hits&gt;Neutral Hits) and the magnitude of activation in some of these regions is related to superior emotional memory. Moreover, for negative stimuli, recapitulation in more anterior portions of the \\{VOTC\\} is greater for remembered than forgotten items. The current study offers new evidence for effects of emotion on recapitulation of activity and functional connectivity in support of memory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Successful working-memory retrieval requires that items be retained as distinct units. At the neural level, it has been shown that theta-band oscillatory power increases with the number of to-be-distinguished items during working-memory retrieval. Here we hypothesized that during sentence comprehension, verbal-working-memory retrieval demands lead to increased theta power over frontal cortex, supposedly supporting the distinction amongst stored items during verbal-working-memory retrieval. Also, synchronicity may increase between the frontal cortex and the posterior cortex, with the latter supposedly supporting item retention. We operationalized retrieval by using pronouns, which refer to and trigger the retrieval of antecedent nouns from a preceding sentence part. Retrieval demand was systematically varied by changing the pronoun antecedent: Either, it was non-embedded in the preceding main clause, and thus easy-to-retrieve across a single clause boundary, or embedded in the preceding subordinate clause, and thus hard-to-retrieve across a double clause boundary. We combined electroencephalography (EEG), scalp-level time\u2013frequency analysis, source localization, and source-level coherence analysis, observing a frontal-midline and broad left-hemispheric theta-power increase for embedded-antecedent compared to non-embedded-antecedent retrieval. Sources were localized to left-frontal, left-parietal, and bilateral-inferior-temporal cortices. Coherence analyses suggested synchronicity between left-frontal and left-parietal and between left-frontal and right-inferior-temporal cortices. Activity of an array of left-frontal, left-parietal, and bilateral-inferior-temporal cortices may thus assist retrieval during sentence comprehension, potentially indexing the orchestration of item distinction, verbal working memory, and long-term memory. Our results extend prior findings by mapping prior knowledge on the functional role of theta oscillations onto processes genuine to human sentence comprehension.",

In this study, we present an improvement on the parameterization equations in the inverse scheme of the 2Seacolor model. The improved model is then validated with three in-situ datasets and compared with the Zhang model (Zhang &amp; Fell, 2007) and the Lee model (Lee, Darecki et al., 2005). Validation with radiometric data shows that the 2SeaColor model provides the best estimates of Kd for the full range of observations, with the largest determination coefficient (R2 = 0.935) and the smallest root mean squared error (RMSE = 0.078 m\u2212 1). For clear waters, where Kd(490) &lt; 0.2, the Zhang model provides the most accurate Kd estimations, but results from the Lee model and the 2SeaColor are rather comparable. For turbid waters, where Kd(490) &gt; 0.2 m\u2212 1, the 2SeaColor model is found to be more accurate, with an \\{RMSE\\} of 0.186 m\u2212 1, compared to \\{RMSEs\\} of 0.279 m\u2212 1 and 0.388 m\u2212 1 for the Zhang model and the Lee model, respectively. The 2SeaColor model is finally applied to the \\{GOCI\\} (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) level 2 product (L2P) to produce Kd maps over the Yangtze Estuary, resulting in a reasonable distribution and expected range of Kd, as for example Kd(490) was varying from 0.04 to 9.82 m\u2212 1 for the image acquired at 02:16 UTC, on March 8th 2013. The analytical 2SeaColor model is able to provide consistently stable and fairly accurate Kd estimates in both clear and turbid waters without the need of tuning empirical coefficients from field measurements, and thus has great potential for estimating Kd over optically complex waters.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Information extraction systems discover structured information in natural language text. Having information in structured form enables much richer querying and data mining than possible over the natural language text. However, information extraction is a computationally expensive task, and hence improving the efficiency of the extraction process over large text collections is of critical interest. In this paper, we focus on an especially valuable family of text collections, namely, the so-called deep-web text collections, whose contents are not crawlable and are only available via querying. Important steps for efficient information extraction over deep-web text collections (e.g., selecting the collections on which to focus the extraction effort, based on their contents; or learning which documents within these collections\u2014and in which order\u2014to process, based on their words and phrases) require having a representative document sample from each collection. These document samples have to be collected by querying the deep-web text collections, an expensive process that renders impractical the existing sampling approaches developed for other data scenarios. In this paper, we systematically study the space of query-based document sampling techniques for information extraction over the deep web. Specifically, we consider (i) alternative query execution schedules, which vary on how they account for the query effectiveness, and (ii) alternative document retrieval and processing schedules, which vary on how they distribute the extraction effort over documents. We report the results of the first large-scale experimental evaluation of sampling techniques for information extraction over the deep web. Our results show the merits and limitations of the alternative query execution and document retrieval and processing strategies, and provide a roadmap for addressing this critically important building block for efficient, scalable information extraction.",

In this chapter, I review recent work showing that the model also accounts accurately for \\{RT\\} and choice-probability data in a wide variety of probe-recognition, short-term, memory-search paradigms. According to the model, observers store items from study lists as individual exemplars in memory. When a test probe is presented, it causes the exemplars to be retrieved. The exemplars that are most readily retrieved are those that are highly similar to the test probe and that have the greatest memory strengths. The retrieved exemplars drive a familiarity-based evidence-accumulation process that determines the speed and accuracy of old\u2013new recognition decisions. The model accounts for effects of memory-set size, old-new status of test probe, and study-test lag; effects of the detailed similarity structure of the memory set; and the role of the history of previously experienced memory sets on performance. Applications of the model reveal a quantitative law of how memory strength varies with the retention interval. In addition, the model provides a unified account of how probe recognition operates in cases involving short and long study lists. Furthermore\u00a0it provides an account of the classic distinction between controlled versus automatic processing depending on the types of memory-search practice in which observers engage.

The comparatively high revisit frequency and high variability in angular sampling of the \\{AVHRR\\} sensors operated simultaneously onboard the different National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellites contribute substantially to the success and quality of \\{BRDF\\} retrieval. The performance of the \\{BRDF\\} model for \\{AVHRR\\} data is assessed by comparison to \\{MODIS\\} \\{BRDF\\} retrievals, and the \\{AVHRR\\} \\{BRDF\\} reflectance data is validated against \\{BRDF\\} reflectance data from \\{MODIS\\} and in situ data gathered at three field sites in Switzerland. The comparison shows that the \\{AVHRR\\} \\{BRDF\\} retrievals are of high quality across most of Europe. The higher angular sampling of \\{AVHRR\\} allows for more full model retrievals of best quality and generates less fill values compared to MODIS. For most of the years investigated, the absolute accuracy of the \\{AVHRR\\} albedos is found to be within 0.05 throughout the complete seasonal cycle with a minimum bias at the peak of the growing season. However, they systematically underestimate the field-measured albedos, predominantly in winter due to spatial scale mismatch in combination with site heterogeneity and because the expression for the calculation of satellite-based blue-sky albedo does not account for multiple scattering. A slightly increased underestimation also occurs during vegetation senescence, presumably because of the narrow to broadband conversion employing only two bands. Overall, the results confirm the potential of \\{AVHRR\\} to produce multi-decadal data sets of reflectance anisotropy and albedo for use in climate monitoring and modeling studies. This offers a promising and unique opportunity to produce a BRDF/albedo climate data record from \\{AVHRR\\} dating back to 1985.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Passive microwave remote sensing at L-band has been widely acknowledged as the most promising technique to observe the spatial distribution of near surface (top ~ 5 cm) soil moisture at regional to global scales. The launch of the ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission in 2009 now means that global space-borne brightness temperature observations are available at L-band (1.41 GHz) to estimate soil moisture every 2 to 3 days with a target accuracy of 0.04 m3/m3. Moreover, NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite has been launched on 31st January 2015, also carrying an L-band radiometer, together with an L-band radar for downscaling the brightness temperature observations to better than 10 km resolution. At the SMOS/SMAP radiometer scale of ~ 40 km, the presence of water bodies potentially induces an overestimation of retrieved soil moisture, if not carefully accounted for in retrieval models. Such water fraction effects on brightness temperature and soil moisture retrieval accuracy were investigated in this study, using airborne L-band brightness temperature data collected during three Australian field experiments. The water induced brightness temperature effect and water fraction were compared under different resolutions, sampling days, and land surface conditions, showing that the water fraction impact on retrieved soil moisture is independent of scale, but heavily dependent on the soil water content status. Subsequently, the highest water fraction threshold that can be tolerated in order to achieve the 0.04 m3/m3 target accuracy without correction has been determined as 0.08 (actual range is from 0.02 for dry bare soil to 0.08 for wet vegetated soil). Using a \\{MODIS\\} derived water fraction dataset, the water fraction dynamics were also studied over Australia during the ten years from 2001 to 2010. The results show that if the mean water fraction map was used as a static water map to flag or correct water effects, the water body induced soil moisture retrieval error would have exceeded the 0.04 m3/m3 target more than once for 13.5% of the Australian land 40 km sized radiometer pixels; only 0.6% Australian land pixels would have exceeded this target with a frequency of 10 times or more per year.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Soil moisture is a principal component of the Earth's climate and hydrological systems that is difficult to monitor and model due to high variability, uncertainty in land surface characterization and uncertainty in soil moisture forcing. Satellite soil moisture retrievals and brightness temperature observations, such as those available from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, can be a valuable source of information for data assimilation and merging with other satellite retrieval datasets. To correct for biases in these data sets, bias correction methods such as cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, linear rescaling and copulas are used to map satellite soil moisture climatology to that of in situ or model values. This study compared \\{SMOS\\} retrievals to soil moisture observations from the \\{SCAN\\} network for a calibration period of 2010\u20132011 and validation period of 2012\u20132013 before and after bias correction. The focus of the study was on the presence and removal of multiplicative bias when comparing \\{SMOS\\} retrievals to \\{SCAN\\} data. Additive bias between \\{SMOS\\} retrievals and \\{SCAN\\} observations was removed by standard bias correction techniques and a new resampling approach was found to reduce multiplicative biases. In addition, the new bias correction technique was found very competitive with the benchmark methods for both the calibration and validation periods.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Graph-based representations are experiencing a growing usage in visual recognition and retrieval due to their representational power in front of classical appearance-based representations. However, retrieving a query graph from a large dataset of graphs implies a high computational complexity. The most important property for a large-scale retrieval is the search time complexity to be sub-linear in the number of database examples. With this aim, in this paper we propose a graph indexation formalism applied to visual retrieval. A binary embedding is defined as hashing keys for graph nodes. Given a database of labeled graphs, graph nodes are complemented with vectors of attributes representing their local context. Then, each attribute vector is converted to a binary code applying a binary-valued hash function. Therefore, graph retrieval is formulated in terms of finding target graphs in the database whose nodes have a small Hamming distance from the query nodes, easily computed with bitwise logical operators. As an application example, we validate the performance of the proposed methods in different real scenarios such as handwritten word spotting in images of historical documents or symbol spotting in architectural floor plans.",

        "abstract": "Abstract A real world problem of image retrieval and searching is considered in this paper. In modern generation, managing images from a large storage medium is not a straightforward job. Many researchers have worked on texture features, and produced diverse feature descriptors based on uniform, rotation invariant, edges and directional properties. However, most of them convert the relationship of the center pixel and the boundary pixel into a local pattern, and use histogram to represent the local pattern as a feature vector. In this work, we propose a new image retrieval technique; local extrema co-occurrence patterns (LECoP) using the \\{HSV\\} color space. \\{HSV\\} color space is used in this method to utilize the color, intensity and brightness of images. Local extrema patterns are applied to define the local information of image, and gray level co-occurrence matrix is used to obtain the co-occurrence of \\{LEP\\} map pixels. The local extrema co-occurrence pattern extracts the local directional information from local extrema pattern, and convert it into a well-mannered feature vector with use of gray level co-occurrence matrix. The presented method is tested on five standard databases called Corel, \\{MIT\\} VisTex and STex, in which Corel database includes Corel-1k, Corer-5k and Corel-10k databases. Also, this algorithm is compared with previous proposed methods, and results in terms of precision and recall are shown in this work.",

For these cases, similarity search appears to be the best retrieval method, but there is a lack of techniques suited for these conditions. This work presents a combination of machine learning algorithms put together to find the most similar object of a given one in a set of pre-processed objects based only on their metadata tags. The algorithm represents objects as character frequency curves and is capable of finding relationships between objects without an apparent association. It can also be parallelized using MapReduce strategies to perform the search. This method can be applied to a wide variety of documents with metadata tags.

        "abstract": "Abstract Urban warming has become a serious problem due to global warming and rapid urbanization. One important phenomenon is the increasing urban heat island (UHI) effect, which has a serious negative impact on energy consumption, environmental pollution, and human well-being. Trees lower land surface and air temperatures by providing shade and through the process of evapotranspiration and therefore are useful in effectively mitigating the \\{UHI\\} effect. The cooling effects of trees vary depending on the tree crown size and density and the optical properties of their leaves. Selection of the best species to plant is important in achieving effective mitigation of the \\{UHI\\} effect. In this research, we examined four woodlands. Three of these woodlands are dominated by species (Cinnamomum camphora, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Magnolia grandiflora) that are frequently planted in Nanjing, China and one is a mixed woodland. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) was employed to detail the vegetation canopy structure and capture the volume of three-dimensional point clouds of the leaves (L_V3DPC), as well as the shade at each case study site. Meteorological parameters were measured at each site. Statistical analysis was used to assess the cooling effects of the different woodlands and their impacts. This research revealed that trees can influence the microclimate beneath their canopies and that the degree of the impact is different for different tree species. Statistical analyses showed that the woodlands studied exhibit obvious temperature reductions during the daytime (05:00\u201319:30) and weaker temperature reductions during the nighttime (19:30\u201305:00). The temperature reduction was greatest for M. glyptostroboides, followed by C. camphora, M. grandiflora, and the trees in the mixed broad-leaved woodland. These results indicate that small-leaved species tend to be more effective at cooling than large-leaved species. Comparisons of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Sky View Factor (SVF) with L_V3DPC and shade, respectively, show that L_V3DPC and shade better reflect the impact of the vegetation canopy on the cooling effect. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that shading by trees is of prime importance in cooling the thermal environment. The high significance of L_V3DPC and shade indicate that the tree canopy is a major component of the contribution of trees to microclimatic environments, particularly the cooling effect under the tree canopy. This paper presents an innovative technique for determining tree canopy shade using \\{TLS\\} data for the purpose of analyzing the cooling effect of trees. The findings can be used as a guide to aid in the selection of the best species for urban greenspace planning and design to cool the thermal environment and enhance energy savings in urban environments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Fine scale maps of vegetation biophysical variables are useful status indicators for monitoring and managing national parks and endangered habitats. Here, we assess in a comparative way four different retrieval methods for estimating leaf area index (LAI) in grassland: two radiative transfer model (RTM) inversion methods (one based on look-up-tables (LUT) and one based on predictive equations) and two statistical modelling methods (one partly, the other entirely based on in situ data). For prediction, spectral data were used that had been acquired over Majella National Park in Italy by the airborne hyperspectral HyMap instrument. To assess the performance of the four investigated models, the normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) between estimates and in situ \\{LAI\\} measurements are reported (n = 41). Using a jackknife approach, we also quantified the accuracy and robustness of empirical models as a function of the size of the available calibration data set. The results of the study demonstrate that the LUT-based \\{RTM\\} inversion yields higher accuracies for \\{LAI\\} estimation (R2 = 0.91, nRMSE = 0.18) as compared to \\{RTM\\} inversions based on predictive equations (R2 = 0.79, nRMSE = 0.38). The two statistical methods yield accuracies similar to the \\{LUT\\} method. However, as expected, the accuracy and robustness of the statistical models decrease when the size of the calibration database is reduced to fewer samples. The results of this study are of interest for the remote sensing community developing improved inversion schemes for spaceborne hyperspectral sensors applicable to different vegetation types. The examples provided in this paper may also serve as illustrations for the drawbacks and advantages of physical and empirical models.",

An experimental field dataset (SPARC), collected at the agricultural site of Barrax (Spain), was used to evaluate different retrieval methods on their ability to estimate leaf area index (LAI). With regard to parametric methods, all possible band combinations for several two-band and three-band index formulations and a linear regression fitting function have been evaluated. From a set of over ten thousand indices evaluated, the best performing one was an optimized three-band combination according to ( \u03c1 560 - \u03c1 1610 - \u03c1 2190 ) / ( \u03c1 560 + \u03c1 1610 + \u03c1 2190 ) with a 10-fold cross-validation R \\{CV\\} 2 of 0.82 ( \\{RMSE\\} \\{CV\\} : 0.62). This family of methods excel for their fast processing speed, e.g., 0.05 s to calibrate and validate the regression function, and 3.8 s to map a simulated \\{S2\\} image. With regard to non-parametric methods, 11 machine learning regression algorithms (MLRAs) have been evaluated. This methodological family has the advantage of making use of the full optical spectrum as well as flexible, nonlinear fitting. Particularly kernel-based \\{MLRAs\\} lead to excellent results, with variational heteroscedastic (VH) Gaussian Processes regression (GPR) as the best performing method, with a R \\{CV\\} 2 of 0.90 ( \\{RMSE\\} \\{CV\\} : 0.44). Additionally, the model is trained and validated relatively fast (1.70 s) and the processed image (taking 73.88 s) includes associated uncertainty estimates. More challenging is the inversion of a \\{PROSAIL\\} based radiative transfer model (RTM). After the generation of a look-up table (LUT), a multitude of cost functions and regularization options were evaluated. The best performing cost function is Pearson\u2019s \u03c7 -square. It led to a R 2 of 0.74 (RMSE: 0.80) against the validation dataset. While its validation went fast (0.33 s), due to a per-pixel \\{LUT\\} solving using a cost function, image processing took considerably more time (01:01:47). Summarizing, when it comes to accurate and sufficiently fast processing of imagery to generate vegetation attributes, this paper concludes that the family of kernel-based \\{MLRAs\\} (e.g. GPR) is the most promising processing approach.",

Applying a sensitivity analysis on initial parameter settings of our retrieval code was proved vital for producing semi-automatized retrievals with a hybrid regularization method developed at the Institute of Mathematics of Potsdam University. A direct quantitative comparison of the retrieved microphysical properties with measurements from a Compact Time of Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (CToF-AMS) is used to validate our algorithm. Microphysical retrievals performed with sun photometer data are also used to explore our results. Focusing on the fine mode we observed remarkable similarities between the retrieved size distribution and the one measured by the AMS. More complicated atmospheric structures and the factor of absorption appear to depend more on particle radius being subject to variation. A good correlation was found between the aerosol effective radius and particle age, using the ratio of lidar ratios (LR: aerosol extinction to backscatter ratios) as an indicator for the latter. Finally, the dependence on relative humidity of aerosol effective radii measured on the ground and within the layers aloft show similar patterns.",

Our results show that there is almost a threefold improvement from 0.28 to 0.78 in the correlation coefficient when using the nonlinear model compared to using a linear regression model of \\{AOD\\} and PM10. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced from 34.42 to 21.33 \u03bcg/m3 using the nonlinear model over the linear model.

However, the basis of these post-collaborative benefits is largely unexplained. Thus, the primary goal of the current research was to investigate the cognitive mechanisms underlying post-collaborative benefits vis-\u00e0-vis the theoretical framework of distinctiveness theory, which postulates that two processes influence memory. Relational processing refers to the encoding of similarity among a set of items, whereas item-specific processing refers to the encoding of information that differentiates items from one another. The central claim of distinctiveness theory is that memory is enhanced when differences among individual items are processed in the context of the similarity among those items (referred to as distinctive processing). The basic design of all three experiments was similar (i.e., close replications with intent to provide multiple estimates of effect sizes on which to base conclusions): Learners were asked to study lists of exemplars from taxonomic categories, followed by recall practice that occurred either collaboratively or individually. All learners completed individual final tests, immediately after practice and/or after a delay. Of greatest theoretical interest for diagnosing the extent to which post-collaborative benefits reflect distinctive processing, we examined indicators of relational processing (clustering and category access) and item-specific processing (items recalled per category and recognition performance). Results across the three experiments established that distinctive processing (i.e., enhancements in both relational and item-specific processing) contributes to post-collaborative benefits across both short and long retention intervals.",
