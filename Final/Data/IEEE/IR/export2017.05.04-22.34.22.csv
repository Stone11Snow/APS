To aim at solving the problem, this paper puts forward a novel retrieval system, which is based on a dual-level index model. The dual-level index model introduces the index mechanism into the concept extending, to allow quick extending. Moreover, the model combines the memory buffering mechanism with the index of concept extending, to speed up the extending process. In order to apply the dual-level index model, a retrieval method is given for the retrieval system.

However, retrieving information from the web is not an easy task. Web's characteristics place many difficulties to users willing to explore it as an information source. Information retrieved from the web is usually very extensive, composed of voluminous collections of hypertext documents. Taking advantage of the intrinsic value present in this huge resource requires to organize relevant information according to specific needs. When organizing web resources to satisfy persistent information needs, some evaluation scheme is required to measure the system performance, as perceived by users. The resource quality might be continuously measured, allowing for automatic corrections if and when significant deviations are detected. This adaptive quality control framework may also detect and follow drift in user information needs. We propose to evaluate and control resources' global quality based on a three-dimensional space with dimensions representing Automation, Efficacy and Efficiency. Each dimension in this space aggregates a set of measures, relevant to the resource's global quality. The quality of the system is permanently monitored, the system periodically measures and stores the values of its quality parameters.

When unified data access is coupled with sophisticated data querying and discovery techniques, it will be possible to provide consumers with access to richer data sets and services that extend the use of key NOAA data. A traditional waterfall methodology is unlikely to keep up with the ever increasing volumes of data and number of data sources, and as a consequence the ever increasing number of access (interface) requirements driven by a ever increasing and diverse consumers.

Currently, the FMC estimation using spectral data is mainly based on spectral indices derived from several bands and these methods do not make full use of the entire spectrum. Partial Least Square (PLS) is a new multivariate statistical method which can effectively reduce collinearity. In this paper, using LOPEX dataset, we mainly explored the performance of PLS coupled with different feature selection methods for FMC retrieval. According to the results, PLS shows great potential to extract FMC from spectral data; when coupled with different band selection approaches, the models also generate high estimation precision; with band selection, the PLS coupled models involved fewer bands, lowering the model complexity. Thus, the high estimation precision and much simpler modeling make band selection-PLS coupled methods superior to original PLS for FMC retrieval.","2153-6996;21536996","Electronic:978-1-4244-9566-5; POD:978-1-4244-9565-8; USB:978-1-4244-9564-1","10.1109/IGARSS.2010.5652617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5652617","PLS;Retrieval;hyperspectral","Calibration;Correlation;Estimation;Fuels;Moisture;Reflectivity;Vegetation mapping","fires;forestry;information retrieval;least squares approximations;moisture measurement;vegetation;vegetation mapping","FMC estimation;FMC retrieval;Fuel Moisture Content;LOPEX dataset;band selection;collinearity;feature selection methods;fuel moisture content;hyperspectral data;multivariate statistical method;partial least square;vegetation moisture status;wild fire vulnerability","","0","","9","","","25-30 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We convert time-point data to discrete symbols on the base of the fact that the logarithm of the data approximately obeys normal distribution, and build hidden Markov models with these symbols for gene sequences. In a gene expression time series, the time point data is correlated with others. The use of HMMs can help to take advantage of this special correlation. We tested the method with two common datasets.

Traditional text-based search methods are not always effective for 3D data. In this paper, we proposed a 3D model retrieval system combining the text-based search method and the shape-based search method. By means of the Google 3D Warehouse, we start the initial search with inputting some keywords (such as the model's name). Next, according to the text-based search result, we obtain and download the retrieved models as a database. Then, we convert the SKP models and extract the shape features for the further shape-based retrieval. Finally, we select a model from the text-based retrieved results as a query request and get more reasonable results by shape retrieval.

Rapid growth of web sites and web applications gives way to deliver complex business applications through the web. As the web dependency increases, so do the web hacking activities. Web applications are normally written in scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP embedded in HTML allowing connectivity to the databases, retrieving data and putting them in the WWW site. A web application is vulnerable to many kinds of threats and attacks. In order to detect known attacks, some set of attack rules and detections are needed. In this paper, a negative security model based on misuse of web applications is used. This negative security model provides a Web Application Firewall(WAF) engine with a rule set, to ensure critical protection across every web architecture. WAFs are deployed to establish an increased external security layer to detect and/or prevent attacks before they reach web applications. This paper has been tested with apache web server's log file. We have tested successfully almost all the common attacks.

Health records from health facilities, namely the patient disease cases, syndrome, and demographic information, are transmitted through the mHealthSurvey mobile phone application and fed in to the T-Cube data structure. T-Cube Web Interface (TCWI) is a browser-based software tool that uses the T-Cube data structure for fast retrieval and display of large volume multivariate time series and spatial information. Interface allows the user to execute complex queries quickly and to run various types of statistical tests on the loaded data.

A new approach of OFESP (Opinion Feature Extraction based on Sentiment Patterns) is proposed in this paper, which takes into account the structure characteristics of reviews for higher values of precision and recall. With a self-constructed database of sentiment patterns, OFESP matches each review sentence to obtain its features, and then filters redundant features regarding relevance of the domain, statistics and semantic similarity. Experimental studies on real-world data demonstrate that as compared with the traditional method based on a window mechanism, OFESP outperforms it on precision, recall and F-score.

At the same time, the number of consumers is seeking ways to infer the customer's interests and to adapt their web sites to make the content of interest more easily accessible. Pattern mining is a promising approach in support of this goal. Assuming that past navigation behavior is an indicator of the user's interests, then, the records of this behavior, kept in the form of the webserver logs, can be mined to infer what the users are interested in. On that basis, recommendations can be dynamically generated, to help new web-site visitors find the information of interest faster. In this work, a new pattern mining algorithm, for efficiently extracting approximate behavior patterns so that slight navigation variations can be ignored when extracting frequently occurring patterns, is introduced. This algorithm is particularly useful with websites that have a large number of web-pages. Our particular approach is tailored to ""focus"" web sites that offer information on a well defined subject, such as, for example, the web site of an undergraduate course. Visitors of such focused sites exhibit similar types of navigation behavior, corresponding to the services offered by the web sites; therefore, page recommendation based on usage pattern mining can be quite effective.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9032-5; Electronic:978-1-4244-9034-9; POD:978-1-4244-9033-2","10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640494","Preprocessing;Sequential patterns mining;Web mining;dynamic page recommendation;frequent access pattern","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Databases;Navigation;Web server;Web sites","Web sites;data mining;information retrieval;recommender systems","Internet;Web pages;Web site effectiveness;electronic commerce tool;information seeking;page recommendation;single level algorithm;usage pattern mining;user navigational pattern extraction","","2","","12","","","17-19 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The kernel of the approach followed by LAD consists in a breadth-first enumeration of all the prime implicants whose degree is not greater than a fixed maximum d. In contrast, SC adopts an effective heuristic procedure for retrieving the most promising logical products to be included in the resulting and-or expression. Since the computational cost required by LAD prevents its application even for relatively small dimensions of the input domain, LSC employs a depth-first approach, with asymptotically linear memory occupation, to analyze the prime implicants having degree not greater than d. In addition, the theoretical analysis proves that LSC presents almost the same asymptotic time complexity as LAD. Extensive simulations on artificial benchmarks validate the good behavior of the computational cost exhibited by LSC, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, the pdpBf retrieved by LSC always shows a better performance, in terms of complexity and accuracy, with respect to those obtained by LAD.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342421","Logical Analysis of Data;Positive Boolean function;Shadow Clustering.;logic synthesis","Algorithm design and analysis;Analytical models;Boolean functions;Circuit synthesis;Clustering algorithms;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Data analysis;Kernel;Network synthesis","Boolean functions;data analysis;information retrieval;logic gates;pattern clustering;tree searching","AND-OR expression;LSC;asymptotically linear memory occupation;depth-first approach;information retrieval;logical analysis of data;partially defined positive Boolean function reconstruction;pdpBf;shadow clustering","","4","","25","","20091201","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper represents a two-phase approach based on semi-CRFs and novel feature sets. Semi-CRFs put the label to a segment not a single word which is more natural than the other machine learning methods. Our approach divides the whole biomedical NER into two sub-tasks: term boundary detection and semantic labeling. At the first phase, term boundary detection sub-task detects the boundary of the entities and classifies the entities into one type C.

"A subtopic-enriched MMR approach to sentence ranking for Chinese multi-document summarization","Po Hu; Tingting He; Hai Wang","Department of Computer Science, Huazhong Normal University, Wuhan, China","2010 Third International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","20101129","2010","","","95","98","In this paper, we present SEMMR, a novel subtopic-enriched sentence ranking method for Chinese multi-document summarization derived from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR). MMR is one of the most popular ranking algorithms for balancing the topical relevance and content redundancy in a unified framework, which has been well employed in the context of text retrieval and document summarization. For multi-document summarization task, existing MMR-based approaches usually directly incorporate the topical relevance between each sentence and the main topic into the sentence ranking process while ignoring the latent subtopic information of finer granularity. Actually, a document set on a main topic usually consists of a few implicit subtopics, and different subtopic may have unequal impact on the sentence ranking. Specifically, the sentences having higher proximity with the subtopics close to the main topic are deemed more relevant than the sentences related with the subtopics far away from the main topic. To address this issue and take into account the subtopic's impact on sentence ranking performance, this paper extends the traditional MMR algorithm by integrating the sub-topical relevance as well as the sentence-to-subtopic proximity into the unified ranking process. Preliminary experimental results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8007-4; POD:978-1-4244-8004-3","10.1109/KAM.2010.5646317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5646317","Multi-document summarization;Sentence ranking;Subtopic discovery;Subtopic-enriched Maximal Marginal Relevance","Educational institutions;Finance;Google","information retrieval;text analysis","Chinese multidocument summarization;content redundancy;maximal marginal relevance;ranking algorithm;sentence ranking;sentence-to-subtopic proximity;subtopic-enriched MMR approach;text retrieval;topical relevance;unified ranking process","","0","","9","","","20-21 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as traditional retrieval algorithms lack the use of semantics to retrieve relevant documents, voluminous information is retrieved most of which may be irrelevant to the posted query. Due to which the learning process of a learner is slowed down. Hence, a need is felt to develop a retrieval and ranking method that produces semantically relevant web resources with information need. For this reason, the paper proposes semantically relevant retrieval and ranking of web resources that uses top N resource links returned from a search engine as seed, domain ontologies to compute semantic relevance, and data from Social Bookmarking System (SBS) to retrieve additional semantically relevant resources. Finally all retrieved resources are ranked according to the query relevancy using Vector Space Model (VSM). The proposed approach presented in this paper is elucidated in three parts: (i) a method that expands a posted query using semantic relevance by using ontologies, (ii) an algorithm to retrieve semantically relevant web resources by simulating human cognition using SBS, and (iii) a new approach to compute social semantic ranking of retrieved web resources. Thus it utilizes collective advantages of Social Bookmark Tagging System and Semantic technologies. Improvement in results obtained by the proposed approach in contrast to the existing results retrieved by search engine is apparent from empirical evaluation.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4201-0; POD:978-1-4244-8093-7","10.1109/ARTCom.2010.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5656799","Ontology;Semantic relevance;human cognition and social semantic ranking;social bookmarking","Classification algorithms;Cognition;Humans;Ontologies;Scattering;Search engines;Semantics","information needs;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines;semantic Web","World Wide Web;domain ontologies;eResources ranking;human cognition simulation;information need;learning resources;search engine;semantic relevance;semantic technologies;social bookmarking tagging system;social semantic retrieval;top N resource links;vector space model","","3","","30","","","16-17 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It involves information retrieval from the mobile robots, the information being their location in a global map. According to location information of each mobile robot, administrator implements low level control over mobile robots in their navigation plan and obstacle avoidance with the help of communication through mobile agents. This can also be done using basic client server architecture, but due to the inherent low bandwidth nature of the network, such architectures suffer from extreme lagging and network congestion as the number of networks' nodes increases, thus making it unsuitable for dynamic exchange of information.

However existing classifiers apply a well designed measure to find nearest neighbors. They still can not be comparable with human being in many complex cases such as on noisy, sparse or high dimensional data. This paper proposes a quite different but much interesting approach that utilizes Lipschitz function to define a simple topological transformation for modeling Gestalt laws of psychology from data and then designs a new measure to evaluate the quality of the discovered Gestalts. Subsequently, the nearest neighbors are selected from higher quality Gestalts, from which a new classifier is proposed that has much better classification performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6440-1; POD:978-1-4244-6437-1","10.1109/BICTA.2010.5645347","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5645347","Classification;Gestalt laws;nearest neighbors;topological transformation","Glass;Image segmentation;Iris recognition","artificial intelligence;data mining;information retrieval;pattern classification","Gestalt laws;Lipschitz function;artificial intelligence;classification;data mining;information retrieval;manifold learning;perceptual nearest neighbors","","0","","23","","","23-26 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a modified multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) approach for tag positioning is presented. Applying standard MDS results in unsatisfying and unusable representations due to two problems. The first problem stems from word overlap which is orthogonal to the second problem: excessive empty space. Both of these shortcomings are addressed by introducing methods for overlap removal and empty space reduction.

Visualization and analysis processes allow the user to explore the available data through the use of overlays, time series, and plots; and with user-specified aggregation, averaging, and sampling intervals.

Based on the restriction, we proposed a scheme that incorporates the electrical network frequency (ENF) as a tool for detecting damaged audio segments.

To deal with this recent trend, we have proposed a Web-page layout optimization method for multimodal browsing sizes. It dynamically changes box locations and font sizes by switching CSS files for different browsing sizes, so that the main content can be accessed without the screen scroll operation even at a small size whereas the blank space is avoided at a large size. However, in this method, any box location must be specified by the absolute value in HTML/CSS files, which is not easy under a variety of browsing sizes. In this paper, we propose the extension of this method for flexible Web-page designs using the normal flow, the liquid layout, and the float property, where the browser automatically arranges the boxes. Using Ajax, the box location and the font size is switched to fit to the current browsing size by our method.

However, under such circumstances the fixed global parameter k is not robust for all queries with diverse semantics. In this paper, we propose an alternative method based on the sparse representation. The query sample is considered as a sparse linear combination of all training samples, and the number of nearest neighbors is determined automatically according to the sparse coefficients to the query.

We consider three 2005 WindSat hurricane overpasses for proper atmospheric conditions (Dennis, Katrina and Rita). The improved atmospheric clearing algorithm extracts ocean surface emissivity in and near the hurricane rain bands and eyewall.

Architecture is proposed for enhanced resources search, combining the strengths of the social (social annotations) and semantic (semantic metadata) technologies, which has been designed considering the search style of the information seekers. Such architecture is applied in a use-scenario, where the expert users who are not technicians have some restrictions and limitations to retrieve the documents they need.

The proposed bag of group NVPs allows fusion of individual cues and facilitates the eventual comparison of groups of varying sizes. The use of topic models helps to cluster group interactions and to quantify how different they are from each other in a formal probabilistic sense.

Ubiquitous Computing emphasizes the integration of computing and the environment, while the computer itself disappears from people's attention.

The location-aware information is provided to users whenever they want. All the information sent to users has been filtered according to users' current locations and locations of the information. User can customize the categories of information to make sure he can get any preferred information but not only the navigation related ones, which makes users' travel more convenient and pleasant.

First, edge detection technique is used to detect all edges in the image, to preserve the most important structural features of that image by finding sharp contrasts, after that, we select all closed contours from detected edges. By the next we use texture information to discriminate text from non-text regions. Finally, we verify regions in order to reduce false alarms and to generate valid text regions. The evaluation is done on the challenging ICDAR 2003 robust reading and text locating database. The results show that our system can localize text of various font sizes and styles in complex background.

And Random Walk is a promising approach for semi-supervised learning problems of learning from labeled and unlabeled data. Given a set of points, some of them are labeled, and the remaining points are unlabeled, the goal is to predict the labels of the unlabeled points. Since labeling often requires expensive human labor, whereas unlabelled data is easier to obtain, semi-supervised learning is very useful in many real-world problems, such as text classification. Here we proposed an approach for Chinese question Classification using Multilevel Random Walk (MRK), which is an improvement of random walk.
