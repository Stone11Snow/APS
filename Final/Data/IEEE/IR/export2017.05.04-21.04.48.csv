MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) is a Java program that makes MetaMap available to biomedical researchers in controlled, configurable environment. Currently there is no Spanish version of MetaMap, which difficult the use of UMLS Metathesaurus to extract concepts from Spanish biomedical texts. Developing a Spanish version of MetaMap would be a huge task, since there has been a lot of work supporting the English version for the last sixteen years. Our ongoing research is mainly focused on using biomedical concepts for crosslingual text classification. In this context the use of concepts instead of bag of words representation allows us to face text classification tasks abstracting from the language. In this paper we show our experiments on combining automatic translation techniques with the use of biomedical ontologies to produce an English text that can be processed by MMTx in order to extract concepts for text classification.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2917-2; POD:978-1-4244-2916-5","10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4746715","","Indexing;Information retrieval;Medical tests;Natural languages;Ontologies;Terminology;Text categorization;Unified modeling language;Visual databases;Web services","Java;medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","English text;Java program;MetaMap Transfer;Spanish biomedical texts;UMLS Metathesaurus concepts;automatic translation techniques;biomedical ontologies;concept indexing;crosslingual medical text classification;online application;text mapping;word representation","","1","","21","","","13-16 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, it is flexible enough to index different video classification units and can maintain the hierarchical relationship between them. In addition, it uses a construct called hierarchical Markov model mediator to introduce high-level semantic relationships among images and different levels of video units.

In this paper, an automatic online news topic keyphrase extraction system is proposed. News stories are organized into topics. Keyword candidates are firstly extracted from single news stories and filtered with topic information. Then a phrase identification process combines keywords into phrases using position information. Finally, the phrases are ranked and top ones are selected as topic keyphrases.

Fitting of the circadian distribution of CAD population gives R<sup>2</sup> = 0.854 with harmonic and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.767 with polynomial model. Similarly with DCM patients, fitting with polynomial model led to R<sup>2</sup> = 0.997 while harmonic regression led to R<sup>2</sup> = 0.983. Different modes of VT onset show strongly different circadian patterns even when patients have the same etiology.

However, one of the main problems with the secure transmission of digital data over wireless networks is that the errors that occur during transmission typically need to be resolved before decryption can begin. Because of the limited resources such as power and size of these wireless devices, hardware-efficient implementations of these operations are essential. This paper presents a joint hardware-efficient design for both encryption and channel coding that is optimized for low-resource requirements. We implemented the Rijndael advance encryption standard (AES) algorithm and convolutional encoder for the encryption and encoder sub-unit, respectively. In order to decode the received digital data, we use the Viterbi decoder, which has been known to be suited for convolutional codes. Our design has a 70% reduction in the number of hardware resources for the encoding sub-unit through the block of XORs. The low-resource usage is achieved through an integrated architecture of the encoding units. Most of the hardware reduction was achieved in the AddRoundKey and the encoder sub-unit. Our system was implemented on a Xilinx Spartan 3 xc3s200FT256 using ISE foundation 8.1, and 13% of the slices were used for the Viterbi decoder with 674 bels.

In the retrieval, the database user interacts with the machine and provides ""feedbacks"" to the retrieval result. The learning component learns from the spatiotemporal data, the semantic event model as well as the ""feedback"" and returns the refined result to the user. Specifically, the learning algorithm is developed based on a Coupled Hidden Markov Model (CHMM), which models the interactions of objects in CAIs and recognizes hidden patterns among them.

In HES-SPATO, history SCOs (sharable content objects) were formed by integrating SPATOs (Spatial, Person, Action/Attribute, and Temporal Object) with the associated ""space,"" ""person,"" and ""action/attribute"" assets. SCOs, then, formed other SCORM components such as lessons and courses accordingly. The authoring module of HES-SPATO can enhance the history courseware designer and instructor's ability for creating online materials in a few guided steps. By applying the GIS concept of information layers and temporal logic, the learning module of HES-SPATO allowed students to visualize history events more clearly in sequence with different features according to their own needs. It can also present specific information directly related to the history event only, as defined in SPATO, to reduce cognitive load.

The degree of similarity between two spatial relations is mapped to the distance between the associated nodes in an Interval Neighbor Group. The shorter the distance, the higher degree of similarity, while a longer one, a lower degree of similarity. Once all the pairwise similarity values are derived, an ensemble similarity will integrate these pairwise similarity assessments and give an overall similarity value between two images. Therefore, images in a database can be quantitatively ranked according to the degree of ensemble similarity with the query image. Two search strategies are discussed, namely, global and subimage similarity retrieval. A global strategy evaluates the ensemble similarity based on all pairwise spatial relations present in both images. On the other hand, only the spatial relations present in the maximum common subimage between the query and a database image are considered in the subimage strategy.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3454-1","10.1109/ISM.2008.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4741182","content-based image retrieval;interval neighbor group;maximum bounding box;retrieval by spatial similarity","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases;Topology","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;query formulation;visual databases","content-based image retrieval;database image;interval neighbor group;query image;search strategies;spatial similarity ranking framework;subimage strategy;symbolic images;symbolic pictures retrieval","","1","","16","","","15-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we build a semantic overlay over an existing peer-to-peer network. The self-organization of the overlay is obtained by using the social-network paradigm. The connections between peers are formed on the basis of a query-answer principle. The knowledge about answers to previous queries is exploited to route queries efficiently.

An extension of the algorithm to deal with an unknown number of clusters is also presented. The extension is based on competitive agglomeration, whereby the number of clusters is over-specified, and adjacent clusters are allowed to compete for data points in a manner that causes clusters which lose in the competition to gradually become depleted and vanish.

Formal ontologies and taxonomies enrich such hierarchies further with properties and relationships but require manual effort; therefore they are costly to maintain, and often stale. Folksonomies and vocabularies lack rich category structure. Classification and extraction require the coverage of vocabularies and the alterability of folksonomies and can largely benefit from category relationships and other properties. With Doozer, a program for building conceptual models of information domains, we want to bridge the gap between the vocabularies and Folksonomies on the one side and the rich, expert-designed ontologies and taxonomies on the other. Doozer mines Wikipedia to produce tight domain hierarchies, starting with simple domain descriptions. It also adds relevancy scores for use in automated classification of information. The output model is described as a hierarchy of domain terms that can be used immediately for classifiers and IR systems or as a basis for manual or semi-automatic creation of formal ontologies.","","POD:978-0-7695-3496-1","10.1109/WIIAT.2008.358","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4740498","Domain Model creation;Expand and Reduce;Taxonomy extraction;Wikipedia","Bridges;Buildings;Data mining;Encyclopedias;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Ontologies;Taxonomy;Vocabulary;Wikipedia","data mining;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;search engines","Doozer;Wikipedia;category relationships;domain model extraction;expert-designed ontologies;folksonomies;formal ontologies;information classification;information retrieval tasks;taxonomies;vocabularies","","3","","23","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we propose linear regression analysis to identify effective features. In this way, we can effectively deal with the noise issue. The experiments demonstrate that the features identified with linear regression analysis are very effective.

In the second, the distribution of the multivariate wavelet coefficients is modeled by a multivariate model driven by the copulas theory. The parameters of this multivariate distribution are chosen as relevant signatures of the image. The contribution of this paper is to investigate the influence of the copula density on the retrieval performances. To this respect, we have tested the Gaussian copula density and two Archimedean copula densities (the Clayton and the Gumbel copulas). Experimental results indicate that the Archimedea n copulas outperfom the Gaussian one in terms of precision and recall of retrieval.","2154-5111;21545111","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3322-3; POD:978-1-4244-3321-6","10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743753","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4743753","Archimedean copulas;Copula theory;Feature extraction;Gaussian copula;Image retrieval;Multi-channel images;Sklar's theorem;Wavelet transform","Context modeling;Image coding;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Spatial databases;Wavelet coefficients;Wavelet transforms","data compression;database indexing;feature extraction;image coding;image resolution;image retrieval;statistical distributions;wavelet transforms","compressed wavelet-based domain;copula theory;feature extraction;image representation;image resolution;image signature;multichannel image retrieval;multivariate distribution;multivariate indexing;wavelet transform","","1","","18","","","23-26 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A lookup overlay formed by participating peers provides a foundation for pseudo-DHT's register (key, value) and retrieve (key) services. Using pseudo-DHT, peers register their video contents information (key) with their network identity (value). To reduce retrieval latency, register (ldr) performs the alteration of a given key on a key collision. For retrieve (ldr), a query for a key returns a value associated with the key or a key closest to the key. We apply pseudo-DHT to P2TSS, a P2P system that provides both live and time-shifted streams. In P2TSS, a live video is divided and spread out in peers' buffers. Peers construct a chord overlay that serves as the base of pseudo-DHT. A theoretical analysis is presented to predict the search performance of P2TSS with pseudo-DHT. Extensive simulations show that our pseudo-DHT provides good scalability and low overhead, matching our analysis.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3454-1","10.1109/ISM.2008.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4741191","DHT;Peer-to-peer;distributed search;live video stream;time-shifted stream","Analytical models;Delay;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Multimedia systems;Peer to peer computing;Performance analysis;Scalability;Streaming media;USA Councils","peer-to-peer computing;query processing;video retrieval;video streaming","P2P video streaming;distributed search algorithm;lookup overlay;peer-to-peer;pseudo-DHT;resource location algorithm;video contents information","","3","1","13","","","15-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from the existing work, our aim is to generate a group of concatenated feature sets based on regression modeling and arrange them by indexing-based approximate techniques to avoid complicated audio sequence comparisons. We mainly focus on using exact locality sensitive mapping (ELSM) to join the concatenated feature sets and soft hash values. Similarity-invariance among audio sequence comparison is applied to define an optimal combination of several audio features. Soft hash values are pre-calculated to help locate searching range more accurately.

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm of event recognition scheme from video. In this structure, most video events are represented by a hierarchical structure, efficient events representation and analysis of events are possible by using this property. We introduce a scalable and hierarchical event recognition method. First, events are classified into four hierarchical categories. Higher level events are organized by lower level events and relationships among them. We represent those relationships using temporal-logical constraints, that is, the event grammar, and a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) combines the given event grammar with the probabilistic inference procedure to recognize an event. For scalability of the recognition system, all events in the hierarchy use the same framework of DBN. To recognize events efficiently in such a condition, we define the activation rate which is calculated by each event and propagated in bottom-up direction at each time step. We apply the proposed method to the experiments with a video segment simulating ticket office transactions.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3454-1","10.1109/ISM.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4741231","","Bayesian methods;Cameras;Computer science;Computer vision;Information retrieval;Message passing;Scalability;Stochastic processes;User-generated content;Video surveillance","Bayes methods;image recognition;image representation;temporal logic;video surveillance","dynamic Bayesian network;event grammar;hierarchical event recognition;hierarchical event representation;intelligent video surveillance;probabilistic inference;scalable video event analysis;temporal-logical constraint","","0","","7","","","15-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the one hand diversity constitutes a resource by enlarging the knowledge-pool of the team and therefore potentially contributes to team and organisational performance. On the other hand diversity can act as a barrier and hinder access to the knowledge. The paper refers to limitations of empirical research designs and discusses different simulation approaches as alternative research methods. Following the first steps of a roadmap for using simulation given by Davis et al. (2007) a framework, comprising relevant moderator and mediator variables of the team diversity - information processing relationship, is identified. Finally agent based simulation is acknowledged as method to clarify the team diversity - team performance relationship in future research and further steps of the roadmap are outlined.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:978-0-7695-3450-3","10.1109/HICSS.2009.164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755661","","Computational modeling;Conference management;Cultural differences;Information management;Information processing;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Psychology;Resource management;Technological innovation","business data processing;cognitive systems;software agents","agent based simulation;agent-based modeling;cognitive diversity;information processing;knowledge resource;team diversity;top management teams","","0","","48","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the same features that have made the Web so useful and popular also impose important restrictions on the way the data it contains can be manipulated. Particularly, in the traditional Web scenario, there is an inherent difficulty in gaining access to data that is implicitly present in Web pages but is not readily available. The term Web Data Management (WDM) has been used to refer to the study of problems related to fetching, extracting, querying, modeling, storing, transforming, and integrating data available on the Web. These issues have been growing in importance in the scientific community in the last years, as it can be be seen by the considerable space devoted to them in important publication venues. This interest is justified not only by the scientific and technical challenges involved in WDM problems, but also, and specially, by the growing demand from the industry for solving such problems. In this paper, we present a brief report on the WDM cooperative research carried out by the Database Laboratory at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (LBD/UFMG) and the Information Technology Group at the Federal University of Amazonas (GTI/UFAM). The main aim of this research effort is to develop methods and tools for dealing with data available on the Web and in other non-structured sources (e.g., XML documents), thus providing facilities similar to those available in traditional database systems for managing such data.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3397-1","10.1109/LA-WEB.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756173","Data and Topic-Oriented Crawling;Keyword-based queries;Web Data Extraction;Web Data Integration;Web Data Management","Application software;Conference management;Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Online services;Wavelength division multiplexing;Web pages;Web sites;XML","Internet;XML;database management systems;query processing;storage management","Federal Amazonas University;Federal Minas Gerais University;Web data management;Web page;XML document;cooperative research;data extraction;data fetching;data querying;data storage;database system;nonstructured source","","0","","37","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most important steps in CBIR systems is feature extraction. However, using not appropriate features in heterogeneous image database during retrieval process does not provide a complete description of an image. Indeed, each feature is able to describe some characteristics related to the shape, the color or the texture of the objects in image, but it can not cover the entire visual characteristics of the image. Therefore, many researchers have explored the use of multiple features to describe an image. In this paper, we propose the extraction and the relevance evaluation of several features for an heterogeneous image database classification and recognition, then we study the image retrieval system effectiveness with a new hierarchical feature model. The obtained results prove that using the new hierarchical feature model is more efficient than the use of the classical aggregated features in an image retrieval system.","2154-5111;21545111","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3322-3; POD:978-1-4244-3321-6","10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4743738","CBIR;Feature extraction;Feature relevance evaluation;Heterogeneous image database;Hierarchical feature model;SVM-multiclass","Application software;Biology computing;Data engineering;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image processing;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Systems engineering and theory","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;relevance feedback;visual databases","CBIR systems;color characteristics;content-based image retrieval;feature extraction;heterogeneous image database classification;heterogeneous image database recognition;hierarchical feature model;image retrieval process;image retrieval system;relevance evaluation;shape characteristics;texture characteristics","","1","","26","","","23-26 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is why, recent works have focused themselves in the construction of query classifiers following the categories proposed in the scientific literature. These works have based on query representations using two sources of main information: text and click-through data. Despite of the before mentioned we have little understanding about the nature and behaviour of the variables used to characterize queries. In this work we analyse the behaviour of the variables looking for a way to improve their comprehension and to identify the characteristics that exactly allow that the query classifiers improve their precision. The analysis shows that the variables based on text have a better performance in the discrimination of the categories than the ones based on click-through data. Among these variables, the query length (number of terms that compound a query), the Levenshtein distance between snippets and queries, and the PageRank metric are recommendable features to work with query type classifiers.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3397-1","10.1109/LA-WEB.2008.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756163","Web usage mining;query taxonomies","Computer science;Information resources;Information retrieval;Mutual information;Navigation;Performance analysis;Scattering;Search engines;Taxonomy;Web search","Internet;query formulation;search engines","Levenshtein distance;PageRank metric;Web search analysis;Web search engines;query classifiers","","2","","11","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an attempt to bridge this semantic gap, recent approaches started integrating both low level-visual features and high-level textual keywords. Unfortunately, manual image annotation is a tedious process and may not be possible for large image databases. To overcome this limitation, several approaches that can annotate images in a semi-supervised or unsupervised way have emerged. In this paper, we outline and compare four different algorithms. The first one is simple and assumes that image annotation can be viewed as the task of translating from a vocabulary of fixed image regions to a vocabulary of words. The second approach uses a set of annotated images as a training set and learns the joint distribution of regions and words. The third and fourth approaches are based on segmenting the images into homogeneous regions. Both of these approaches rely on a clustering algorithm to learn the association between visual features and keywords. The clustering task is not trivial as it involves clustering a very high-dimensional and sparse feature spaces. To address this, the third approach uses semi-supervised constrained clustering while the fourth approach relies on an algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and feature discrimination. These four algorithms were implemented and tested on a data set that includes 6000 images using four-fold cross validation.","2154-5111;21545111","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3322-3; POD:978-1-4244-3321-6","10.1109/IPTA.2008.4743754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4743754","clustering;constrained clustering;content-based image retrieval;image annotation","Bridges;Clustering algorithms;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Labeling;Vocabulary","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);visual databases","automatic image annotation systems;clustering algorithm;content-based image retrieval;feature discrimination;high-level textual keywords;image segmentation;low level-visual features;semisupervised constrained clustering","","0","","38","","","23-26 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We believe that what defines a situation and what applications are preferred in the situation not only vary from user to user but also change over time, and therefore these assumptions and requirements are impractical for ordinary consumers.

Often, what is required is that images taken in the same place, of the same thing, or of the same person be conceptually grouped together. This work focuses on grouping images containing the same object, despite significant changes in scale, viewpoint and partial occlusions, in very large (1M+) image collections automatically gathered from Flicker. The scale of the data and the extreme variation in imaging conditions makes the problem very challenging. We describe a scalable method that first computes a matching graph over all the images. Image groups can then be mined from this graph using standard clustering techniques. The novelty we bring is that both the matching graph and the clustering methods are able to use the spatial consistency between the images arising from the common object (if there is one). We demonstrate our methods on a publicly available dataset of 5 K images of Oxford, a 37 K image dataset containing images of the Statue of Liberty, and a much larger 1M image dataset of Rome.

They are very effective in breaking many cryptographic algorithms, especially those running in low-end processors in embedded systems, sensor nodes, and smart cards. Although many countermeasures to power analysis attacks have been proposed, most of them are software based and designed for a specific algorithm. Many of them are also found vulnerable to more advanced attacks. Looking for a low-cost, algorithm-independent solution that can be implemented in many processors and makes all cryptographic algorithms secure against power analysis attacks, we start with register file, where the operands and results of most instructions are stored. In this paper, we propose RFRF, a register file that stores data with a redundant flipped copy. With the redundant copy and a new precharge phase in write operations, RFRF provides data-independent power consumption on read and write for cryptographic algorithms. Although RFRF has large energy overhead, it is only enabled in the security mode. We validate our method with simulations. The results show that the power consumption of RFRF is independent of the values read out from or written to registers. Thus RFRF can help mitigate power analysis attacks.","1063-6404;10636404","POD:978-1-4244-2657-7","10.1109/ICCD.2008.4751919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4751919","","Algorithm design and analysis;Cryptography;Embedded system;Energy consumption;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Registers;Sensor systems;Smart cards","cryptography;file organisation","cryptographic algorithms;embedded systems;low-end processors;power analysis attacks;power consumption;redundant flipped copy;register file;secret information;sensor nodes;side-channel attacks;smart cards","","0","","19","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most important functions in P2P system is locating resources. Dynamic joins and leaves of the node and heterogeneous network structure in P2P system make it a difficult problem to discover shared resource. In this paper, we propose a intelligent resource discovery mechanism based on the mobile agent technology. Agents maintain local resource information and mobile agents migrate on network to discover shared resource. The mobile agents adaptively learn paths within the P2P networks to enable rapid location of resources. Preliminary results of our algorithm demonstrate that resource can be quickly acquired and network traffic can be reduced greatly, scalability and robustness can also be improved based on the mobile agent technology.","","POD:978-0-7695-3490-9","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.364","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756877","Agent;P2P Networks;Resource Discovery","Competitive intelligence;Computational intelligence;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Mobile agents;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic","mobile agents;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation","P2P network;agent-based intelligent resource discovery scheme;decentralized distributed network node;heterogeneous network structure;mobile agent;peer-to-peer system;resource sharing","","2","","15","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a database management system in P2P networks. It uses a structured P2P network to manage copies of data cache, and an unstructured P2P network to manage peers who are responsible for the data cache. It has the benefit of the Client/Server model and peer-to-peer model at the same time. PeerCSDB distinguishes itself from existing P2P database systems in several ways. First, by saving the data cache in the clients, the system will lighten the load on the database server and alleviate the bottleneck. Second, the clients form a peer-to-peer network to manage the data cache. The user could get query results from data cache, so it significantly reduces the response time to queries. We implemented and evaluated PeerCSDB. Experimental results show that PeerCSDB can effectively exploit P2P technologies for database management system.","","POD:978-0-7695-3480-0","10.1109/FITME.2008.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4746549","Arithmetic;Database;P2P","Computer network management;Database systems;Delay;Information management;Information retrieval;Information technology;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Relational databases;Seminars","client-server systems;distributed databases;peer-to-peer computing;storage management","P2P database system;P2P technology;PeerCSDB;client/server model;data cache management;database management system;database server;peer-to-peer model;peer-to-peer network;structured P2P network","","0","","8","","","20-20 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By performing clustering before image retrieval, the search space can be reduced to those clusters that are close to the query target. First, the image is segmented to regions by using an unsupervised segmentation method. This is an area where a vast number of regions are involved. To reduce search space for region-based image retrieval, we use clustering based on genetic algorithm. Fuzzy similarity is used in order to compute the similarity of two images. Moreover, a two-class SVM is trained based on user interests to improve image retrieval.

However, hypertext documents such as Web pages are interconnected with links. How to take advantage of such links as extra evidences to enhance automatic classification of hypertext documents is a non-trivial problem. We think a collection of interconnected hypertext documents can be considered as a complex network, and the underlying community structure of such a document network contains valuable clues about the right classification of documents. This paper introduces a new technique, modularity Eigenmap, that can effectively extract community structure features from the document network which is induced from document link information only or constructed by combining both document content and document link information. A number of experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach leads to excellent classification performance in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2917-2; POD:978-1-4244-2916-5","10.1109/ICDIM.2008.4746816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4746816","","Complex networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Semisupervised learning;Text categorization;Web pages;Web search","document handling;hypermedia;pattern classification;text analysis","Web pages;community structure feature extraction;complex network;document link information;hypertext classification;hypertext documents;modularity Eigenmap","","0","","12","","","13-16 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an unsupervised framework for content-based Web newspaper articles and broadcast news stories aggregation and retrieval.

In the present era of information technology, the search engines providing the service of information-on-demand cater a majority of information needs for a large section of population across the globe. Yet, even a larger section of the population belonging to rural as well as urban locations of the world are not benefited from the service due to lack of literacy and infrastructure. Better understanding of the information needs of people and devising alternate channels of information dissemination based on search engines can eventually lead to a socio-economic revolution among the rural as well as urban population of the world. In this paper, we try to study and understand various information types, frequency of search and available channels of information and their level of reliance among the rural population. The study further attempts to understand whether demand exists for 'information on demand' or search engine service itself would unlock a new untapped demand.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:978-0-7695-3450-3","10.1109/HICSS.2009.406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755650","","Conference management;Context-aware services;Frequency;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Mouth;Search engines;Web sites","information technology;search engines","Indian context;information technology;information-on-demand cater;rural consumers;search engine service","","0","","17","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
