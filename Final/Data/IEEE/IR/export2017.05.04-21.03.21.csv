First, PACS users are limited to certain bandwidths and locations. Second, Web PACS machine replacement is too costly, management is difficult, and better image stability is needed. There are also speed variations for different users at different locations. For instance, radiologists use medical image workstations with direct access to the PACS information system and so have a greater speed for querying and file retrieval. Physicians, on the other hand, use web browsers with no direct access to the PACS information system, which leads to slower network speeds. Physicians also affect one another in overall network speed by processing queries and file retrievals via Web browser. There are also insufficient network bandwidth concerns. These often arise when exchanging medical images with other hospitals or downloading large numbers of images. Since these large file volumes are transferred via WANs, insufficient network bandwidths limit upload and download speeds. And if the Web PACS breaks down, the hospital must ask professional engineers for replacements, and spend large amounts of money about a NT$ million or more per unit. This is not only troublesome for system managers, but also costly for the hospital.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780768","Co-allocation;Data Grids;File Accessing System;Medical Image","Bandwidth;Biomedical imaging;Hospitals;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information systems;Management information systems;Picture archiving and communication systems;Stability;Workstations","Internet;PACS;biomedical imaging;file servers;image retrieval;wide area networks","MIFAS;PACS information system;WAN;Web PACS machine replacement;Web browser;co-allocation data grids;file retrieval;image stability;medical image file accessing system","","1","","15","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, by changing the process of relevance feedback into a learning problem of neural network, a relevance feedback technique for content-based images retrieval by neural network learning (NELIR) is introduced, which can improve user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully exploiting similarity information. NELIR can describe the distribution of positive feedback sample images in feature space with a set of neighboring clusters produced through constructing neural network, for accurately reflecting their semantic relevance. In particular, constructing neural network is dynamic. The neural network depends on which images are retrieved in response to the query. On the other hand, NELIR is independent of the specific feature extraction and similarity measure. Thus, it may be embedded in many current CBIR systems to improve the performance of image retrieval. The performance of a prototype system using NELIR is evaluated on a database of 2,000 images.

Customers search the knowledge base of reviews by querying on specific needs or interests.

In this paper, a general fourth order cumulant matrix which conforms with the structure of MUSIC algorithm is introduced. Because the fourth order cumulant is insensitive to Gaussian noise, the MUSIC-type method can be reformulated using the fourth-order cumulant matrices instead of autocorrelation matrices when additive noise is colored Gaussian. By doing so, the additive colored Gaussian noise can be suppressed. So fourth order cumulant-based MUSIC algorithm provides better resolution and estimation performance when noise is color. Firstly,the theory of MUSIC algorithm is studied; additionally, the relation between fourth order cumulant and autocorrelation function is analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the cumulant-based MUSIC algorithm, and it can restrain effectively the effect of coloured noise comparing with its equivalent second-order statistics-based version. Moreover, it has higher resolution probability and low SNR scenario in direction of arrival estimation.","","POD:978-0-7695-3501-2","10.1109/CMC.2009.357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797187","fourth order cumulant;frequency estimation;multiple signal classification","Additive noise;Algorithm design and analysis;Autocorrelation;Colored noise;Direction of arrival estimation;Gaussian noise;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Probability;Signal to noise ratio","Gaussian noise;direction-of-arrival estimation;higher order statistics;matrix algebra","Gaussian noise;MUSIC-type method;additive noise;autocorrelation matrices;colored noise;direction of arrival estimation;fourth order cumulant matrix;fourth order cumulant-based MUSIC algorithm;fourth-order cumulant matrices;harmonic retrieval;second-order statistics-based version;statistical performance","","0","","8","","","6-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our approach, we model the notion of similarity as an unknown function of the image features characterizing the lesions, and use modern machine-learning algorithms to learn this function from similarity scores collected from radiologists in reader studies. This approach is evaluated using data collected from an observer study with a set of clinical mammograms.

It is envisioned that these low power computers will become the enabling technology in pervasive computing and bring about the next paradigm shift in computing. We present a new type of MAC protocol that is applicable to a special type of mobile wireless sensor network. In this network, mobile sensor nodes will sense the environment, and buffer the measured data for later retrieval. Once within range of the base station, the mobile mote will have a considerable amount of data to upload to the base station. Such a system could be used in different applications such as analyzing migration patterns of animals (ex. elephants) or offline monitoring of vehicle fleets. We present a MAC protocol that will maximize the throughput of the said network, and thereby ensure that the maximum amount of data can be uploaded by the mobile mote to the base station in a given time. By using a combination of floor acquisition multiple access (FAMA) and TDMA an optimal MAC protocol for the above mentioned scenario is designed. To gain access to the base station, motes will first contend with each other by sending RTS messages to the base station using a CSMA scheme. The mobile node with the first successful RTS message will be registered with the base station. We achieve high channel utilization by providing a single node with unmitigated access to the medium for the duration of the upload - i.e. the mote will acquire the floor. Uplink data transfer is carried out using a TDMA like scheme, where every time slot is allocated to the said mote. The proposed protocol is implemented as TinyOS components, targeted for the MICA2 sensor network platform. Simulation results are presented that benchmark the proposed FAMA/TDMA Hybrid MAC against a CSMA based MAC (B- MAC) protocol as well as a demand assigned TDMA protocol.","2151-1802;21511802","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2900-4; POD:978-1-4244-2899-1","10.1109/ICIAFS.2008.4783993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783993","","Access protocols;Base stations;Information retrieval;Media Access Protocol;Multiaccess communication;Pattern analysis;Pervasive computing;Time division multiple access;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","carrier sense multiple access;mobile communication;time division multiple access;wireless sensor networks","CSMA scheme;FAMA;MAC protocol;TDMA;TinyOS component;carrier sense multiple access;floor acquisition multiple access;mobile sensor node;mobile wireless sensor network;time division multiple access","","0","","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several techniques such as focused crawling and intelligent crawling have recently been proposed for topic specific resource discovery. All these crawlers use the hypertext features behavior in order to perform topic specific resource discovery. A focused crawler uses the relevance score of the crawled page to score the unvisited URLs extracted from it. The scored URLs are then added to the frontier. Then it picks up the best URL to crawl next. Focused crawlers rely on different types of features of the crawled pages to keep the crawling scope within the desired domain and they are obtained from URL, anchor text, link structure and text contents of the parent and ancestor pages. Different focused crawling algorithms use these different set of features to predict the relevance and quality of the unvisited Web pages. In this article a combined method based on rough set theory has been proposed. It combines the available predictions using decision rules and can build much larger domain-specific collections with less noise. Our experiment in this regard has provided better Harvest rate and better target recall for focused crawling.","","POD:978-0-7695-3520-3","10.1109/ICAPR.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4782763","Classification;Web resource discovery","Crawlers;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition;Search engines;Set theory;Software libraries;Taxonomy;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web sites","Internet;Web sites;hypermedia;rough set theory","URL extraction;Web pages;World Wide Web;hypertext features behavior;resource discovery;rough set based ensemble prediction;rough set theory;topic specific Web crawling","","0","1","12","","","4-6 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea is to encode an image as a collection of visual words of the quantized local patches. Objects in the image can then be retrieved through inferring the semantic topics associated with the set of visual words. However, the visual BOW mining framework is apt to suffer from the so-called term-mismatch problem (a.k.a. vocabulary problem). This is caused by the poverty of query information, and consequently becomes an obstacle to deal with synonymy (i.e., different visual words for describing the same object). In this paper, we propose a novel language-model-based approach with pseudo-relevance feedback for addressing the vocabulary problem in visual BOW mining. We employ the pseudo positive images produced in response to the original query as a set of ""cues"" to gradually refine the query language model. Unlike traditional approaches that only ruggedly append feedback information into the original query, the proposed approach reconstructs the query language model with finer granularities so that the query concepts can be captured more accurately. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated using two different types of image object databases. Our algorithms are shown to bring significant improvement in the retrieval accuracy over a non-feedback baseline, and achieve better performance than conventional feedback approaches.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:978-0-7695-3502-9","10.1109/ICDM.2008.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781119","Bag of words;Image object retrieval;Language model;Pseudo relevance feedback","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Database languages;Feedback;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Vocabulary","data mining;image retrieval;query processing;relevance feedback","bag-of-words approach;image object databases;image object mining;image object reranking;language-model-based approach;pseudo-relevance feedback;quantized local patches;query information;query language model;semantic topics;term-mismatch problem;visual words;vocabulary problem","","0","","31","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since database management tools does not provide an inbuilt mechanism to cluster datasets of higher magnitude it inevitably requires an external module to perform the same. This external module should be devised specifically to deal with the data extracted from the data source. There exists myriad of techniques for clustering and the conventional approaches deficits like excessive time and computational complexity. Computational complexity becomes a factor of consideration when data is extracted voluminously and the process of clustering and filtration is performed as a subsequent separate operation. The concept proposed is crafted with an object of eliminating the inherent redundancies in the accustomed practice. The proposed solution relies on exploiting the processing power of the database management tool by streamlining the SQL used for data extraction. And hence a procedure is formulated that can combine data retrieval and clustering to one single operation and leave it to DBMS without letting it to dissipate to the adjoining tiers.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3595-1; POD:978-1-4244-3594-4","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787767","","Clustering algorithms;Computational complexity;Data mining;Database languages;Energy management;Information retrieval;Pattern analysis;Relational databases;Scalability;Space technology","SQL;computational complexity;information retrieval;pattern clustering","Structured Query Language;clustering algorithm;computational complexity;data extraction;data retrieval;database management tools;filtration process","","0","","23","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cope with inferred problems, such as data redundancy, these systems opt for data-driven content retrieval mechanisms (pull mechanisms). Each node has a list of neighbors with whom it periodically exchanges buffer information and requests content fragments. One of the drawbacks of such a mechanism is that it does not offer intelligent selection of sending neighbors based on their characteristics. This is mainly because the most important criteria used to select nodes is the content availability. This can result in some performance degradation, for instance, due to peers that are sending very small or big parts of the needed data. Resiliency may then be weakened and overhead increased. In this paper we propose to study how the integration of some end nodes characteristics can improve the performance of a typical pull mechanism with random scheduling. We show that the improvement in performance is significant enough despite the fact that the room for improvement is bounded by the limitations of the pull mechanism. Hence we believe that the awareness of end characteristics is an important block upon which we can build more efficient content retrieval mechanisms. The gain in performance can also be amplified by proposing an alternative to the pull mechanism such as a combined pull-push approach.","2331-9852;23319852","POD:978-1-4244-2308-8","10.1109/CCNC.2009.4784764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784764","","Bandwidth;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Degradation;Delay;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Processor scheduling;Streaming media;Throughput","content-based retrieval;peer-to-peer computing;scheduling;video streaming","buffer information;content availability;content fragments;data redundancy;data-driven content retrieval mechanisms;pull-based live P2P streaming systems;random scheduling","","0","","18","","","10-13 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After preprocessing, the object trajectories and event models are fed into the core components of the framework for learning and retrieval. As trajectories are spatiotemporal in nature, the learning component is designed to analyze time series data. The human feedback to the retrieval results provides progressive guidance for the retrieval component in the framework. The retrieval results are in the form of video sequences instead of contained trajectories for user convenience.

XML is also used to store large amounts of bibliographic and scientific data. However, XML is by nature verbose and this contributes to the fact that XML databases are much large in size, thus increasing the cost for storing and retrieving data in smaller handheld devices which do not have large memory capacity. In order to address this problem, many XML-specific compression systems, such as XMill, XGrind, XQueC, XMLPPM, etc, have been developed. Recently, a work on storing the XML compactly has been developed, which proposes a non-tree based structure called RFX (redundancy free XML). In this paper, we propose a non-queriable compressor for the existing RFX structure which attains a high compression ratio at the cost of time for efficient retrieval of data.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3595-1; POD:978-1-4244-3594-4","10.1109/ICCCNET.2008.4787776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787776","","Containers;Costs;Databases;Entropy;Handheld computers;Huffman coding;Information retrieval;Tree data structures;World Wide Web;XML","XML;data compression;storage management","RFX storage structure;RFXFreeze;XML database;XML-specific compression system;nonqueriable compressor;nontree based structure;redundancy free XML","","0","","14","","","18-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A major shortcoming in the state-of-the-art is the lack of principled approaches for handling the sharing of large amounts of data within potentially resource-constrained environments while respecting the fundamental tenants of SOA.

Divon has been structured with four agents, namely, message agent, query handler agent, presentation agent, and user profiler agent. The message agent plays a key role in guiding the search process and displaying the information in a suitable form for the user whereas user profiler agent creates individual user profiles according to individual preferences. Divon has been developed on JADE environment and can run on any computer in connection with an arbitrary search engine. Divon has been evaluated against three metrics, namely, average search time, average response time and the precision within top 10 results. Evaluation results have shown that divon enhance the performance relative to the Google in average search time and precision within top ten results.

The future SMOS mission is based on such principles and will aim at retrieving SSS with an accuracy of the order of 0.1 psu (practical salinity units). This represents numerous engineering and scientific challenges, in particular because competing terms carried in the ocean TB measurements, foremost being sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean surface roughness, must be accounted for in a new and more robust manner. Prior to launch, we analyze the sensitivity of the future measurements to these factors by looking at somewhat higher frequency C and X-band data (6.8 and 10.7 versus the L-band 1.4 GHz) that are readily available from several recent MW imagers (AMSR-E, TMI, WindSAT). The shift to C and X-bands lowers TB sensitivity to changes in salinity by a large factor of 10-20. To compensate, we performed our study over the Amazon plume region where there are large (100-200 km) and persistent salinity contrasts that exceed the 0.1 psu science salinity requirement by a factor of 10-40 [1]-[2]. This region is of great importance within the salinity mission context due to the large freshwater flux and northward propagating eddies from retroreflection of the North Brazil Current (NBC). The validity of the emissivity/scattering models developed for SMOS at L-band are analyzed at these higher frequencies and our ability to detect these world largest salinity gradients is assessed.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2816-8; POD:978-1-4244-2815-1","10.1109/PASSIVE.2008.4787006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4787006","","Dielectric measurements;Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;L-band;Microwave measurements;Ocean salinity;Ocean temperature;Rivers;Sea measurements;Sea surface","oceanographic techniques;radiometers;remote sensing;seawater","Amazone river plume;C-band data;North Brazil Current retroflection;SMOS mission;WindSat data;X-band data;emissivity/scattering models;frequency 6.8 GHz;freshwater flux;ocean salinity retrieval assessment;ocean surface roughness;ocean surface salinity measurement;oceans brightness temperature;passive microwave radiometer measurement;salinity mission context;sea surface temperature;seawater dielectric characteristics;western tropical Atlantic Ocean","","0","","16","","","14-17 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus optimal choices will tend toward constant density displays. However, previous constant density algorithms are based on global density, which leads to occlusion and empty space if the density is not uniform. We introduce an algorithm that considers the layout of individual objects and avoids occlusion altogether. Efficiency concerns are important for dynamic summaries of the Informedia Digital Video Library, which has hundreds of thousands of shots. Posting multiple queries that take into account parameters of the visualization as well as the original query reduces the amount of work required. This greedy algorithm is then compared to an optimal one.

At 532 nm, the calibration factor may be estimated fairly accurately by Rayleigh (molecular) normalization in high-altitude, clean-air regions. For elevated aerosol layers embedded in clean air, the direct transmittance approach may be used to estimate the optical depth of the layer, thereby giving an auxiliary input that permits S<sub>a</sub> to be determined as a part of the solution. Otherwise, S<sub>a</sub> must be specified based on models or determined through use of some other constraining information. The retrieval at 1064 nm is more problematic because the molecular scatter contribution is much weaker, typically making it difficult to either calibrate by molecular normalization or to accurately estimate the transmittance of an elevated aerosol layer, particularly for the weak signals from satellite lidar or eye-safe airborne lidar. As such, aerosol retrievals from dual-wavelength satellite lidars such as those onboard ICESat and CALIPSO have largely been limited to 532 nm retrievals using a table look-up approach to select assumed S<sub>a</sub> values based on climatological/geographically determined models. Dual-wavelength retrievals using a Constrained Ratio Aerosol Model-fit (CRAM) retrieval method, employing AERONET based model ratio parameters, have also been obtained with some success for a few satellite lidar data sets.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779055","","Aerosols;Backscatter;Calibration;Extinction coefficients;Hair;Information retrieval;Laser radar;NASA;Optical scattering;Satellites","aerosols;atmospheric optics;atmospheric techniques;backscatter;calibration;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam","AERONET based model ratio parameters;CRAM dual wavelength aerosol retrieval models;CRAM retrieval method;Constrained Ratio Aerosol Model fit;Fernald lidar equation solution relation;HSRL;High Spectral Resolution Lidar;Rayleigh normalization;aerosol backscatter;aerosol extinction-backscatter ratio;aerosol height;direct transmittance approach;elastic scatter lidar;molecular normalization calibration;optical depth estimation;system calibration factor;wavelength 1064 nm;wavelength 532 nm","","4","","5","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a notation for visualizing the flow of requirements, explicitly including both informal and document-based communication. An example illustrates the notation by applying it to eliciting and validating security requirements. We compare our visualization approach for flows of requirements to related notations.

However the content analysis and retrieval is not as simple as meaningful retrieval of information in a normal data system. The visual information of video data lies in high chromatic depth and density. At the same time these data uses different codecs for storage and interpretation. The differences of video codec coding system properties cause for chromatic data differences of video files. This paper elicits the difficulties of dealing with multi codec level video visual classification and it proposes an approach to handle visual features and higher level color attributes of video data even though it is in multi-codecs nature. This approach uses novel compacted dither pattern code extractor for visual classification. This extractor reduces the complexity of colour visual feature extraction and classification. Further, this approach has been tested with various lossy and loss-less video formats to generate a probabilistic coding mechanism. The results of this approach show that it can be further enhanced to calibrate a video visual classification knowledge base.","2151-1802;21511802","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2900-4; POD:978-1-4244-2899-1","10.1109/ICIAFS.2008.4783962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4783962","Chromatic data;Codecs;Compacted Dither Codes;Content analysis;Training Knowledge;Video visual classification","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Data security;Data systems;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information technology;Layout;Video codecs","feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;probability;video codecs;video coding;video retrieval","chromatic data differences;colour visual feature extraction;compacted dither coding;compacted dither pattern code extractor;digital video content analysis;digital video content retrieval;multicodec formats;probabilistic coding mechanism;video codec coding system;video visual classification","","2","","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Magubi is a model and implementation that is able to not only do advanced standard service discovery, but also, by viewing human tasks and activities as services, is able to expand the realm of service discovery for pervasive computing while addressing the overload challenge. Here, we present the model, and how we model services, humans, and activities.

Additionally, some biological properties of the protein are taken, thus forming better integrated descriptor. In the second approach, some modification of the ray based descriptor is applied on the backbone of the protein molecule. In the third approach, wavelet transformation is applied on the distance matrix of the Calpha atoms which form the backbone of the protein. The SCOP database was used to evaluate the retrieval accuracy. We provide some experimental results of the retrieval accuracy of our three approaches.

Generally, the training data for learning to rank come in two different forms: (1) absolute relevance judgments assessing the degree of relevance of a document with respect to a query. This type of judgments is also called labeled data and are usually obtained through human editorial efforts; and (2) relative relevance judgments indicating that a document is more relevant than another with respect to a query. This type of judgments is also called preference data and can usually be extracted from the abundantly available user click-through data recording users' interactions with the search results. Most existing learning to rank methods ignore the query boundaries, treating the labeled data or preference data equally across queries. In this paper, we propose a minimum effort optimization method that takes into account the entire training data within a query at each iteration. We tackle this optimization problem using functional iterative methods where the update at each iteration is computed by solving an isotonic regression problem. This more global approach results in faster convergency and signficantly improved performance of the learned ranking functions over existing state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using data sets obtained from a commercial search engine as well as publicly available data.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2926-4; POD:978-1-4244-2925-7","10.1109/ALLERTON.2008.4797684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4797684","","Humans;Information retrieval;Iterative methods;Learning systems;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Search engines;Software measurement;Training data;Web search","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;query processing;regression analysis;search engines","Web search;functional iterative methods;information retrieval;isotonic regression;machine learning;optimization problem;preference data;query-level learning;ranking functions;search engines","","3","4","27","","","23-26 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach in this regard is using query expansion techniques and the other would be introducing a semantic similarity measure for concepts in ontology. Although each approach has its own benefits and drawbacks, query expansion techniques are preferred when the corpus volume is so huge that examining concept pairs between query and documents is not reasonable. In this paper a semantic query expansion algorithm for medical information retrieval is introduced. Proposed approach consists of identifying MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) concepts in user's query and applying expansion algorithm to them. Expansion algorithm is based on the location of concepts in MeSH hierarchy, number of synonyms of each concept and number of terms the concept is made of. Results show improvements over classic method, query expansion using general purpose ontology and a number of other approaches.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3397-1; POD:978-1-4244-3396-4","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2008.4781679","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4781679","","Additives;Books;Feedback;Indexing;Information retrieval;Libraries;Natural languages;Ontologies;System testing;Vocabulary","information retrieval;medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","domain specific ontologies;information retrieval systems;medical field;medical information retrieval;medical subject headings;query expansion techniques;semantic query expansion algorithm;semantic similarity measure","","2","","20","","","16-18 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To alleviate this problem we are developing a retrieval system, which extends the functionality of keyword-based searching by browsing functionalities. The browsing, however, is not based on hyperlinks but rather on the relationships that occur in medicinal ontologies, which model medicinal learning objects as well as their relationships to other medicinal concepts.

Dynamic query sliders are linked to the main visualization to filter data. A common alternative to dynamic queries is to link several simple visualizations, such as histograms, to the main visualization with a brushing interaction strategy. Selecting data in the histograms highlights that data in the main visualization. We compare these two approaches in an empirical experiment on DataMaps, a geographic data visualization tool. Dynamic query sliders resulted in better performance for simple range tasks, while brushing histograms was better for complex trend evaluation and attribute relation tasks. Participants preferred brushing histograms for understanding relationships between attributes and the rich information they provided.","","POD:0-7803-8154-8","10.1109/INFVIS.2003.1249020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249020","","Data visualization;Displays;Histograms;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Manipulator dynamics;Multidimensional systems;User interfaces;Visual databases","data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;information filters;query formulation","DataMaps;brushing histograms;brushing interaction;complex trend evaluation;dynamic queries;dynamic query sliders;filter data;geographic data visualization;information exploration;information visualization;multidimensional visualization;query formulation;real-time visual display;usability study","","1","2","16","","","21-21 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NMF aims to find two non-negative matrices whose product can well approximate the original matrix. The sizes of these two matrices are usually smaller than the original matrix. This results in a compressed version of the original data matrix. The solution of NMF yields a natural parts-based representation for the data. When NMF is applied for data representation, a major disadvantage is that it fails to consider the geometric structure in the data. In this paper, we develop a graph based approach for parts-based data representation in order to overcome this limitation. We construct an affinity graph to encode the geometrical information and seek a matrix factorization which respects the graph structure.

Concurrent words become concurrent field association words (CFA words) if there is a little field overlap. Usually, efficient CFA words are difficult to extract using only frequency, so this paper proposes weighting according to degree of importance of concurrent words.

In contrast to conventional classification method based on statistical model, in our method, the similarity matrix is first introduced to partition the input into a series of portions; then the SVM (support vector machine) classifier is employed for vocal/non-vocal classification for each portion, finally, a smoothing method is adopted to correct the misclassification errors brought by the classifier.

In contrast, the spatial resolution used for the retrieval of the soil moisture from SMOS images will be rather coarse, in the order of tens of kilometres. The provided soil moisture information is therefore integrated over a large area that may be composed of different land covers and soils. Uncertainties of the soil moisture retrieval depend on the accuracy and spatial resolution of ancillary data, like land use information data, which is necessary for the retrieval. The sensitivity of the retrieval to different land cover information datasets is investigated, using a coupled SVAT-radiative transfer-model comparing the standard land use map used within the SMOS Level 2 soil moisture processor with a well established map for the study area.

The proposed database applies a native XML database as a backbone, uses hybrid-tree as its database structure, and performs threshold algorithm (TA) to conduct similarity search based on a random combination of image features. The database also sketches an index scheme in building a mapping between temporal and spatial domains so as to support both temporal and spatial queries at a higher speed search over the traditional pure temporal or spatial based indexing methods. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed database system can conduct a more efficiently search activities supporting queries that involve composite features with arbitrary Boolean combinations and can outperform a traditional database employing a linear scanning search scheme","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.259084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028839","Multimedia database;PCA;hybrid-tree;temporal & spatial indexing","Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Image analysis;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Spatial databases","XML;computer vision;database indexing;multimedia databases;tree data structures;video retrieval;visual databases","XML database;computer vision;database structure;hybrid-tree structure;image processing;image retrieval;linear scanning search scheme;multimedia database system;spatial based indexing method;temporal based indexing method;threshold algorithm;video retrieval","","0","","8","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to use remote sensing derived soil moisture information for practical applications as e.g. flood forecasting and water balance modeling in mesoscale areas, frequent large area coverage is a prerequisite. The present paper investigates the potential of using frequent microwave observations to retrieve information on surface soil moisture characteristics, as they will become available from the SENTINEL-1 mission. SAR data from the ESA AGRISAR 2006 campaign is used for that purpose. The paper first investigates the potential of using different models for the retrieval of surface soil moisture information using airborne data. An empirical parameter retrieval model is then applied for the retrieval as well as to ENVISAT ASAR satellite data to investigate the trade-off in spatial scale. The rms error of the retrieval results was found to be between 4 and 7 vol.%, which is consistent with previous findings.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779365","Soil moisture;field campaigns;hydrology;inverse problems","Backscatter;Electromagnetic heating;Information retrieval;Land surface;Remote sensing;Rough surfaces;Satellites;Soil moisture;Surface soil;Vegetation mapping","atmospheric boundary layer;moisture;remote sensing by radar;soil;synthetic aperture radar","AD 2006;ENVISAT ASAR satellite;ESA AGRISAR campaign;SAR data;SENTINEL-1 mission;energy flux;microwave remote sensing;multitemporal airborne data;satellite data;surface parameter retrieval;surface soil moisture content;water flux","","0","","9","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This demand has driven an increase in volume, frequency of acquisition, and spatial resolution of HR-CSI. In turn, this has spurred the need for more accurate and time-efficient processing tools for analyzing geospatial information to support user-specific applications. One such application is change detection between multi-temporal HR-CSI data. The significant increase in quantity and quality of multi-temporal HR-CSI data makes traditional manual analysis impractical. Thus, there is a need for a fully automated change detection system that not only identifies areas of change, but also allows users to filter, sort through, and analyze areas of change quickly and efficiently. Here we describe a tool - GeoCDX (Geospatial Change Detection and Exploitation) - to meet this need. GeoCDX is an integrated system that performs image ingestion and registration, feature extraction, and change analysis. The change detection results from GeoCDX are web accessible with additional interfaces to Google Earthtrade (GE) and Google Mapstrade (GM). In the near future GeoCDX will be integrated with its sister system GeoIRIS (Geospatial Information Retrieval and Indexing System).

For example, document similarity can be used to rank search engine results, cluster documents according to topics etc. A major challenge in calculating document similarity originates from the fact that two documents can have the same topic or even mean the same, while they use different wording to describe the content. A sophisticated algorithm therefore will not directly operate on the texts but will have to find a more abstract representation that captures the texts' meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for calculating the similarity of text documents.

In order to analyze the shift from non-blog users to becoming blog users, a qualitative approach in a longitudinal percept is used to explore the affect and cognition of consumers. With a time period analysis, this study compares both individual and group schema differences by using in-depth interviews, open coding and axial coding. Our findings from the schema-based perspective provide evidences that different time period processes lead to different consumers affect and cognition of schema development. In the end, we conclude that consumers affect and cognition play significant influence on blog usage. These findings also present valuable information to different areas across relative efforts in consumers affect and cognition.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.231","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780695","","Blogs;Cognition;Information management;Information retrieval;Information services;Internet;Merchandise;Motion pictures;Web pages;Web sites","Web sites;cognition;human factors","axial coding;blog usage;cognition;consumer affect;information retrieval;knowledge construction;open coding;social life;time period analysis","","0","","34","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
