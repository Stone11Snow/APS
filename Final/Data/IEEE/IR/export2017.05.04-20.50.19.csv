Based on the corn plant ontology, we propose a semantic annotation method in which the feature words are selected by an improved method for weight calculation and the RDF triples are generated by syntactic parser. Finally a semantic retrieval system for corn plant is developed.

Existing service matchmakers typically determine the relevance between a web service advertisement and a service request by computing an overall score that aggregates individual matching scores among the various parameters in their descriptions. Two main drawbacks characterize such approaches. First, there is no single matching criterion that is optimal for determining the similarity between parameters. Instead, there are numerous approaches ranging from Information Retrieval similarity measures up to semantic logic-based inference rules. Second, the reduction of individual scores to an overall similarity leads to significant information loss. Determining appropriate weights for these intermediate scores requires knowledge of user preferences, which is often not possible or easy to acquire. Instead, using a typical aggregation function, such as the average or the minimum of the degrees of match across the service parameters, introduces undesired bias, which often reduces the accuracy of the retrieval process. Consequently, several services, e.g., those having a single unmatched parameter, may be excluded from the result set, while being potentially good candidates. In this work, we present two complementary approaches that overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. First, we propose a methodology for ranking the relevant services for a given request, introducing objective measures based on dominance relationships defined among the services. Second, we investigate methods for clustering the relevant services in a way that reveals and reflects the different trade-offs between the matched parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed techniques and algo- - rithms through extensive experimental evaluation on both real requests and relevance sets, as well as on synthetic scenarios.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5456360","Web services matchmaking;clustering;ranking;skyline.","Aggregates;Information management;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Quality of service;Search engines;Technology management;Weather forecasting;Web search;Web services","Web services;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;pattern clustering;search engines","Web search engines;Web service retrieval;aggregation function;information retrieval;multicriteria dominance relationship;relevance sets;semantic logic-based inference rules;unmatched parameter","","49","","33","","20100429","July-Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently, a much more flexible pattern matching problem with wildcards has been proposed. Chen et al. introduced local constraints, global constraints and the one-off condition into the task of pattern matching, and the most representative algorithm SAIL was designed. However, the performance of SAIL is not analyzed well, which affects its application. Therefore, this paper analyzes the performance of SAIL in-depth, and discovers that the matching result is closely related to the features of patterns. Meanwhile, the completeness of SAIL in the pattern matching with no-recurring characters is proved, and an improved algorithm, named RSAIL, is proposed for pattern matching with recurring tail characters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSAIL improves the number of matches by 2.2% compared to SAIL.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4161-7; POD:978-1-4244-7964-1","10.1109/GrC.2010.156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5576076","SAIL;completeness;matching;wildcard","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Bioinformatics;Classification algorithms;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;USA Councils","pattern matching","RSAIL;bioinformatics;flexible wildcards;information retrieval;pattern matching;recurring characters;representative algorithm;tail characters","","3","","13","","","14-16 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The interpretation of these new information depends on our ability to retrieve known substructures in the data, the Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) networks. In an algorithmic point of view, it is an hard task since it often leads to NP-hard problems. To overcome this difficulty, many authors have provided tools for querying patterns with a restricted topology, i.e., paths or trees in PPI networks. Such restriction leads to the development of fixed parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms, which can be practicable for restricted sizes of queries. Unfortunately, Graph Homomorphism is a W[1]-hard problem, and hence, no FPT algorithm can be found when patterns are in the shape of general graphs. However, Dost et al. [2] gave an algorithm (which is not implemented) to query graphs with a bounded treewidth in PPI networks (the treewidth of the query being involved in the time complexity). In this paper, we propose another algorithm for querying pattern in the shape of graphs, also based on dynamic programming and the color-coding technique. To transform graphs queries into trees without loss of informations, we use feedback vertex set coupled to a node duplication mechanism. Hence, our algorithm is FPT for querying graphs with a bounded size of their feedback vertex set. It gives an alternative to the treewidth parameter, which can be better or worst for a given query. We provide a python implementation which allows us to validate our implementation on real data. Especially, we retrieve some human queries in the shape of graphs into the fly PPI network.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2010.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473212","Graph query, pattern matching, dynamic programming, protein-protein interactions networks.","Bioinformatics;Dynamic programming;Feedback;Genomics;Humans;Information retrieval;Network topology;Proteins;Shape;Tree graphs","biological techniques;biology computing;molecular biophysics;proteins","PPI networks;W[1]-hard problem;color-coding technique;feedback vertex set;fixed parameter tractable algorithms;graph homomorphism;human query;protein-protein interaction network;python implementation;querying pattern;treewidth parameter","Algorithms;Databases, Protein;Protein Interaction Mapping;Proteins","16","","35","","20100527","October 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The novelty of SUDS is that it explores the data distribution in subspaces to build a visual dictionary with which the videos are processed by deriving the string matching techniques with two-step data simplification. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive approach, called VLP, to extract a series of dominant subspaces of variable lengths from the whole visual feature space without the constraint of dimension consecutiveness. A stable visual dictionary is built by clustering the video keyframes over each dominant subspace. A compact video representation model is developed by transforming each keyframe into a word that is a series of symbols in the dominant subspaces, and further each video into a series of words. Then, we present an innovative similarity measure called CVE, which adopts a complementary information compensation scheme based on the visual features and sequence context of videos. Finally, an efficient two-layered index strategy with a number of query optimizations is proposed to facilitate video retrieval.

The database on the server side consists of hundreds of thousands of landmarks, which is crawled using a state of the art mining method for community photo collections. In addition to the landmark images, we also integrate a database of media covers with millions of items. Retrieval from these databases is done using vocabularies of local visual features. In order to fulfill the real-time constraints for AR applications, we introduce a method to speed-up geometric verification of feature matches. The client-side tracking of recognized objects builds on a multi-modal combination of visual features and sensor measurements.

The approach takes into account geometrical information of the 3D face and encodes the relevant information into a compact representation in the form of a graph. Nodes of the graph represent equal width isogeodesic facial stripes. Arcs between pairs of nodes are labeled with descriptors, referred to as 3D Weighted Walkthroughs (3DWWs), that capture the mutual relative spatial displacement between all the pairs of points of the corresponding stripes. Face partitioning into isogeodesic stripes and 3DWWs together provide an approximate representation of local morphology of faces that exhibits smooth variations for changes induced by facial expressions.

Such trace links are essential for code understanding and change management. The lack thereof is often cited as a key reason for software engineering failure. Unfortunately, the creation and maintenance of requirements-to-code traces remains a largely manual and error prone task due to the informal nature of requirements. This paper demonstrates that reasoning about requirements-to-code traces can be done, in part, by considering the calling relationships within the source code (call graph). We observed that requirements-to-code traces form regions along calling dependencies. Better knowledge about these regions has several direct benefits. For example, erroneous traces become detectable if a method inside a region does not trace to a requirement. Or, a missing trace (incompleteness) can be identified. Knowledge of requirement regions can also be used to help guide developers in establishing requirements-to-code traces in a more efficient manner. This paper discusses requirement regions and sketches their benefits.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-1-4244-8629-8; POD:978-1-4244-8630-4; USB:978-1-4244-8628-1","10.1109/ICSM.2010.5609699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5609699","call tree;feature location;requirements;traces","Gallium nitride;Information retrieval;Java;Maintenance engineering;Software;Software engineering;Unified modeling language","management of change;software engineering;software management","change management;requirements-to-code trace;software engineering;source code;trace links","","3","","20","","","12-18 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linguists make a very conservative estimate that 4000 languages are spoken today in the world, and in many of these languages, very limited linguistic knowledge and speech data/resources are available. Rapid transition to a new target language becomes a practical concern within the concept of tiered resources (e.g., different amounts of acoustically matched/mismatched data). In this paper, we present our research efforts towards multilingual spoken information retrieval with limitations in acoustic training data. We propose different retrieval algorithms to leverage existing resources from resource-rich languages as well as the target language. Proposed algorithms employ confusion-embedded hybrid pronunciation networks, and lattice-based phonetic search within a proper name retrieval task. We use Latin-American Spanish as the target language by intentionally limiting available resources for this language. After searching for queries consisting of Spanish proper names in Spanish Broadcast News data, we demonstrate that retrieval performance degradations (due to data sparseness during automatic speech recognition (ASR) deployment in the target language) are compensated by employing English acoustic models. It is shown that the proposed algorithms for developing rapid transition of rich languages to underrepresented languages are able to achieve comparable retrieval performance using 25% of the available training data.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2035785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5308384","Hybrid pronunciation;limited resource languages;multi-lingual speech systems;robust automatic speech recognition;spoken document retrieval;weighted parallel lattice search","Automatic speech recognition;Broadcasting;Degradation;Dictionaries;Information retrieval;Lattices;Natural languages;Robustness;Speech recognition;Training data","information retrieval;natural language processing;speech recognition","acoustic training data;limited resource languages;multilingual hybrid representations;multilingual speech recognition;spoken proper name retrieval;transcribed speech data","","1","1","42","","20091103","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is consequently a strong need for highly efficient search tools for EO image databases and for search methods to automatically identify and recognize structures within EO images. Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) and automatic image annotation systems have been designed to tackle the problem of image retrieval in large image databases. These two systems achieve a common goal, that is to learn the mapping function between low-level visual features and high-level image semantics. A setup, which has hardly been explored in annotating systems and which is the rule rather than the exception, is the case when the training database used to learn the mapping function is not exhaustive regarding semantic classes present in the images. This means that there exists unknown image classes for which there is no training examples in the training database. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised method for auto-annotating satellite image databases and discovering unknown semantic image classes in these databases. The idea is to incorporate into the learning process the unannotated data which by definition contain the unknown image classes. The latter are considered to be latent structures in the data that appear when we train a hierarchical latent variable model with both the labeled and unlabeled data. We also show that, in our case, the use of unlabeled data leads to more reliable estimates regarding the model parameters. We present experimental results on a synthetic dataset, making a comparison of our algorithm with a semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (S3VM) on this dataset. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our unknown image classes discovery procedure on a database of SPOT5 satellite images. We show that the results obtained on this database are rather positive since t- - he new structures detected correspond to semantic classes which are not represented in the training database.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2058794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5545467","Bayesian inference;Gaussian mixtures;expectation-Maximization;hierarchical Bayesian models;latent variable models;semantic image annotation;semi-supervised learning;unknown image classes discovery","Computational modeling;Content based retrieval;Data models;Databases;Earth;High-resolution imaging;Image color analysis;Image databases;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Satellites;Search methods;Semantics;Supervised learning;Visualization","Bayes methods;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;programming language semantics;support vector machines","Bayesian inference;EO image databases;Gaussian mixtures;SPOT5 satellite images;autoannotating satellite image databases;automatic image annotation systems;content based image retrieval;earth observation imaging sensors;hierarchical Bayesian models;hierarchical latent variable model;high-level image semantics;image data volume;learning process;mapping function;semantic image annotation;semantic image classes;semisupervised support vector machine;unknown image classes discovery","","14","","31","","20100809","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is believed that the parameters trained on a proper corpus will improve translation performance. Instead of exploring new algorithms, this paper aims to select development corpus for tuning parameters according to the test set. We address this problem as domain adaptation and propose two methods based on information retrieval (IR) technique and text clustering (TC) technique, respectively.

Scatter Bitmap Index uses less space and is more CPU-efficient than other bitmap indexing techniques. It is simple to represent, and improves query processing time by utilizing low-cost Boolean operations and multiple index scans. The Scatter Bitmap Index technique performs simple predicate conditions on the index level before going to the primary data source. Furthermore, Scatter Bitmap Index can be optimized by applying K-mode Clustering, which finds relationships among attribute values in queries.

However, existing techniques are rarely capable of dealing with imperfections in user-supplied ratings. When such imperfections (e.g., ambiguities) cannot be avoided, designers resort to simplifying assumptions that impair the system's performance and utility. We have developed a novel technique referred to as CoFiDS-Collaborative Filtering based on Dempster-Shafer belief-theoretic framework-that can represent a wide variety of data imperfections, propagate them throughout the decision-making process without the need to make simplifying assumptions, and exploit contextual information. With its DS-theoretic predictions, the domain expert can either obtain a ""hard” decision or can narrow the set of possible predictions to a smaller set.

In this paper, a novel combined model based on phrase and sentence level's analyses and a discussion on the complementation of different levels' analyses are presented. For the phrase-level sentiment analysis, a newly defined Left-Middle-Right template and the Conditional Random Fields are used to extract the sentiment words.

No cross-channel computations are necessary in bilinear interpolation. By taking into consideration of inter-channel correlation, Pei and Lam improved the bilinear interpolation without increasing much of computational complexity. Both approaches however suffer certain edge-aliasing effect by reason of their average (or lowpass) nature. In order to eliminate such edge-aliasing, a new interpolation method is proposed in this work. By excluding extreme neighbor pixels before the average operation, the edge can now be better preserved.

Using an iterative algorithm, we then perform trifactorizations of the new matrices to infer the clusters of different data types and their correspondence. Theoretically, we prove the convergence and correctness of SS-NMF coclustering and show the relationship between SS-NMF with other well-known coclustering models.

In this paper, we intend to show that integrating knowledge of mutual dependencies between chords and metric structure allows us to enhance the estimation of these musical attributes. For this, we propose a specific topology of hidden Markov models that enables modelling chord dependence on metric structure. This model allows us to consider pieces with complex metric structures such as beat addition, beat deletion or changes in the meter. The model is evaluated on a large set of popular music songs from the Beatles that present various metric structures. We compare a semi-automatic model in which the beat positions are annotated, with a fully automatic model in which a beat tracker is used as a front-end of the system. The results show that the downbeat positions of a music piece can be estimated in terms of its harmonic structure and that conversely the chord progression estimation benefits from considering the interaction between the metric and the harmonic structures.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2045236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428860","Chords;downbeat;hidden Markov model (HMM)","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Electrical capacitance tomography;Hidden Markov models;Information analysis;Music information retrieval;Postal services;Rhythm;Signal synthesis;Topology","audio signal processing;hidden Markov models;music","audio file;audio signals;beat addition;beat deletion;beat tracker;chord progression;chord progression estimation;downbeats;hidden Markov model;metric structure;music harmony;music rhythm;music songs;musical signal estimation","","18","","39","","20100311","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Range queries, as one of the most commonly used tools, are often posed by the users to retrieve needful information from a spatial database. However, due to the limits of communication bandwidth and hardware power of handheld devices, displaying all the results of a range query on a handheld device is neither communication-efficient nor informative to the users. This is simply because that there are often too many results returned from a range query. In view of this problem, we present a novel idea that a concise representation of a specified size for the range query results, while incurring minimal information loss, shall be computed and returned to the user. Such a concise range query not only reduces communication costs, but also offers better usability to the users, providing an opportunity for interactive exploration. The usefulness of the concise range queries is confirmed by comparing it with other possible alternatives, such as sampling and clustering. Unfortunately, we prove that finding the optimal representation with minimum information loss is an NP-hard problem. Therefore, we propose several effective and nontrivial algorithms to find a good approximate result. Extensive experiments on real-world data have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed techniques.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416721","Spatial databases;algorithms.;range queries","Communications technology;Costs;Handheld computers;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Personal digital assistants;Spatial databases;Usability;Wireless communication","computational complexity;optimisation;query processing;visual databases","NP-hard problem;bandwidth limit;information retrieval;interactive exploration;maps view;minimal information loss;nontrivial algorithm;range query;spatial database;wireless communication technology","","0","","31","","20100218","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The corresponding differential interferogram contains, in principle, information concerning the geometry of the seismic source that the earthquake comes from. To perform the inversion operation, a novel approach based on NNs is considered. This requires the generation of a statistically significant number of synthetic interferograms necessary for the network training phase. Each of them corresponds to a different combination of fault geometric parameters. After the training, the network is ready to perform, in real time, the inversion on new differential interferograms. This paper illustrates such a methodology and its validation on a set of experimental data.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2010.2050776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508396","Neural networks (NNs);SAR interferometry (InSAR);seismic parameter estimation","Earthquakes;Information geometry;Information retrieval;Landmine detection;Neural networks;Parameter estimation;Seismic waves;Seismology;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Uncertainty","earthquakes;faulting;geophysical signal processing;neural nets;parameter estimation;radar interferometry;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","InSAR data;SAR interferometry;active seismogenic fault;differential interferogram;earthquake;fault geometry;inversion operation;neural networks;seismic source characterization;seismic source geometric parameter estimation;seismic source quantitative parameter retrieval;synthetic interferograms","","2","","41","","20100712","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Face Matching and Retrieval Using Soft Biometrics","U. Park; A. K. Jain","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","20100812","2010","5","3","406","415","Soft biometric traits embedded in a face (e.g., gender and facial marks) are ancillary information and are not fully distinctive by themselves in face-recognition tasks. However, this information can be explicitly combined with face matching score to improve the overall face-recognition accuracy. Moreover, in certain application domains, e.g., visual surveillance, where a face image is occluded or is captured in off-frontal pose, soft biometric traits can provide even more valuable information for face matching or retrieval. Facial marks can also be useful to differentiate identical twins whose global facial appearances are very similar. The similarities found from soft biometrics can also be useful as a source of evidence in courts of law because they are more descriptive than the numerical matching scores generated by a traditional face matcher. We propose to utilize demographic information (e.g., gender and ethnicity) and facial marks (e.g., scars, moles, and freckles) for improving face image matching and retrieval performance. An automatic facial mark detection method has been developed that uses (1) the active appearance model for locating primary facial features (e.g., eyes, nose, and mouth), (2) the Laplacian-of-Gaussian blob detection, and (3) morphological operators. Experimental results based on the FERET database (426 images of 213 subjects) and two mugshot databases from the forensic domain (1225 images of 671 subjects and 10 000 images of 10 000 subjects, respectively) show that the use of soft biometric traits is able to improve the face-recognition performance of a state-of-the-art commercial matcher.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2010.2049842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5471147","Demographic information;face marks;face recognition;face retrieval;soft biometrics","Biometrics;Demography;Face detection;Facial features;Image databases;Image matching;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Spatial databases;Surveillance","biometrics (access control);face recognition;image matching;image retrieval;visual databases","FERET database;Laplacian-of-Gaussian blob detection;face image matching score;face recognition accuracy;face retrieval;facial mark detection method;facial marks;morphological operators;numerical matching scores;soft biometric traits;visual surveillance","","70","","38","","20100524","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The P2P paradigm emerges as a powerful model for organizing and searching large data repositories distributed over independent sources. Advanced query operators, such as skyline queries, are necessary in order to help users handle the huge amount of available data. A skyline query retrieves the set of nondominated data points in a multidimensional data set. Skyline query processing in P2P networks poses inherent challenges and demands nontraditional techniques, due to the distribution of content and the lack of global knowledge. Relying on a superpeer architecture, we propose a threshold-based algorithm, called SKYPEER and its variants, for efficient computation of skyline points in arbitrary subspaces, while reducing both computational time and volume of transmitted data. Furthermore, we address the problem of routing skyline queries over the superpeer network and we propose an efficient routing mechanism, namely SKYPEER<sup>+</sup>, which further improves the performance by reducing the number of contacted superpeers. Finally, we provide an extensive experimental evaluation showing that our approach performs efficiently and provides a viable solution when a large degree of distribution is required.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342419","Skyline queries;peer-to-peer systems;routing indexes.","Computer architecture;Costs;Distributed computing;Distributed power generation;Information retrieval;Information systems;Network servers;Organizing;Query processing;Routing","distributed databases;peer-to-peer computing;query processing","SKYPEER algorithm;data generation;distributed data;peer-to-peer networks;skyline query processing;subspace skyline query routing;superpeer architecture","","5","","27","","20091201","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, two aspects of cross-lingual semantic document similarity measures are investigated: One is document representation, and the other is the formulation of similarity measures. Fuzzy set and rough set theories are applied to capture the inherently fuzzy relationships among concepts expressed by natural languages. Our approach first develops a language-independent sense-level document representation based on the fuzzy set model to reduce the barrier between different languages and further explores the fuzzy-rough hybrid approach to obtain a more robust macrosense-level document representation through the partitioning of the integrated sense association network of the document collection into macrosenses. Then, Tversky's notion of similarity and the F1 measure on information retrieval are adopted to formulate, respectively, two document similarity measures with fuzzy set operations on the two proposed document representations. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by its success rate in identifying the English translations to their corresponding Chinese documents in a collection of Chinese-English parallel documents. Moreover, the proposed approach can be easily extended to process documents in other languages. It is believed that the proposed representations, along with the similarity measures, will enable more effective text mining processes.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2065811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5549886","Cross-lingual;document representation;fuzzy–rough hybrid;sense association network;similarity measure","Approximation methods;Computational modeling;Correlation;Fuzzy sets;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Internet;Natural languages;Pragmatics;Robustness;Search engines;Semantics;Set theory;Text mining;Web pages","document handling;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;natural language processing;rough set theory","Chinese document;Chinese-English parallel document;cross-lingual document representation;cross-lingual information retrieval;cross-lingual semantic document similarity measure;fuzzy set model;fuzzy set operation;fuzzy set theory;integrated sense association network;language-independent sense-level document representation;natural language;rough set theory;text mining process","","17","","57","","20100816","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The preliminary results presented in this paper show large spatial variations of the vineyard soil properties, which are in accordance with the distribution of the different soil types within the study area. This is particularly observable from soil electrical conductivity data, which show strong spatial correlation with large areas of comparable values delimited by well-defined discontinuities, revealing sharp variations of soil characteristics over short distances. These discontinuities almost systematically correspond to the limits of the vineyard plots, though areas of contrasted soil electrical conductivity values are also found within some plots. Furthermore, the patterns of soil electrical conductivity are in good agreement with soil stratigraphy observed from GPR measurements. Finally, these results also highlighted compaction as a likely explanation to vine vigour problems observed locally in the vineyard. Future work will focus on the full-waveform inversion of GPR and EMI data to retrieve the properties of the different soil layers and to investigate the spatial variation of soil water availability in the study area, and provide on this basis recommendations for the vineyard management.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4605-6; POD:978-1-4244-4604-9","10.1109/ICGPR.2010.5550145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5550145","3D-imaging;Ground-penetrating radar;electromagnetic induction;soil hydrogeophysical properties","Compaction;Conductivity measurement;Electric variables measurement;Electromagnetic induction;Electromagnetic interference;Ground penetrating radar;High-resolution imaging;Information retrieval;Soil measurements;Soil properties","","","","0","","12","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is because they change so quickly and several images of the same place can be acquired at different times within the same day. This paper describes the use of filter measures and the Bayesian networks to reduce the number of irrelevant features necessary for ocean structure recognition in satellite images, thereby improving the overall interpretation system performance and reducing the computational time.

The model tracks the periodicities of different signal property changes that manifest within different frequency bands by using the most appropriate onset/transient detectors for each frequency band. In addition, the proposed system applies a novel method to weight tempo candidates. Each contribution is evaluated by comparing the presented system against existing approaches using three different databases that comprises 1638 songs. These databases include the two publicly available database of songs used in the tempo evaluation contest of ISMIR 2004. These songs are used in order to compare the proposed approach against four recent existing approaches and also against the participants of the tempo detection contest of ISMIR 2004.

This paper reviews techniques to accelerate concept classification, where we show the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. As a basis, we use the Bag-of-Words algorithm that in the 2008 benchmarks of TRECVID and PASCAL lead to the best performance scores. We divide the evaluation in three steps: 1) Descriptor Extraction, where we evaluate SIFT, SURF, DAISY, and Semantic Textons. 2) Visual Word Assignment, where we compare a k-means visual vocabulary with a Random Forest and evaluate subsampling, dimension reduction with PCA, and division strategies of the Spatial Pyramid. 3) Classification, where we evaluate the χ<sup>2</sup>, RBF, and Fast Histogram Intersection kernel for the SVM. Apart from the evaluation, we accelerate the calculation of densely sampled SIFT and SURF, accelerate nearest neighbor assignment, and improve accuracy of the Histogram Intersection kernel. We conclude by discussing whether further acceleration of the Bag-of-Words pipeline is possible. Our results lead to a 7-fold speed increase without accuracy loss, and a 70-fold speed increase with 3% accuracy loss. The latter system does classification in real-time, which opens up new applications for automatic concept classification.

The particularity of our approach lies in a pre-classification of instances prior to the main classifier training: i.e. we select from the training data those instances that show better discrimination with respect to class memberships. On a very challenging dataset of 900 music pieces divided among 10 music genres, the instance selection method slightly improves the music genre classification in 2.4 percentage points.

We identify two fundamental ways of performing information retrieval on the grid - as a batch job or as a distributed activity - and argue the case for the latter for reasons of efficiency. We give an analysis of the theoretic communication and computation complexity and demonstrate that bandwidth limitations provide a decisive argument to support our case. We describe further design decisions for our system architecture and give a brief comparison with other designs reported in literature.

These advances enable researchers to study driving behavior more extensively for traffic safety. However, increasing the variety and the amount of driving data complicates the simultaneous browsing of various data and finding desired data from large databases. In this study, we develop a browsing and retrieval system for driving data that provides a multi-modal data browser, query- and similarity-based retrieval functions, and a fast browsing function that skips redundant scenes. For sharing data with several users, this system can be used via networks from PCs or smartphones, This system uses a time-series active search, which has been successfully used for fast search of audio and video data, as its retrieval function algorithm. In a few seconds, this system can retrieve driving scenes that are similar to an input scene from 80,000 scenes. Retrieval performance was compared in various retrieval conditions by changing the codebook size of the vector quantization for the histogram features and a combination of driving signals. Experimental results showed that more than 97% retrieval performance was achieved for driving behaviors of left/right turns and curves using a combination of such complementary information as steering angles and lateral acceleration. We also compared the proposed method to a conventional image-based retrieval method using subjective similarity scores of driving scenes. Our proposed system retrieved similar scenes with about a 75% retrieval performance that was five points higher than a conventional image-based retrieval method. It is because image-based method is sensitive to changes of image in the area except in the region of interest for driving data retrieval.

However, despite their effectiveness, their greater processing overhead can prevent them from scaling well for enterprise level mail servers. For example, the dictionary lookups that are characteristic of this approach are limited by the memory access rate, therefore relatively insensitive to increases in CPU speed. We conduct a comprehensive study to address this scaling issue by proposing a series of acceleration techniques that speed up Bayesian filters based on approximate classifications. The core approximation technique uses hash-based lookup and lossy encoding. Lookup approximation is based on the popular Bloom filter data structure with an extension to support value retrieval. Lossy encoding is used to further compress the data structure. While these approximation methods introduce additional errors to a strict Bayesian approach, we show how the errors can be both minimized and biased toward a false negative classification. We demonstrate a 6× speedup over two well-known spam filters (bogofilter and qsf) while achieving an identical false positive rate and similar false negative rate to the original filters.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2010.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453351","Computer systems organization;approximation.;bloom filter;information systems applications;miscellaneous;performance attributes;spam","Acceleration;Approximation methods;Bayesian methods;Data structures;Dictionaries;Electronic mail;Encoding;Filters;Information retrieval;Unsolicited electronic mail","Bayes methods;data structures;pattern classification;statistical analysis;unsolicited e-mail","Bloom filter data structure;approximate classifications;dictionary lookups;enterprise level mail servers;hash based lookup;lossy encoding;statistical based Bayesian filters;statistical spam filter;value retrieval","","6","","31","","20100422","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on behavior models and allow delivery of approximate matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements. To do so, we reduce the problem of behavioral matching to a graph matching problem and adapt existing algorithms for this purpose. To validate our approach, we developed a BPEL ranking platform that allows to find in a service repository, a set of service candidates satisfying user requirements, and then, to rank these candidates using a behavioral-based similarity measure.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2010.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432151","BPEL processes ranking.;Web services;behavioral matching;services retrieval","Application software;Automata;Collaborative work;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Libraries;Ontologies;Standards publication;Vocabulary;Web services","Web services;behavioural sciences;business data processing;semantic Web","BPEL ranking Processes;behavioral matching;behavioral-based similarity measure;graph matching;inputs-outputs matching;semantic distance;service behavior;service discovery;service repository;service retrieval","","31","","50","","20100318","July-Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a feature vector is extracted using a texture window of one sec, which enables the representation of any 30 sec long music recording as a time sequence of feature vectors, thus yielding a feature matrix. Consequently, by stacking the feature matrices associated to any dataset recordings, a tensor is created, a fact which necessitates studying music genre classification using tensors. First, a novel algorithm for non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) is derived that extends the non-negative matrix factorization. Several variants of the NTF algorithm emerge by employing different cost functions from the class of Bregman divergences. Second, a novel supervised NTF classifier is proposed, which trains a basis for each class separately and employs basis orthogonalization. A variety of spectral, temporal, perceptual, energy, and pitch descriptors is extracted from 1000 recordings of the GTZAN dataset, which are distributed across 10 genre classes. The NTF classifier performance is compared against that of the multilayer perceptron and the support vector machines by applying a stratified 10-fold cross validation. A genre classification accuracy of 78.9% is reported for the NTF classifier demonstrating the superiority of the aforementioned multilinear classifier over several data matrix-based state-of-the-art classifiers.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2010.2040784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5393058","Bregman divergences;music genre classification;non-negative tensor factorization","Content based retrieval;Cost function;Data mining;Feature extraction;Informatics;Multilayer perceptrons;Music information retrieval;Stacking;Support vector machines;Tensile stress","multilayer perceptrons;multimedia communication;music;support vector machines","Bregman divergences;GTZAN dataset;multilayer perceptron;multimedia data management;music genre classification;music recordings;nonnegative tensor factorization;support vector machines","","14","","44","","20100119","Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In that respect, it is essential to understand how antenna transfer functions and real system dynamic range affect the amount of retrievable information from measurements. This paper examines the confidence level of linear system transfer functions, and practical aspects of noise floor influence on stepped frequency ground penetrating radar. Small inaccuracies in antenna equations directly reflect in Green's function errors. Degradation of the numerical signal resolution was imposed by limiting the data resolution to two-bytes. The capability of the field system to detect thin layering in building materials using numerical modeling studies has been investigated. This would lead to the assumption that the radar model is correct and the only errors are due to inaccuracies in the data and the finite precision determination of the system's linear transfer functions. Systematic errors characterization is partially possible, limiting uncertainty in the data. A link seems to exist between the data precision and the possibility of information extrapolation for different settings.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4605-6; POD:978-1-4244-4604-9","10.1109/ICGPR.2010.5550208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5550208","EM properties of materials;GPR;Green's function;non-destructive testing;transfer functions accuracy","Antenna measurements;Dynamic range;Ground penetrating radar;Information retrieval;Linear systems;Noise level;Nondestructive testing;Signal resolution;Transfer functions;Uncertainty","Green's function methods;building materials;ground penetrating radar;nondestructive testing;radar signal processing;signal resolution;transfer functions","Green's function errors;antenna equations;antenna transfer functions;building material thin layering detection;data resolution;finite precision determination;linear system transfer functions;noise floor;nondestructive testing;numerical modeling;numerical signal resolution degradation;stepped frequency ground penetrating radar;systematic error characterization","","1","","14","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Starting from the fundamental assumption that similarity of context implies similarity of meaning, relevant Web documents are downloaded via a Web search engine and the contextual information of words of interest is compared (context-based similarity metrics). The proposed algorithms work automatically, do not require any human-annotated knowledge resources, e.g., ontologies, and can be generalized and applied to different languages. Context-based metrics are evaluated both on the Charles-Miller data set and on a medical term data set. It is shown that context-based similarity metrics significantly outperform co-occurrence-based metrics, in terms of correlation with human judgment, for both tasks. In addition, the proposed unsupervised context-based similarity computation algorithms are shown to be competitive with the state-of-the-art supervised semantic similarity algorithms that employ language-specific knowledge resources. Specifically, context-based metrics achieve correlation scores of up to 0.88 and 0.74 for the Charles-Miller and medical data sets, respectively. The effect of stop word filtering is also investigated for word and term similarity computation. Finally, the performance of context-based term similarity metrics is evaluated as a function of the number of Web documents used and for various feature weighting schemes.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5291692","Natural language processing;Web search;knowledge acquisition.;ontologies;semantic similarity","Filtering;Humans;Information retrieval;Knowledge acquisition;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Ontologies;Search engines;Speech processing;Web search","Internet;document handling;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines;software metrics","Charles-Miller data set;Web documents;Web search engine;Web-based metrics;co-occurrence-based metrics;context-based metrics;context-based similarity metrics;knowledge acquisition;language-specific knowledge resources;medical term data set;ontologies;stop word filtering;unsupervised context-based similarity computation algorithms","","26","1","42","","20091023","Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Unlike the conventional 3-D model similarity retrieval approach, the query model and the models obtained by 3-D model hybrid associative retrieval have the following properties: They belong to different model classes and have different shape characteristics in general but are semantically related and preassembled in a certain associative group. For instance, given a furniture associative group { desk, chair, bed}, we may probably like to use a desk as a query model to search for a list of matching models, which belong to the chair or bed class. We consider the following possibilities: 1) there can be more than two classes in an association group and 2) different association groups might have different numbers of classes. The hybrid associative retrieval is performed in two stages: 1) to establish the relationship between different 3-D model categories with semantic associations, we propose three approaches based on neural network learning and 2) to address the aforementioned two conditions, we use a cyclic-shift scheme to partition different associative groups into two-class pairwise associative groups and then adopt two different strategies to combine the final retrieval results. Experiments by using different data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework on the new hybrid associative retrieval task.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2043671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438776","3-D model retrieval;Association;nearest neighbor;neural network","Application software;Biological system modeling;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Design automation;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Shape measurement;Strontium","associative processing;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;solid modelling","cyclic-shift scheme;hybrid 3D model associative retrieval;matching model;neural network learning;query model;three-dimensional model;two-class pairwise associative group","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Data Mining;Database Management Systems;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiology Information Systems","2","","37","","20100325","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

That it can handle multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making problems in a useful manner that allows generalized fuzzy numbers or crisp values between zero and one to represent the evaluating values of criteria and can avoid some drawbacks present some existing algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7681-7; POD:978-1-4244-7679-4","10.1109/ICEIE.2010.5559802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559802","Generalized Fuzzy Numbers Similarity Measure;Geometric-Mean Averaging;Prioritized Information Fusion Algorithm","Bismuth;Correlation;Decision making;Electronic mail;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Risk analysis","decision making;fuzzy set theory;sensor fusion","GMA operators;decision-making problems;fuzzy number similarity measurement;information fusion algorithm","","0","","20","","","1-3 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
