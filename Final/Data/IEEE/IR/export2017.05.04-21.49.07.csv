To overcome this, we proposed a novel advanced remote sensing information processing system knowledge-driven information mining (KIM). KIM is based on human-centered concepts (HCCs), which implements new features and functions allowing improved feature extraction, search on a semantic level, the availability of collected knowledge, interactive knowledge discovery, and new visual user interfaces.

First, we use a few coefficients in the low frequency region of DCT block as the basis to represent spatial features. Second, we heuristically determine a suitable quantization step-size for visual features to better tolerate spatial variations of similar video clips and propose a paired quantizer method. Third, we incorporate the compactness and/or continuity of matched common sub-sequences in the LCS measure to better reflect temporal characteristics of video. The performance of the proposed algorithm shows an improvement of 63.5% in terms of MAP (mean average precision) as compared to an existing algorithm.

Researchers have previously addressed the issue of finding the key for symbolically encoded music (MIDI); however, very little work has been done on key detection for acoustic music. In this paper, we present a method for estimating the root of diatonic scale and the key directly from acoustic signals (waveform) of popular and classical music. We propose a method to extract pitch profile features from the audio signal, which characterizes the tone distribution in the music. The diatonic scale root and key are estimated based on the extracted pitch profile by using a tone clustering algorithm and utilizing the tone structure of keys. Experiments on 72 music pieces have been conducted to evaluate the proposed techniques.

This synthesized HMM can then be applied to any audio stream as a parser to detect the most likely theme segment. We overcome the problem of a short duration being used to train a theme HMM, by using the MAP rule with the background model as a prior model.

Two of the algorithms use global information at the base station (or sink), while the third uses only local information. Through simulations, we observe that the localized algorithm outperforms the two global algorithms in terms of communication cost, corresponding energy and latency. In addition, we also gain a deeper insight into the performance tradeoff for algorithms in sensor network.

First, for each candidate word in the vocabulary and each unknown handwritten word image, we search for the location, orientation, and scale of every character of the candidate word; we use a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD) to robustly locate the character's skeleton in the skeletons of the handwritten word image. Second, we verify words by creating a template image according to the result of character analysis, and by matching this template image to the skeleton of the handwritten word using the MHD. Results for recognition of handwritten words from real videos are shown (greater than 70% accuracy with 100 words).

However, the lack of efficient indexing is still a major barrier to effective information retrieval on the Web. This paper presents the design of a technique for content-based indexing and retrieval of relevant documents from a large collection of documents such as the Internet. The technique aims at improving the quality of retrieval by capturing the semantics of the documents. It introduces a thematic relationship between parts of text using a linguistics theory called rhetorical structure theory (RST) based on cue phrases to determine the set of rhetorical relations. Once these structures are determined, they can be saved into a database. We can then query that collection using not only keywords, as traditional information retrieval systems, but also rhetorical relations. The indexing and retrieval technique described in this paper is under development and initial results on a small number of documents have been very successful.","","POD:0-7803-8625-6","10.1109/ITRE.2004.1393667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1393667","","Content based retrieval;Databases;Frequency;Indexing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Internet;Maintenance;Natural language processing;Search engines","Internet;computational linguistics;content-based retrieval;document handling;indexing;information retrieval systems;linguistics;natural languages","Internet;Web documents;World Wide Web;content-based indexing;content-based retrieval;cue phrases;document indexing;document semantics;information retrieval systems;linguistics theory;rhetorical relations;rhetorical structure theory;thematic relationship","","3","1","19","","","28 June-1 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most well-known techniques for solving this problem suffer from the ""curse of dimensionality"" that means the performance of the system scales poorly with increased dimensionality of the underlying data. The refined algorithms typically achieve a query time that is logarithmic in the quantity of points and exponential in the number of dimensions. However, once the number of dimension exceeds 15, searching in k-d trees or related structures involves the examination of a large fraction of the search space, thereby performing no better than exhaustive search.

Latent semantic indexing (LSI) was successfully introduced to efficiently index text documents. We propose to adapt this technique to efficiently represent the visual content of video shots for semantic content detection. Although we restrict our approach to visual features, it can be extended with minor changes to audio and motion features to build a multi-modal system. The semantic content is then detected thanks to two classifiers: k-nearest neighbors and neural network classifiers.

We introduce an adaptive and fault-tolerant method for gateway assignment in sensor networks. Our approach is fully distributed and achieves the following objectives: (i) it allows surviving gateways to recover for other failed gateways; (ii) it distributes energy usage and traffic load between several gateway nodes within the sensor network. Each gateway adaptively controls its region of influence based on local conditions such as remaining energy level and traffic load. Our methodology was evaluated via simulation using a network model containing 400 sensor nodes with virtual targets. The simulation results indicate that our scheme is robust to gateway failures.

PIDIS is a non-persistent, best-effort reliability improvement service that exploits the mechanism of swarm intelligence to make intelligent decisions about whence to fetch the lost packets. PIDIS employs the beneficial aspects of probabilistic routing and adapts well to mobility. PIDIS achieves probabilistic reliability and, unlike other gossip-based schemes, does not need to maintain information about group members from which lost packets are retrieved. Further PIDIS does not rely on any underlying routing protocol or primitive, and can be incorporated into any (unreliable) ad hoc multicast routing protocol. Lastly, because PIDIS is non-persistent, it does not incur any overhead when there is no lost message to be recovered. We incorporated PIDIS into ODMRP, and compared it against anonymous gossip (AG) implemented over ODMRP, and ODMRP. Our simulation results show that PIDIS+ODMRP in most cases, is more efficient and performs better than AG+ODMRP and ODMRP in terms of packet delivery, end-to-end delay and MAC layer overheads. We attribute the better performance and lower MAC overheads of PIDIS+ODMRP to the efficient gossiping made possible by using swarm intelligence techniques.","","POD:0-7803-8815-1","10.1109/MAHSS.2004.1392215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392215","","Ad hoc networks;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Delay;Information retrieval;Maintenance;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Multicast protocols;Routing protocols","access protocols;ad hoc networks;delays;mobile radio;multicast protocols;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability","MAC layer overheads;PIDIS+ODMRP;best-effort improvement service;end-to-end delay;gossip-based schemes;gossiping;mobile ad hoc networks;multicast networks;nonpersistent improvement service;performance;probabilistic reliability;probabilistic routing;protocol-independent packet delivery improvement service;reliability improvement service;swarm intelligence","","0","","10","","","25-27 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scaleable dynamic programming (scaleable-DP) can match and evaluate the same class of motions such as walking, running, stepping and their timescale parameters. This approach is adaptable for differences in individuals, such as body sizes and timing of the stop-frames. On the blending pipeline, we first generate the keyframes according to the matching result. The keyframes are generated by considering the spatial and temporal difference of individual motions.

Based on the statistical properties of the feature space we define a structure, called α-semantics graph, to discover the hidden semantic relationships among the semantic repositories embodied in the image database. With the α-semantics graph, each semantic repository is modeled as a unique fuzzy set to explicitly address the semantic uncertainty and the semantic overlap existing among the repositories in the feature space.

The techniques can be applied directly to a digitized performance (i.e., a soundfile) and do not require a musical score or a MIDI transcription. In both cases, the raw audio is first processed into a collection of ""rhythm tracks"" which represent the time evolution of various low-level features. The Bayesian approach chooses a set of parameters that represent the beat by modeling the rhythm tracks as a concatenation of random variables with a patterned structure of variances. The output of the estimator is a trio of parameters that represent the interval between beats, its change (derivative), and the position of the starting beat. Recursive (and potentially real time) approximations to the method are derived using particle filters, and their behavior is investigated via simulation on a variety of musical sources. The simpler method, which performs a gradient descent over a window of beats, tends to converge more slowly and to undulate about the desired answer. Several examples are presented that highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches.","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/TSA.2004.841053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1395972","Musical rhythm;particle filters;rhythmic analysis;spectral center;spectral dispersion;tempo tracking","Application software;Bayesian methods;Cognition;Humans;Information retrieval;Particle filters;Particle tracking;Random variables;Rhythm;Spectral analysis","Bayes methods;audio signal processing;computational complexity;filtering theory;gradient methods;music;recursive estimation;tracking","Bayesian decision framework;MIDI transcription;low-level audio feature;musical performance beat tracking;musical score;particle filter;random variable concatenation;recursive approximation;rhythm track","","27","1","38","","","March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key of the major scale (""do"") is estimated using music scale models. Due to the diversity of melody types, models for both diatonic and pentatonic scales are employed to avoid the possible key ambiguity for folk songs. The decision of the key of a melody is based on the scale estimation results for aggregating music notes, so that the method can work for both short and long melodies.

First, GPSR is designed under the assumption of symmetric links (i.e., bidirectional reachability) which is not realistic for many practical sensor networks. Second, in sensor networks, packet destinations are often marked with locations instead of identifiers like IP address and therefore packets are routed to the home node which is the node geographically closest to the destined location. GPSR is not efficient in identifying the home node when the target location is outside the exterior perimeter of the sensor network. Third, due to the dynamic nature of sensor networks, maintaining data consistency, that is, data retrieved from the home node for a location should be consistent with the data sent to the same location, becomes a challenge when home nodes change. We propose on-demand GPSR (OD-GPSR), a data driven geographical routing protocol customized for sensor networks with solutions to the above three problems.

The MTI is a 15-band multispectral research and technology development satellite that provides high spatial resolution imagery of the earth's surface from a polar orbit. It has a capability for pixel-by-pixel retrieval of total atmospheric water vapor during the day. The surface temperature retrieval process uses atmospheric profiles of temperature and water vapor from numerical weather prediction data assimilation products available for the globe. The profiles of water vapor are scaled using the retrieved pixel-by-pixel water vapor during the day to improve atmospheric compensation within the image. The algorithm requires specification of a maximum emissivity or the acceptance of a default: here the maximum band emissivity is known and specified. The results of the algorithm are evaluated at three sites with a high degree of surface uniformity and known spectral emissivity: Lake Tahoe, NV/CA, Ivanpah Playa, NV/CA, and the Mauna Loa caldera, HI. At the first two sites, coincident measurements of surface temperature and emissivity are available. At Mauna Loa, surface emissivity measurements are available, but surface temperature measurements are not. Therefore, at Mauna Loa, the surface emissivity estimates derived from the surface temperature retrieval are compared with emissivity measurements. The results show that the surface temperature retrievals had a root mean square (RMS) difference with surface measurements of 0.6 K during the day and 1.0 K at night. This indicates, albeit weakly, that the use of pixel-by-pixel water vapor retrieved by the satellite improves the overall surface temperature retrievals. At Ivanpah Playa, all the data are daytime, and the surface temperature retrievals have an RMS difference with the in situ measurements of 0.8 K. The Mauna Loa emissivities derived from the surface temperature retrieval agreed excellently with in situ emissivity measurements. The approach taken to perform surface temperature retrieval, used operationally within the MTI research and development program, is seen to be simple and effective.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.840642","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1396339","","Data assimilation;Earth;Extraterrestrial measurements;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Temperature measurement;Testing;Weather forecasting","artificial satellites;atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;data assimilation;infrared imaging;land surface temperature;microwave measurement;remote sensing","Ivanpah Playa;Lake Tahoe;Mauna Loa caldera;Multispectral Thermal Imager;US Department of Energy;USA;artificial satellite;atmospheric temperature;atmospheric water vapor;high spatial resolution imagery;land surface temperature;numerical weather prediction data assimilation;remote sensing;surface emissivity;surface temperature retrieval algorithm;thermal infrared","","9","","31","","","March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This concept is even more appropriate to multimedia repositories where large files must be processed as a result of each retrieval operation. Two problems with multimedia databases are that they require a large volume of disk storage and processing power and that it is generally difficult to query video content or optimise the retrieval process. In the EGTV project, both of these issues are addressed. In the first case, the data server is distributed across multiple autonomous sites where users are permitted to modify schemas and in some cases the data model. In the second case, a mechanism for storing behaviour has been devised which allows functions such as retrieve_frame, retrieve_segment and retrieve_context to be implemented and stored at individual servers. This provides selective retrieval and thus, large data items can be processed locally to filter unwanted data before the transfer process must begin. In this way, storage of operations forms the basis for optimisation of retrieval content and volumes.","1550-5502;15505502","POD:0-7695-2164-9","10.1109/MMMC.2005.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386004","","Content based retrieval;Data models;Distributed computing;Filters;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Object oriented modeling;Software libraries;Streaming media","","","","0","","14","","","12-14 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These tools either return too much useless material or miss important material. Even when such tools find useful information, the data is still in a text form that makes it difficult to build displays or diagrams. Employing the data in data mining or standard database operations, such as sorting and counting, can also be difficult. An emerging technology called information extraction (IE) is beginning to change all that, and you might already be using some very basic IE tools without even knowing it. Companies are increasingly applying IE behind the scenes to improve information and knowledge management applications such as text search, text categorization, data mining, and visualization (Rao, 2003). IE has also begun playing a key role in fields such as national security, law enforcement, insurance, and biomedical research, which have highly critical information and knowledge needs. In these fields, IE's powerful capabilities arc necessary to save lives or substantial investments of time and money. IE views language up close, considering grammar and vocabulary, and tries to determine the details of ""who did what to whom"" from a piece of text. In its most in-depth applications, IE is domain focused; it does not try to define all the events or relationships present in a piece of text, but focuses only on items of particular interest to the user organization.","1520-9202;15209202","","10.1109/MITP.2004.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1390870","","Crawlers;Data mining;Databases;Displays;Humans;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Layout;Search engines;Sorting","data mining;information management;information retrieval;knowledge management;natural languages","data mining;information extraction;information management;information retrieval;knowledge management;natural language processing","","2","","1","","","Nov.-Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, each single concept model is constructed independently. In the second step, ontology-based concept learning improves the accuracy of the individual concept by considering the possible influence relations between concepts based on a predefined ontology hierarchy. The advantage of ontology learning is that its influence path is based on an ontology hierarchy, which has real semantic meanings. Besides semantics, it also considers the data correlation to decide the exact influence assigned to each path, which makes the influence more flexible according to data distribution.

Biased discriminant analysis (BDA) has been proposed to select features during relevance feedback iterations. However, to solve the BDA, we often encounter the matrix singular problem. Motivated by the direct method and null-space method successfully used in the Fisher linear discriminant analysis for face recognition, we generalize them into the Hilbert space for BDA. Because the direct method and the null-space method may lose some discriminant information, we propose a new full-space method to contain all discriminant information.

As users query requirement may be ambiguous and subjective sometimes in content-based image retrieval, the query results are uncertain to some extent; therefore, retrieval process can be treated as a grey system, and the query vectors and the weight values of image features as the grey numbers. So, it is a good approach for us to develop a relevance feedback technique for content-based image retrieval using the GRA method in grey system theory. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance feedback technique for content-based image retrieval using the GRA method in the grey system theory. The key idea of the proposed approach is the grey relational analysis of the feature distributions of images the user has judged relevant, in order to understand what features have been taken into account (and to what extent) by the user in formulating this judgment, so that we can accentuate the influence of these features in the overall evaluation of image similarity. The proposed method, which allows the user to retrieve the image database and progressively refine systems response to the query by indicating the degree of relevance of retrieved images, dynamically updates the query vectors and the weights for similarity measure in order to accurately represent the users particular information needs. Experimental results show that the proposed approach captures the users information needs more precisely.","1550-5502;15505502","POD:0-7695-2164-9","10.1109/MMMC.2005.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386006","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Statistical analysis;Uncertainty;Weight measurement","","","","1","","12","","","12-14 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However there are music pieces that have overall uniform perceived tempo, but have some small parts (segments) with quite different tempo from other parts. The PTE may not work well for this type of music pieces if the energy level in these small segments is significantly high.

A top-down clustering procedure is applied to group these segments into musical events with similar characteristics. A Bayesian information criterion is then used to regularize the complexity of the model structure.

We propose an integration and organization system based on a query relaxation approach for cross-media meta-search engines. Frequently, the parameters for information retrieval are too specific or exacting to generate any relevant sites. However, by gradually relaxing the search terms used for information retrieval, we can solve this problem while narrowing the search to sites that are most relevant to the subject being researched.

"Recognition of Enhanced Images","Khanh Vu; K. A. Hua; N. Hiransakolwong; S. Nilpanich","University of Central Florida","11th International Multimedia Modelling Conference","20050214","2005","","","239","246","Image enhancement such as adjusting brightness and contrast is central to improving human visualization of images content. Images in desired enhanced quality facilitate analysis, interpretation, classification, information exchange, indexing and retrieval. The adjustment process, guided by diverse enhancement objectives and subjective human judgment, often produces various versions of the same image. Despite the preservation of content under these operations, enhanced images are treated as new in most existing techniques via their widely different features. This leads to difficulties in recognition and retrieval of images across application domains and user interest. To allow unrestricted enhancement flexibility, accurate identification of images and their enhanced versions is therefore essential. In this paper, we introduce a measure that theoretically guarantees the identification of all enhanced images originated from one. In our approach, images are represented by points in multidimensional intensity-based space. We show that points representing images of the same content are confined in a well-defined area that can be identified by a so-devised formula. We evaluated our technique on large sets of images from various categories, including medical, satellite, texture, color images and scanned documents. The proposed measure yields an actual recognition rate approaching 100% in all image categories, outperforming other well-known techniques by a wide margin. Our analysis at the same time can serve as a basis for determining the minimum criterion a similarity measure should satisfy. We discuss also how to apply the formula as a similarity measure in existing systems to support general image retrieval.","1550-5502;15505502","POD:0-7695-2164-9","10.1109/MMMC.2005.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385997","","Brightness;Humans;Image analysis;Image enhancement;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Visualization","","","","1","","24","","","12-14 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the original Gabor texture features are rotation variant. Recently, Zhang et al proposed rotation normalization using circular shift. They have shown the proposed rotation normalization is effective through some examples, but did not comprehensively study its performance. The purpose of this paper is to study the performance of the rotation normalization on a good size texture database. Our experimental results show that the proposed rotation normalization is effective in retrieving rotated textures and has some adverse effect on retrieving non-rotated texture.","1550-5502;15505502","POD:0-7695-2164-9","10.1109/MMMC.2005.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385987","","Australia;Discrete wavelet transforms;Distance measurement;Gabor filters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information technology;Spatial databases;Wavelet transforms","","CBIR;Gabor filter;texture and rotation invariance","","3","","14","","","12-14 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way, the proposed method can greatly reduce the size of indexes while theoretically guaranteeing the same accuracy as exhaustive matching.","","POD:0-7803-8603-5","10.1109/ICME.2004.1394629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1394629","","Broadband communication;Discrete cosine transforms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Pixel;Shape;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;indexing","CBIR;content-based image retrieval;exhaustive matching;image portion extraction;index size reduction;partial similarities;predefined distance measure;query image;retrieval accuracy;similarity-based partial image retrieval","","1","","18","","","27-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, conventional search engines, which are based on a centralized architecture, are not suited for intranet information retrieval because intranet information is frequently updated. Centralized search engines take a long time to collect Web pages by robots. So, we have developed a distributed search engine, the cooperative search engine (CSE), to retrieve fresh information. In CSE, a local search engine located in each Web server makes an index of local pages. And, a meta search server integrates these local search engines to realize a global search engine. CSE takes a few minutes to update the index because each local search engine scans all files in its own disk. In this paper, we propose a notification mechanism using a change aware distributed file system.

It is applied to grasp the network topology in a sensor network or an ad-hoc network, or to retrieve content information by mobile agent systems. A flooding algorithm has the advantages of robustness and optimality by parallel processing of messages. However, the flooding mechanism has a fundamental disadvantage: it increases the processing time until the flooding control is finished and causes congestion in the network. We propose and evaluate methods for producing a more efficient flooding algorithm by adopting the growth processes of primitive creatures, such as molds or microbes, to produce a simple flooding control mechanism.","","POD:0-7695-2262-9","10.1109/SAINT.2005.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386128","","Ad hoc networks;All-optical networks;Electronic mail;Floods;Information retrieval;Information science;Mobile agents;Network topology;Parallel processing;Robustness","computer network reliability;message passing;mobile agents;parallel processing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","ad-hoc network;biotic growth;content information retrieval;flooding algorithm;flooding control methods;massage parallel processing;mobile agent systems;network congestion control;network topology;sensor network","","0","","9","","","31 Jan.-4 Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the costs of essay grading, methods to automate the assessment process have been developed. Approaches based on surface features and content have been introduced. We present a method for evaluating the content of essays based on latent semantic analysis (LSA), which was originally developed for information retrieval and has successfully been applied for assessment of essays in several applications. We use LSA to compare the conceptual similarity between the essays and selected text passages from the course material covering the essay assignment-specific subject matter.

The main characteristic of the proposed approach is that the segmentation is performed specifically for each individual song using a process we call bootstrapping. In bootstrapping, a small random sampling of the song is annotated by the user. This annotation is used to learn the song-specific voice characteristics and the trained classifier is subsequently used to classify and segment the whole song. We present experimental results on a collection of pieces with jazz singers that show the potential of this approach and compare it with the traditional approach of using multiple songs for training. It is our belief that the idea of song-specific bootstrapping is applicable to other types of music and audio computer-supported annotation.","","POD:0-7803-8603-5","10.1109/ICME.2004.1394662","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1394662","","Character recognition;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Instruments;Music information retrieval;Sampling methods;Signal processing;Speech analysis;Speech recognition","audio signal processing;classification;feature extraction;music","computer-supported annotation;jazz singers;semi-automatic singing voice extraction;singing voice identification;singing voice structure;song segmentation;song-specific bootstrapping;song-specific voice characteristics;trained classifier","","7","","13","","","27-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The feature set for discrimination is presented and ranked according to a linear discriminant analysis. For the automatic segmentation within an input signal stream, a further feature set is used for the discrimination of signal and noise. A corpus for training and evaluation comprising speech and monophonic singing data of nine performers is described in detail. The data has been labeled according to the judgment of another set of probands.

By using this new indexing structure, the number of signatures to be examined per query is reduced significantly.

The existing discriminant analysis is implemented either in a regular way, such as MDA (multiple discriminant analysis), or in a biased way, such as biased discriminant analysis (BDA). A rich set of parameterized discriminant analysis is proposed as an alternative to the regular MDA and BDA when taking regularization into account to avoid the singularity of the scatter matrices. Extensive experiments are carried out for performance evaluation and the results show the superior performance of the parameterized discriminant analysis over regular MDA and BDA for both linear and nonlinear settings.","","POD:0-7803-8603-5","10.1109/ICME.2004.1394111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1394111","","Content based retrieval;Image analysis;Image classification;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kernel;Performance analysis;Supervised learning;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;image classification;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;statistical analysis","biased discriminant analysis;content-based image retrieval;content-based retrieval;dimensionality;image classification;image data distribution multi-modality;kernel discriminant analysis;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;nonlinear discriminant analysis;parameterized discriminant analysis;regularization;scatter matrix singularity;small sample problem;statistical learning problem","","4","","9","","","27-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
