"Hierarchical matching for retrieval of hand-drawn sketches","Wing Ho Leung; Tsuhan Chen","Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Multimedia and Expo, 2003. ICME '03. Proceedings. 2003 International Conference on","20030818","2003","2","","II","29-32 vol.2","As pen-based devices become more popular, it has motivated several novel research issues in the area of pen computing. One interesting and practical problem is the storage and retrieval of hand-drawn sketches. A sketch can consist of handwritten notes, symbols, free-form hand-drawings, annotations on a document, and others. It is very useful to store the sketches in a database and then retrieve them later. In our prior work, we proposed a method for hand-drawn sketch retrieval by performing stroke-by-stroke matching and by considering the spatial relationship between them. In this paper, we propose a method to simplify a sketch and perform matching in a hierarchical manner. With this approach, a shaded region or a region of complex strokes can be detected automatically and represented as a single hyper-stroke. In the matching stage, the similarity is computed by combining the similarity scores across the feature spaces at each level and the similarity of the stroke hierarchies. A sketch may be better represented by exploiting the structural relationship between the strokes. In addition, as a general rule to the hierarchical approach, it has the advantage of reduced computation thus the retrieval process would speed up.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1221545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221545","","Cascading style sheets;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image converters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;image matching;image retrieval","hand-drawn sketch retrieval;hand-drawn sketch storage;hierarchical sketch matching;pen computing","","3","","17","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main problem hindering such efforts so far has been scalability, with limits of the frequently used three-character representation for melodic contour becoming apparent even at relatively small database sizes. Extending the contour representation to 24 semi-tone resolutions would go a long way towards solving such problems, but applying current string matching methods to a 24 character alphabet would prove difficult at best, and human errors would be far more prevalent. Here we show that the vast majority of errors at this resolution, although more numerous, are quite predictable using current methods of probabilistic modeling. This is evidence which we hope opens the door to more intelligent forms of note matching.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1221544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221544","","Costs;Databases;Frequency;Humans;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Music;Rhythm;Scalability;Standards development","audio databases;music","contour representation;intelligent string matching;melodic contour;musical database;note matching;query-by-humming systems;three-character representation","","1","2","18","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the growing amount of online and offline available music and a broadening user spectrum more efficient query methods are needed. We believe that only a parallel multimodal combination of different input modalities forms the most intuitive way to access desired media for any user. In this paper we introduce a query by humming, speaking, writing, and typing. The strengths of each modality are combined in a synergetic manner by a soft decision fusion. Songs can be referenced by their according melody, artist, title or other specific information. Further more the recognition of the actual user's emotion and external contextual knowledge helps to build an expectance of the intended song at a time. This constrains the hypothesis sphere of possible songs and leads to a more robust recognition or even a suggestive query. A combination of artificial neural networks, hidden Markov models and dynamic time warping integrated in a Bayesian belief network framework build the mathematical background of the chosen hybrid architecture. We address the implementation of a working system and results achieved by the introduced methods.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1220853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220853","","Bayesian methods;Context;Databases;Emotion recognition;Hidden Markov models;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Probability;Robustness;Writing","audio databases;belief networks;hidden Markov models;music;neural nets;query formulation;query processing","Bayesian belief network framework;artificial neural networks;contextual knowledge;dynamic time warping;hidden Markov models;hybrid music retrieval system;multimodal queries;music database;query methods;soft decision fusion;user emotion recognition","","4","","10","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method operates on a roughly structured ASCII file, produced by OCR. Because of the heterogeneity of the reference structure, the method acts in a bottom-up way, without an a priori model, gathering structural elements from basic tags to sub-fields and fields. Significant tags are first grouped in homogeneous classes according to their grammar categories and then reduced in canonical forms corresponding to record fields: ""authors"", ""title"", ""conference name"", ""date"", etc. Non labelled tokens are integrated in one or another field by either applying PoS correction rules or using a structure model generated from well-detected records. The designed prototype operates with a great satisfaction on different record layouts and character recognition qualities. Without manual intervention, 96.6% words are correctly attributed, and about 75.9% references are completely segmented from 2500 references.","","POD:0-7695-1960-1","10.1109/ICDAR.2003.1227694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227694","","Character recognition;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Instruments;Intersymbol interference;Optical character recognition software;Prototypes;Tagging;Turning","bibliographic systems;grammars;image segmentation;text analysis","ASCII file;OCR;PoS;bibliographic references;canonical forms;character recognition;conference name;correction rules;fields contextual tagging;grammar categories;homogeneous classes;part-of-speech tagging;prototype design;record fields;scientific publications;segmentation method;structural elements;text coding","","6","2","6","","","3-6 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show how hyperonymy diverges from is-a and what measures are more accurate for hyperonymy representation.

Based on Lyapunov stability theory, stability analysis and controller design approaches for continuous-time T-S fuzzy systems are discussed in this paper. For the fuzzy feedback control systems via PDC design techniques, three mutually complementary sufficient criteria and controller design methods for global asymptotic stability are presented. Two of the three proposed controller design methods are based on LMI problems that can be solved very efficiently in practice by some powerful commercial computer software tools. And all of the controller design methods deduced from the three mutually complementary stability criteria respectively expand the fields of closed-loop stable controller design for fuzzy systems.

To do so, a criterion for a ""good"" buddy image is proposed. Based on such criterion, an algorithm is designed to maximize the space spanned by the selected buddy images. Since the proposed approach requires only a constant storage space for each image, it has good scalability for a large size of image database.

Detailed histological characteristics of small HCC and precursor lesions in histological diagnosis are needed to refine the contribution of histopathology to the management of patients with HCC. In this context a possible approach regards the implementation of knowledge extraction process based on a labeled data set of cases. Our data set is made of 212 cases, including early malignant nodules, benign ones, and some uncertain cases. A set of 11 histopathological and morphological features described each case. We applied statistical and machine learning algorithms both for feature selection and classification of nodules. In particular, we implemented an ensemble of classifiers in a straightforward way. Moreover, this ensemble provides physicians with a rough level of confidence of the proposed diagnoses, taking into account the importance of the interpretability of automated output. Feature selection approach was validated; actually a subset of four histological features performed at least as the whole set of features in the classification of the malignant and benign nodules.

To be effective, a relevance feedback approach must be able to efficiently capture the user's query concept from a very limited number of training samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel adaptive classification method using random forests, which is a machine learning algorithm with proven good performance on many traditional classification problems. With random forests, our method reduces the relevance feedback to a two-class classification problem and classifies database objects as relevant or irrelevant. From the relevant object set, our approach returns the top k nearest neighbors of the query to the user. Briefly speaking, our relevance feedback method has the following dominant features. First, our method is able to address the multimodal distribution of relevant points, because it trains a nonparametric and nonlinear classifier, i.e., random forests, for relevance feedback. Second, it does not overfit training data because it uses an ensemble of tree classifiers to classify multimedia objects. Experiments on a Corel image set (with 31,438 images) show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art relevance feedback approaches.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1221028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221028","","Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;State feedback;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","classification;content-based retrieval;multimedia systems;relevance feedback","adaptive classification method;content-based multimedia retrieval systems;machine learning algorithm;relevance feedback approach","","1","","11","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This scheme resorts to an off-line analysis on the video frame sizes and server properties for figuring out the necessary buffer space and network bandwidth. The server platform of particular interest obeys a cycle-based data-block retrieval discipline, which is an essential technique to reduce the disk seek time for leveraging the disk throughput for supporting a large number of concurrent video accesses. Such a discipline is taken into account here to guarantee smooth delivery of variable-bit-rate videos. In run-time a server-driven control model is in use, where a server performs the primary flow control task, without relying on any feedback from clients.

The spontaneous dynamics of the network are shown to increase in complexity by increasing the size of the learning set. The type of chaos exploited to code these inputs is related with the frustrated chaos described in previous papers. When, following a brute-force but robust learning of the inputs, the network is presented with a series of unlearned ambiguous input, experimental results show how chaotic regimes become the natural response of the network, reflecting in its frustrated dynamics the inherent ambiguity of the input. A live demonstration can be shown where the rhythms associated with the dynamics can be heard.

On the other hand complication also arises in determining the subject textual content from its background region (i.e. thresholding) before the actual text extraction process can begin. Differing from the usual sequence of processes where document images are binarized before the actual text extraction, this paper proposes a new method by first segmenting individual subject areas with the help of an irregular pyramid to be followed by the binarization process. This permits the focus of attention only on the appropriate subject areas for the binarization process before text recognition. Our method overcomes the difficulty in global binarization to find a single value to fit all. It also avoids the common problem in most local thresholding technique of finding a suitable window size.

The performance of N-grams in the transcription was evaluated using a database of realistic drum sequences from different genres and yielded a performance increase of 7.6 % compared to a the use of only prior (unigram) probabilities with the acoustic model.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1221722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221722","","Automatic control;Databases;Instruments;Lighting control;Music information retrieval;Periodic structures;Rhythm;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Support vector machines","Gaussian processes;acoustic signal processing;musical acoustics;musical instruments;support vector machines","Gaussian mixture;acoustic signal;polyphonic drum sequences;signal analysis;support vector machine","","6","1","9","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a system for automatic singer identification is developed which recognizes the singer of a song by analyzing the music signal. Meanwhile, songs which are similar in terms of singer's voice are clustered. The proposed scheme follows the framework of common speaker identification systems, but special efforts are made to distinguish the singing voice from instrumental sounds in a song. A statistical model is trained for each singer's voice with typical song(s) of the singer. Then, for a song to be identified, the starting point of singing voice is detected and a portion of the song is excerpted from that point. Audio features are extracted and matched with singers' voice models in the database. The song is assigned to the model having the best match. Promising results are obtained on a small set of samples, and accuracy rates of around 80% are achieved.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1220847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220847","","Audio databases;Feature extraction;Instruments;Loudspeakers;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Organizing;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Spatial databases","audio databases;audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval;speaker recognition;statistical analysis","audio feature extraction;automatic singer identification;common speaker identification systems;music database;music signal;statistical model","","18","","6","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The task arose from experiments performed at the TREC-2002 video retrieval benchmark: 'cartoons' are returned unexpectedly at high ranks even if the query gave only 'photographic' image examples. Distinguishing between the two genres has proved difficult because of their large intra-class variation. In addition to image metrics used in prior cartoon-classification work, we introduce novel metrics like ones based on the pattern spectrum of parabolic size distributions derived from parabolic granulometries and the complexity of the image signal approximated by its compression ratio. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature set for classification (using support vector machines) on a large set of keyframes from the TREC-2002 video track collection and a set of Web images. The paper reports the identification error rates against the number of images used as training set.

RF provides a way to obtain the subjectivity of the user's high-level visual concepts, and MIL enables the automatic learning of the user's high-level concepts. The user interacts with the CBIR system by relevance feedback in a way that the extent to which the image samples retrieved by the system are relevant to the user's intention is labeled.

In this paper we address the problem of content-based retrieval of 3D models. The solution we present here relies on the description of each model by means a curvature map: after an initial pre-processing of the model, differential properties of points on the surface of the 3D object are evaluated; the model surface is then warped into an ellipsoid, and is mapped onto a 2D image retaining curvature information of the original model. Matching is performed by comparing the 2D map of the query against the 2D maps of the database models.

However, these methods only perform relevance feedback on low-level image features and fail to address the images' semantic content. In this paper, we propose a relevance feedback framework to take advantage of the semantic contents of images in addition to low-level features. By forming a semantic network on top of the keyword association on the images, we are able to accurately deduce and utilize the images' semantic contents for retrieval purposes.

In this paper, we demonstrate the fundamental principles, implementation methods, performance evaluations, and experimental results from the proposed model. We present a region-based prototype image retrieval system named FuzzyImage. The system is characterized by feature vectors. First, we segment an image into regions depending on clustering similar feature vectors by fuzzy c-means. Next, a similar measurement is used to evaluate the similarity between the query image and incorporated regions. The users can select the most interesting regions from 5 sample images that pop-up, and by feedback to the system. Based on the selected individual regions of query images, the overall similarity helps filter out irrelevant images in a database after relevance feedback and enables a simple user-oriented query interface for a region-based image retrieval system. This algorithm is implemented and tested on general-purpose images. This project makes three main contributions to a region-based CBIR system. First, a region segmentation method is employed in the FuzzyImage system. Second, this system takes the user's intuition into consideration and designs a user-oriented interface to directly search the database.

An extensive log data accumulated at the download service site for a fixed period of time was used. The log data contained only information for the users' downloaded ringing tomes without evaluation data. The user set and the tone downloadable content set were not fixed and our goal was to investigate how collaborative filtering could be successfully applied to a system with such continuously changing conditions. The Jaccard's similarity coefficient was used to calculate the similarity between the users. The learning period, the recommendation period and the number of the similar users were used as condition parameters. The system quality evaluation showed that the recall increases with the increase of the learning period but decreases with the increase of the recommendation period. Optimal values for the number of the most similar users as well as for the learning and the recommendation periods were experimentally obtained.

The model included usage of the green leaf biomass volumetric density as a canopy descriptor and of cover fractions derived from unmixing Landsat Thematic Mapper image data for the three vegetation formations. The inclusion of the unmixed cover fractions improves modeling synthetic aperture radar backscatter, as it allows separation between the different radiation interaction mechanisms. The method was first assessed with reference to the reproduction of the backscatter from the vegetation formations. In the next phase, the accuracy of AAB retrievals from the backscatter data was evaluated. Results of testing the methodology in a region of climatic gradient in central Israel have shown a good correspondence between observed and predicted AAB values (R<sup>2</sup>=0.82). This indicates that the methodology developed may lay a basis for mapping important and more advanced ecological information such as primary production and contribute to better understanding of processes in Mediterranean and semiarid regions.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.813351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221813","","Backscatter;Biomass;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Merging;Production;Remote sensing;Satellites;Testing;Vegetation mapping","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image processing;radar imaging;remote sensing;remote sensing by radar;sensor fusion;synthetic aperture radar","350 to 2500 nm;IR;Israel;Landsat TM;Mediterranean;SAR;backscatter;canopy;complex canopies;complex habitat;geophysical measurement technique;green leaf biomass;herbaceous biomass;image processing;infrared;merging;model;multispectral remote sensing;optical imaging;radar image;radar remote sensing;radar scattering;sensor fusion;shrubs;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping;visible;volumetric density","","22","","44","","","July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed method is based on time-series active search, which is a quick signal search method reported earlier. To realize the BGM search, however, a novel extension is introduced. That is, the music signal is firstly decomposed into a number of small time-frequency regions, and the search is carried out for each of those components. The results of the search are then integrated based on a voting scheme to find the target music locations. Experiments show that accurate search is possible when SNR is -5 dB and that the search completes in about 8 s for a 30-m stored signal.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1220880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220880","","Laboratories;Multimedia communication;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Search methods;Speech;Streaming media;TV;Time frequency analysis;Voting","audio databases;information retrieval;music","BGM search;background music signals;fast search algorithm;long audio stream;signal components search;signal search method;target music locations;time-frequency regions;time-series active search","","0","","8","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Similarity measures are evaluated against human similarity judgements. The models are also used for artist classification to achieve 62% accuracy on a 25-artist set, and 38% on a 404-artist set (random guessing achieves 0.25%).

The feature extraction process involves a log-polar transform followed by an adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet transform. The log-polar transform converts a given image into a rotation and scale invariant but row- shifted image, which is then passed to the adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet transform to generate adaptively some subbands of rotation and scale invariant wavelet coefficients with respect to an information cost function. An energy signature is computed for each subband of these wavelet coefficients. In order to reduce feature dimensionality, only the most dominant log-polar wavelet energy signatures are selected as feature vector for image retrieval. The whole feature extraction process is quite efficient and involves only O (n·log n) complexity.

Query by humming provides a natural means for content-based retrieval from music databases, and this research provides a robust front-end for such an application. The segment of a note in the humming waveform is modeled by phone level hidden Markov models (HMM). The duration of the note segment is then labeled by a duration model. The pitch of the note is modeled by a pitch model using a Gaussian mixture model.

Such a solution could be simplified by using a centralized server that acts as a gateway between the user and repositories: the centralized server forwards the user query to federated repositories and fuses retrieved documents for presentation to the user. To perform these tasks efficiently, the centralized server should perform two main functions: resource selection and data fusion. The former is required to forward the user query only to the repositories that are candidate to contain relevant documents. The latter is used to gather all retrieved documents and conveniently arrange them for presentation to the user. In the case of image repositories, data fusion is particularly challenging owing to the difficulty to normalize document scores returned by different repositories.

In addition, these deployed devices may actually communicate with one another, facilitating capabilities such as autonomous event response. These potentially complex interactions between multiple entities - human and machine - require that knowledge of the system configuration be available to participants. Users of instrument data require information - metadata - about the sensor that generated the data. Software that coordinates and controls instruments requires access to the software interfaces of those devices. ""Manual configuration"" has been used on small-scale systems, but in a network consisting of hundreds or thousands of instruments, the configuration challenge becomes critical. We propose to address the problem through automation of the configuration process; which will be achieved at several levels. Automated configuration will simplify the system operator's task of building and maintaining the observatory network. We describe a small, low-powered information storage device that we call a ""instrument puck"". When plugged into a suitable computer (lab workstation, deployed observing node), information can be written to or read from the puck. While an instrument is being prepared for initial integration into observatory, a technician ""loads"" a puck with information necessary to configure the instrument within the observatory, and then physically attaches the puck to its instrument. Thereafter the attached puck always travels with its instrument, no matter where it is being installed in the observing network. The information loaded into the puck encompasses whatever is necessary to enable automatic configuration and system integration of the instrument when it is plugged into the observatory network, and any o- her information required by observatory policies. This information may include structured descriptions of the instrument's sensor and data characteristics (metadata). The information can also include actual software code that is retrieved from the puck and executed by an observatory node when the device is plugged in; this code could implement distributed instrument control and data retrieval interfaces, allowing network-wide access to the instrument functionality. We believe the puck concept to be a powerful one, a given instrument puck is configured just once; enabling automatic configuration of its instrument no matter it is installed on the network thereafter. We also describe mechanisms by which an instrument and its puck can be ""discovered"" by the observatory network when the devices are plugged in. Several approaches are explored, with varying degrees of automation. We evaluate these approaches with special consideration to electrical and safety aspects of the undersea environment. Information and results from our prototyping efforts are also presented.","","POD:0-7803-7775-3","10.1109/SSC.2003.1224112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1224112","","Automatic control;Automation;Communication cables;Humans;Information retrieval;Instruments;Mars;Observatories;Oceans;Workstations","application program interfaces;computerised instrumentation;device drivers;distributed sensors;geophysics computing;meta data;oceanographic equipment;submarine cables","NSF Ocean Observatories Initiative;automated configuration;autonomous event response;cabled observatories;data retrieval interfaces;distributed instrument control;human and machine interactions;instrument pucks;metadata;ocean observatories;regional scale cabled observatory system;sensor network configuration;small-scale systems;software interfaces","","7","","7","","","25-27 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With existing techniques, similarity-based searching may become impractical in terms of computing time in the case of searching through long-running (several-days' worth of) signals. The proposed algorithm, which is referred to as time-series active search, offers significantly faster search with sufficient accuracy. The key to the acceleration is an effective pruning algorithm introduced in the histogram matching stage. Through the pruning, the actual number of matching calculations can be reduced by 200 to 500 times compared with exhaustive search while guaranteeing exactly the same search result. Experiments show that the proposed method can correctly detect and locate a 15-s signal in a 48-h recording of TV broadcasts within 1 s, once the feature vectors are calculated and quantized. As extentions of the basic algorithm, efficient AND/OR search methods for searching for multiple query signals and a feature dithering method for coping with signal distortion are also discussed.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2003.813281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223562","","Acceleration;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Information retrieval;Internet;Multimedia databases;Music information retrieval;Search methods;Signal detection;Speech","audio signal processing;pattern matching;time series;video signal processing","15 s;48 h;TV broadcasts;audio signals;efficient AND/OR search methods;feature dithering method;histogram pruning;multiple query signals;quick search method;signal distortion;similarity-based signal searching;time-series active search;video signals","","82","19","27","","","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Easy access to such collections requires an index, which is currently created manually at great cost. Because automatic handwriting recognizers fail on historical manuscripts, the word spotting technique has been developed: the words in a collection are matched as images and grouped into clusters which contain all instances of the same word. By annotating ""interesting"" clusters, an index that links words to the locations where they occur can be built automatically. Due to the noise in historical documents, selecting the right features for matching words is crucial. We analyzed a range of features suitable for matching words using dynamic time warping (DTW), which aligns and compares sets of features extracted from two images. Each feature's individual performance was measured on a test set.

To solve this problem and enhance the performance of image and video analyses, a spatial color descriptor is proposed involving a color adjacency histogram and color vector angle histogram. The color adjacency histogram represents the spatial distribution of color pairs at color edges in an image, thereby incorporating spatial information into the proposed color descriptor. Meanwhile, the color vector angle histogram represents the global color distribution of smooth pixels in an image. Since the proposed color descriptor includes spatial adjacency information between colors, it can robustly reduce the effect of a significant change in appearance and shape in image and video analyses. Moreover, since the color adjacency histogram is simply represented by binary streams, the storage space required for the image histogram values can be effectively reduced. Experimental results show that even with significant appearance changes, the proposed color descriptor could produce a high image retrieval rate and accurately detect abrupt scene-cuts in a video analysis.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2003.814792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223563","","Histograms;Image analysis;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Image storage;Information retrieval;Performance analysis;Pixel;Robustness","image colour analysis;image retrieval;image segmentation;video signal processing","abrupt scene-cut detection;color adjacency histogram;color pair spatial distribution;color vector angle histogram;color-based image retrieval;image retrieval;spatial adjacency information;spatial color descriptor;video segmentation","","45","","18","","","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

CLUE is built on a hypothesis that images of the same semantics tend to be clustered. It attempts to narrow the semantic gap by retrieving image clusters based on not only the feature similarity of images to the query, but also how images are similar to each other.

The approach, by generating CNNs where the input data are fed via external inputs rather than initial conditions, enables both hetero-associative and auto-associative memories to be designed. A numerical example is reported in order to show the capabilities of the designed network in storing and retrieving information.","1098-7576;10987576","POD:0-7803-7898-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2003.1223291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1223291","","Associative memory;Asymptotic stability;Cellular neural networks;Design methodology;Frequency domain analysis;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Stability analysis;Stability criteria","cellular neural nets;content-addressable storage;discrete time systems;matrix algebra;stability criteria","asymptotic stability;autoassociative memory;cellular neural networks;circulant matrices;discrete-time model;dynamic properties;feedback parameter;frequency domain;heteroassociative memory;information retrieval;information storage;stability analysis","","0","","12","","","20-24 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications, an intramural R&D division of the National Library for Medicine (NLM), maintains an archive of digitized X-rays of the cervical and lumbar spine taken as part of the second national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES II). It is our goal to provide shape-based access to digitized X-rays including retrieval on automatically detected and classified pathology, e.g., anterior osteophytes. This is done using radius of curvature analysis along the anterior portion, and morphological analysis for quantifying protrusion regions along the vertebra boundary. Experimental results are presented for the classification of 704 cervical spine vertebrae by evaluating the features using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based approach.

It is supposed that these symbolic representations can be completely derived from text, e.g. using a text analysis component of a text-to-speech synthesiser. An analysis is made to evaluate the correspondence of the particular symbolic features with the acoustic variability. A final dissimilarity measure is designed so as to maximise the correspondence with the selected acoustic measure. The designed measure is applied to the problem of sentence selection for the speech synthesis voice databases.","","POD:0-7803-7395-2","10.1109/WSS.2002.1224390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1224390","","Acoustic measurements;Informatics;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Relational databases;Spatial databases;Speech analysis;Speech synthesis;Text analysis;Vocabulary","feature extraction;signal representation;speech processing;speech synthesis;text analysis","acoustic variability;sentence selection;speech synthesis;speech synthesis voice databases;symbolic features;symbolic representations;symbolic segment dissimilarity measure;text analysis component;text-to-speech synthesiser","","0","","7","","","11-13 Sept. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concatenation cost is defined as a linear function of weighted sub-costs, each addressing a particular phonetic or prosodic feature. The different sub-costs composing the concatenation cost are defined, and their weights are optimised by a multiple linear regression as a function of an acoustic measure of concatenation quality. A perceptual evaluation of the synthesised speech is done with the selection obtained using optimised and hand-tuned weights and with the current laboratory's unit selection method.","","POD:0-7803-7395-2","10.1109/WSS.2002.1224416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1224416","","Acoustic measurements;Cost function;Databases;Information retrieval;Linear regression;Optimization methods;Research and development;Robustness;Speech analysis;Speech synthesis","optimisation;regression analysis;speech processing;speech synthesis","TTS;acoustic unit selection;concatenation cost calculation;concatenation quality;linear function;multiple linear regression;optimisation;perceptual evaluation;phonetic feature;prosodic feature;speech synthesis;unit selection;weight optimisation;weighted sub-costs","","0","","11","","","11-13 Sept. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Chasing hyperlinks to find relevant information may be daunting. To overcome such a problem, a learning system, cognizant of a user's interests, can be employed to automatically search for and retrieve relevant information by following appropriate hyperlinks. In this paper, we describe the design of such a learning system for automated Web navigation using adaptive dynamic programming methods. To improve the performance of the learning system, we introduce the notion of multiple model-based learning agents operating in parallel, and describe methods for combining their models. Experimental results on the WWW navigation problem are presented to indicate that combining multiple learning agents, relying on user feedback, is a promising direction to improve learning speed in automated WWW navigation.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.817043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227587","","Decision making;Dynamic programming;Feedback;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Motion planning;Navigation;Uncertainty;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;dynamic programming;multi-agent systems;online front-ends","automated Web navigation;hyperlink chasing;information retrieval;information searching;learning system;multiagent adaptive dynamic programming;multiple model-based learning agents;user interests","","5","","16","","","May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
