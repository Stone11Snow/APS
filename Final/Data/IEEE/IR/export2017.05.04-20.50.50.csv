In the face of the large number of websites, traditional web crawlers cannot function well to get the relevant pages effectively. To solve these problems, focused crawlers utilize semantic web technologies to analyze the semantics of hyperlinks and web documents. The focused crawler is a special-purpose search engine which aims to selectively seek out pages that are relevant to a predefined set of topics, rather than to exploit all regions of the web. The main characteristic of focused crawling is that the crawler does not need to collect all web pages, but selects and retrieves only the relevant pages. So the major problem is how to retrieve the maximal set of relevant and quality pages. To address this problem, we have designed a focused crawler which calculates the relevancy of block in web page. The Block is partitioned by VIPS algorithm. Page relevancy is calculated by sum of all block relevancy scores in one page. It also calculates the URL score for identifying whether a URL is relevant or not for a specific topic.","2155-1812;21551812","Electronic:978-1-4244-6370-1; POD:978-1-4244-6367-1","10.1109/ICETC.2010.5529547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5529547","VIPS algorithm;focused crawler;vector space model","Computer science education;Crawlers;Educational technology;Information retrieval;Internet;Partitioning algorithms;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web server","Internet;information retrieval;search engines;semantic Web","Internet;URL score;VIPS algorithm;Web crawlers;Web documents;Web page retrieval;Web sites;block partitioning;block relevancy scores;improved focused crawling approach;relevant page retrieval;semantic Web technology;software crawlers;special-purpose search engine","","0","","9","","","22-24 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This divergence measures the orthogonal distance between the tangent to the convex function (used in the definition of the divergence) at one of its input arguments and its second argument. This is in contrast to the ordinate distance taken in the usual definition of the Bregman class of divergences. We use this orthogonal distance to redefine the Bregman class of divergences and develop a new theory for estimating the center of a set of vectors as well as probability distribution functions. The new class of divergences are dubbed the total Bregman divergence (TBD). We present the l-norm based TBD center that is dubbed the t-center which is then used as a cluster center of a class of shapes The t-center is weighted mean and this weight is small for noise and outliers.

However, how to make an efficient query from the large amounts of data faces a severe challenge. An effective ranking approach of the query items plays an important role on databases searching applications.

Beyond existing orderless bag-of-features, local features of an image are first projected to different directions or points to generate a series of ordered bag-of-features, based on which different families of spatial bag-of-features are designed to capture the invariance of object translation, rotation, and scaling. Then the most representative features are selected based on a boosting-like method to generate a new bag-of-features-like vector representation of an image. The proposed retrieval framework works well in image retrieval task owing to the following three properties: 1) the encoding of geometric information of objects for capturing objects' spatial transformation, 2) the supervised feature selection and combination strategy for enhancing the discriminative power, and 3) the representation of bag-of-features for effective image matching and indexing for large scale image retrieval. Extensive experiments on 5000 Oxford building images and 1 million Panoramio images show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed features as well as the retrieval framework.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540021","","Asia;Image coding;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Scalability;Web search","feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;indexing","geometric information;image indexing;image matching;large scale image retrieval;local features;object rotation;object scaling;object translation;retrieval framework;spatial-bag-of-features;vector representation","","74","","16","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To maintain high efficiency even for very large data collection, features are assumed independent. We show experimentally that co-ocsets are not rare, i.e. the independence assumption is often violated, and that they may ruin retrieval performance if present in the query image.

We assume that speaker roles can emerge from parameters extracted from speaker segmentations without taking any prior information into account. Each speaker is then represented by a feature vector carrying temporal, signal and prosodic information.

Ideally, a description in terms of primitives should facilitate the recognition, synthesis, and characterization of actions. We propose an unsupervised learning algorithm for automatically decomposing joint movements in human motion capture (MoCap) sequences into shift-invariant basis functions. Our formulation models the time series data of joint movements in actions as a sparse linear combination of short basis functions (snippets), which are executed (or “activated”) at different positions in time. Given a set of MoCap sequences of different actions, our algorithm finds the decomposition of MoCap sequences in terms of basis functions and their activations in time. Using the tools of L<sub>1</sub> minimization, the procedure alternately solves two large convex minimizations: Given the basis functions, a variant of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit solves for the activations, and given the activations, the Split Bregman Algorithm solves for the basis functions. Experiments demonstrate the power of the decomposition in a number of applications, including action recognition, retrieval, MoCap data compression, and as a tool for classification in the diagnosis of Parkinson (a motion disorder disease).","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539977","","Character recognition;Data compression;Humans;Information retrieval;Matching pursuit algorithms;Minimization methods;Motion analysis;Parkinson's disease;Pursuit algorithms;Unsupervised learning","image matching;image motion analysis;image representation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;time series","MoCap data compression;Parkinson diagnosis;action characterization;action recognition;action retrieval;action synthesis;human motion capture;joint movements;large convex minimizations;learning shift-invariant sparse representation;motion capture analysis;motion disorder disease;motion sequences;orthogonal matching pursuit;shift-invariant basis functions;short basis functions;snippets;sparse linear combination;split Bregman algorithm;time series data;unsupervised learning algorithm","","14","","27","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SCSF is effective and efficient for image matching because it is independent of image distortion such as rotation and flip as well as it increases the matching accuracy. The SCSF was organized by M-tree, which could speedup the searching procedure. Our experiments show that the image matching is quickly and efficiently with the use of SCSF.

We present a very simple algorithm for generating compact binary representations of imagery data, based on random projections.

Several hashing methods have been proposed to allow approximate but highly efficient search. Unsupervised hashing methods show good performance with metric distances but, in image search, semantic similarity is usually given in terms of labeled pairs of images. There exist supervised hashing methods that can handle such semantic similarity but they are prone to overfitting when labeled data is small or noisy. Moreover, these methods are usually very slow to train. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised hashing method that is formulated as minimizing empirical error on the labeled data while maximizing variance and independence of hash bits over the labeled and unlabeled data. The proposed method can handle both metric as well as semantic similarity. The experimental results on two large datasets (up to one million samples) demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539994","","Availability;Binary codes;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Scalability;Videos;YouTube","file organisation;image retrieval","large scale image search;scalable image retrieval;semantic similarity;semi-supervised hashing method;unsupervised hashing method","","151","2","17","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, in such systems, operations such as data retrieval and message sending incur significant communication costs. For example, a simple scheme used in many Byzantine fault-tolerant DHT constructions of $n$ nodes requires $O(log^{3}n)$ messages, this is likely impractical for real-world applications. The previous best known message complexity is $O(log^2{n})$ {it in expectation}, however, the corresponding protocol suffers from prohibitive costs owing to hidden constants in the asymptotic notation and setup costs. In this paper, we focus on reducing the communication costs against a computationally bounded adversary. We employ threshold cryptography and distributed key generation to define two protocols both of which are more efficient than existing solutions. In comparison, our first protocol is {it deterministic} with $O(log^2{}n)$ message complexity and our second protocol is randomized with expected $O(log{n})$ message complexity. Further, both the hidden constants and setup costs for our protocols are small and no trusted third party is required. Finally, we present results from micro benchmarks conducted over PlanetLab showing that our protocols are practical for deployment under significant levels of churn and adversarial behaviour.","1063-6927;10636927","Electronic:978-1-4244-7262-8; POD:978-1-4244-7261-1","10.1109/ICDCS.2010.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541679","Computer network security;Distributed algorithms","Computer science;Costs;Cryptographic protocols;Distributed computing;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Robustness","","","","9","","50","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our work, the video is first segmented into shots and scenes, and key frames from each shot are analyzed before aggregating the results. Each key frame is classified as indoor or outdoor. Outdoor frames are further broken down by a semantic segmentation which provides a label to each pixel. These labels are then used to classify the scene type by describing the arrangement of scene components with a spatial pyramid. We present results from operating on a large database of videos and provide a comparison with selected work from the literature on photographs. Evidence of the success of the semantic segmentation is provided on a set of hand-labeled images.

In O-Ring, data items are replicated on successive peers around the ring, with an overlap of data items stored at consecutive peers. Each peer holds data items for which it is directly responsible. It also holds backup copies of data items held by the peer preceding it on the ring and the peer following it on the ring.

Imperfect search results frequently appear due to the mismatch between the textual features and the actual visual content. Visual reranking, in which visual information is applied to refine text based search results, has been proven to be effective. However, the improvement brought by visual reranking is limited, and the main reason is that the errors in the text-based results will propagate to the refinement stage. In this paper, we propose a Content-Aware Ranking model based on “learning to rank” framework, in which textual and visual information are simultaneously leveraged in the ranking learning process. We formulate the Content-Aware Ranking based on large margin structured output learning, by modeling the visual information into a regularization term. The direct optimization of the learning problem is nearly infeasible since the number of constraints is huge. The efficient cutting plane algorithm is adopted to learn the model by iteratively adding the most violated constraints. Extensive experimental results on a large-scale dataset collected from a commercial Web image search engine, as well as the TRECVID 2007 video search dataset, demonstrate that the proposed ranking model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ranking and reranking methods.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5540003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540003","","Asia;Chaos;Constraint optimization;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Search engines;Video sharing","learning (artificial intelligence);search engines","content-aware ranking model;image search engines;learning problem;learning to rank framework;ranking learning process;regularization term;text based search;textual information;video search engines;visual content;visual information;visual reranking;visual search","","20","1","26","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Maintenance of street lights and electric apparatus in conduits for example. The fundamental problems with this system have been 1)the trade-off relation between power consumption by sensor and the data retrieval rate for the interrogator, and 2)the data retrieval agility for the moving interrogator. A higher duty ratio incurs more power consumption in sensors whereas a lower duty ratio leads to a less reliable retrieval rate. Even though there have been such efforts as"" adaptive sleep period control ""which was derived from the packet arrival rate, they didn't systemically solve the problem, particularly for moving-interrogator environment. This paper presents a solution of separating the timing of sensor-sampling and the timing of sensor-data retrieval. The asynchronous data retrieval mechanism is facilitated by a dual interfaced UHF passive RF tag known as a ""recorder tag"" which the authors have been developing. This paper examines the power consumption composition of a prototype recorder tag. The power consumption efficiency of the proposed data-retrieval method is discussed in comparison with that of the existing method in terms of ""Sensor Sampling Interval vs. Battery Life Expectancy."" The authors also evaluated the viability of retrieving sensor data through a moving-interrogator. We specifically inspected the relationship of ""Interrogator's Moving Speed vs Successful Data Retrieval Rate."" The tests showed that with a commercial 1.2V rechargeable battery, the recorder tag lasts for 21 days forluminance and temperature sensing using a 30 minute samplinginterval, extending the traditional battery lifespan ten times longer, yet still preserving 100% time availability for sensor data retrieval. The power consumption is expected to be eight times as efficient when using optimized ci- - rcuitry. Experiments in an emulated fading environment reveal that the data retrieval rate is observed to be the highest when the maximum relative speed between the moving-interrogator and the recorder tag is less than 3km/h, with an optimized distance of separation being 10cm for a 27dBm EIRP interrogator. The moving speed, 3km/h, can be improved by optimizing the anti-collision procedure and by enhancing the sensitivity of the recorder tag.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6700-6; POD:978-1-4244-6697-9","10.1109/RFID-TA.2010.5529869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5529869","","Adaptive control;Batteries;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Power system reliability;Programmable control;Radio frequency;Sensor systems;Temperature sensors;Timing","","","","3","","13","","","17-19 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Taking into account the network delay and economic cost associated with sharing and communicating large amounts of distributed data over an internet, an important problem in this scenario is to retrieve the global skyline tuples from all the distributed local sites with minimum communication cost. Based on the well known notation of the probabilistic skyline query over centralized uncertain data, in this paper, for the first time, we propose the notation of distributed skyline queries over uncertain data. Furthermore, two communication-and computation-efficient algorithms are proposed to retrieve the qualified skylines from distributed local sites.

Recently, heat kernel signature was introduced as an intrinsic local shape descriptor based on diffusion scale-space analysis. In this paper, we develop a scale-invariant version of the heat kernel descriptor. Our construction is based on a logarithmically sampled scale-space in which shape scaling corresponds, up to a multiplicative constant, to a translation. This translation is undone using the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The proposed scale-invariant local descriptors can be used in the bag-of-features framework for shape retrieval in the presence of transformations such as isometric deformations, missing data, topological noise, and global and local scaling. We get significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art algorithms on recently established non-rigid shape retrieval benchmarks.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4244-6985-7; POD:978-1-4244-6984-0","10.1109/CVPR.2010.5539838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5539838","","Computer vision;Extraterrestrial measurements;Geometry;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Image sampling;Information retrieval;Internet;Kernel;Shape","Fourier transforms;information retrieval;shape recognition;vocabulary","Fourier transform;diffusion scale space analysis;multiplicative constant;scale invariant heat kernel signature;shape descriptor;shape recognition;shape retrieval","","103","","46","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides prohue pseudo intensity image, the separate chromatic components saturation and intensity of a color image are also equivalent to two gray images. The graph of a gray image function is a rumpled surface appearing like a landscape, from which six novel texture feature curves are derived. In this way, eighteen feature curves can be obtained from the three gray images.

The lack of semantic based retrieval capability has impeded application of remote sensing data. To address the issue, we propose a framework based on domain-dependent ontology to perform semantic retrieval in image archives. Firstly, primitive features expressed by color and texture are extracted to gain homogeneous region by means of kmeans unsupervised algorithm. The homogeneous regions are described by high-level concepts depicted and organized by domain specific ontology. Additionally, a reasoning mechanism over ontology integrating an inference engine is discussed. It enables the capability of semantic query in archives by mining the interrelationships among domain concepts and their properties to satisfy users' requirements.

The proposed batch mode re-tagging method can automatically refine noisy tags of a group of Flickr photos uploaded by the same user within a short period by leveraging millions of training web images and their associated rich textual descriptions. Specifically, for one group of Flickr photos, we construct a group-specific lexicon which contains only the tags of all photos within the group. For each query tag, we employ the inverted file method to automatically find loosely labeled training web images. We propose a SVM with Augmented Features, referred to as AFSVM, to learn adapted classifiers to refine the annotation tags of photos by leveraging the existing SVM classifiers of popular tags, which are associated with a large amount of positive training web images. Moreover, to further refine the annotation tags of photos in the same group, we additionally introduce an objective function that utilizes the visual similarities of photos within the group as well as the semantic proximities of their tags.

The information signal can be retrieved at the receiving end by estimating the variance of the received signal. To evaluate the performance of DTM scheme, normalized mean square error (NMSE) in additive white Gaussian channel is derived for analog information transmission, as well as BER (bit error rate) for binary information communications.

"Secure Ranked Keyword Search over Encrypted Cloud Data","C. Wang; N. Cao; J. Li; K. Ren; W.

For the protection of data privacy, sensitive data has to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a very challenging task. Although traditional searchable encryption schemes allow users to securely search over encrypted data through keywords, these techniques support only boolean search, without capturing any relevance of data files. This approach suffers from two main drawbacks when directly applied in the context of Cloud Computing. On the one hand, users, who do not necessarily have pre-knowledge of the encrypted cloud data, have to post process every retrieved file in order to find ones most matching their interest, On the other hand, invariably retrieving all files containing the queried keyword further incurs unnecessary network traffic, which is absolutely undesirable in today's pay-as-you-use cloud paradigm. In this paper, for the first time we define and solve the problem of effective yet secure ranked keyword search over encrypted cloud data. Ranked search greatly enhances system usability by returning the matching files in a ranked order regarding to certain relevance criteria (e.g., keyword frequency), thus making one step closer towards practical deployment of privacy-preserving data hosting services in Cloud Computing. We first give a straightforward yet ideal construction of ranked keyword search under the state-of-the-art searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) security definition, and demonstrate its inefficiency. To achieve more practical performance, we then propose a definition for ranked searchable symmetric encryption, and give an efficient design by properly utilizing the existing cryptographic primitive, order-preserving symmetric encryption (OPSE). Thorough analysis shows that our proposed solution enjoys ``as-strong-as-possible"" security guarantee compared to previous SSE schemes, while correctly real- - izing the goal of ranked keyword search. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed solution.","1063-6927;10636927","Electronic:978-1-4244-7262-8; POD:978-1-4244-7261-1","10.1109/ICDCS.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5541682","","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Data privacy;Frequency;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Outsourcing;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Usability","","","","136","1","22","","","21-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extremely strong noise in cryo-EM brings in unreliable artifacts and a limited number of projections leave missing components in 3D Fourier space. We consider all these cases as missing data problems. The iterative transform algorithms aim at improving 3D resolution through applying constraints in Fourier space and real space. In Fourier space, the ""true"" signal components, which are either physically measured or assumed, are retained while the delusive components are updated iteratively. In real space, the protein has spatial limitation or ""finite support"" and possesses non-negativity values. Preliminary results of 3D reconstruction of membrane protein GlpF suggest that the iterative transform process improves 3D resolution.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-22-0; POD:978-1-4244-7324-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542838","3D reconstruction;cryo-electron microscopy;error reduction algorithm;hybrid input-output algorithm","Crystals;Fourier transforms;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Microscopy;Proteins;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution","biology computing;crystals;electron microscopy;image reconstruction;iterative methods;proteins","2D crystals;3D Fourier space;3D protein structures;3D reconstruction;cryoelectron microscopy;error reduction algorithm;hybrid input output algorithm;iterative transform algorithms;membrane protein GlpF","","0","","9","","","23-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, various kinds of audio features are extracted to represent different audio sounds in each segment. Third, GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) is used as the classifier to detect cheering events. Finally, in addition to widely used smoothing rules, this paper developed a new boundary-seeking smoothing algorithm to overcome the shortcomings of conventional sliding-window based analysis method and eliminate the false alarms caused by background noise. By integrating all the techniques, an average F value of 82.99% is achieved in the cheering detection task evaluated on eleven games of five kinds of sports.

However, current state-of-the-art MMOGs based on peer-to-peer overlays fail to satisfy these requirements. This happens because avatar mobility implies many data exchanges through the overlay. As state-of-the-art overlays do not anticipate this mobility, the needed data is not delivered on time, which leads to transient failures at the application level. To solve this problem, we propose Blue Banana, a mechanism that models and predicts avatar movement, allowing the overlay to adapt itself by anticipation to the MMOG needs.
