In addition, performance of indexing method for the aforementioned descriptors is analyzed. The prototype system allows users to search by providing a query image and selecting one of four implemented methods.Research goal is enhancing current content-based image retrieval techniques.

This paper proposes a singing voice recognition algorithm that is able to automatically recognize the word in a singing signal with background music by using the concept of spectrogram pattern matching. The main idea is to apply both the spectrogram and the image processing methods to solve the problem of singing voice recognition. Each signal that accompanies music is analyzed and generated to its spectrogram that is used to train data for the classifier.

"Developing a Significant Nearest Neighbor Search Method for Effective Case Retrieval in a CBR System","C. Y. Tsai; C. C. Chiu","Dept. of Ind.

A successful CBR system highly depends on how to design an effective case retrieval mechanism. The K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search method which selects the K most similar prior cases for a new case has been extensively used in the case retrieval phase of CBR. Although KNN can be simply implemented, the choice of the K value is quite subjective and will influence the performance of a CBR system. To eliminate the disadvantage, this research proposes a significant nearest neighbor (SNN) search method. In SNN, the probability density function of the dissimilarity distribution is estimated by the expectation maximization algorithm. Accordingly, the case selection can be conducted by determining whether the dissimilarity between a prior case and the new case is significant low based on the estimated dissimilarity distribution. The SNN search avoids human involvement in deciding the number of retrieved prior cases and makes the retrieval result objective and meaningful in statistics. The performance of the proposed SNN search method is demonstrated through a set of experiments.","","POD:978-0-7695-3653-8","10.1109/IACSIT-SC.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5169353","case-based reasoning;expectation maximization algorithm;nearest neighbor search;statistical inference","Computer science;Conference management;Humans;Industrial engineering;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Problem-solving;Search methods;Springs;Technology management","case-based reasoning;expectation-maximisation algorithm;information retrieval","CBR system;K-nearest neighbor search method;KNN;artificial intelligence;case retrieval;case-based reasoning;dissimilarity distribution;expectation maximization algorithm;probability density function;problem-solving technique;significant nearest neighbor search method;statistics","","0","","10","","","17-20 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first approach is based on a neural network color classifier trained using error back propagation training algorithm. The second approach is based on heuristically designed fuzzy classifier using fuzzy if-then rules for classifying color pixels into one of the eleven JNS colors. Color signatures for images in the database are obtained using both the methods. Further a fuzzy set theoretic approach is proposed to describe and extract the fuzzy color semantics that attempt to reduce the semantic gap between the low-level visual features and the high-level semantic features. Five linguistic variables are used to represent the image color semantics providing a flexible query scheme that is able to effectively represent vagueness in human color perception. The calibration images are inserted in the database for verifying correctness of the two approaches. The comparison of the image retrieval results obtained using fuzzy and fuzzy-neural approaches are presented at the end.","","POD:978-0-7695-3565-4","10.1109/ICDIP.2009.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190600","Neuro-fuzzy;color classifier;fuzzy color semantics;rule based system","Color;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Histograms;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Spatial databases","backpropagation;feature extraction;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;image classification;image colour analysis;image retrieval","Just Not the Same color histogram;color binning;color pixel classification;color signatures;error back propagation training algorithm;fuzzy color semantics extraction;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy set theory;image retrieval;neural network color classifier;visual features","","1","","13","","","7-9 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The produced string was then subjected into the longest common sequence (LCS) techniques (as is commonly done in computational biology), to detect duplicate and near-duplicate Webpages. The process of tagging and aligning was based on set of sentences extracted from the Web page as a representative of the pages. The query-keywords are used as a basis for sentence extraction. Results obtained from experiments performed have shown that such a combined approach can provide very interesting similarity calculation and re-ranking measure. This can be used with reasonable efficiency to detect duplications on search results generated by search engines such as Google.

However, it is not invariant to starting point selection, so the phase normalization is applied. After that, we linearly project the shape feature in 3D format onto a subspace based on EBcC technique into low dimensional subspace. The FBcC, another similar method, also produces well separated classes in low dimensional subspace. Finally, the normalized cross correlation is used to measure the similarity among shapes.

The algorithm is supervised and needs apriori information about the number and location of textures present in the composite texture training images. The OSP operator role is twofold: to extract a set of texture signature vectors each uniquely characterizing only one texture; after that, the texture segmentation process commences and the signature vectors are used to identify/mark textures in new images, essentially a pixel labeling process with all pixels of one texture having the same label.

The commonly used reachability exploration method focuses on verifying deadlock-freeness. When this property is violated, the states and traces in the reachability graph only give clues to re-design the composition. The process must then repeat itself until no deadlock is found. In this paper, multiple Web service interaction is modeled with a Petri net called composition net (C-net). The protocol-level mismatch problem is transformed into the deadlock structure problem of a C-net. If mismatches are found, a solution based on Petri net siphons is proposed.

The main steps in ME-match are creation of bilingual pronouncing mapping, tokenization of query names, transformation of query names to IPA forms based on tonal grouping approach, searching possible various words in both scripts for each query IPA phoneme string, combination of various words to become full name strings and then searching names.

Recent systems have mainly depended upon textual representations of the queries and targets in order to apply common string-matching algorithms. However, these methods lose much of the information content of the song and limit the ways in which a user may search. We have created a music recommendation system that uses self-organizing maps to find similarities between songs while preserving more of the original acoustical content.

However, in case of a large number of tags, this protocol produces an estimate of the tag population size which still differs from the actual number of tags, and utilizes a non-optimal method for deciding the frame size. In this paper we address the issues of more precise tag number estimation and achieving optimal frame sizing by proposing a new protocol, the binary spitting TSA (BSTSA) protocol. Through thorough NS2-based simulations we show that BSTSA considerably outperforms all previous protocols, achieving 80% time system efficiency vs. the 50% achieved by TSA, and reduces the length of the tag identification process of up to 40% with respect to TSA.","2155-5486;21555486","POD:978-1-4244-3938-6","10.1109/SAHCNW.2009.5172951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5172951","","Backscatter;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Delay effects;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Power system reliability;Protocols;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification","access protocols;radio networks;radiofrequency identification","ALOHA protocol;BSTSA;RFID network;TSA;binary spitting TSA;optimal frame tuning;radiofrequency identification;tag number estimation;tree slotted ALOHA","","0","","9","","","22-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automatic image annotation (AIA) has been proved to be an effective and promising solution to automatically deduce the high-level semantics from low-level visual features. Due to the complexity of image-label mapping, it has become a challenge to systematically develop precise models with better performance. In this paper, we try to address the problem using latent semantic indexing (LSI) together with mixed bagging (bootstrap aggregating). Given a training set of annotated images, we first perform vector quantizing of visual space to construct a visual vocabulary consisting of visual terms based on K-means constrained by the semantic relationships derived from the associated annotations using latent semantic indexing; then the statistical hidden correlation between the visual terms and keywords is modeled by a two-level mixed bagging model. At the base level, each multi-class SVM is trained independently using the replicate training set via Bootstrap technique, and the decision of each multi-class SVM is integrated based on average aggregating to generate a combined confidence label vector (CLV) associated with each visual term. All the CLVs are then propagated to the subsequent language model fusion level. At his level, WordNet is used for re-weighting the CLV for each visual term by incorporating the word correlations to obtain an appropriate and consistent image annotation. We carried out experiments on a medium-sized image collection with about 1000 images from corel stock photo CDs. The experimental results demonstrated that the annotation performance of this method outperforms some traditional approaches, showing the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed unified framework into which semantic image classification and language models are seamlessly integrated.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170985","","Bagging;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Shape measurement;Support vector machines;Technology management;Vocabulary","image classification;image coding;image retrieval;indexing;support vector machines;vector quantisation","K-means constraint;WordNet;automatic image annotation;bootstrap aggregation;combined confidence label vector;cross-media image retrieval;image-label mapping complexity;language model fusion level;latent semantic indexing;low-level visual features;medium-sized image collection;semantic image classification;statistical hidden correlation;support vector machine;two-level mixed bagging model;vector quantization;visual vocabulary","","0","","19","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Third, we use hybrid feature descriptor as feature vector of the regions to match images.

Designing a ReSTful service API involves finding resources and their relationships, selecting uniform operations for each resource, and defining data formats for them. It is often a non-trivial exercise to refine a functional specification, expressed in terms of arbitrary actions, to a resource-oriented, descriptive state information content. We argue that this process can be described as a series of model transformations, starting from service functionality and gradually refining the phase products until a ReSTful service API is reached.

The scale of the problem and the diversity of the sources present serious challenges to the conventional manual or statistics-based approaches to schema integration. Domain knowledge-base construction plays an important role to it. The paper discusses knowledge representation, knowledge storage and its construction for three real-world domains based on database schemas, Web query interfaces and traditional methods of Knowledge construction. The architecture is a semantic network constituted by many kinds of knowledge units. Applications of the Deep Web query interface mapping and intelligent user query intension recognition based on our domain knowledge-base are also introduced briefly. Extensive experiments are conducted and results show that our approach is effective. The research provides a basic resource construction technique for semantic Web information processing.

The collection of network information can be used for several reasons (e.g., accounting or security) depending on the purpose the collected data will be used for. At the University of Twente (UT), an automatic decision process for hybrid networks that relies on collected network information has been investigated. This approach, called self-management of hybrid networks requires information retrieved from measuring processes in order to automatically decide on establishing/releasing lambda-connections for IP flows that are long in duration and big in volume (known as elephant flows). Nonetheless, the employed measurement technique can break the self-management decisions if the reported information does not accurately describe the actual behavior and characteristics of the observed flows. Within this context, this paper presents an investigation on the trustfulness of measurements performed using the popular NetFlow monitoring solution when elephant flows are especially observed. We primarily focus on the use of NetFlow with sampling in order to collect network information and investigate how reliable such information is for the self-management processes. This is important because the self-management approach decides which flows should be off-loaded to the optical level based on the current state of the network and its running flows. We observe three specific flow metrics: octets, packets, and flow duration. Our analysis shows that NetFlow provides reliable information regarding octets and packets. On the other hand, the flow duration reported when sampling is employed tends to be shorter than the actual duration.","1573-0077;15730077","POD:978-1-4244-3486-2","10.1109/INM.2009.5188864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5188864","","Data security;Image motion analysis;Information retrieval;Information security;Measurement techniques;Monitoring;Optical fiber networks;Performance evaluation;Sampling methods;Volume measurement","IP networks;decision theory;optical fibre networks;sampling methods;telecommunication network management","IP flow;NetFlow monitoring;automatic decision process;hybrid network self-management;lambda-connection;network measurement;optical network","","7","","26","","","1-5 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experimental results showed that the undesired side effects can be avoided in the rule hiding process by use of our approach. The results also revealed that in most cases, all the sensitive rules are hidden without generating spurious rules. First, the good scalability of our approach in terms of database sizes is achieved by using an efficient data structure FCET to store solely maximal frequent itemsets rather than the entire frequent itemsets. Furthermore, we proposed a new framework for enforcing the privacy in mining association rules, that combine the techniques for efficiently hiding sensitive rules and the transaction retrieval engine based on the FCET index tree. In particular, four strategies are implemented in the sanitized procedure, for hiding a group of association rules characterized as sensitive or artificial rules.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170962","FCET;Greedy methods;maximal frequent itemsets;rule hiding;sanitized procedure","Association rules;Computer science;Data mining;Data structures;Engines;Information retrieval;Itemsets;Privacy;Scalability;Transaction databases","data encapsulation;data mining;data privacy;data structures;greedy algorithms","data hiding;data mining techniques;data structure;database sizes;greedy approach;privacy preserving association rules;rule hiding process;transaction retrieval engine","","2","","10","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many possible applications for ASC including for example speech recognition, audio database creation and information retrieval, health condition monitoring, audio scene analysis, etc. While relevant features have been well studied and identified for speech signals, they are relatively less studied for other types of audio signals. Considering the fact that different classes of audio signals have their own unique characteristics, the idea of class-dependent feature selection and classification is examined in this paper. In particular, the paper uses a class-dependent method based on a proposed scatter-matrix based class separability ranking measure to select a highly relevant feature subset for each type of the audio signals. An effective training model is also incorporated into the proposed method. The support vector machine with radial basis function kernel is then used as the classifier. Experiments have been conducted on speech and two other types of audio sounds, i.e., coughing and the sound generated when a cup touches a plate or vice versa. Compared to some recently published methods, the proposed class-dependent ASC method requires fewer features and is able to achieve the same or better classification accuracy.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170289","Audio Signal Classification;class-dependent classification","Acoustic scattering;Audio databases;Condition monitoring;Data mining;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Information retrieval;Pattern classification;Signal processing;Speech recognition","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;speech processing;support vector machines","audio sound;class separability ranking measure;class-dependent audio signal classification;radial basis function kernel;relevant feature subset selection;scatter-matrix based measure;sound generation;speech signal;support vector machine;training model","","0","","16","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our algorithm spills window data onto the disk on a periodic basis, refines the output result by properly retrieving the disk resident data, and maximizes output rate by employing techniques to manage the memory blocks. The problem of managing the window blocks in memory-similar in nature to the caching issue-captures both the temporal and frequency related properties of the stream arrivals.

We present a method to determine insurance premiums for catastrophic risks. This method takes into account: statistical data reflected in the yearly average compensation index, an appropriate time period in which the insurance company retrieves the financial losses incurred by the payment of large compensations, the preventive setting up of a reserve fund of the insurer in order to cover partially the catastrophic risk, and a reinsurance strategy. All these are meant to keep up the level of the premiums within an interval of values such that they are still competitive or at least fairly good. In our scenario, we will consider the situation in which the insurer has to borrow money in order to be able to pay the damage claims that arise following a calamity, the loans being refunded in a certain number of years.

As part of the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program at Sandia National Laboratories, a team of international border management specialists, along with input from representatives of several countries, have exercised a systematic approach to identify technology gaps and have developed a technology roadmap aimed at addressing many of the challenges associated with the analysis of border management systems. In the process, several tools have been developed to assist analysts in capturing knowledge and representing information in a meaningful way while making it easier to retrieve when needed. The tools have been used to help in technology gap analysis for specific borders and to aid decision makers on resource prioritization.

The Flash-based Earthquake Location Tool (FELT) provides an authentic earthquake locating experience for students. FELT retrieves seismic data from recent earthquakes and displays seismograms that students can interact with in order to determine an earthquake's epicenter. XML files provide reference points for the selected earthquakes and their seismograms.

The chosen seed key is not fixed but may vary depending on the request change in order to increase the adaptability of Freenet.

In this paper, we propose a new music retrieval scheme based on the mood change pattern. For this, we first divide music clips into segments based on low level musical features. Then, we apply K-means clustering algorithm for grouping them into clusters with similar features. By assigning a unique mood symbol for each group, each music clip can be represented into a sequence of mood symbols. Then, we estimate the similarity of music based on the similarity of their musical mood sequence using the longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm. To evaluate the performance of our scheme, we carried out various experiments and measured the user evaluation.

The auxiliary motion vectors of only key picture are interleaved into the bit stream of previous key picture. To control bit-rate increased due to interleaving of supplement information, residual difference is calculated. This encoded residual difference is used to calculate the predictor so that concealment of each macroblock in a key picture will be performed. Consequently, the increase in bit-rate due to supplement information is compensated with increase in PSNR gain with correlated increase in GOP size. Moreover, we investigate the impact of key picture distortion propagation loss of hierarchical prediction in SVC.

"Rapid Identification Approach for Reusable SOA Assets Using Component Business Maps","I. Elgedawy; L. Ramaswamy","Northern Cyprus Campus, Comput. Eng. Dept., Middle East Tech. Univ., Mersin, Cyprus","2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","20090731","2009","","","599","606","Substantial savings from asset reuse result when the right assets are identified in the very early stages of a client engagement. Unfortunately, advanced identification approaches (known by having high precision and recall, such as behavior-based approaches) cannot be adopted in these early stages, because at these early stages, there is no many details nor much understanding about the client functional requirements. On the other hand, unstructured keyword-based identification approaches are known of having low precision and recall. To overcome this problem, we argue that assets descriptions should have explicit information about the business activities realized by the assets. To be able to capture this information in a machine understandable format, this paper proposes a model for describing reusable assets functional scopes using component business maps (CBMs), in which the asset scope is represented as a hierarchy of CBM elements. Adopting this scope model, the paper proposes a rapid identification approach for reusable assets that retrieves assets based on their CBM projections. We believe the proposed approach provides better precision and recall when compared to unstructured keyword-based approaches.","","POD:978-0-7695-3709-2","10.1109/ICWS.2009.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5175874","Assets;CBM;SOA","Collaborative software;Computer science;Context modeling;Costs;Information retrieval;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Service oriented architecture;Software reusability;USA Councils;Web services","Web services;business data processing;formal specification;groupware;software architecture;software reusability","Web service;asset specification;client functional requirement;collaborating business process;component business map;rapid identification approach;reusable SOA asset;reusable asset functional scope;unstructured keyword-based identification approach","","3","","12","","","6-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Publishers can make content and templates only once, but publish them to many medias which are different in screen size. One of the most difficult problems in cross-media publishing is the target mediaspsila layout size are different. Generic template and content canpsilat adapt to different medias automatically. In this paper, we propose a new method of publishing information in cross-media environment using a new layout model which bases on polymorphous data and adaptive templates.

In our framework, each 3D application for visualization is constructed by users themselves or already exists, and consists of sets of interactive 3D components. Users can embed such 3D applications into cells on Excel, and define the coordination between them. To define coordination, we provide interactive 2D/3D components and coordination rules that enable users to use operations for coordination such as brushing and linking, retrieving related or detailed information one after another, synchronizing viewpoints between 3D visualizations, and sharing table values between 3D components for visualizations and cells on Excel.","1550-6037;15506037","POD:978-0-7695-3733-7","10.1109/IV.2009.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5190769","","Character generation;Data visualization;Dynamic programming;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Laboratories;Proteins;Search engines;Visual databases;Web services","data visualisation;software tools;spreadsheet programs","Excel;coordinated 3D visualization techniques;interactive 2D/3D components;interactive 3D visualization techniques;multiple 3D visualization techniques","","0","","24","","","15-17 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The theoretical analysis herein guarantees that the desired memory patterns are stored as asymptotically stable equilibrium points with very few spurious states. In order to avoid extensive computation, learning and forgetting are utilized by adding patterns to be stored as asymptotically stable equilibrium points to an existing set of stored patterns and deleting specified patterns from a given set of stored patterns without affecting the rest in a given network. Furthermore, the number of the memorized patterns in a designed brain-state-in-a-box neural network model can be made much more than that of neurons. Simulation results demonstrate the validity and characteristics of the proposed approach.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:978-1-4244-3548-7","10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5178785","","Associative memory;Biological neural networks;Brain modeling;Computer networks;Information retrieval;Network synthesis;Neurons;Pattern recognition;Probes;Prototypes","asymptotic stability;content-addressable storage;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;neural nets;number theory;set theory;vectors","associative memory analysis;associative memory synthesis;asymptotically stable equilibrium point;brain-state-in-a-box neural network model;connection weight matrix;design procedure;learning method;n-dimensional bipolar vector set;natural number set;stored memory pattern set","","0","","18","","","14-19 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By prioritizing similarity during a case-based approach may degrade the quality of the retrieval results. There have been a number of attempts to increase retrieval diversity. However, there is a trade-off between similarity and diversity. The improvements in diversity may lead to the loss of similarity. In this paper, we propose a new retrieval strategy based on the random-restart hill-climbing algorithm which optimizes the trade-off between similarity and diversity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better overall quality than other approaches.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.624","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170516","Case-Based Reasoning;Diversity Retrieval;Hill Climbing","Computer science;Cultural differences;Degradation;Diversity reception;Electronic commerce;Information management;Information retrieval;Problem-solving;Recommender systems;TV","information filters;information retrieval","case-based recommender systems;diversity retrieval;random-restart hill-climbing algorithm;retrieval strategy","","0","","6","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
