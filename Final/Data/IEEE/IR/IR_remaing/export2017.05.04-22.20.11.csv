Social media is generating a vast amount of sentiment rich data in the form of tweets, status updates, blog posts etc. Sentiment analysis of this user generated data is very useful in knowing the opinion of the crowd. Twitter sentiment analysis is difficult compared to general sentiment analysis due to the presence of slang words and misspellings. The maximum limit of characters that are allowed in Twitter is 140. Knowledge base approach and Machine learning approach are the two strategies used for analyzing sentiments from the text. In this paper, we try to analyze the twitter posts about electronic products like mobiles, laptops etc using Machine Learning approach. By doing sentiment analysis in a specific domain, it is possible to identify the effect of domain information in sentiment classification. We present a new feature vector for classifying the tweets as positive, negative and extract peoples' opinion about products.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3926-8; POD:978-1-4799-3927-5","10.1109/ICCCNT.2013.6726818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6726818","Machine Learning Techniques;Sentiment Analysis;Twitter","Entropy;Feature extraction;Speech;Support vector machines;Training;Twitter;Vectors","information retrieval;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","Twitter sentiment analysis;crowd opinion extraction;domain information;electronic products;feature vector;knowledge base approach;machine learning techniques;opinion classification;opinion identification;sentiment analysis;sentiment classification;sentiment identification;sentiment rich data;social media;source text","","15","1","17","","","4-6 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper, concerned with these automated methods, attempts to improve Gloss Vector semantic relatedness measure for more reliable estimation of relatedness between two input concepts. Generally, this measure by considering frequency cut-off for big rams tries to remove low and high frequency words which usually do not end up being significant features. However, this naive cutting approach can lead to loss of valuable information. By employing point wise mutual information (PMI) as a measure of association between features, we will try to enforce the foregoing elimination step in a statistical fashion. Applying both approaches to the biomedical domain, using MEDLINE as corpus, MeSH as thesaurus, and available reference standard of 311 concept pairs manually rated for semantic relatedness, we will show that PMI for removing insignificant features is more effective approach than frequency cut-off.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5133-3; POD:978-1-4799-3702-8","10.1109/ICICM.2013.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702809","Bioinformatics;Biomedical Text Mining;Computational Linguistics;Semantic Relatedness;UMLS","Biomedical measurement;Cutoff frequency;Frequency measurement;Semantics;Taxonomy;Unified modeling language;Vectors","data mining;information retrieval;medical computing;text analysis","MEDLINE;MeSH;PMI;UMLS;biomedical corpus;gloss vector semantic relatedness measure;information retrieval;naive cutting approach;point wise mutual information;pointwise mutual information;second-order co-occurrence vectors;text mining;unified medical language system","","1","","17","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ELM is gaining increasing attention, due to its versatility and speed in adapting its internal parameters. Since both of these attributes are fundamental in music classification, ELM provides a good alternative to standard learning models. Our results support this claim, showing a sustained gain of ELM over a feedforward neural network architecture. In particular, ELM provides a great decrease in computational training time, and has always higher or comparable results in terms of efficiency.","1845-5921;18455921","Electronic:978-953-184-194-8; POD:978-1-4799-3125-5; USB:978-953-184-187-0","10.1109/ISPA.2013.6703770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6703770","","Feature extraction;Multiple signal classification;Neural networks;Signal processing;Speech;Standards;Training","audio signal processing;feedforward neural nets;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;signal classification","ELM;automated classification system;automatic music classification;automatic music retrieval;extreme learning machines;feedforward neural network architecture;learning tool","","6","","14","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, many ODL students access and interact with information in a mobile context, which implies that interaction takes place in dynamic and changing environments. This presents students with a number of overlapping contextual challenges that need to be managed when accessing and interacting with information. Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) are also confronted by these challenges as they strive to provide access through technologies that are accessible, usable, scalable and sustainable to students. Against this background, it is important to have an understanding of the categories of information that students would want to access and interact with through the devices that they privately own, of which mobile phones are the most common. This study investigated the categories of information that students would want to access through mobile cellular phones. The data capturing involved both qualitative and quantitative data. In order to get a comprehensive and representative set of information access needs it was necessary to start with open-ended questions. Based on the analysis of the 50 responses to the open-ended questions, fixed-response questions were formulated. The 84 responses to the fixed-response questions were then analyzed to determine the importance of the information access needs as well as the access frequency. The contribution of this paper is a set of prioritized information needs that provide some insight into the mobile centric information needs of students at the University of South Africa (UNISA) as an example of an ODL institution.","2326-9413;23269413","Electronic:978-1-4799-3067-8; POD:978-1-4799-3068-5","10.1109/ICASTech.2013.6707519","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707519","information access needs;mobile phone;mobile phone acces","Computer aided instruction;Discussion forums;Educational institutions;Libraries;Materials;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","cellular radio;computer aided instruction;distance learning;information retrieval;mobile computing","HEI;ODL students access;UNISA;University of South Africa;higher educational institution;mobile cellular phone;mobile centric information access needs;open-and-distance learning;postgraduate student","","0","","33","","","25-27 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We create a new task of solving non-trivial questions using GIS (Geographic Information System) and test it with an associated corpus. A dynamic programming algorithm is developed for classification and voting algorithm for verification. Two types of ontologies are integrated for disambiguating and discriminating spatial terms. PostGIS serves as the GIS backend to provide domain expertise for spatial reasoning. Results show that exact answers can be returned quickly and correctly by our system.

The model thus created is analyzed to derive inferences about the user, where the analysis is performed on a graph model comprising topics based information obtained by mining domain specific personal data sources and from certain facts on which the user has expressed fair level of belief. We have explored the possibility of deriving beneficial information by provisioning an appropriate representation of knowledge as belief-graph with specific orientation in healthcare and call this model as Med-Tree. Subject to privacy conditions, we open up the belief-graph model to establish objective based social connections that gets contextually bound. As a next step, such contextually bound ad-hoc networks are subjected to advanced querying process resulting in useful information extraction and inferences.

The paper provides a novel approach to guide the crawler in choosing the right query term to be submitted to any search form interface that has been designed to accept keywords or terms as input to it. The system is based on the use of classification hierarchies that might have either been manually or automatically constructed.

In this work we analyze entropy-per-chroma feature on a basis of eigenvalues decomposition. This feature has been successfully applied on audio-fingerprinting-based audio recognition systems. We show that involving eigenvalues decomposition contributes for an even more robust audio feature which may be used in audio matching task.

However, size is only one of many possible properties that data generated for software testing should exhibit. For the testing of realistic software systems we also need to trade off between multiple different properties or search for specific instances of data that combine several properties. In this paper we propose a general search-based framework for finding test data with specific properties.

These posts range from real-time update of the event's occurrences highlights of important moments thus far, personal comments and so on. A large user group has evolved who seeks these live updates to get a brief summary of the important moments of the event so far. However, major social search engines including Twitter still present the tweets satisfying the Boolean query in reverse chronological order, resulting in thousands of low quality matches agglomerated in a prosaic manner. To get an overview of the happenings of the event, a user is forced to read scores of uninformative tweets causing frustration. In this paper, we propose a method for multi-tweet summarization of an event. It allows the search users to quickly get an overview about the important moments of the event. We have proposed a graph-based retrieval algorithm that identifies tweets with popular discussion points among the set of tweets returned by Twitter search engine in response to a query comprising the event related keywords. To ensure maximum coverage of topical diversity, we perform topical clustering of the tweets before applying the retrieval algorithm. Evaluation performed by summarizing the important moments of a real-world event revealed that the proposed method could summarize the proceeding of different segments of the event with up to 81.6% precision and up to 80% recall.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5137-1; POD:978-1-4799-1519-4","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693323","Social network analysis;Text mining;Tweet summarization;Twitter search","Clustering algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Linear programming;Real-time systems;Search engines;Twitter;Vectors","Boolean algebra;graph theory;information retrieval;search engines;social networking (online);text analysis","Boolean query;Twitter search engine;graph-based retrieval algorithm;multitweet summarization;real-time public event;social search engine;topical clustering;topical diversity","","2","","22","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem was based on the assumptions that the campaigns strategy for the national wetlands policy awareness in Uganda has for along time been less successful because it did not focus on the right media strategy with respect to the target audience participation and audience demographic characteristics. There was no gender barrier to information uptake. Low income and education levels were barriers to community access to wetlands information. The study found that the socio-economic backgrounds of the audiences were identical in their access to public information and the types of media used in the campaigns.

Due to the difference in the platforms and vocabularies used by research institutions and their administrations, it is hard to completely automate this task and thus it takes a lot of time for the institutions to manually fill out these reports. To fill this gap, this paper employs the semantic web technologies to develop an information inquiry system for research institutions. First, we extract and preprocess the entity information from the institutions. Then we use the ontology language to describe the logical relations between entities like organizations, people and projects. Thus an institution-oriented functional ontology is constructed, which is capable of logical reasoning. Next, with self-defined rules, we also incorporate the generic rule engine to realize the functionality of information retrieval. Finally, by treating this system as the service provider in the architecture of the semantic web services, we fulfill the separation of query content from query format and enable the interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. Therefore, both the administrations and the institutions can use their own language to pose or process the query. Such a system not only demonstrates the power of semantic web, but also provides a portal for the exchange and sharing of information between research institutions and their administrations.","2155-1456;21551456","Electronic:978-1-4799-0245-3; POD:978-1-4799-0243-9","10.1109/ICIII.2013.6702977","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702977","information inquiry;ontology modeling;semantic web;web service","Cognition;Databases;Engines;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Semantics;Web services","information retrieval;research initiatives;semantic Web","entity information;generic rule engine;information inquiry;information retrieval;institution oriented functional ontology;interoperable machine-to-machine interaction;logical reasoning;logical relations;ontology language;query content;query format;research institutions;self-defined rules;semantic Web services;semantic Web technologies","","0","","15","","","23-24 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, enlargement of the gap between data processing and I/O operations' throughput will bound the system performance to storage and retrieval operations and remarkably reduce the overall performance of high performance computing clusters. File replication is a way to improve the performance of I/O operations and increase network utilization by storing several copies of every file. Furthermore, this will lead to a more reliable and fault-tolerant storage cluster. In order to improve the response time of I/O operations, we have proposed a mechanism that estimates the required number of replicas for each file based on its popularity. Besides that, the remaining space of storage cluster is considered in the evaluation of replication factors and the number of replicas is adapted to the storage state. We have implemented the proposed mechanism using HDFS and evaluated it using MapReduce framework. Evaluation results prove its capability to improve the response time of read operations and increase network utilization. Consequently, this mechanism reduces the overall response time of read operations by considering files' popularity in replication process and adapts the replication factor to the cluster state.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5137-1; POD:978-1-4799-1519-4","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693407","Adaptive Storage;Dynamic Replication;File Replication;File Systems","Bandwidth;High performance computing;History;Reliability;System performance;Throughput;Time factors","distributed databases;information retrieval systems;input-output programs;parallel processing","HDFS;IO operation response-time;MapReduce framework;cluster state;dynamic replication mechanism;file popularity;high performance computing applications;high performance computing clusters;large datasets;network utilization;read operations;replication process;retrieval mechanisms;storage mechanisms","","0","","21","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are hundreds of OSNs, each with its own focus and offers for particular services and functionalities. To take advantage of the full range of services and functionalities that OSNs offer, users often create several accounts on various OSNs using the same or different personal information. Retrieving all available data about an individual from several OSNs and merging it into one profile can be useful for many purposes. In this paper, we present a method for solving the Entity Resolution (ER), problem for matching user profiles across multiple OSNs. Our algorithm is able to match two user profiles from two different OSNs based on machine learning techniques, which uses features extracted from each one of the user profiles. Using supervised learning techniques and extracted features, we constructed different classifiers, which were then trained and used to rank the probability that two user profiles from two different OSNs belong to the same individual. These classifiers utilized 27 features of mainly three types: name based features (i.e., the Soundex value of two names), general user info based features (i.e., the cosine similarity between two user profiles), and social network topological based features (i.e., the number of mutual friends between two users' friends list). This experimental study uses real-life data collected from two popular OSNs, Facebook and Xing. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and its classification performance measured by AUC was 0.982 in identifying user profiles across two OSNs.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5137-1; POD:978-1-4799-1519-4","10.1109/SocialCom.2013.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693350","Entity Resolution;Machine Learning;Online Social Networks","Crawlers;Erbium;Facebook;Feature extraction;Training;Vectors","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);topology","AUC;ER;Facebook;OSN;Xing;available data retrieval;entity matching;entity resolution;extracted features;machine learning techniques;online social networks;personal information;social network topological based features;supervised learning techniques;user profile matching","","15","1","9","","","8-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite the prerequisite for extraction of information from topographic map, automated understanding of symbols is a challenging task. The objective of this paper is to explain the development of a system for automatic understanding of symbols from the Indian topographic map. The system has been developed making use of shape analysis method in which complex valued chain coding has been used for representation of the exterior boundary of the shape of the symbol. Fourier discrete transform and Auto-correlation function have been used to define shape descriptors. Classification and recognition have been implemented through template matching method and Similarity measures. The system is trained with 150 samples of each of 20 types of symbols from National digital topographic database (NTDB) for OSM of Indian topographic maps. The developed system is tested for 200 samples of each type of symbol from NTDB. It is found that 84.68% of symbols are understood correctly by the developed system. However, there are some inherent limitations in understanding the symbols from an actual map.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6101-9; POD:978-1-4673-6102-6","10.1109/ICIIP.2013.6707550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707550","chain coding;pattern recognition;shape analysis;template matching","Conferences;Correlation;Encoding;Feature extraction;Pattern recognition;Shape;Vectors","cartography;discrete Fourier transforms;image classification;image coding;image matching;information retrieval;topography (Earth);visual databases","Fourier discrete transform;Indian topographic map symbol understanding system;NTDB;National digital topographic database;OSM;autocorrelation function;complex valued chain coding;exterior boundary representation;information extraction;shape analysis method;shape descriptors;similarity measures;symbol classification;symbol recognition;template matching method","","0","","46","","","9-11 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But large amounts of text data, such as online newspapers, web forums or online encyclopedias, usually exist for languages that have a large population of native speakers. This text data can be easily collected from the web and then used to both expand the recognizer's vocabulary and improve the language model. One challenge, however, is normalizing and filtering the web data for a specific task. In this paper, we investigate the use of online text resources to improve the performance of speech recognition specifically for the task of keyword spotting. For the five languages provided in the base period of the IARPA BABEL project, we automatically collected text data from the web using only Limited LP resources. We then compared two methods for filtering the web data, one based on perplexity ranking and the other based on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word detection. By integrating the web text into our systems, we observed significant improvements in keyword spotting accuracy for four out of the five languages. The best approach obtained an improvement in actual term weighted value (ATWV) of 0.0424 compared to a baseline system trained only on LimitedLP resources. On average, ATWV was improved by 0.0243 across five languages.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2756-2; POD:978-1-4799-2757-9; USB:978-1-4799-2755-5","10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707768","data filtering;keyword spotting;language modeling;low resource;web text","Data models;Filtering;Internet;Speech;Speech recognition;Training data;Vocabulary","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;natural language processing;speech recognition;text analysis","ATWV;IARPA BABEL project;LimitedLP resources;OOV;Web forums;Web text;acoustic models;actual term weighted value;keyword spotting accuracy;language models;low resource languages;native speakers;online encyclopedias;online newspapers;online text resources;out-of-vocabulary word detection;perplexity ranking;recognizer vocabulary;speech recognition;text data","","0","","20","","","8-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Influence may rise or fall quickly over time and thus capturing this evolution of influence is of benefit to a varied number of application domains such as: digital marketing, counter-terrorism or policing. In this paper we investigate the influence of users in programming communities on Twitter. We propose a new model for capturing both time-invariant influence and also temporal influence. The unified model is a combination of network topological methods and observation of influence-relevant events in the network. We provide an application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for capturing this effect on the network. There are many possible combinations of influence factors, hence we required a ground-truth for model configuration. We performed a primary survey of our population users to elicit their views on influential users. The survey allowed us to validate the results of our classifier. We introduce a novel reward-based transformation to the Viterbi path of the observed sequences which provides an overall ranking for users. Our results show an improvement in ranking accuracy over using solely topology-based methods for the particular area of interest we sampled. Utilising the evolutionary aspect of the HMM we attempt to predict future states using current evidence. Our prediction algorithm significantly outperforms a collection of naive models, especially in the short term (1-3 weeks).","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3211-5; POD:978-1-4799-3212-2","10.1109/SITIS.2013.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727234","Influence;Social Networks","Communities;Hidden Markov models;Measurement;Network topology;Predictive models;Twitter;Viterbi algorithm","evolutionary computation;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;network theory (graphs);social networking (online)","HMM;Twitter influence ranking;counter-terrorism;digital marketing;evolutionary model;hidden Markov models;influence evolution;influence factors;influence observables;influential agents;information diffusion;model configuration;network centrality;network topological methods;policing;programming communities;ranking accuracy;temporal influence;time-invariant influence","","1","","10","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They contain hyperlinks through which they are linked with other articles on the web. We propose a FICWAN algorithm which is a modification of FIHC. FICWAN is especially suited for web data.

However, IRs use relational database to store their metadata. It is essential to transform an IR database into ontology and publish its data on semantic web. The aim of this work is to share and reuse the information that exists in IRs. The proposed system extracts metadata from IRs, transforms it into ontology and publishes their data on semantic web.

Service applications are hoped to be more intelligent and knowledgeable. To solve such challenge, this paper attempts to organize web pages into a semantic association graph based on a novel model - indexing network, which can provide more valuable information and services for users. An information search and recommendation services platform is implemented using cloud distributed systems (Hadoop + Habse + Zookeeper) based on Sugon-Tongji cloud platform that is located at Tongji University. 70 million web pages are crawled on the Internet and their corresponding indexing network model are constructed. Several novel services are implemented and provided on the platform, such as search location, search navigation, category/keyword recommendation, and the interaction interface of the indexing network.

In this paper, we model user's preferences and search criteria using an NN (Neural Network) to solve a multiobjective optimization problem specific to environmental planning systems. We argue that some NP hard problems cannot be solved alone either by a human or by a computer. Human participation in automated search is one way of combining human intuition with algorithmic search to solve such problems. However, even humans have some limitations for participation in that they cannot participate in search completely because of human fatigue. To overcome this, in our approach, an NN tries to model the user's rating criteria and preferences to help the user in rating large set of designs. Although training an NN with limited data is not always feasible, there are many situations where a simple modelling technique (e.g., linear/quadratic mapping) works better if the learning data set is small. In this paper we attempt to get more accuracy of the NN by generating data using other linear/non-linear techniques that fills the gap created by lack of sufficient training data. Also, we provided the architectural design of an HPC based framework we have proposed and compared the performance of the NN with fuzzy logic and other linear/non-linear user modelling techniques for the environmental resources optimization problem.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0652-9; POD:978-1-4799-0650-5","10.1109/SMC.2013.560","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722313","collaborative search;environmental planning;genetic algorithm;interactive algorithm;neural network;user modelling","Adaptation models;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Computers;Optimization;Search problems","environmental science computing;fuzzy logic;human factors;information retrieval;neural nets;optimisation;parallel processing;user modelling","HPC based framework;NP hard problems;algorithmic search;automated search;environmental planning systems;environmental resource optimization problem;fuzzy logic technique;human fatigue;human intuition;human participation;information retrieval systems;interactive optimization;multiobjective optimization problem;neural network;nonlinear user modelling technique;training data;user preferences;user rating criteria;user search criteria","","0","","15","","","13-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although forums have different designs, and are built on different technologies, they always have identical logic navigation that connects homepage and particular posts through forum lists and threads by specific URLs. Considering this common implicit navigation, we have optimized Web crawling problem to be URL-type recognition problem. URL-type database and regular expressions are used in order to achieve URL-type recognition. These regular expressions are expanded with special custom characters and commands that gave this forum crawler advantage over other Web based crawlers. The results shown in this paper are obtained by crawling a set of Web forums with different technology, location and design.

For the purpose of detecting more types of cloaking techniques, our system works as follows: driving a real browser to execute scripts in web pages, crawl a page for the second time by modifying the referrer field of our HTTP headers, obtaining search engine's cached page for further comparison. We apply our system to 104,800 URLs extracted from Yahoo. Results show that our system can gain a high accuracy: precision at 94.52% and recall at 98.57%.

In this paper we design Tagpref inspired by the method of establishing user preference with tags. The user's preference was described by the user's preference degrees for different tags. Different algorithms were proposed and evaluated for taggers and non-taggers on Movie Lens based on direct and indirect behavior.

We argue that, given the envisioned diversity, capabilities, and sheer number of smart things, this obstructs the possibility of creating diverse and exciting applications that benefit of the generated information in public, global usage scenarios. In this paper, we thus aim to initiate the discussion of creating a true Internet of Things, i.e., interconnected IoT networks, based on provision and requests of generated information in a public infrastructure. We highlight the challenges in designing this infrastructure for feasible integration in the current Internet and IoT designs, comprehensive provision and retrieval of information, and versatile derivation of higher information contexts from single information sources.

This paper aims to handle this issue by developing a comprehensive fuzzy tree similarity measure. The fuzzy tree similarity measure compares both the concepts and values in two trees of items. The focus of this study is primarily on the fuzzy value similarity between two trees. In the similarity measure, each attribute is associated with a set of linguistic terms to express the value granularly. The node values are first transformed to membership vectors related to the linguistic terms, and the values of the conceptual corresponding nodes are then compared. These local similarities are aggregated into the final fuzzy value similarity between the two trees. A telecom product recommendation case study shows the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy tree similarity measure and its applicability for telecom product recommendations.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0652-9; POD:978-1-4799-0650-5","10.1109/SMC.2013.594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722347","fuzzy similarity measure;recommender systems;tree similarity measure","Data models;Pragmatics;Recommender systems;Semantics;Telecommunications;Vectors;Vegetation","fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;marketing data processing;recommender systems;telecommunication industry;telecommunication services;trees (mathematics)","conceptual corresponding nodes;fuzzy tree similarity measure;fuzzy value similarity;granular value expression;item recommendation;linguistic terms;membership vectors;recommendation approach;recommender systems;telecom product recommendation","","3","","25","","","13-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, most of the hospitals own several information systems for each purpose and each organization. Thus, searching patient information across multiple data sources or data types is difficult problem that must be solved. To solve this problem, we developed content repurposing platform that enables search refinement across data sources using metadata database which store metadata extracted from each data sources. The platform is constructed on top of object storage and includes metadata extraction engine, metadata DB, content router, and search engine.

The points of interest (PoIs) are detected using the Harriscorner detector in order to extract the image features. A scheme using adjustable algorithms, i.e. support vectors machine (SVM) is adopted in order to fuse the multimodal features. A Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF-NN) estimates the RBC geometrical properties. The proposed method is evaluated in both regression and identification tasks by processing images of a simulated device used to acquire scattering phenomena of moving RBCs. The evaluation database includes 23625 scattering images, obtained by means of the Boundary Element Method. The regression and identification accuracy of the actual RBC shape is estimated using three feature sets in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise from 60 to 10 dB SNR, giving a mean error rate less than 1 percent of the actual RBC shape, and more than 99 percent mean identification rate in a set of valid RBCs size.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3163-7; POD:978-1-4799-3164-4","10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701700","","Feature extraction;Histograms;Red blood cells;Scattering;Shape;Signal to noise ratio;Support vector machines","Gaussian noise;biomedical optical imaging;blood;boundary-elements methods;cellular biophysics;covariance analysis;feature extraction;independent component analysis;information retrieval;light scattering;medical image processing;radial basis function networks;regression analysis;support vector machines","Harris-corner detector;ICA;RBC geometrical properties;RBF-NN;SNR;SVM;acquire scattering phenomena;additive white Gaussian noise;adjustable algorithms;boundary element method;color scattering images;feature dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;histogram-of-oriented gradients;human biconcave red blood cells;identification accuracy;identification tasks;image features;image normalization;image processing;independent component analysis;information retrieval process;multimodal features;radial basis function neural network;region covariance features;regression accuracy;regression tasks;support vector machine","","1","","29","","","10-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the influence of speakers' mother tongue, however, those from different regions inevitably have different accents in their pronunciation of English. The ultimate goal of our project is creating a global pronunciation map of World Englishes on an individual basis, for speakers to use to locate similar English pronunciations. If the speaker is a learner, he can also know how his pronunciation compares to other varieties. Creating the map mathematically requires a matrix of pronunciation distances among all the speakers considered. This paper investigates invariant pronunciation structure analysis and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict the inter-speaker pronunciation distances. In experiments, the Speech Accent Archive (SAA), which contains speech data of worldwide accented English, is used as training and testing samples. IPA narrow transcriptions in the archive are used to prepare reference pronunciation distances, which are then predicted based on structural analysis and SVR, not with IPA transcriptions. Correlation between the reference distances and the predicted distances is calculated. Experimental results show very promising results and our proposed method outperforms by far a baseline system developed using an HMM-based phoneme recognizer.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2756-2; POD:978-1-4799-2757-9; USB:978-1-4799-2755-5","10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707733","World Englishes;f-divergence;pronunciation structure analysis;speaker-based pronunciation clustering;support vector regression","Correlation;Educational institutions;Grammar;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Support vector machines;Training","hidden Markov models;information retrieval systems;natural language processing;records management;regression analysis;support vector machines","HMM based phoneme recognizer;IPA narrow transcriptions;SAA;SVR;automatic pronunciation clustering;english pronunciation;global communication;interspeaker pronunciation;pronunciation structure analysis;speakers mother tongue;speech accent archive;speech data;support vector regression;world English archive","","2","","25","","","8-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In SM<sup>2</sup>H, both intra-modality similarity and inter-modality similarity are first modeled by a hypergraph, then multi-modal dictionaries are jointly learned by Hypergraph Laplacian sparse coding. Based on the learned dictionaries, the sparse codeset of each data object is acquired and conducted for multi-modal approximate nearest neighbor retrieval using a sensitive Jaccard metric.

As a result, SW technological breakthroughs such as ontologies and semantic data description, as well as data representation and manipulation technologies (i.e., RDF, OWL, and SPARQL) are being recently explored to improve data accessibility for blind Web surfers. In this paper, we briefly explore existing studies targeting Web data accessibility for blind users, ranging from traditional techniques (Braille output, screen readers, etc.) toward semantically enhanced techniques (using SW technologies). Then, we present an ongoing framework, exploring SW technologies (namely RDF, RDFa and OWL) in order to improve the representation of heterogeneous Web pages (typically pages not conforming to the W3C recommendations for Web page design), adapting the document's contents and presentation so that it best fits the blind user's needs.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3211-5; POD:978-1-4799-3212-2","10.1109/SITIS.2013.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727199","Blind users;Braille;Multi-axial navigation;Screen readers;Semantic annotation;Web navigation;touch-screen semantic navigation","Browsers;Guidelines;Navigation;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Visualization","data structures;handicapped aids;information retrieval;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;touch sensitive screens","Braille output;OWL;RDF;RDFa;SPARQL;SW technologies;W3C recommendations;Web data accessibility;Web data navigation;Web information;Web page design;Web surfers;blind users;data manipulation technology;data representation technology;document contents;heterogeneous Web page representation;ontologies;screen readers;semantic Web;semantic data description;semantically enhanced techniques","","2","","52","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of such a segmentation is to divide the audio into intervals that need a lexical transcription and intervals that just need some categorization in terms of jingle, applause, etc. In this paper a baseline SNS system that was trained on monolingual BN data is evaluated on a multilingual BN corpus and on a heterogeneous corpus, composed of diverse TV shows including discussions, soaps, animation films, etc. It appears that the system exhibits serious deficiencies when confronted with such out-of-domain data. Especially the heterogeneous corpus, characterized by many short speaker turns and a rich pallet of non-speech intervals, turns out to be challenging. However, employing a proper SNS information criterion, it is demonstrated that enhancing the acoustic representation of the audio, creating a richer music model and performing a file-wise adaptation of the acoustic models can significantly increase the performance.

Our proposed algorithm, Social Aware Recommendation of Venues and Environments (SARVE), computes the Pearson Correlation and social characteristic information of conference participants. SARVE further incorporates the current context of both the smart conference community and participants in order to model a recommendation process using distributed community detection.

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data have got some promising results [2]. However the obvious disadvantage is that it can hardly get the profile information except for the roof of building, and the result is that people can not get complete building model. On the contrary, Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) could get points cloud of buildings with high density and accuracy by multi-stations scanning for realistic 3D model reconstruction. The information includes not only building roofs, but also building profiles. In this paper, the authors use TLS data, and explore an automatic model reconstruction approach to establish digital building model. The registered cloud points from multiple scanning stations are taken as input parameters. Profiles information of building is extracted from raw points cloud by a segmentation algorithm. And a regular polyhedron model of building is finally presented. The experiment results show that the automatic reconstruction procedure and algorithms are easy to implement and can get reasonable building model after facade boundary regularization.","2153-6996;21536996","Electronic:978-1-4799-1114-1; POD:978-1-4799-1112-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2013.6723073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6723073","","Algorithm design and analysis;Fitting;Image reconstruction;Laser modes;Three-dimensional displays;Windows","airborne radar;buildings (structures);data acquisition;feature extraction;image reconstruction;image segmentation;information retrieval;optical information processing;optical radar;optical scanners;roofs;solid modelling;virtual reality","LiDAR;TLS data;airborne laser scanning;automatic model reconstruction approach;boundary regularization;building profiles information extraction;building reconstruction;building roof;city buildings digitization;city buildings modeling;data acquisition;digital building model;light detection and range;multistations scanning;points cloud registration;raw points cloud;realistic 3D model reconstruction;regular polyhedron model;segmentation algorithm;terrestrial laser scanning data;virtual 3D city","","1","","8","","","21-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To learn a model to distinguish one writer from the other, it is important to capture every nuance of the handwriting of an individual. Learning such model poses two challenges. First, discriminatory variables maybe large and potentially related leading to a complex discriminatory function. Second, it will require large amount of training data to learn a complex and possibly high-dimensional function. In this study, the authors are proposing a semi-supervised framework for writer identification for offline handwritten documents that leverages the information hidden in the unlabelled samples. Proposed framework models the complexity of approximating the optimal hypothesis by breaking the main task into several subtasks and learning a separate hypothesis for each subtask. All the hypotheses pertaining to the subtasks will be used for the best model selection by retrieving a common substructure that has high correspondence with all the candidate hypotheses. The obtained substructure acts as a knowledge base that has the contextual information, which is otherwise difficult to retrieve.

Annotating documents rises as an interesting strategy to diminish the hard task of retrieving important documents from the Web. Annotations consist of associating metadata with text segments of a document, in order to facilitate its retrieval by search engines. Besides improving their performance, annotations enable an optimized indexation of documents. However, due to the huge amount of existing documents, the idea of generating document annotations is not a trivial task. This paper presents a proposal for automatically enriching documents with semantic annotations, where document terms are annotated according to a domain ontology. Currently there already exist some document annotation tools to automate this process. However, the main contribution of this work is focused on the ability of exploring the ontology inference capability and on the meta-annotation concept, which aim at providing users and automatic agents with a more powerful mechanism to retrieve information.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5119-7; POD:978-1-4799-1371-8","10.1109/ICSC.2013.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693512","Semantic annotation;document annotation;ontology-based retrieval","Cognition;Context;HTML;Ontologies;Semantics;Taxonomy;Vocabulary","document handling;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","automatic agents;document annotation;document retrieval;document terms;domain ontology;information management;meta data;meta-annotation concept;ontology-based reasoning approach;search engines;semantic annotations;text segments","","0","","27","","","16-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore it is necessary to rank the topics. The topic ranking should be done on the importance basis. But this importance is determined by how frequently a topic appears and this importance varies in different time slots. For extracting hot topics, most of the text mining approaches with vector space model need to determine the weighting of the feature terms. Existing traditional algorithms can't achieve high accuracy for retrieving hot terms, because they have not considered position, scattering and topicality.

It has been shown that classification systems based on such learned features exhibit state-of-the-art accuracy in many music classification benchmarks. Although the general approach of dictionary-based MIR has been shown effective, little work has been done to investigate the relationship between system performance and dictionary properties, such as the dictionary sparsity, coherence, and conditional number of the dictionary. This paper aims at addressing this issue by systematically evaluating the performance of three types of dictionary learning algorithms for the task of genre classification, including the least-square based RLS (recursive least square) algorithm, and two variants of the stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm ODL (online dictionary learning) with different regularization functions. Specifically, we learn the dictionary with the USPOP2002 dataset and perform genre classification with the GTZAN dataset. Our result shows that setting strict sparsity constraints in the RLS-based dictionary learning (i.e., <;1% of the signal dimension) leads to better accuracy in genre classification (around 80% when linear kernel support vector classifier is adopted). Moreover, we find that different sparsity constraints are needed for the dictionary learning phase and the encoding phase. Important links between dictionary properties and classification accuracy are also identified, such as a strong correlation between reconstruction error and classification accuracy in all algorithms. These findings help the design of future dictionary-based MIR systems and the selection of important dictionary learning parameters.","","Electronic:978-986-90006-0-4; POD:978-1-4799-2794-4","10.1109/APSIPA.2013.6694278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6694278","","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Dictionaries;Encoding;Kernel;Support vector machines","audio databases;gradient methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;music;pattern classification;stochastic processes","GTZAN dataset;MIR community;RLS-based dictionary learning algorithms;USPOP2002 dataset;classification accuracy;dictionary coherence;dictionary properties;dictionary sparsity;dictionary-based MIR systems;genre classification;large-scale music database;least-square based RLS algorithm;linear kernel support vector classifier;music information retrieval community;online dictionary learning;performance evaluation;reconstruction error;recursive least square algorithm;regularization functions;signal dimension;sparsity constraints;stochastic gradient descent-based algorithm ODL","","1","","26","","","Oct. 29 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Big Data can offer beneficial scenarios in the e-health arena. However, one of the scenarios can be that Big Data needs to be kept secured for a long time in order to gain its benefits such as finding cures for infectious diseases and keeping patients' privacy. From this connection, it is beneficial to analyze Big Data to make meaningful information while the data are stored in a secure manner. Thus, the analysis of various database encryption techniques is essential. In this study, we simulated 3 types of technical environments such as Plain-text, Microsoft Built-in Encryption, and custom Advanced Encryption Standard using Bucket Index in Data-as-a-Service. The results showed that custom AES-DaaS has faster range query response time than MS built-in encryption. In addition, while carrying out the scalability test, we acknowledged there are performance thresholds according to physical IT resources. Therefore, for the purpose of efficient Big Data management in e-health, it is noteworthy to examine its scalability limits as well even if it is under cloud computing environment. Furthermore, when designing an e-health database, both patients' privacy and system performance needs to be dealt as top priorities.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5801-9; POD:978-1-4673-5799-9","10.1109/HealthCom.2013.6720677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720677","AES;Big Data;Bloom filter;Bucket Index;DaaS;cloud;e-health;formatting;security","Data handling;Data storage systems;Encryption;Indexes;Information management;Scalability","cloud computing;cryptography;data analysis;data privacy;database management systems;diseases;health care;information retrieval;medical computing;ubiquitous computing","AES-DaaS;IT trends;Microsoft built-in encryption;big data analysis;big data management;bucket index;cloud computing environment;custom advanced encryption standard;data-as-a-service;database encryption techniques;infectious diseases;patient privacy;plain-text;scalability limits;secured e-health data retrieval;social networking;ubiquitous computing","","1","","18","","","9-12 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Speaker identification model for Assamese language using a neural framework","M. Sarma; K. K. Sarma","Dept. of Electron. & Electr. Eng., IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India","The 2013 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","20140109","2013","","","1","7","This paper presents a neural model of speaker identification using the vowel sound segmented out from words spoken by a speaker. Vowel sounds occur in a speech more frequently and with higher energy. Therefore, situations where acoustic information is noise corrupted vowel sounds can be used to extract different amounts of speaker discriminative information. The model explained here uses a neural framework formed with Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) where a novel Self Organizing Map (SOM) based vowel segmentation technique is used. The work extracts glottal source information of the speakers by Empirical-Mode Decomposition (EMD) of the speech signal and depending on which a LVQ based speaker code book is formed. The work shows the use of residual signal obtained from EMD of speech as a speaker discriminative feature. The neural approach of speaker identification gives superior performance in comparison to the conventional statistical approach like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) etc. found in literature. The work formulates a framework for the design of a ANN based speaker recognition model for Assamese language which is spoken by around three million people in the North East Indian state of Assam. Although the proposed model has been experimented in case of the speakers of Assamese language, it shall also be suitable for other Devanagari based languages for which the speaker database should contain samples of that specific language.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-6129-3; POD:978-1-4673-6127-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6707000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707000","","Artificial neural networks;Databases;Hidden Markov models;Speaker recognition;Speech;Speech processing;Speech recognition","audio databases;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;probability;self-organising feature maps;speaker recognition","ANN based speaker recognition model;Assamese language;Devanagari based languages;EMD;LVQ;LVQ based speaker code book;North East Indian state;PNN;SOM-based vowel segmentation technique;acoustic information;empirical-mode decomposition;glottal source information extraction;learning vector quantization;neural framework;neural model;noise corrupted vowel sounds;probabilistic neural network;residual signal;self organizing map based vowel segmentation technique;speaker database;speaker discriminative feature;speaker discriminative information;speaker identification model;speech signal","","1","","36","","","4-9 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many studies regarding the meaning of human genome sequences and the effort to identify the whole genome of other species. Although genes significantly affect phenotype, the importance of other factors have increased. In this paper, we propose an autocorrelation based method to arrange the repetitive elements which demonstrate a major part of the genomic sequences. The search for the entire genome based on a simple mathematical analysis will be given. The performance of our proposed self autocorrelation based method will be compared with that of conventional scheme for the human chromosome sequence. Fast scanning of the genome sequence based on our proposed scheme can give a clue to analyze the complex function of the genomic sequences.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3163-7; POD:978-1-4799-3164-4","10.1109/BIBE.2013.6701582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701582","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Biological cells;Correlation;DNA;Genomics;Mathematical analysis","biochemistry;bioinformatics;correlation methods;genomics;information retrieval;mathematical analysis;molecular biophysics;sequences","autocorrelation property;entire genome search;fast genome sequence scanning;fast locally repetitive element search;genes;genomic repetitive elements arrangement;genomic sequence complex function analysis;human chromosome sequence;human genome project;human genome sequences;mathematical analysis;phenotype;self autocorrelation based method;species genome identification","","0","","11","","","10-13 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Information search for children using Faceted navigation","K. A. Ullah; M. A. Iftikhar","Dept. of Inf. Technol., Univ. of Gujrat, Gujrat, Pakistan","2013 International Conference on Open Source Systems and Technologies","20140127","2013","","","28","33","Information search is one of the most common activities over Internet. Several search engines crawl the web round the clock and fetch useful information according to users' interest. To date, most of these search engines exploit the keyword based searching procedure which might be inappropriate for some naive users such as children. It may be very intricate for children to search their desired content effectively using the traditional `keyword based' search mechanism. They may fail to map the desired concept into appropriate keywords. To circumvent this situation, Faceted navigation is proposed as an effective alternate search method for children. Faceted navigation, also termed as Faceted search, is a specialized form of exploratory search that allows the users to search a domain on the basis of its attributes. We have performed several experiments to compare faceted search to the traditional query-based search mechanism. In particular, a faceted search based test interface has been designed. Children were asked to perform some pre-designated tasks on this system and their performance was analyzed on the said faceted search interface. A quantitative comparison was made with a query based search system using few quantitative performance metrics: keyword and spelling mistakes, number of missed pages and average accuracy. It is evident from experimental results that children performed much better on the proposed faceted search interface than query based search system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2047-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-2046-4; POD:978-1-4799-2048-8","10.1109/ICOSST.2013.6720601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6720601","exploratory search;faceted search;information search for children;keyword-based search","Accuracy;Internet;Prototypes;Search engines;Search problems;Sun;Web pages","information retrieval;search engines","Faceted search;accuracy metric;alternate search method;children;exploratory search;faceted navigation;information fetch;information search;keyword based searching procedure;keyword metric;missed pages metric;naive users;quantitative comparison;quantitative performance metrics;query-based search mechanism;search engines;spelling mistakes metric;user interest;web crawling","","0","","19","","","16-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This improvement resolves the problems that the definition of clique by CPM algorithm is too strict and does not meet the reality. Then, our research analysed the topic of the communities found by the improved CPM algorithm using Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method. And we obtained communities with a higher application value finally.

There is one core in common between all dynamic web application and that is their need to use a database to store information inside that and retrieve that information upon the user request or add, edit and delete them. Among all database types, rational databases are very popular. Most of relational database management systems such as MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, MS Access, Postgres use SQL as their language. Flexibility of SQL makes it a powerful language. It allows the user to ask what information he wants without having any knowledge about how the information will be fetch. However vast use of SQL based databases make it the center of attention of hackers. SQL injection attack is a well-known security threat to database driven web applications. A successful SQL injection attack reveals critical confidential information to the hacker. In this paper first we provided background information on this vulnerability. Next we present a comprehensive review of different types of SQL injection attack. For each attack we provide an example that shows how the attack launches. Finally we propose the best solution at development phase to defeat SQL injection and conclusion.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5133-3; POD:978-1-4799-3702-8","10.1109/ICICM.2013.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6702822","Information Security;SQL Injection;SQLIA;Web Application Vulnerability","Delays;Encoding;Programming;Relational databases;Security;Servers","Internet;SQL;computer crime;information retrieval systems;relational databases","Internet connection;MS Access;MS SQL Server;MySQL;Oracle;Postgres;SQL based databases;SQL injection attack taxonomy;banking;database driven Web applications;dynamic Web application;email;hackers;information retrieval;information storage;online business;online services;rational databases;relational database management systems;security threat;shopping;social networks","","6","","10","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new concept referred to as multi-view subspace agreement, which aims to learn a subspace for each view which respects the similarity relationships between data points in the other view. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised but exhibits discriminative characteristics and is thus well suited to applications such as retrieval and clustering where class labels are generally unavailable. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated under an audio-visual speaker retrieval experiment with the MOBIO database. The retrieval performance of the proposed approach out-performs other single-view or multi-view dimensionality reduction methods with a significant margin.","2157-4766;21574766","Electronic:978-1-4673-5593-3; POD:978-1-4673-5591-9","10.1109/WIFS.2013.6707786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707786","","Databases;Face;Noise measurement;Principal component analysis;Training","biometrics (access control);image recognition;information retrieval;pattern clustering;speaker recognition","MOBIO database;audio-visual speaker retrieval;class labels;clustering;multimodal biometrics retrieval;multiview subspace agreement;single-view dimensionality reduction methods;unsupervised multiview dimensionality reduction","","3","","15","","","18-21 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
