Existing tools for automation rely on extracting information in the form of device models and workload patterns from raw performance data collected from devices. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying such information extraction techniques on real-world data collected over a period of months from the data centers of two commercial enterprises. Real-world monitor data has several challenges that typically do not exist in controlled lab environments. Our analysis for creating models is using popular algorithms such as M5, CART, ARIMA and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The relative error rate in predicting device response time from real-world data is 40-45% - a similar experiment using data from a controlled lab environment has a relative error of 25%. Bootstrapping models for the two commercial datasets ran for 245 mins and 477 mins respectively, which illustrates the need for mechanisms that effectively deal with large enterprise scales. We describe one such technique that clusters devices with similar hardware configurations. With a cluster size of five devices, we were able to reduce the model creation time to 94 mins and 138 mins respectively. Finally, an interesting trade-off arises in model accuracy and computation time required to refine the model.","1526-7539;15267539","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2818-2; POD:978-1-4244-2817-5","10.1109/MASCOT.2008.4770579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4770579","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Delay;Error analysis;Error correction;Fast Fourier transforms;Hardware;Monitoring;Radio access networks;Storage automation","information retrieval;storage management","ARIMA;CART;M5;device models;fast Fourier transform;hardware configurations;information extraction;real-world monitor data;real-world storage management;storage deployments;workload patterns","","0","","33","","","8-10 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach firstly models user profile as feature vectors. Then pervasive device captures user's implicit feedback based on his/her reading behavior and delivers it to the server. At last, the server infers user interest and updates user profile by adjusting the weights of features to keep track of the dynamic change of user interest.

But none of them able to implement all distributed systems goals and have some limitation. The major part of these limitations is related to no clear quantity relation are defined for distributed systems concepts. These limitations cause the developments were very special purpose like P2P system. P2P systems were developed on internet that is a dynamically scalable and heterogeneous system. Therefore scalability is one of the important challenges in P2P systems. On the other hand P2P systems have tried to provide transparent sharing in the Internet, especially transparent access to resources. Access transparency is more important to P2P systems because it affects more the system configuration, dynamicity and performance therefore the other important challenge in P2P systems is access transparency. However in distributed systems there isn't any clear mathematic relation between these two concepts, scalability and access transparency. Although we know that any increase in the scalability of a P2P systems cause complexity in access transparency establishing because the frequency of data exchanges as well as the system's process communication time increases exponentially. It is thus important for a P2P system to decide dynamically how far to allow the scale up, given the additional overheads it has to suffer from establishing data access transparency. This tradeoff decision in the statically or dynamically created P2P system can be made either quite centrally by a single manager, completely distributed by independent machines, or in a hybrid way. In this paper we first define scalability concept base on set theories and then adapted concept of access transparency to P2P systems and define some metrics for it. Finally formulates the relation between scalability and access transparency in P2P systems. The relation hel- - ps to calculate the overhead of establishing data access transparency when a P2P system is scaled up.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2313-2; POD:978-1-4244-2312-5","10.1109/ICDFMA.2008.4784408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4784408","Access Transparency;Internet;Mathematical Relation;P2P Systems;Scalability","Collaboration;Computer networks;Distributed computing;Frequency;Internet;Joining processes;Mathematics;Peer to peer computing;Scalability;Set theory","Internet;electronic data interchange;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing","Internet;P2P system;data access transparency;data exchanges;distributed systems;peer-to-peer systems","","0","","16","","","21-22 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is based on the recording of differential absorption, the difference between local maxima and minima in the absorption spectrum of the probed gas species. The key procedures in the retrieval algorithms of the recorded DOAS spectra are the separation of the absorption into two parts that represent respectively broad and narrow spectral features and the evaluation of absorption spectra. In this paper three retrieval data processing methods, i.e.,complete integral algorithm, linear least-squares fitting algorithm and Fourier transform filtering algorithm, are studied. The experimental results show that the Fourier transform filtering algorithm has good performance: the maximum deviation is less than 3%. This new method can effectively correct overlapped spectra, reduces the noise and improves the accuracy of the DOAS system. The relative error is smaller than using complete integral algorithm and linear least-squares method.","","POD:978-0-7695-3490-9","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756709","Data Processing;Differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS);Fourier transform filtering;Least squares fitting algorithm","Absorption;Atmospheric measurements;Data processing;Filtering algorithms;Fourier transforms;Gases;Optical filters;Optical recording;Pollution measurement;Spectroscopy","Fourier transforms;data acquisition;environmental science computing;flue gases;information retrieval;integral equations;least squares approximations;spectra","Fourier transform filtering algorithm;complete integral algorithm;differential optical absorption spectroscopy;flue gas;gas species;linear least-squares fitting algorithm;maximum deviation;retrieval data processing methods","","0","","12","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an algorithm, called feedback-based distributed skyline (FDS), to support arbitrary horizontal partitioning. FDS aims at minimizing the network bandwidth, measured in the number of tuples transmitted over the network. The core of FDS is a novel feedback-driven mechanism, where the coordinator iteratively transmits certain feedback to each participant. Participants can leverage such information to prune a large amount of local data, which otherwise would need to be sent to the coordinator. Extensive experimentation confirms that FDS significantly outperforms alternative approaches in both effectiveness and progressiveness.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564468","Distributed databases;Spatial databases","","Internet;database management systems;distributed processing;feedback;information retrieval","Internet;distributed skyline retrieval;distributed systems;feedback-based distributed skyline;feedback-driven mechanism;low bandwidth consumption;restricted horizontal partitioning;skyline search;vertical partitioning","","20","","42","","20080715","March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A data item (in the repository) can belong to multiple categories and new data is continuously added to the system. In this paper, we describe a system, CS*, which takes a keyword query and returns the relevant top-K categories. In contrast, traditional keyword search returns the top-K documents (i.e., data items) relevant to a user query. The need to dynamically categorize new data and also update the meta-data required for fast responses to user queries poses interesting challenges. The brute force approach of updating the meta-data by comparing each new data item with all the categories is impractical due to (i) the large cost involved in finding the categories associated with a data item and (ii) the high rate of arrival of new data items. We show that a sampling based approach which provides statistical guarantees on the reported results is also impracticable. We hence develop the CS* approach whose effectiveness results from its ability to focus on a strategically chosen subset of categories on the one hand and a subset of new data on the other. Given a query, CS* finds the top-K categories with high accuracy even in time-constrained situations. An experimental evaluation of the CS* system using real world data shows that it can easily achieve accuracy in excess of 90%, whereas other approaches demand at least 57% more resources (i.e., processing power), for providing similar results. Our experimental results also show that, contrary to expectations, if the rate of arrival of data items doubles, whereas CS* continues to provide high accuracy without a significant increase in resources, other approaches require more than double the number of resources.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:978-1-4244-3422-0","10.1109/ICDE.2009.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812408","Dynamic Data;Keyword Search;categorized search","Blogs;Costs;Data engineering;Data systems;Educational institutions;Keyword search;Sampling methods;Search engines;Stock markets;USA Councils","document handling;information retrieval;meta data","dynamic categorized information;information repository;keyword query;keyword search;meta-data;queries poses;time-constrained situations;top-K categories;top-K documents","","3","","15","","","March 29 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we design three models for this task, including a profile-based model, a thread-based model, and a cluster-based model. Second, we re-rank the user expertise measured in probability by utilizing the structural relations among users in a forum system.

Rough set theory (RST) is one of the powerful approaches in data mining, which has been demonstrated to have its usefulness in successfully solving a variety of problems. But there is almost no literature related to the distributed computation in RST. In this paper, the relation between the cores of partitioned data and global data are discussed. An useful proposition is obtained, which shows that the union of the cores of partitioned data is determinedly included in the core of global data. In following, two algorithms, DMC and PPDMC, are proposed for distributed mining of core on horizontally partitioned data. DMC concerns the reduction of time complexity while PPDMC focuses on privacy preserving. Experiment and propositions show the excellent function of DMC and PPDMC through practical and academic ways. Just because the pivotal status of core in RST, the algorithms proposed in this paper will show good foreground in distributed data mining.","","POD:978-0-7695-3490-9","10.1109/PACIIA.2008.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756746","Core;Distributed data mining;Rough set theory","Computational intelligence;Computer industry;Computer networks;Conferences;Data analysis;Data mining;Distributed computing;Distributed decision making;Mining industry;Partitioning algorithms","data analysis;data mining;distributed databases;information retrieval;rough set theory;security of data","distributed data mining;horizontally partitioned data;knowledge discovery;knowledge extraction;massive databases;privacy preservation;rough set theory","","0","","7","","","19-20 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a large number of organizations have documents that lack metadata. The lack of metadata breaks off not only the discovery and dissemination of these documents over the Internet, but also their connectivity with other documents. Unfortunately, manual metadata extraction is expensive and time-consuming for a large document, and most existing automated metadata extraction approaches have focused on specific domains and homogeneous documents. In this paper, we propose a combined cased-based and template-based metadata extraction approach to solve these issues. The key idea of solving the heterogeneity is to classify documents into equivalent groups so that each document group contains similar documents only. Next, for each document group we have a template of previous case that contains a process to extract metadata from documents in the group.","","POD:978-0-7695-3516-6","10.1109/ICACC.2009.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777353","Case-based Reasoning;Heterogeneous Documents;Metada Extraction;Template-based Reasoning","Art;Artificial intelligence;Communication system control;Communications technology;Data mining;Educational institutions;Government;Internet;Laboratories;Nonhomogeneous media","classification;document handling;information retrieval;meta data","case-based metadata extraction;document classification;heterogeneous Thai document;template-based metadata extraction","","1","","11","","","22-24 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Real-world applications often require that the output of multiple IE systems be joined to produce the data of interest. To optimize the execution of a join of multiple extracted relations, it is not sufficient to consider only execution time. In fact, the quality of the join output is of critical importance: unlike in the relational world, different join execution plans can produce join results of widely different quality whenever IE systems are involved. In this paper, we develop a principled approach to understand, estimate, and incorporate output quality into the join optimization process over extracted relations. We argue that the output quality is affected by (a) the configuration of the IE systems used to process documents, (b) the document retrieval strategies used to retrieve documents, and (c) the actual join algorithm used. Our analysis considers several alternatives for these factors, and predicts the output quality - and, of course, the execution time - of the alternate execution plans. We establish the accuracy of our analytical models, as well as study the effectiveness of a quality-aware join optimizer, with a large-scale experimental evaluation over real-world text collections and state-of-the-art IE systems.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:978-1-4244-3422-0","10.1109/ICDE.2009.138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812402","Information extraction;text databases","Corporate acquisitions;Data engineering;Data mining;Heart;Information analysis;Information services;Internet;Relational databases;Text processing;Web sites","information retrieval;information retrieval systems;optimisation","document retrieval strategies;information extraction output;information extraction systems;join optimization process","","1","2","17","","","March 29 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that collecting such operational data often requires significant instrumentation or intrusiveness, which is difficult to realize in production data centers. Such constraints complicate the deployment of existing techniques or limit their effectiveness in practice.

Existing remedies to PageRank are mostly heuristic approaches.

In this paper, we present a framework of ontology learning that enables us to retrieve documents from the Web using focused crawling in a biological domain, amphibian morphology.

The current suite of sensors is maturing and the data sets derived from these sensors are slowly being integrated into science research programs. As NASA moves on to new missions and other funding priorities, it is likely that the funding to maintain these data in a highly interactive data system will decrease. The challenge to the NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAAC) in general and to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) DAAC in particular is to prioritize holdings, delegating lower priority data sets to lower cost management systems and perhaps lower levels of service. In order to address these data prioritization requirements, the NSIDC DAAC is experimenting with data maturity and levels of service scaling systems, thus permitting discussion of data set importance to our users in a more quantitative and less subjective manner. The Maturity Index (MI) is divided into three categories: scientific maturity, preservation maturity, and societal impact. In both the MI and Level of Service (LOS) categorizations, attempts are made convert descriptive categories into ordinal scales, with a resultant score for each data set. If this system proves successful, it could offer data managers a mechanism to assess data set value and defend high value data sets to the science community and federal funding agencies.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779423","data archive prioritization;satellite data management","Calibration;Councils;Data systems;Documentation;Earth Observing System;Environmental management;NASA;Production;Resource management;Satellites","information retrieval;records management;remote sensing;scientific information systems","NASA Distributed Active Archive Centers;NASA Earth Observing System;National Snow and Ice Data Center;data access;data preservation;data records maintenance;data set prioritization;level of service categorization;maturity index;preservation maturity;satellite-based remote sensing;scientific maturity;societal impact","","1","","7","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The query is then matched to the cluster, taking advantage of multiple samples to yield a robust decision. Two, automatic audio-visual association is performed which allows a bi-modal retrieval of clips, even when the query is uni-modal. Three, the biometric recognition uses individual-specific score distributions learnt from the clusters, in a likelihood ratio based decision framework that obviates the need for explicit normalization or modality weighting.

The need to develop a search engine based architectural model for people to search through the Web. Broad Web search engines as well as many more specialized search tools rely on Web crawlers to acquire large collections of pages for indexing and analysis. The crawler is an important module of a web search engine. The quality of a crawler directly affects the searching quality of such Web search engines. Such a Web crawler may interact with millions of hosts over a period of weeks or months, and thus issues of robustness, flexibility, and manageability are of major importance. Given some URLs, the crawler should retrieve the Web pages of those URLs, parse the HTML files, add new URLs into its queue and go back to the first phase of this cycle. The crawler also can retrieve some other information from the HTML files as it is parsing them to get the new URLs. In this paper, we describe the design of a Web crawler that uses PageRank algorithm for distributed searches and can be run on a network of workstations. The crawler scales to several hundred pages per second, is resilient against system crashes and other events, and can be adapted to various crawling applications. We present Web mining architecture of the system and describe efficient techniques for achieving high performance.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3473-2","10.1109/APSCC.2008.259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4780726","Crawler;Data Mining;PageRank;Web Mining","Crawlers;HTML;Indexing;Internet;Robustness;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web mining;Web search;Web sites","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;search engines","HTML files;HyperText Markup Language;Internet search;URL;Universal Resource Locator;Web crawler;Web mining architectural model;Web mining architecture;Web pages;Web search engines;World Wide Web;distributed crawler;distributed search;pagerank algorithm;parsing","","2","","8","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present Nabu - a Web metasearch engine that, for a given user query, customizes the results obtained from an underlying search service with the aim of providing effective retrieval on Macedonian Web collections. In addition to the main Web search service, Nabu also offers services such as news, hardware, image and video search, which makes it a fully-featured Macedonian Web search portal.

With support from NASA, NOAA, and ONR, UMASS has collaborated with NOAA-NESDIS and NOAA-AOC to operate the instrument aboard the NOAA WP-3D ""Hurricane Hunter"" aircraft since the 2002 hurricane season and for four winter experiments sampling high-latitude storms. The goals of these experiments have been to characterize storm boundary layers and to develop improved retrievals for space-based scatterometers, specifically, NASA SeaWinds Scatterometer on QuikSCAT and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) which was developed by ESA on behalf of EUMETSAT IWRAP is a conically-scanning, dual-frequency (C- and Ku-band) coherent radar with dual-polarization capability. The incidence angles are nominally: 30, 35, 40, and 50 degrees. At times, the instrument has been configured to address specific scientific and engineering problems. Examples include: C-band measurements of high incidence angle backscatter for ASCAT validation, and C-band horizontal polarization measurements to develop a high wind speed geophysical model function (GMF). Independent measurements of surface wind speed and column integrated rain rate are made coincidently with the UMass Simultaneous Frequency Radiometer (USFMR) and AOC Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR). Since 2005, IWRAP has operated in a raw data mode, recording individual radar pulses to enable the separation of near surface backscatter contributions (i.e. surface scattering versus volume scattering). The intensity of tropical cyclones ranged from tropical storm to category five hurricane, and high-latitude storms with up to hurricane force winds. Currently, we are post-processing and standardizing IWRAP raw data collected since 2005. This effort is intended to expand the utility of IWRAP and (USFMR/SFMR) measurements beyond the scope of the initially proposed research projects by maki- - ng a standardized dataset available to the larger scatterometer community as well as the hurricane and high-latitude storms research communities.

In this paper, a new model of IC is presented, which relies on hierarchical structure alone. The model considers not only the hyponyms of each word sense but also its depth in the structure. The IC value is easier to calculate based on our model, and when used as the basis of a similarity approach it yields judgments that correlate more closely with human assessments than others, which using IC value obtained only considering the hyponyms and IC value got by employing corpus analysis.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3546-3; POD:978-1-4244-3430-5","10.1109/FGCNS.2008.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4813554","Information Content;Semantic Similarity;WordNet","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Conferences;Educational institutions;History;Humans;Integrated circuit modeling;Knowledge engineering;Ontologies;Physics","information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","WordNet;corpus analysis;human assessments;information content;semantic similarity;word knowledge","","26","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But, the accuracy of extraction is not very satisfactory, especially for named entity extraction. In this work, we analyze the reasons of it and propose a novel method to improve the accuracy. Existing methods extract information from a text which is collected from a single source. This is very difficult to extract the exact information we need. From the Internet, one could easily find tens of sources for the same information (e.g. particular news). In this work, we propose to combine information extracted from multiple sources using a majority voting to find the information we needed. We use Change of CEO as an example and we extract the new CEO, original CEO and the company name for the event.

Due to searcherspsila limited medical knowledge and the taskpsilas inherent difficulty, searchers often cannot find desired search results in a single pass and have to search iteratively for multiple passes. For this purpose, iMed provides an iterative search advisor that guides searchers to refine their inputs.

The two kinds of algorithms don't keep the paragraph information of the original page either. In this paper, a new basic semantic unit (BSU) with granularity between nodes in the DOM tree and content block is defined. Two different methods based on BSU, using clustering and heuristic rules are developed to extract page content. The clustering method gets the best precision 96.88%; while the heuristic rules obtain the best F1-value 95.28%.

In this paper we propose a novel approach of VGE using a topological model. This approach provides an exact representation of GIS data, allowing an accurate geometrical exploitation. Moreover, our model can merge and represent several semantic information, even if spatially overlapping.

By far the most popular data served by the NSIDC DAAC are derived from Earth-observing remote sensing instruments aboard polar orbiting satellites. These instruments include Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/ Imager (SSM/I), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), and Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). Observations made by these Earth-observing sensors are a valuable resource for polar researchers. However, the Earth science community, and in particular the polar research community, often have problems accessing data that are suitable for a specific study. These difficulties range from accessing data from large-volume archives to effectively using the data upon delivery. NSIDC's responsibility is to facilitate the user's data acquisition experience by reducing the inefficiencies in data discovery and by providing data users with software utilities that assist the scientist with using the delivered data. NSIDC and a group of collaborators have proposed to create an advanced multi-faceted web service for data access, browse, overlay, manipulation, and delivery that integrates several important data sets for cryospheric analysis.

This is because interaction with objects can give us valuable insights with regard to behavior. The problem is that in an environment where multiple users interact with the same object, it is difficult to obtain data relating to each individual. To this end, we propose a model that extracts individual data from a data set. We can recognize individual users in environments where multiple users interact with an object. The model consists of 3 policies. As a result of our experiment, we proved that the system could extract individual data that fits an individual examinee's consciousness an average of 85.3% of the time. In addition, by letting each examinee look back on the system results, we could make the examinee conscious of behavior of which they had previously been unaware.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2966-0; POD:978-1-4244-2965-3","10.1109/ISWPC.2009.4800568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4800568","activity recognition;context-awareness;individualization;pervasive application","Acceleration;Data mining;Home appliances;Humans;Indium tin oxide;Joining processes;Radiofrequency identification;TV;Telephony;Wearable sensors","information retrieval;ubiquitous computing;user interfaces","activity recognition;context-awareness;data set;individual data extraction model;pervasive application","","0","","8","","","11-13 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, due to the nature of these data structures, I/O libraries are often complicated and expensive to maintain. As a consequence, the long-term archival of data stored in multiple formats becomes an expensive and challenging task. In this paper, we demonstrate an alternative solution, namely migration of data to a single standards-based archive format.

Automated machine learning systems using clustering techniques have only partially succeeded in addressing these newly arising requirements, failing in their endeavor to properly assign short-term hype topics to long-term trends.

The traditional methods are based on pattern matching and linguistic analysis, which mainly depend on the measurement of feature similarity. But due to two reasons, those methods are basically inefficient to process Chinese news topic extraction from Internet. The first reason is the difficulty of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Chinese, and the other is the diversity and fast update speed of Internet news. At the present, some works utilizing news special structure (e.g. title) for Chinese news topic are presented. However, two problems still remain unsolved so far, which are (1) missing of some news topic and (2) irregular topic words produced. Aiming to solve these two problems, we propose a POS-based approach to news topic extraction. We first segment words and tag POS for news title, and then eliminate segmentation errors according to POS information and position relation. After that, topic words are associated and combined into bigger ones, and different topic weights are assigned to those bigger words. We conduct an experiment on 600 Chinese news Web pages to demonstrate our new approach. The experimental results show that our approach has a higher recall and precision rate of news topic extraction and reduces irregular topic words obviously.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3546-3; POD:978-1-4244-3430-5","10.1109/FGCNS.2008.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4813517","","Computer science;Conferences;Data mining;IP networks;Internet;Pattern analysis;Pattern matching;Search engines;Thesauri;Web pages","Internet;information resources;information retrieval;natural language processing;search engines;word processing","Chinese news topic extraction;Internet;natural language processing;news search engine;novel POS-approach;topic word segmentation","","2","","9","","","13-15 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The estimation is usually conducted through linear transformations. These methods, though manifested in different mathematical forms, are all based on treating hyperspectral images as the data sets produced by linear stochastic processes, which may contradict the physical processes involved in the formation of hyperspectral imagery. We investigate in this study the dimensionality of a hyperspectral data by using a nonlinear time series analysis approach - false neighbour method. The investigation is conducted based on pixels of different land-cover types. It is found that the estimated dimensionality of the hyperspectral data is markedly smaller than that derived based on linear transformations. This indicates that the hyperspectral data can be embedded tightly in a lower dimensional space if nonlinearity is considered. It is also found that dimensionality may change among different land-cover types.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2808-3; POD:978-1-4244-2807-6","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779288","dimensionality;hyperspectral;nearest neighbours;nonlinearity;time series analysis","Computer science;Feature extraction;Forestry;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Principal component analysis;Resource management;Solar radiation;Stochastic processes;Time series analysis","geophysical signal processing;information retrieval;time series","dimensionality;false neighbour method;hyperspectral data;information extraction;time series","","0","","14","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
