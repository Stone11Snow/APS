However some youth will take the initiative to seek out this bad information. In this paper we propose a method to analyze the searching behavior of youth and then to shield those keywords that may impact their health over time. We suggest that search engine operators provide keywords filtering technology to limit the searching behavior of youth. Operators should return to warning users who search keywords that contain bad information and record the searching log as feedback to parents. Of course parents should provide their IP addresses to the search engine operators first, to allow operators to set their IP addresses within the scope of supervising. Relying on search logs we count and classify keywords to understand the trend of youths' searching behavior and the areas that they often are interested in. Then we cluster the keywords in each area to get some main clusters and frequent keywords. Using this method we can grasp youths' searching behavior and protect them from the impact of bad information effectively.","","Electronic:978-0-615-51608-0; POD:978-1-4577-1449-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978793","bad informations;classify;cluster;searching behavior;shield","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Internet;Machine learning algorithms;Search engines;Text categorization;Training","Internet;behavioural sciences computing;information retrieval;pattern classification;pattern clustering;search engines;security of data","IP addresses;Internet era;cyber security;cyberspace environment;gambling;keywords filtering technology;pornography;search engine operators;searching log;youth searching behavior analysis","","0","","4","","","1-2 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a new MH based algorithm that extracts both the topics expressed in large text document collections and also models how the authors of documents use those topics. The methodology is illustrated using a sample of 1740 documents and 2037 authors of NIPS conference papers. A novel feature of our model is the inclusion of MH sampling for author topic models, in which authors are modeled as probability distributions over topics. The author-topic models can be used to support a variety of interactive and exploratory queries on the dataset. Algorithm proposed in this paper is the implementation of enhanced author topic modeling in text collection for extraction of topics from documents which will be useful for efficient search and retrieval. This paper presents an unsupervised learning technique for extracting information from the real world large text collections. This involves clustering which is used for extracting a representation from a collection of documents. Each cluster is associated with a topic and a single document is associated in only one cluster. Traditional Author Topic Model encounters problem in case of multi topic documents. Experimental results using proposed algorithm achieved the same classification accuracy with reduced time (50%) to extract the topics.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0590-8; POD:978-1-4577-0588-5","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972315","Automatic Categorization;Gibbs sampling;Metropolis Hasting sampling;Probabilistic Author Topic Model;Unsupervised Learning","Computational modeling;Computer science;Data mining;Data models;Information processing;Probabilistic logic;Vocabulary","data mining;information retrieval;probability;text analysis;unsupervised learning","MH based algorithm;Web;author topic model based unsupervised algorithm;automatic extraction;data mining;digital libraries;information extraction;large text document collections;probability distributions","","0","","16","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, a regular hexagon window, whose center was the candidate circle's center, was selected as search constraints to reduce the computation time and increase the calculation speed. At last, the marginal gradient direction information was used as constraint conditions to limit retrieval object. Thus invalid computation was reduced and the detection speed was accelerated. The proposed algorithm was used to detect circular parts size. Experimental results show that the measurement error is less than 4.5%. And the performances of the non-contact inspection system can meet the demands of on-line and real time measurement with high accuracy in the production line.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0856-5; POD:978-1-4577-0855-8","10.1109/PACCS.2011.5990212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990212","","Equations;Image edge detection;Inspection;Machine vision;Mathematical model;Size measurement;Transforms","Hough transforms;edge detection;information retrieval systems;inspection;measurement errors;mechanical engineering computing;object detection;size measurement","Zernike moment;candidate circle center;circular part detection;circular part size inspection system;improved RHT algorithm;limit retrieval object;marginal gradient direction information;measurement error;noncontact inspection system;online measurement;production line;real time measurement;regular hexagon window;search constraint;sub-pixel edge detection;target edge positioning","","0","","5","","","17-18 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

UML state machine diagrams can properly describe the behavior of large software systems at the design level. The slicing of UML state machine diagrams is helpful for their maintenance. But it is difficult to apply a slicing algorithm to automatically reduce the diagrams with respect to slicing criteria, because of the unique properties of these diagrams, such as hierarchy and orthogonality. These properties make constructing a data dependence graph highly complicated. Hierarchy between states leads to implicit paths between states, which may affect data dependence. Also, orthogonality (i.e., parallelism) can cause an intransitivity problem when tracing data dependence. In this paper, we discuss an approach to address such problems. We first construct a control flow graph, which explicitly describes all possible transitions; and a hierarchy graph, which depicts the hierarchical structure of state machine diagram. Next we retrieve data dependence information and construct a dependence graph across different levels. We also show how data dependence information is retrieved, by virtue of ATM example.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4453-3; POD:978-1-4577-0780-3","10.1109/SSIRI.2011.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992010","UML state machine diagrams;behaviors of states;data dependence;hierarchy;orthogonality;slicing","Adaptation models;Asynchronous transfer mode;Concurrent computing;Firing;Flow graphs;Parallel processing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;control charts;data flow graphs;data reduction;finite state machines;information retrieval;program slicing;software maintenance","UML;control flow graph;data dependence graph;hierarchy graph;information retrieval;reduction technique;slicing techniques;software maintenance;software systems;state machine diagrams","","0","","17","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has impacted virtually on all aspects of human endeavor, most especially on how information is generated, processed, and disseminated. Individuals have become highly sophisticated, professionalized, and demanding on both the system and the information professionals to satisfy their ever increasing information requirements. While a lot of progress can be seen in efforts being made to meet the needs of various professional groups such as engineers, lawyers, medical practitioners, scientists, administrators etc through the development of specialized databases and tailor-made information retrieval systems (IRS), the Ulama the most influential professional group in the Muslim world, vested with the responsibility of preaching, counseling, administration, and providing religious leadership to the Muslims is neglected. This paper looks at the problems being faced by the Ulama using ICT to search for information to enable them perform their roles effectively. Among several factors identified, lack of a comprehensive Islamic Database and a suitable Information Retrieval System (IRS) is among the factors militating against the use of ICT by the Ulama.

Prytz","Marine Geophysical Laboratory, James Cook University, Townsville, Australia","OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain","20110825","2011","","","1","4","The Australian Coastal Ocean Radar Network includes eight WERA phased array radar stations. The stations are configured in pairs in order to produce high quality gridded surface current data at 10-minute intervals at four sites. Other gridded parameters of significant wave height, dominant wave period, Bragg peak energies and directional wave spectral information are also extracted from the radar sea-echoes. Three of the sites operate at 8-9 MHz, giving ranges of up to 200 km for surface currents, while the fourth site operates in the 13-14 MHz band and has an operating range of 150 km. Each pair of radar stations operates on the same frequency and separation is achieved by an alternating sequence of 5 minutes on and 5 minutes off. First-Look analyses are carried out at the radar sites by proprietary WERA software and are transmitted by broadband phone connections to a base laboratory for operational monitoring and preparation for archiving. These data are attached to metadata in netCDF format and sent to the archive. Raw data (time series) are stored at the radar stations for each of the elements of the phased array receive antennas. At this stage the data have been sorted into range bins by the WERA firmware and a Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) reduction process is applied using a scan of the band by the radar receiver immediately prior to each 5-minute run. These time series data are returned to the laboratory on hard disks in a delayed mode every 2-3 months on a regular maintenance program. Delayed-mode re-processing is carried out using software developed by ACORN to achieve improved identification of Bragg peaks and subsequent improved parameter extraction. At this stage gridded data are combined from each pair of stations to produce hourly maps of surface current vectors and directional wave spectra. Quality flags are set for each data value before the delayed-mode data are filed for archiving.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0088-0; POD:978-1-4577-0086-6","10.1109/Oceans-Spain.2011.6003440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6003440","","Arrays;Chirp;Quality control;Radar;Sea measurements;Sea surface","firmware;information retrieval systems;interference suppression;marine radar;meta data;oceanographic equipment;phased array radar;radar computing;radar interference;radar receivers;radiofrequency interference;receiving antennas","Australian Coastal ocean radar network;Bragg peak energy;WERA firmware;WERA phased array radar stations;data archive;delayed-mode reprocessing;directional wave spectral information;distance 150 km;frequency 13 MHz to 14 MHz;frequency 8 MHz to 9 MHz;hard disks;metadata;parameter extraction;phased array HF radars;phased array receive antennas;quality flags;radar receiver;radar sea-echoes;radio frequency interference reduction process;raw data;surface current vectors;time 10 min;time series data","","7","","1","","","6-9 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on enhancing their processing based on indexing structures. Indexes, like R-trees, cannot avoid backtracking to process them. This feature weakens suitability of such an index to several data access modes within mobile environments. To meet needs of these environments, we propose a novel index called VN-tree (Voronoi-Neighbors tree), based on the Voronoi diagram and its dual graph (the Delaunay Triangulation) of the candidate points of interest. VN-tree adopts a non-overlapping partitioning scheme and supports backtracking-free search algorithms to answer several types of queries. In particular, processing continuous nearest neighbor queries is a straightforward use of VN-tree. We conduct various experiments to compare VN-tree with R*-tree as in-memory indexes in the on-demand data access mode. Main results show that VN-tree consistently provides outstanding performances.","2376-6492;23766492","Electronic:978-1-4244-9538-2; POD:978-1-4244-9539-9","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982841","Voronoi diagram;indexing structres;location-dependent applications;nearest neighbors search","Artificial neural networks;Indexing;Mobile communication;Nearest neighbor searches;Partitioning algorithms;Time factors","backtracking;computational geometry;indexing;information retrieval;mobile computing;query processing;search problems","R-tree;VN-tree;Voronoi diagram;Voronoi-neighbor tree;backtracking-free search algorithm;data access mode;efficient nearest neighbor query search;in-memory index;indexing structure;location based service;mobile environment;non-overlapping a partitioning scheme","","0","","17","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach has been previously studied for information-flow security of shared-variable concurrent programs, but the price for compositionality is very high: a thread must be extremely pessimistic about what an environment might do with shared resources. This pessimism leads to many intuitively secure threads being labelled as insecure. Since in practice it is only meaningful to compose threads which follow an agreed protocol for data access, we take advantage of this to develop a more liberal compositional security condition. The idea is to give the security definition access to the intended pattern of data usage, as expressed by assumption-guarantee style conditions associated with each thread.

We compared the resulting data retrieval performance with non-autonomic versions, using various combinations of network capacity, membership churn and workload patterns. Overall, autonomic management yielded improved retrieval performance.

Our proposed method combines tree projection and prefix growth features from pattern-growth category with position coded feature from early-pruning category, all of these features are key characteristics of their respective categories, so we consider our proposed method as a pattern growth / early-pruning hybrid algorithm that considerably reduces execution time.

This work is the first step towards an infrastructure allowing people to know in a very easy way the information they need. This paper exploits the Search Computing paradigm. It is a new way for composing data. While state-of-art search systems answer generic or domain-specific queries, Search Computing enables answering questions via a constellation of cooperating data sources, called search services, which are correlated by means of join operations. Search Computing aims at responding to queries over multiple semantic fields of interest; thus, Search Computing fills the gap between generalized search systems, which are unable to find information spanning multiple topics, and domain-specific search systems, which cannot go beyond their domain limits.","","Electronic:978-0-9564263-8-3; POD:978-1-61284-148-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978535","integration;query;search","Manuals","Internet;Web sites;government data processing;public administration;query processing;question answering (information retrieval)","Internet revolution;Web sites;data sources;domain specific queries;domain specific search system;e-government;generic queries;public administration;search computing paradigm;search services;semantic fields","","0","","33","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider networked systems from various domains including control, communications, sensing, sociology, economics and biology. We first describe a general model for modeling such systems that involves several interacting dynamic multigraphs. These multigraphs evolve in at least three planes. At the higher plane (layer) we have the network of cognitive agents, where decisions are made and executed. At the intermediate plane (layer) we have the information network, where data, models, observations and signalling are represented. At the lower plane (layer) we have the communication network that supports the information and agent networks. There are several ways to capture these ideas and principles, and the one presented here is one of the simpler possible representations. The lower layer is more connected to the physical layer, while the middle and higher layer are more logical. The networks involve have links and nodes that are annotated by weights that can be scalar, vector or even policies and rules. Furthermore the networks are dynamic. The resulting dynamic models are very complex and require a combination of methods from analysis, algebra, logic and optimization. The simplest possible model involves two interacting multigraphs: (a) the collaboration multigraph, which describes the time varying relation of collaboration between the agents; and (b) the communication multigraph, which describes the time varying communications that occur between the agents. We link these concepts to ideas from distributed computing, distributed programs and distributed computer hardware. We also link this representation to the behavior and structure models used in modern model-based-systems engineering. We describe a novel path-oriented characterization of these activities in networked dynamic systems. Next we introduce three fundamental problems and challenges emerging from thi- - s framework. The first addresses the joint analysis of the collaboration and communication multigraphs and their impact on the performance of the networked system. The second fundamental problem addresses the development of a taxonomy of collaboration and communication multigraphs, from the perspective of system performance. The third fundamental problem addresses the need for different probability models for such cooperative networked systems. We relate the new framework, emerging from the results of the first and second problems, and its basic constructs, to information and control patterns, generalized information theory and entropy, and to distributed computing with local states. This new framework indicates the need for a new kind of probability over dynamical logical structures that is reminiscent of the axiomatic framework of quantum physics.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0125-2; POD:978-1-4577-0124-5","10.1109/MED.2011.5983087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983087","","Biological system modeling;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Conferences;Games;Network topology;Topology","Hilbert spaces;convex programming;decision making;game theory;graph theory;information retrieval systems;multi-agent systems;networked control systems;probabilistic logic;software engineering;telecommunication network management","Kolmogorov type model;Small World graph;biological network;biological swarm;cognitive agent;collaboration multigraph;communication graph topology;communication multigraph;communication network;constrained coalitional game;convex optimization problem;cooperative networked system;cyberphysical system;decision making;distributed computer hardware;distributed computing;distributed information retrieval system;economic network;event triggered dynamics;finite dimensional Hilbert space;graph optimization problem;information flow;information model;interacting dynamic multigraph;least partial asynchrony;logic model;model based system engineering;multiple graph coalitional game;network science;networked control system;networked multiagent system;path oriented characterization;probabilistic model;quantum physics;robotic swarm;selforganized communication multigraph;sense-decide-actuate system;time varying communication","","0","","20","","","20-23 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Shared-computer is increasingly used to support web collaborative explorative activities because learners can be facilitated to promote shared understanding of the workspace and enhance effective communications. However, implementing shared-computer can also be inefficient and frustrating because learners have to spend extra time and cognitive resources to negotiate with the web search. This may discourage learners to positively participate the activity. Hence, the study proposes a the 1:1 group (shared-computer integrated one person for one computer) so that learners can individually search web information with their personal laptop according to their strategies and preferences, and then use shared-computer to share their information and interact with peers. An empirical study involved nine graduate students is conducted to examine the learner's interaction behaviors in two scenarios: 1:1 and shared-computer.

Search time, which is an important factor for hashing in practice, is usually not addressed explicitly. In this paper, we develop a new scalable hashing algorithm with joint optimization of search accuracy and search time simultaneously. Our method generates compact hash codes for data of general formats with any similarity function. We evaluate our method using diverse data sets up to 1 million samples (e.g., web images).

Usually, the HFS object is incompatible with social justice or violation of the mainstream moral characters, or events. This ""violation of moral"" triggers the HFS process either in the cyberspace or in the real world. HFS has arose numerous controversies, especially the dilemmas between privacy violation and public opinion. Literatures and studies of HSF are mainly from China. International journals or periodical literatures target on this issue are very few. In addition, current studies are mainly qualitative studies lacking of quantitative and theoretical model building and empirical research. Therefore, it is necessary to acquire better understanding of HSF structure and evolving process. The purpose of this paper is to provide a broad discussion and summarized attributes of HFS.

This paper proposes a novel efficient network management framework to tackle the above challenges, where four key design elements are introduced. First is the QoI satisfaction index, where the QoI benefit the queries receive is quantified in relation to the level they require. Second is the credit satisfaction index, where the credits are used by the network operator to motivate the user participation, and this index is to quantify its degree of satisfaction. Third is the Gur Game-based distributed energy control, where the above two indexes are used as inputs to the mathematical framework of the Gur Game for distributed decision-making. Fourth is the dynamic pricing scheme, based on a constrained optimization problem to allocate credits to the participants while minimizing the necessary adaptation of the pricing scheme from the network operator. We finally evaluate the proposed scheme under an event occurrence detection scenario, where the proposed scheme successfully guarantees less than 7% detection outage, saves 80% of the energy reserve if compared with the lower bound solution, and achieves the suboptimum with only 4% gap if compared with optimal solution.","2155-5486;21555486","Electronic:978-1-4577-0093-4; POD:978-1-4577-0094-1","10.1109/SAHCN.2011.5984882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5984882","","Automata;Games;Humans;Indexes;Pricing;Sensors;Smart phones","decision making;game theory;information retrieval;mobile radio;optimisation;power control;telecommunication network management","Gur Game-based distributed energy control;QoI requirements;constrained optimization problem;context-aware information retrieval;context-aware participatory sensing;credit satisfaction index;distributed decision-making;dynamic pricing scheme;energy supply maintenance;mathematical framework;network management;quality-of-information;sensor-embedded smartphones","","21","","24","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cater to such a high priority and specialized service application, there is a need to provide an independent IP mobility service framework that would meet the stringent communication requirements of the mobile emergency managers, without requiring any changes/modifications to the existing public communication network infrastructure. With this motivation, we present a novel secure mobility management solution framework called enhanced Client based Secure Handoff for Mobile Units (eCSH-MU), which extends our previously proposed CSH-MU solution. The eCSH-MU solution is a deployable solution, in which the entire mobility functions are managed by the client side, and hence is independent of the underlying network architecture.

In recent years, several architectures and models have been proposed in order to limit access to resources and ensure that data are available only to authorized users, programs or processes. These models in most cases are not dynamic and the permissions assigned to users are granted based on a static policy. A mechanism that will allow exception access to data, for example to medical information, in case of an emergency is needed. In current systems, emergency access techniques are not well defined and are used in an ad hoc manner on top of the access control mechanisms implemented without using parameters such as time, location or hierarchy of the actors involved in the system. In this paper, we present a model that provides both a normal access control based on roles and also a mechanism that is used in order to provide exception access to data in case of an emergency. The proposed emergency access mechanism is time aware and takes into account the mobility and location of users, also it grants exception access with a controlled manner in case of an emergency utilizing role hierarchies.","1530-1346;15301346","Electronic:978-1-4577-0681-3; POD:978-1-4577-0680-6; USB:978-1-4577-0678-3","10.1109/ISCC.2011.5983932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5983932","Access control;Break The Glass;Electronic Healthcare Record;Emergency Access;Spatio Temporal RBAC","","authorisation;information retrieval;medical information systems;mobile computing;spatiotemporal phenomena","STEM-RBAC;ad hoc manner;data transfer;emergency access technique;glass mechanism;location aware role based access control model;medical information;spatiotemporal emergency role based access control","","2","","16","","","June 28 2011-July 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is particularly useful for the task of music structure segmentation. The performance of such systems however relies on the nature of the studied music pieces and it is often assumed that harmonic and timbre variations remain low within musical sections. While this condition is rarely fulfilled, similarity matrices are often too complex and structural information can hardly be extracted. In this paper we propose an image-oriented pre-processing of similarity matrices to highlight the conveyed musical information and reduce their complexity. The image segmentation processing step handles the image characteristics in order to provide us meaningful spatial segments and enhance thus the music segmentation. Evaluation of a reference structure segmentation algorithm using the enhanced matrices is provided, and we show that our method strongly improves the segmentation performances.","1949-3983;19493983","Electronic:978-1-61284-433-6; POD:978-1-61284-432-9","10.1109/CBMI.2011.5972522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972522","","Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Matrix decomposition;Multiple signal classification;Music;Visualization","audio signal processing;image segmentation;information retrieval;music","MIR community;audio similarity matrices enhancement;image processing framework;image segmentation processing step;music information retrieval;music segmentation;music structure segmentation;reference structure segmentation algorithm;similarity matrices image-oriented preprocessing","","0","","14","","","13-15 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A slow control plant system is based on industrial automation technology with maximum sampling rates below 100 Hz, and a fast control plant system is based on embedded technology with higher sampling rates and more stringent real-time requirements than that required for slow controllers. The latter is applicable to diagnostics and plant systems in closed-control loops whose cycle times are below 1 ms. Fast controllers will be dedicated industrial controllers with the ability to supervise other fast and/or slow controllers, interface to actuators and sensors and, if necessary, high performance networks. Two prototypes of a fast plant system controller specialized for data acquisition and constrained by ITER technological choices are being built using two different form factors. This prototyping activity contributes to the Plant Control Design Handbook effort of standardization, specifically regarding fast controller characteristics. Envisaging a general purpose fast controller design, diagnostic use cases with specific requirements were analyzed and will be presented along with the interface with CODAC and sensors. The requirements and constraints that real-time plasma control imposes on the design were also taken into consideration. Functional specifications and technology neutral architecture, together with its implications on the engineering design, were considered. The detailed engineering design compliant with ITER standards was performed and will be discussed in detail.

Reading of traditional books provides contextual cues to aid in memory recall and finding of information. On the contrary e-books do not support the generation of contextual cues so well. In an e-book, a reader finds information mostly from full-text searching and by using the scrollbar. However a trade-off between precision and recall may occur during the search, and scrollbars provide only a rough idea of approximate location in a document. Many studies have added cues to scrollbars (information spaces), but fewer studies have investigated what contextual cues are used by readers to find information and the behavior adopted in finding information by using contextual cues. According to our observations, names of chapters and subchapters are important contextual cues in finding information, because the reader can easily grasp their location within a document. However more tangible information space with more useful contextual cues within that space is necessary so that readers can grasp the structure of content.","2161-3761;21613761","Electronic:978-0-7695-4346-8; POD:978-1-61284-209-7","10.1109/ICALT.2011.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5992327","Contextual cues;E-books;Electronic books;Review content;Revisit information","Electronic publishing;Indexes;Materials;Navigation;Search problems;Turning;Visualization","electronic publishing;information retrieval","contextual cues;e-books;electronic textbook;full-text searching;information space;paper textbook;scrollbar","","2","","9","","","6-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They can access public transport timetables on-the-move and have the data tailored dynamically based on their location. In this work, not only to improve lifestyles but increase life standards, we aim to combine the paradigms above with healthcare and hospital patient records systems. Accordingly, this paper describes a location-aware electronic health record system that can sense the location of the physician by utilizing fingerprinting technique, and retrieve the relevant patient's medical data on to the physician's mobile device. Furthermore, the system also enables medical personnel to transcribe post-it-like, audio-notes, and facilitate communication among physicians on other shifts by posting location-based notes.

These streams consist of millions or billions of updates and must be processed to extract the useful information to enable timely strategic decisions. Mining data streams have many inherent challenges among which the most important challenges are adapting to available resources and assuring quality of the output result. Recent work in the area of data stream mining addresses these two challenges separately. Algorithms in the area of stream mining lack the combination of resource and quality awareness. That means, although they deal with resource adaptation, they do not take quality aspects into consideration. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of resource adaptation and quality awareness with respect to data stream mining and then propose a novel framework that accounts for both quality awareness and resource adaptation. The proposed framework can be generalized for any stream mining technique.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1280-7; POD:978-1-4577-1279-1","10.1109/ICBEIA.2011.5994246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5994246","Algorithm granularity;Data streams;Methodical quality;Synopsis;adaptation factors;resource adaptation;temporal quality","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data models;Monitoring","data mining;information retrieval;quality assurance;resource allocation","high speed data stream mining;quality awareness;resource adaptation;strategic decision;useful information extraction","","0","","10","","","5-7 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feature selection techniques are designed to find the meaningful feature subset of the original features which can facilitate clustering, classification, and retrieval. In this paper, we consider the feature selection problem in unsupervised learning scenarios, which is particularly difficult due to the absence of class labels that would guide the search for relevant information. Based on Laplacian regularized least squares, which finds a smooth function on the data manifold and minimizes the empirical loss, we propose two novel feature selection algorithms which aim to minimize the expected prediction error of the regularized regression model. Specifically, we select those features such that the size of the parameter covariance matrix of the regularized regression model is minimized. Motivated from experimental design, we use trace and determinant operators to measure the size of the covariance matrix. Efficient computational schemes are also introduced to solve the corresponding optimization problems. Extensive experimental results over various real-life data sets have demonstrated the superiority of the proposed algorithms.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2011.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5728821","Feature selection;clustering.;dimensionality reduction;manifold;regression;regularization","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrix;Feature extraction;Laplace equations;Manifolds;Optimization","covariance matrices;information retrieval;least squares approximations;minimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;regression analysis;unsupervised learning","Laplacian regularization;Laplacian regularized least squares;data manifold;feature classification;feature clustering;feature retrieval;feature selection;information processing task;parameter covariance matrix;regularized regression model;unsupervised learning;variance minimization criterion","","20","","35","","20110310","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
