We estimate relationship strength between web pages in social bookmarking services using a tag vocabulary and construct a network of the web pages. In this step Bayes theorem is used to estimate true strength from each user's strength estimation. After estimation using tags the network is represented in lower dimension space and some non-important links are removed. In this step the network is approximated keeping neighborhood of data in the original network. To evaluate our proposed method we carry out some experiments using artificially generated data and real social bookmarking data. And we confirm that 1) the proposed method can estimate more appropriate relationship strength than ordinary methods based on cooccurrence frequency and tags sharing rate and 2) the proposed method can remain essential links and delete pseudo relationship.","1098-7584;10987584","Electronic:978-1-4673-1506-7; POD:978-1-4673-1507-4","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2012.6251238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6251238","","Electronic mail;Estimation;Media;Registers;Social network services;Vocabulary;Web pages","Bayes methods;information retrieval;social networking (online)","Bayes theorem;Web pages;artificially generated data;cooccurrence frequency;folksonomy;network analysis;real social bookmarking data;relationship strength estimation;social bookmarking services;social media;tag vocabulary","","4","","16","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we obtain crowd counting models for each camera by statistics regression methods using sample data. Secondly, we integrate video surveillance system and geographic information system (GIS) for capturing, managing, analyzing and displaying all forms of geographically referenced camera information, such as location, monitor area, and real-time crowd counting data, etc. And then, we combine image processing with crowd counting models to estimate people number and crowd density of monitoring areas. Finally, we implement a system for real-time crowd counting based on video surveillance system and GIS. We can acquire real-time data of people number and crowd density levels for each camera, and display them by the way of map and curves. Also, we can retrieve history data and analyze them by spatial analysis tools.

Good information is fundamental to understand and respond to 21st century national security threats. Without comprehensive information, decision-makers operate with a limited understanding of the threat horizon or the best means to address it. Required information exists across a variety of proprietary and open sources, and the volume of data available that might potentially contain relevant facts is simply too large and the bandwidth of the trained analysts is limited. Such information must be available in time-critical situations to be able to quickly connect the dots across various related pieces of information. It is imperative that decision-makers are provided intelligent tools that can automatically extract new relevant information from data without being explicitly asked, leading to actionable intelligence. To overcome these challenges we propose an information collection, management and analysis framework to meet the ever-growing threats to national security. The proposed framework establishes a collaborative environment to semi-automatically generate actionable intelligence by ensuring that the right people have access to all inclusive information at the right time. The core of this framework is to create a single view of entity by correlating information from different sources, stored in different formats. These sources can be passport, immigration, driving license, FIR records, Telecom and Utility services. The correlation algorithm is able to handle varied amount of noise in the data such as syntactic and semantic variations, format changes, spelling error, incomplete data, regional and linguistics variation as well as addition or removal of fields. The framework can further exploit the consolidated view to discover relationships between entities t- us expanding the reach for relevant information. The framework provides multiple avenues of interaction and the foresight needed to incorporate new sources of data as they arise in future.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2401-4; POD:978-1-4673-2400-7","10.1109/SOLI.2012.6273509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6273509","","Cities and towns;Data models;Lead;Pattern matching;Standards;Vehicles;Wireless communication","data acquisition;decision making;groupware;information analysis;information management;information retrieval;national security;public administration","FIR record;actionable intelligence;collaborative environment;correlation algorithm;data consolidation solution;data source;decision-maker;driving license;human expert;immigration;information access;information analysis;information collection;information correlation;information management;information technology;intelligence practice;intelligent tool;internal security needs;linguistics variation;national security threat;open source;passport;regional variation;semantic variation;syntactic variation;telecom serivce;threat horizon;utility service","","1","","25","","","8-10 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, the system selects text data from the Internet by continuously downloading them using a web crawler. The greedy algorithm is applied to extract the proper sentences, in order to fit with the target phonetic distribution until the appropriate text corpus is established. The experiment is done by using the text from the Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) corpus for Thai language [1] to generate the target phonetic distribution. The result shows that the increased number of data drawn from the Internet is able to accomplish the target phonetic distribution and generates diphone coverage for 99.13%.

In particular, we focus on two representative types of flexible search functionalities: ranked keyword search, and search over structured data. Although these functionalities are already prevalent in information retrieval in the plaintext domain, realizing them in the encrypted domain requires non-trivial effort and is relatively new. In light of this, we first describe several existing technical approaches proposed by us and other researchers, and identify their advantages and limitations.

When dealing with big data, the lengths of element's Dewey codes are quit big, which leads to low efficiency of judging the relationships among the elements and needs large storage space. Thus, the big XML data and complicated XML schema are the bottlenecks of keyword search. In this paper, we incorporate the map-reduce mechanism to manage the uncertain data with partition, and design a parallel method to process information retrieve. The different XML fragments are stored in distributed network, and these can be parallel processed to retrieve the Smallest Lowest Common Ancestors (SLCAs) and return the k results with the largest probabilistic values.

However, many of them cannot be searched by existing search engines. Accordingly, we develop a novel search engine named Dash, which stands for Db-pAge Search, to support db-page search. Dash determines db-pages possibly generated by a target web application and its database through exploring the application code and the related database content and supports keyword search on those db-pages. In this paper, we present its system design and focus on the efficiency issue. To minimize costs incurred for collecting, maintaining, indexing and searching a massive number of db-pages that possibly have overlapped contents, Dash derives and indexes db-page fragments in place of db-pages. Each db-page fragment carries a disjointed part of a db-page. To efficiently compute and index db-page fragments from huge datasets, Dash is equipped with MapReduce based algorithms for database crawling and db-page fragment indexing. Besides, Dash has a top-k search algorithm that can efficiently assemble db-page fragments into db-pages relevant to search keywords and return the k most relevant ones. The performance of Dash is evaluated via extensive experimentation.","1063-6927;10636927","Electronic:978-1-4577-0296-9; POD:978-1-4577-0295-2","10.1109/ICDCS.2012.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6258016","Database Crawling;Database-Generated Dynamic Web Pages;Hadoop and Performance;Indexing;MapReduce;Search Engine;Top-k Search","Educational institutions;Indexing;Keyword search;Search engines;Web pages","Internet;database management systems;indexing;information retrieval;search engines;search problems","Dash;MapReduce based algorithm;Web application;application code;cost minimization;database content;database crawling;database-generated dynamic Web page;db-page fragment indexing;db-page search;huge dataset;keyword search;search engine;searching;system design;top-k search algorithm","","1","","27","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies the problem of how to efficiently search and select trustworthy service providers for users in social networks consisting of service providers and consumers. A trust value between two participants can be derived by existing methods from the optimal trust path between them in a social network. When more than one trust factors are taken into consideration, the exact optimal trust path selection algorithm is NP-complete. Although several heuristic algorithms have been proposed to find approximate solutions, their time complexities are still too high to be acceptable in practice, especially when they are used in very large scale social networks. Focusing on reducing trust path searching time, this paper proposes an efficient preprocessing-based search strategy. It exploits structural properties of the social networks and builds an advanced data structure from preprocessing, which can be used to simplify and accelerate the trust path searching. Experimental results show our strategy is very efficient and nearly achieves a constant time complexity. The computed trustworthiness based on our method has excellent performance close to that of the best existing heuristic algorithm.","","Electronic:978-07695-4753-4; Electronic:978-1-4673-3049-7; POD:978-1-4673-3049-7","10.1109/SCC.2012.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6274136","path search;service provider selection;social networks;trustworthiness","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Search problems;Social network services","computational complexity;information retrieval;security of data;service-oriented architecture;social networking (online)","NP-complete problem;complex social network structural properties;exact optimal trust path selection algorithm;heuristic algorithms;preprocessing-based search strategy;service provider selection;service provider trustworthiness;service-oriented computing;time complexity;trust path searching;trust path searching time;trust value","","4","","24","","","24-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our evaluated kernels are derived from two important numerical computations: a biological simulation of the heart using the Immersed Boundary (IB) method, and a Gyrokinetic Particle-in-Cell (PIC)-based application for studying fusion plasma microturbulence. We develop several novel synchronization and grid decomposition schemes, as well as low-level optimization techniques to maximize performance on three modern multicore platforms: Intel's Xeon X5550 (Nehalem), AMD's Opteron 2356 (Barcelona), and Sun's UltraSparc T2+ (Niagara).

So many good algorithms have been developed for web service selection problem. The need for effective web service clustering technique is also came forward, which will help the users to search within their needed clusters, that will reflect different tradeoffs such as price , quality etc. Recent works on web service selection and retrieval techniques has found out that for getting greater accuracy and stability, all the algorithms for web service selection and clustering must satisfy the following two criteria. First, it should consider all the parameter matches. Second, multiple criteria should be taken into consideration while performing the parameter matching. In this paper we are proposing an efficient web service clustering technique based on multi criteria service dominance relationship, which satisfies the above criteria. Recent work on the same area proposed the use of Hilbert space filling curve, and then applying a simple algorithm for forming the clusters. Space filling curve is a way of mapping multi-dimensional space into the one dimensional space. So the effectiveness of the formed clusters are having a direct relationship with how effective the used space filling curve is. In this paper we propose the use of Peano Space filling curve for the multidimensional reduction, which tends to show less irregularity, more fairness and more scalability than Hilbert space filling curve.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2149-5; POD:978-1-4673-2148-8","10.1109/ICDSE.2012.6282302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6282302","Clustering;Peano Space Filling Curve;Web services matchmaking","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Filling;Heuristic algorithms;Hilbert space;Scalability;Web services","Hilbert spaces;Web services;information retrieval;pattern clustering","Hilbert space filling curve;Peano space filling curve;Web service retrieval;Web service selection;Web services clustering;multicriteria service dominance relationship;multidimensional reduction;price tradeoffs;quality tradeoffs","","3","","10","","","18-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The cloud computing methodology is a conceptual based technology which is used widely now a day. But in data privacy protection and data retrieval control is one of the most challenging research work in cloud computing, because of users secrete data which is to be stored by user. An enterprise usually store data in internal storage and then tries to protect the data from other outside source. They also provide authentication at certain specific level. Cloud computing offers an innovative business model for organizations to adopt IT services without upfront investment. Despite the potential gains achieved from the cloud computing, the organizations are slow in accepting it due to security issues and challenges associated with it. Security is one of the major issues which hamper the growth of cloud. The idea of handing over important data to another company is worrisome; such that the consumers need to be vigilant in understanding the risks of data breaches in this new environment. This paper introduces a detailed analysis of the cloud computing security issues and challenges focusing on the cloud computing types and the service delivery types. This paper mainly proposes the core concept of secured cloud computing. It suggests the cloud computing based on separate encryption and decryption services from the storage service. Due to this increasing demand for more clouds there is an ever growing threat of security becoming a major issue.

The information about an object is stored in databases, distributed around the globe, maintained by various stakeholders that participate in the object's supply chain. A Discovery Service (DS) is responsible for collecting all these database URIs and feeding them to clients that query about an object. DSs are usually centralized and are designed to effectively aggregate as many information sources as possible, rather than trying to respond optimally to unforeseen user queries. In this paper we propose a novel, Information-Centric Networking (ICN) inspired, architecture that eliminates the need for a separate DS, enabling at the same time multi-ownership and flexible management of information that is associated with an object. In our ICN approach, information about an object is organized in scopes. Each scope has its own access control rules allowing easy control of information dissemination. Moreover scopes can be hierarchically organized, creating complex access structures that can reflect business relationships. In our architecture companies provide information about an object to the appropriate scopes, but they never lose control of this information. To access information associated with an object,a user queries the scope that corresponds to the desired context, which will forward the query to a service that will respond with the appropriate data. The query will not reveal any extra information, not authorized to be retrieved.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1239-4; POD:978-1-4673-1238-7; USB:978-1-4673-1237-0","10.1109/WoWMoM.2012.6263786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263786","Information scoping;Information-Centric Networking;service discovery","Access control;Companies;Drugs;IP networks;Subscriptions;Supply chains","Internet;authorisation;information dissemination;information retrieval systems;query processing","ICN inspired architecture;Internet of things;access control rules;business relationships;centralized DS;complex access structures;database URI;discovery service;flexible information management;information access;information association;information dissemination;information lookup;information multiownership;information sources;information-centric networking inspired architecture;uniform resource identifier;user queries","","7","","14","","","25-28 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our implementation serves an unbounded number of clients that use the storage concurrently. It tolerates crashes of a minority of the KVSs and crashes of any number of clients. Our algorithm minimizes the space overhead at the KVSs and comes in two variants providing regular and atomic semantics, respectively. Compared with prior solutions, it is inherently scalable and allows clients to write concurrently. Because of the limited interface of a KVS, textbook-style solutions for reliable storage either do not work or incur a prohibitively large storage overhead. Our algorithm maintains two copies of the stored value per KVS in the common case, and we show that this is indeed necessary. If there are concurrent write operations, the maximum space complexity of the algorithm grows in proportion to the point contention.

The user carries Blog Robot like cellular phone and can browse blogs related to the location where user is. The browse method makes the user access the blog at the real scene related to the contents of the blog. Blog Robot gives her/him the content of the blog by reading it with synthesized speech. In particular, the nonverbal information generated by Blog Robot enhances the read information as if the blog writer is next her/him while telling her/him it. The browse method is expected to enable the user to obtain more realistic information than the Web browser on the PC. Moreover, it enables the user shares the information with the blog writer. In addition, since the browse through Blog Robot is performed at the location that the blog writer once visited, the blog writer has proper feedback from the user. It is difficult for the blog writer to obtain the same feedback from the user who sits in front of her/his PC because she/he is not there. We have also designed tags specific to generating the nonverbal expression of Blog Robot and the tags are embedded within the text in the blog. The tags can be used not only for Blog Robot but also for the PC. If the user checks the blog including the tags, they are displayed as icon on- the Web browser (Fig.1 right).","2167-2121;21672121","Electronic:978-1-60558-404-1; POD:978-1-60558-404-1","10.1145/1514095.1514136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256024","Agent Presentation;Human Robot Interaction;Information Revitalization;Web Contents","Abstracts;Robots","Web sites;cellular radio;human-robot interaction;information retrieval;online front-ends;smart phones;speech synthesis;text analysis","Web browser;blog contents;blog robot;browse method;cellular phone;eye contact;hand gestures;joint attention;location-based content access;nonverbal expression;robotized smart-phone;speech synthesis;verbal expression","","0","","","","","11-13 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Vehicular users, in particular, are likely to engage in information retrieval on the move: in this context, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) can play an important role in offloading the cellular infrastructure. We investigate the effectiveness of ITS in this task, considering that roadside units (RSUs) can exploit mobility prediction to decide which data they should fetch from the Internet and schedule transmissions to vehicles, either potential relays or downloaders. Rather than presenting a specific prediction scheme, we propose a model that allows us to express and account for any prediction technique in a simple, yet effective, manner. We then provide a probabilistic graph-based representation of the system that accounts for the prediction uncertainty. We use such a representation to study the network dynamics by efficiently solving a (non-integer) LP problem. Our results show that the above approach to content downloading through ITS can achieve an 80% offload of the cellular network. Also, we investigate the dependency of the system performance on the accuracy of the mobility prediction, and which prediction errors have the largest impact.","2155-5486;21555486","Electronic:978-1-4673-1905-8; POD:978-1-4673-1904-1; USB:978-1-4673-1903-4","10.1109/SECON.2012.6275786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275786","","Accuracy;Mobile communication;Predictive models;Prefetching;Probabilistic logic;Relays;Vehicles","Internet;cellular radio;information retrieval;scheduling;transportation","ITS content download;Internet;LP problem;information retrieval;intelligent transportation systems;mobile users;mobility prediction;offloading cellular networks;prediction errors;prediction uncertainty;probabilistic graph-based representation;roadside units;schedule transmissions;vehicular users","","16","","19","","","18-21 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advantage of such approach is a seamless exploitation of existing semantic resource coded as DL ontology, which is widespread in such area as the Semantic Web and conceptual modeling. The experiments are conducted with a repository of complex Chinese questions which involves the satisfaction of some object property restrictions.

This paper proposes a novel feature selection approach to improve the performance of text classifier based on an integration of Ant Colony Optimization algorithm (ACO) and Trace Oriented Feature Analysis (TOFA). ACO is metaheuristic search algorithm derived by the study of foraging behavior of real ants, specifically the pheromone communication to find the shortest path to the food source. TOFA is a unified optimization framework developed to integrate and unify several state-of-the-art dimension reduction algorithms through optimization framework. It has been shown in previous research that ACO is one of the promising approaches for optimization and feature selection problems. TOFA is capable of dealing with large scale text data and can be applied to several text analysis applications such as text classification, clustering and retrieval. For classification performance yet effective, the proposed approach makes use of TOFA and classifier performance as heuristic information of ACO. The results on Reuters and Brown public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1509-8; POD:978-1-4673-1510-4","10.1109/CEC.2012.6252960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252960","Ant Colony Optimization;Trace Oriented Feature Ananlysis;feature selection;text classification","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Optimization;Text categorization","Internet;information retrieval;optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;search problems;text analysis","Brown public datasets;Internet;Reuters public datasets;TOFA feature selection approach;ant colony optimization algorithm;ant foraging behavior;dimension reduction algorithms;feature space dimensionality;hybrid ACO;metaheuristic search algorithm;text classification;text clustering;text data availability;text retrieval;trace oriented feature analysis;unified optimization framework","","1","","16","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the borrower looks for a lender who offers the fund at a cheaper interest rate, the lender looks for a borrower whose probability of default is nil or minimal. The peer to peer lending sites can help the lenders judge the borrower by allowing the analysis of the social structures like friendship networks and group affiliations. A particular user can be judged based on his profile and on the information extracted from his social network like borrower's friend's profile and activities (like lending, borrowing and bidding activities). We are using classification algorithm to classify good and bad borrowers, where the input attributes consists of both core credit and social network information. Most of these algorithms only take a single table as input, whereas in the real world most data are stored in multiple tables and managed by relational database systems. Transferring data from multiple tables into a single table, especially merging the social network data causes problems like high redundancy. A simple classifier performs well on real single table data but when applied in a multi-relational (Multi table) setting; its accuracy suffers from the altered statistical information of individual attributes during “join”. Therefore we are using a multi relational Bayesian classification method to predict the default probabilities of borrowers.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2149-5; POD:978-1-4673-2148-8","10.1109/ICDSE.2012.6282321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6282321","classification;lending;social networks","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Social network services","Bayes methods;electronic commerce;financial data processing;information retrieval;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing;relational databases;social networking (online);storage management","P2P lending;Prosper;ZOPA;classification algorithm;credit scoring;default probability;e-lending platform;friendship networks;group affiliations;information extraction;interest rate;multirelational Bayesian classification method;naive Bayes classification;peer-to-peer lending sites;relational database systems;social network;social structures","","1","","7","","","18-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Moverness for Locks and Transactions","G. Barnett; S. Qin","","2012 Sixth International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering","20120816","2012","","","185","192","Locks are pervasive in multithreaded code. For software transactional memory (STM) to be widely adopted there must be a consensus on a semantics for programs that entail both locks and transactions, particularly for weakly isolated STMs. For instance, in a weakly isolated STM, use of both locks and transactions to access the same data may introduce data races. In response we present a simple and intuitive semantics that guarantees ordered linearisation points for conflicting locks and transactions. Our approach allows us to classify the moverness of locks and transactions, making reasoning about parallel compositions trivial. Under our semantics we show locks to be left movers and transactions right movers, and the serialisability of conflicting locks and transactions.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4751-0; POD:978-1-4673-2353-6","10.1109/TASE.2012.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6269643","Concurrency;Programming Languages;Software Transactional Memory","Cognition;Computer languages;Educational institutions;Message systems;Monitoring;Semantics;Synchronization","concurrency control;information retrieval;multi-threading;programming language semantics;transaction processing","conflicting locks;conflicting transactions;data access;data races;isolated STM;locks moverness;multithreaded code;ordered linearisation points;parallel compositions trivial;programs semantics;software transactional memory;transaction right movers","","1","","","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Facebook is a cloud-based web site which contains a number of advanced technologies behind the scene. Despite the fact that it is the web site that most users open for all-day and, in some places, all-night long, and its traffic is generally part of all types of networks - wired and wireless, PAN, LAN, MAN, and WAN -, there is virtually no research work or technical paper that report on client's perspective of what happen when users login onto their Facebook homepages. How many and in what order components loaded are, which and how many servers those components loaded are, or how many TCP streams used, are examples of questions which users and network administrators have a little knowledge of. Our work tries to answer the questions by examining every of over 2,000 packets per a single Facebook homepage retrieval using the Wireshark packet capturing software. From the captured packets, we thoroughly examined all objects that Facebook retrieved and categorized them into groups based on the characteristics. Our investigations found that Facebook retrieves these objects from both international and domestic servers, and over a number of parallel TCP streams. The results also showed that the Facebook traffic exhibited a two-spike bursty pattern, regardless of the loading time.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1921-8; POD:978-1-4673-1920-1","10.1109/JCSSE.2012.6261929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6261929","Facebook forensics;TCP;packet capturing;traffic analysis","Educational institutions;Facebook;Feeds;IP networks;Loading;Servers;Traffic control","information retrieval;local area networks;metropolitan area networks;social networking (online);telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;wide area networks","Facebook homepage retrieval;Facebook traffic;LAN;MAN;PAN;WAN;Wireshark packet capturing software;cloud-based Web site;end user perspective;network traffic examination;parallel TCP streams;social network sites;two-spike bursty pattern;wired network;wireless network","","5","","9","","","May 30 2012-June 1 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the major problems is then to provide a definition of the context and to choose the most appropriate methods for using it. Two kinds of contexts were exploited in the past to improve concepts detection: in some works, inter-concepts relations are used as semantic context, where other approaches use the temporal features of videos to improve concepts detection. Results of these works showed that the “temporal” and the “semantic” contexts can improve concept detection. In this work we use the semantic context through an ontology and exploit the efficiency of the temporal context in a “two-layers” re-ranking approach.

Although the WCS [3]/WFS [4]/WMS [5] purposed by OGC try to make it possible for applications to access heterogeneous data through a universal interface, it is still hard to be used because of the absent of data searching and difficulty of application programming. The distributed integrated applications are eager for a distributed, extensible, and co-operable RS-DDS which can distribute different types, different formats, and different goals RS-data in one system.

Core group refers to the data that are always clustered together no matter what clustering method is applied. Then, it adopts other kind of clustering methods to refine the core groups and index database.

However, without any protection to guarantee the data integrity and availability, the reliable data storage cannot be achieved since sensor nodes are prone to various failures, and attackers may compromise sensor nodes to pollute or destroy the stored data. Therefore, how to design a robust sensor data storage scheme to efficiently guarantee the data integrity and availability becomes a critical issue for distributed sensor storage networks. In this paper, we propose a distributed fault/intrusion-tolerant data storage scheme based on network coding and homomorphic fingerprinting in volatile WSNs environments. For high data availability, the proposed scheme uses network coding to encode the source data and distribute encoded fragments with original data pieces. With secure, compact, and efficient homomorphic fingerprinting, our scheme can fast locate incorrect fragments and then initialize data maintenance. Extensive theoretical analysis and simulative results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095535","Distributed sensor data storage;data maintenance;homomorphic fingerprinting;network coding","Availability;Distributed databases;Encoding;Maintenance engineering;Memory;Network coding;Wireless sensor networks","data integrity;fault tolerant computing;information retrieval;network coding;security of data;storage management;wireless sensor networks","WSN;data access;data availability;data integrity;distributed fault-tolerant sensor data storage scheme;distributed intrusion-tolerant sensor data storage scheme;distributed sensor storage networks;homomorphic fingerprinting;network coding;redundancy spread;wireless sensor networks","","10","","35","","20111206","Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Grounded on the work in granular computing, we propose the notion of semantic information granulation estimated with respect to a fuzzy domain ontology to support domain-specific IR. The main contributions of this paper is the illustration of the design and development of a fuzzy granular IR system which can take into account two orthogonal dimensions, such as “similarity” and “granularity” to improve the effectiveness of domain-specific IR. In particular, the proposed fuzzy granular IR system is underpinned by a computational method for automated fuzzy ontology mining. Based on standard benchmark document collection, the results of our experiments confirm that the proposed fuzzy granular IR system outperforms a classical similarity-based (i.e, the vector space model) IR system for domain specific IR.

Instead of this approach, we propose grouping of researchers on basis of topics they have in common that would make more semantic sense for a user searching for publications in an area. Identification of relevant complete topic phrases, discovery of equivalent topics (synonyms) using terms in document collections are fundamental problems in information retrieval, natural language processing, pattern recognition, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, wherein we identify a document's topic using Wikipedia. Wikipedia is the largest freely available crowd-source with up-to-date knowledge containing around 20 millions topics. The document collection we consider is the collection of academic researchers' publications. The documents are mapped to topics extracted from documents using Wikipedia to generate a document-topic representation. Then clustering algorithm is applied on document-topic representation to group semantically related researchers and generate a topic based academic researchers' Social Network. We use Adaptive Rough Fuzzy Leader (ARFL) a soft clustering algorithm, since each researcher can have expertise in more than one area and they can belong to more than one group.
