This paper discusses the design of a multi-document summarizer that uses Katz's K-mixture model for term distribution. The model helps in ranking the sentences by a modified term weight assignment. The system has been evaluated against the frequently occurring sentences in the summaries generated by a set of human subjects. Our system outperforms other auto-summarizers at different extraction levels of summarization with respect to the ideal summary, and is close to the ideal summary at 40% extraction level.","","POD:0-7695-2358-7","10.1109/ICCIMA.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540720","","Computational intelligence;Data mining;Frequency;Humans;Information retrieval;Internet;Measurement standards;Natural languages;Time factors;Writing","data mining;information retrieval;text analysis","Katz K-mixture model;automatic multidocument summarization;information need;information retrieval;modified term weight assignment;probabilistic approach;term distribution;text data mining;tiled summary generation","","1","","11","","","16-18 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The outcomes of the search are not socially relevant: they often reflect only the content popularity based on lookup tables gathered by search robots. In order to obtain personalization and social relevance, in other words, to bring the search outcome closer to a common human perception of value and reliability, the search database itself could be personalized. One possible method to obtain personalization is through the social neighborhood of the searcher. An enabler for the personalization is the phonebook stored in mobile phones. The group of mobile phonebooks can create an infrastructure for a peer-to-peer search network with a social dimension. In order to demonstrate this concept our work introduces a novel search and recommender engine and application for phonebook-based smart phone networks.

By treating local visual features as terms, training images as documents and input images as queries, we formulate the problem of object recognition into that of text retrieval. Our formulation opens up the opportunity to integrate some powerful text retrieval tools with computer vision techniques. In this paper, we propose to improve the efficiency of articulated object recognition by an Okapi-Chamfer matching algorithm. The algorithm is based on the inverted index technique. The inverted index is a widely used way to effectively organize a collection of text documents. With the inverted index, only documents that contain query terms are accessed and used for matching. To enable inverted indexing in an image database, we build a lexicon of local visual features by clustering the features extracted from the training images. Given a query image, we extract visual features and quantize them based on the lexicon, and then look up the inverted index to identify the subset of training images with non-zero matching score. To evaluate the matching scores in the subset, we combined the modified Okapi weighting formula with the Chamfer distance. The performance of the Okapi-Chamfer matching algorithm is evaluated on a hand posture recognition system. We test the system with both synthesized and real world images. Quantitative results demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our system","1550-5499;15505499","POD:0-7695-2334-X","10.1109/ICCV.2005.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1544833","","Application software;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Object recognition;Shape;System testing","feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;information retrieval systems;object recognition;text analysis","Chamfer distance;Okapi weighting formula;Okapi-Chamfer matching;features extraction;hand posture recognition;inverted index;object recognition;query terms;text documents;text information retrieval systems;visual feature extraction","","5","1","28","","","17-21 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 2-D RCWFs are nonseparable and oriented, which improves characterization of oriented textures. Most texture image retrieval systems are still incapable of providing retrieval result with high retrieval accuracy and less computational complexity. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for texture image retrieval by using a set of dual-tree rotated complex wavelet filter (DT-RCWF) and dual-tree-complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) jointly, which obtains texture features in 12 different directions. The information provided by DT-RCWF complements the information generated by DT-CWT. Features are obtained by computing the energy and standard deviation on each subband of the decomposed image. To check the retrieval performance, texture database D1 of 1856 textures from Brodatz album and database D2 of 640 texture images from VisTex image database is created. Experimental results indicates that the proposed method improves retrieval rate from 69.61% to 77.75% on database D1, and from 64.83% to 82.81% on database D2, in comparing with traditional discrete wavelet transform based approach.

Here, three different co-occurrence models are proposed which instead consider the whole song as an integrated part of the probabilistic model.

However, we observe that while the repeated occurrence frequencies of strings within a single object might be low, the frequencies can be very high if they are considered over multiple objects. Furthermore, these strings with high occurrence frequencies are quite static, and the size of such string set is also quite small. In this paper, we propose a complementary compression mechanism on top of the existing HTTP supported algorithms, called the content-aware global static compression (CAGSC), to further improve Web data compression. Its basic idea is to include a static CAGSC table to perform compression on frequently, globally occurred strings. Our experimental result shows that CAGSC can obtain an average of 15% improvement over standard HTTP supported algorithms.","","POD:0-7695-2455-9","10.1109/WCW.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541213","","Compression algorithms;Computer languages;Data compression;Encoding;Frequency;HTML;Information retrieval;Protocols;Sun;Web pages","Internet;data compression","Web content delivery;Web data compression;Web object;content-aware global static compression;real-time lossless compression","","0","","9","","","12-13 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visualizing a sample allows our method to overcome the scalability issues inherent in visualizing massive networks. We report some characteristics that frequently occur in large networks and the conditions under which they are preserved when sampling from a network. This can be useful in selecting a proper sampling scheme that yields a sample with similar characteristics as the original network. Our method is built on top of a relational database, thus it can be easily and efficiently implemented using any off-the-shelf database software.

Current approaches for components retrieval are mostly limited to the matching of their inputs/outputs. To go beyond the limits of these approaches, a substantial effort has been done by different works on semantic Web and ontologies by exploiting more knowledge on the semantics of the components. However, this effort still remains insufficient and does not fulfil user needs as many functional or quality aspects are hidden within the specification of components behavior. In this paper we argue that, in many situations, the component discovery process should be based on the specification of this behavior that is the process model, which describes each component. The idea behind is to develop matching techniques that operate on process models and allow delivery of partial matches and evaluation of semantic distance between these matches and the user requirements. Consequently, even if a service satisfying exactly the user requirements does not exist, the most similar ones will be retrieved and proposed for reuse by extension or modification. To do so, we reduce the problem of service behavioral matching to a graph matching problem and we adapt existing algorithms for this purpose.","","POD:0-7695-2408-7","10.1109/SCC.2005.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1531273","behavioral matching;services retrieval;web services","Application software;Character generation;Context modeling;Context-aware services;Grid computing;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Web services","formal specification;graph theory;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","behavioral specification;component discovery process;graph matching;ontology;semantic Web;service behavioral matching;service retrieval;user requirements","","2","","18","","","11-15 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through a contourlet transformation, each color component of an image is decomposed into a set of directional subbands with texture details captured in different orientations. By exploiting inter-scale dependencies and in-band spatial dependencies, the distribution of the coefficients in each subband triplet (subbands of three color components at the same scale with the same orientation) can be estimated using a vector hidden Markov model. The Kullback-Leibler distance (KLD) is used to measure the difference between the distributions of query texture images and those of images in the database. The experimental results show the proposed retrieval systems yield high retrieval rates and better visual quality as compared with previous methods employing hidden Markov models for luminance component alone.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1529800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529800","","Feature extraction;Helium;Hidden Markov models;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Sections;Visual databases;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms","hidden Markov models;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture","Kullback-Leibler distance;color texture retrieval;contourlet-based hidden Markov model","","4","","13","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has the potential to become an important and integral component for future e-business applications. Developments in CBIR have drawn interest from many researchers and practitioners in recent years. The challenge is how to retrieve the most appropriate or relevant images at the fastest speed. To increase the retrieval speed, most of the systems pre-process the stored images and extract out the essential features. Such scheme only works well for the server type database system. Such approach is not feasible for systems that analyze images in real-time. In this paper, a hierarchical multi-layer statistical discriminant framework is proposed. The system is able to select the most appropriate features by analyzing the newly received images, and then apply a relevance feedback (RF) approach to improve the retrieval accuracy. As the number of features being analyzed is less, an improvement in performance is achieved","","POD:0-7695-2430-3","10.1109/ICEBE.2005.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1552914","","Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Feedback;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Radio frequency;Real time systems;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;electronic commerce;feature extraction;image retrieval;relevance feedback;statistical analysis;visual databases","content-based image retrieval system;e-business application;feature analysis;hierarchical nonparametric discriminant analysis;relevance feedback approach;server type database system","","1","","7","","","12-18 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The contour C<sub>0</sub> of a planar object is parameterised by its curvilinear abscissa u and separated into two signals x(u) and y(u) corresponding to its coordinates x and y. These signals are then filtered with a Gaussian low-pass filter. The size of the sub-consequent contour C<sub>σ</sub> is then adjusted so that it has the same size as the original contour C<sub>0</sub>. Then the contour C<sub>GC</sub>(σ) thus obtained and the original contour C<sub>0</sub> yield intersection points that give intersection points map (IPM) which is used to characterise the pattern. By construction, this method is invariant under translation. The results of analysis have shown its invariance under rotation and its resistance against scale change for a large range of scaling. It is a fast and simple algorithm that can be successfully applied in the context of pattern recognition dedicated to planar non-occluded objects. The application of this method in the research of a query pattern in a database has given very encouraging results.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1529767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529767","intersection point map;multi-scale smoothing;pattern analysis and recognition;scale-space analysis","Bandwidth;Databases;Filtering;Image analysis;Information retrieval;Low pass filters;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Shape;Smoothing methods","Gaussian processes;low-pass filters;object recognition;smoothing methods","Gaussian low-pass filter;contours smoothing;intersection points map;nonoccluded planar shapes description;pattern recognition","","0","","6","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Geographically bound mobile agent in MANET","K. Tei; N. Yoshioka; Y. Fukazawa; S. Honiden","Waseda Univ., Tokyo, Japan","The Second Annual International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Networking and Services","20051121","2005","","","516","518","A location-specific data retrieval, which is data retrieval from nodes in a designated region at the time, is an attractive application in a mobile ad-hoc network (MANET). However, almost all nodes in a MANET are powered by batteries, the location-specific data retrieval should involve a small number of messages. In this paper, we use a mobile agent to retrieve the location-specific data. A mobile agent migrates to a node in a designated region, and retrieves data from nodes in this region. Since, after migration, the agent can communicate with nodes in the designated region through low overhead short length hops, the mobile agent can retrieve data at low message cost for long periods, even if the owner of this agent moves around. However, even after migrating to node in the designated region, in order to stay near this region, a mobile agent should migrate to other nodes in response to the movement of the node hosting this agent. In this paper, we propose the geographically bound mobile agent (GBMA) which is a mobile agent that periodically migrates in order to always be located in a designated region. In order to clarify where the GBMA should be located and when the GBMA starts to migrate, two geographic zones are set to the GBMA: required zone and expected zone. The required zone ease tracking of the GBMA, and the expected zone ease adjustment of the GBMA migration timing.","","POD:0-7695-2375-7","10.1109/MOBIQUITOUS.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1541039","","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Costs;Electronic mail;Informatics;Information retrieval;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile agents;Network servers;Timing","information retrieval;mobile agents;mobile radio;telecommunication computing;tracking","GBMA migration timing;MANET;geographic zone;geographically bound mobile agent;location-specific data retrieval;mobile ad-hoc network;tracking","","0","1","4","","","17-21 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since humans tend to use high-level semantic concepts when querying and browsing multimedia databases, there is an increasing need for semantic video indexing and analysis. For this purpose, we present a unified framework for semantic shot classification in sports video, which has been widely studied due to tremendous commercial potentials. Unlike most existing approaches, which focus on clustering by aggregating shots or key-frames with similar low-level features, the proposed scheme employs supervised learning to perform a top-down video shot classification. Moreover, the supervised learning procedure is constructed on the basis of effective mid-level representations instead of exhaustive low-level features. This framework consists of three main steps: 1) identify video shot classes for each sport; 2) develop a common set of motion, color, shot length-related mid-level representations; and 3) supervised learning of the given sports video shots. It is observed that for each sport we can predefine a small number of semantic shot classes, about 5-10, which covers 90%-95% of broadcast sports video. We employ nonparametric feature space analysis to map low-level features to mid-level semantic video shot attributes such as dominant object (a player) motion, camera motion patterns, and court shape, etc. Based on the fusion of those mid-level shot attributes, we classify video shots into the predefined shot classes, each of which has clear semantic meanings. With this framework we have achieved good classification accuracy of 85%-95% on the game videos of five typical ball type sports (i.e., tennis, basketball, volleyball, soccer, and table tennis) with over 5500 shots of about 8 h. With correctly classified sports video shots, further structural and temporal analysis, such as event detection, highlight extraction, video skimming, and table of content, will be greatly facilitated.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2005.858395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542084","Semantic gap;shot representation;shot similarity;video classification;video databases indexing","Broadcasting;Content based retrieval;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Motion analysis;Multimedia communication;Multimedia databases;Pattern analysis;Supervised learning","content-based retrieval;database indexing;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic networks;sport;video databases;video retrieval","content-based video retrieval;nonparametric feature space analysis;semantic gap;semantic shot classification;semantic video indexing;shot representation;sports video;supervised learning;video classification;video databases indexing","","101","3","62","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Then, accessibility analysis is done to verify the object accessibility and determine the global accessibility.

Using topical crawlers that are guided by a support vector machine, we investigate the effects of various definitions of link contexts on the crawling performance. We find that a crawler that exploits words both in the immediate vicinity of a hyperlink as well as the entire parent page performs significantly better than a crawler that depends on just one of those cues. Also, we find that a crawler that uses the tag tree hierarchy within Web pages provides effective coverage.

Given a short query audio clip, an important task in audio retrieval is to automatically and efficiently identify all corresponding audio clips irrespective of the specific interpretation or instrumentation. In view of this problem, which is also referred to as audio matching, the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a new type of audio feature that strongly correlates to the harmonic progression of the audio signal. In addition, our feature shows a high degree of robustness to variations in parameters such as dynamics, timbre, articulation, and local tempo deviations. The feature design is carried out in two stages basically taking short-time statistics over chroma-based energy distributions. Here, the chroma correspond to the 12 traditional pitch classes of the equal-tempered scale. Applied to audio matching on a large audio database consisting of a wide range of classical music (112 hours of audio material), our features proved to be a powerful tool providing accurate matchings in an efficient way concerning time as well as memory requirements.","1931-1168;19311168","POD:0-7803-9154-3","10.1109/ASPAA.2005.1540223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540223","","Audio databases;Audio recording;Computer science;Information analysis;Instruments;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Statistical distributions;Text analysis;Timbre","audio signal processing;music;statistical analysis","audio database;audio matching;audio retrieval;audio signal harmonic progression;chroma-based energy distributions;chroma-based statistical audio features;music collections;query audio clip","","7","","7","","","16-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the RN protocol maintains this structure in the face of peer joins and departures. The RN protocol is a distributed and asynchronous message-passing protocol, which fits well the autonomous behavior of peers in a P2P system. The RN protocol requires only the existence of a bootstrapping system which is weakly connected. Peers do not need to be informed of any global network state, nor do they need to assist in repairing the network topology when they leave.

A fully consistent radiative transfer approach is always preferred when dealing with the retrieval of surface reflectance from hyperspectral/multiangular data. However, due to the reported calibration anomalies for CHRIS data, a direct atmospheric correction based on physical radiative transfer modeling is not possible, and the method must somehow compensate for such calibration problems in specific wavelength ranges. A dedicated atmospheric correction algorithm for PROBA/CHRIS data over land is presented in this work. It consists in the combination of radiative transfer and empirical line approaches to atmospheric correction, in order to retrieve surface reflectance images free from both the atmospheric distortion and artifacts due to miscalibration. The atmospheric optical parameters and the updated set of calibration coefficients are obtained jointly in an autonomous process, without the need for any ancillary data. Results from the application of the algorithm to PROBA/CHRIS data from the two European Space Agency SPectra bARrax Campaign (SPARC) held at the Barrax study site (La Mancha, Spain) in 2003 and 2004 are presented in this work, focusing on the validation of the final surface reflectance using in situ measurements acquired simultaneously to PROBA overpasses.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.857915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542362","Atmospheric correction;Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (CHRIS);Project for On-Board Autonomy (PROBA);SPectra bARrax Campaign (SPARC);calibration coefficients;empirical line;radiative transfer;surface reflectance","Atmospheric waves;Calibration;High-resolution imaging;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Information retrieval;Land surface;Optical distortion;Optical surface waves;Reflectivity","calibration;data acquisition;image processing;radiative transfer;reflectivity;spectroscopy;terrain mapping","AD 2003;AD 2004;Barrax study site;Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer;ESA SPARC campaign;Earth observation;European Space Agency;La Mancha;PROBA platform;PROBA/CHRIS data;Project for On-Board Autonomy;SPectra bARrax Campaign;Spain;atmospheric correction;atmospheric distortion;atmospheric optical parameters;calibration coefficients;hyperspectral remote sensing;multiangular remote sensing;radiative transfer;spatial resolution;surface reflectance retrieval","","54","","31","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose, we use an ontology that describes the higher logical level of scientific concepts and their relationships. A user can browse and visualize this ontology and then graphically select the relevant nodes and edges to build his query. We developed the ESearch algorithm that searches the physical level of resources to generate paths that express the ontological query. The algorithm also ranks the paths based on three semantic metrics; target object cardinality - to optimize the number of records in the output dataset, path cardinality - to optimize the number of links between the involved data sources, and evaluation cost - to minimize the cost that will be incurred to execute that evaluation path. These metrics allow the user to select the most optimum path that matches his requirements.","","POD:0-7695-2442-7","10.1109/CSBW.2005.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540573","","Availability;Cost function;Data visualization;Databases;Educational institutions;Humans;Information retrieval;Navigation;Ontologies;Pipelines","biology computing;data visualisation;database management systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query languages;query processing","BioNavigation system;ESearch algorithm;biological resources;ontologies;path cardinality;query language;query processing;scientific data collection pipelines;scientific visualization;semantic metrics;target object cardinality","","0","","5","","","8-11 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

BACIIS relies on a semi-automated approach for generating and maintaining wrappers in order to provide a scalable system with a limited maintenance overhead. The semi-automatic wrapper induction in BACIIS is efficient because it is based on, but not limited to a domain knowledge.

We propose a system that performs facial feature extraction in a given grey-scale face image using Hamiltonian sampling. During training stage of the proposed system, the parameters for a hybrid linear Gaussian model are learnt based on the training data. During the testing stage, when a new image is posed to the system, it uses the learnt graphical model together with hybrid (Hamiltonian) sampling to locate and extract the facial features.

"Fuzzy evolutionary systems: first steps towards supporting model lifecycle","P. P. Bonissone","Gen. Electr. Global Res., Niskayuna, NY, USA","NAFIPS 2005 - 2005 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society","20051205","2005","","","579","","Abstract only given. The typical lifecycle of a knowledge-based model starts from its development, testing, optimization, and deployment, and continues with its maintenance phase. The latter consists of monitoring the model's performance, editing its knowledge base to prevent obsolescence, and updating the model when required. Quite often, however, models are handcrafted, i.e., a large amount of manual intervention is used in the earlier phase of their lifecycle. This leaves the maintenance phase as an after-thought, often requiring a similar level of manual efforts. We propose a process, based on evolutionary algorithms, that follows the model throughout its entire lifecycle. For deployment, it generates a collection of competing models, evaluates their performance in light of the currently available data, refines the best models using evolutionary search, and after a finite number of iterations, generates the best-found model. This process is repeated periodically to automatically produce new updated versions of the model. We chose an asset selection problem to illustrate this methodology. Given a fleet of industrial vehicles (diesel electric locomotives), we want to select the best subset (of fixed or variable size) for mission-critical utilization. To this end, we predict the remaining life for each unit in the fleet. We then sort the fleet using this prediction and select the highest ranked units. The model chosen to perform this prediction/selection task is a fuzzy instance-based model. Unlike functional approximators that require an off-line supervised learning stage to create a hyper-surface in the cross-space state-output, instance-based models (IBMs) only require accessing the data in a local neighbourhood of the new point defined by the query. IBMs rely on a collection of previously experienced data stored in their raw representation. Unlike case-based reasoning (CBR), they do not need to be refined, abstracted and organized as cases. Like CBR, IBMs represent an analogical approach to reasoning since they rely on previous instances of similar problems and use them to create an ensemble of local models. Hence the definition of similarity plays a critical role in their performance. Typically, similarity will be a dynamic concept and will change over- the use of the IBMs. Therefore, it is important to apply learning methodologies to define and adapt it. Furthermore, the concept of similarity is not crisply defined, creating the need to allow for some degree of vagueness in its evaluation. Hence, we propose the use of fuzzy IBMs (F-IBMs). We address the issue of similarity by evolving the design of a similarity function in conjunction with the design of the attribute space in which the similarity is to be evaluated. Specifically, we use four steps: (1) Retrieval of similar instances from the database (DB); (2) Evaluation of similarity measures between the probe and the retrieved instances; (3) Creation of local models using the most similar instances (weighted by their similarity measures); (4) Aggregation of outputs of local models to probe. Within the example of asset selection, we show the accuracy of the evolved F-IBMs, their robustness to information loss, and the benefit of their automated updating process to avoid performance loss. Finally, we advocate the use of evolutionary search intertwined with local search to further improve model life cycle.","","POD:0-7803-9187-X","10.1109/NAFIPS.2005.1548600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1548600","Evolutionary Learning;Fuzzy Similarity;Instance-based models;asset selection","Electric vehicles;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;Life testing;Mission critical systems;Monitoring;Predictive models;Probes;Refining","evolutionary computation;fuzzy systems;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems","asset selection problem;evolutionary algorithm;evolutionary search;fuzzy evolutionary systems;fuzzy instance-based model;knowledge-based model;model lifecycle;model performance;similarity function;similarity measure","","0","","","","","26-28 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wide diversity in terminology used inhibit effective computerized and manual data retrieval. For example, say a user wants to find all the gene products that are involved in bacterial protein synthesis, and that have sequences or structures significantly different from those in humans. If one database describes these molecules as being involved in 'translation', whereas another uses the phrase 'protein synthesis', it will be difficult for the user - and even harder for a computer - to find functionally equivalent terms. A schema mapping tool, which interprets results from one database in terminology used by a second database, can solve such problems. We started our project by developing schema mapping for UniProt and Genbank protein resources, both of which can be rendered in XML format, as a large part of scientific community uses proteomic resources. The approach will later on be extended to other scientific databases.

At query time, the text index supports keyword-based searches with interactive response, identifying database objects corresponding to the virtual documents matching the query. Our system, EKSO, creates virtual documents from joining relational tuples and uses the DB2 Net Search Extender for indexing and keyword-search processing.

The conventional wind retrieval algorithm does not explicitly account for SeaWinds' sensitivity to rain, resulting in rain-caused wind retrieval error. A new retrieval method, termed ""simultaneous wind/rain retrieval,"" that estimates both wind and rain from rain-contaminated measurements has been previously proposed and validated with Tropical Rain Measuring Mission data. Here, the accuracy of rains retrieved by the new method is validated through comparison with the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) in coastal storm events. The rains detected by both sensors are comparable, though SeaWinds-estimated rains exhibit greater variability. The performance of simultaneous wind/rain retrieval in flagging excessively rain-contaminated winds is discussed and compared to existing methods. A new rain-only retrieval algorithm for use in rain-backscatter-dominated areas is proposed and tested. A simple noise model for SeaWinds rain estimates is developed, and Monte Carlo simulation is employed to verify the model. The model shows that SeaWinds rain estimates have a standard deviation of 2.5 mm/h, which is higher than the NEXRAD measurements. Thresholding SeaWinds rain estimates at 2 mm/h yields a better rain flag than current rain flag algorithms.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.858431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542358","Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD);QuikSCAT;SeaWinds;rain;scatterometer;simultaneous wind/rain retrieval;wind","Backscatter;Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;Meteorological radar;Oceans;Radar measurements;Rain;Sea measurements;Storms;Wind","atmospheric techniques;backscatter;data acquisition;rain;remote sensing;storms;wind","Ku-band SeaWinds scatterometer;Monte Carlo simulation;NEXRAD;Next Generation Weather Radar;QuikSCAT;SeaWinds-based rain retrieval;Tropical Rain Measuring Mission data;coastal storm events;geophysical model function;near-surface ocean wind vector;noise model;rain backscatter;rain sensitivity;rain-contaminated winds;severe weather events","","10","","17","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The total number of image samples labeled by users in a retrieval session is very limited, and this small number of labeled samples cannot effectively represent the true distributions of positive and negative image classes, especially for the negative image class. This paper proposes a novel approach to deal with this problem. Instead of treating it as a problem, the mere existence of the small number of labeled images and their desired distribution in the kernel space is considered as prior knowledge from image retrieval to aid the design of the kernel used by SVMs. This is achieved by maximizing a criterion, such as one based on scatter matrices, through gradient-based search methods, incurring very little computational overhead to real-time retrieval process. Experimental results on two benchmark image databases demonstrate the improved retrieval performance by the dynamically designed kernel and hence the effectiveness of the proposed approach for SVM based image retrieval","1550-5499;15505499","POD:0-7695-2334-X","10.1109/ICCV.2005.208","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1544877","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kernel;Scattering;Search methods;Support vector machines;Training data","content-based retrieval;gradient methods;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback;support vector machines","CBIR;SVM;gradient-based search;image databases;image retrieval;knowledge-driven kernel design;real-time retrieval process;relevance feedback","","3","","12","","","17-21 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the previous research in ad hoc networks focuses on routing protocols that adapt to the dynamic network topologies, and not much work has been done on data accessing. One important data accessing application is similarity search, which provides the foundation of content-based retrieval. Many traditional similarity search algorithms are based on centralized or flooding mechanisms, which are not effective in wireless ad hoc network environments due to the multiple limitations such as bandwidth and power. In this paper we tackle the problem of similarity search by using semantic-based caching to reflect the data content distribution in the network. The basic idea is analyzing the cached results of earlier queries and trying to resolve the later queries within a small collection of content-related mobile nodes. Based on a Hilbert space-filling curve, the data points in a multi-dimensional semantic space are described as a linear representation. These data points are further cached to facilitate query processing. Through extensive simulations, we show that our method can perform similarity search with improved performance in terms of search cost and response time","0742-1303;07421303","POD:0-7695-2421-4","10.1109/LCN.2005.147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1550848","","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Content based retrieval;Costs;Hilbert space;Information retrieval;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Query processing;Routing protocols","Hilbert spaces;ad hoc networks;cache storage;content-based retrieval;telecommunication computing","Hilbert space-filling curve;centralized mechanism;content-based retrieval;content-related mobile nodes;data accessing;data content distribution;dynamic network topologies;flooding mechanism;linear representation;multi-dimensional semantic space;query processing;routing protocols;semantic-based caching;similarity search algorithms;stationary infrastructures;temporary wireless connections;wireless ad hoc network","","1","","17","","","17-17 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The amount of such knowledge maybe large and ever growing, so the first step of process knowledge reuse is retrieving. A business goal oriented process knowledge retrieving method is introduced. The reuseable process knowledge is organized into process units. A Process Unit semantic description framework is defined. Business goal is also defined using semantic based model. User defined goal description is transformed into target process knowledge description, and used as input of a PK retrieving algorithm on the PK repository. User requirements on target process's functionality, performance and compatibility with collaborative processes are concerned in the retrieving process.

Unfortunately they suffer from recall and precision problems. This paper introduces three strategies for incorporating supporting information into a probabilistic retrieval algorithm in order to improve the performance of dynamic requirements traceability. The strategies include hierarchical modeling, logical clustering of artifacts, and semi-automated pruning of the probabilistic network.

It is assumed that a global message is first distributed to all the nodes, each node receiving the message correctly with probability 1-β. The nodes cooperate in delivering the global message to the mobile access point. Three system configurations are discussed based on whether a polling channel and/or an energy constraint are present. The first type is C-SENMA with Polling with No Energy constraints (PNE), where the mobile access point has the ability to poll individual sensors. Without energy constraints, each sensor can transmit for an unlimited number of times. The second type is C-SENMA with No Polling with No Energy constraints (NPNE), where adaptive polling is not allowed and sensors have to transmit according to a predetermined schedule. The third type is C-SENMA with No Polling with an Energy constraint (NPE), where each node has a limit on the number of transmissions. The capacities of the three system configurations are analyzed. It is shown that, the capacity for C-SENMA PNE is the same as that when there are no misinformed sensors. For C-SENMA NPNE, with the absence of the polling channel, there is a loss on the achievable rate, proportional to β, the probability that a sensor is misinformed. Results are extended to multiple simultaneous transmissions with the presence of channel fading. The optimal number of simultaneous transmissions is investigated under three different fading situations.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2005.858922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542407","Channel capacity;cooperative transmission and networking;multiaccess channels;sensor networks","Capacitive sensors;Fading;Global communication;Information retrieval;Information theory;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Mobile communication;Research initiatives;Telecommunication network reliability","channel capacity;constraint theory;fading channels;mobile agents;mobile computing;multi-agent systems;sensor fusion;wireless sensor networks","C-SENMA;NPE;NPNE;PNE;communication capacity;cooperative sensor network-mobile access;fading channel;misinformed node;multiple simultaneous transmission;no polling-energy constraint;no polling-no energy constraint;polling-no energy constraint","","16","","22","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The long latency of data transfer over Internet results in a serious challenge on ensuring high-performance access to large quantities of data. Furthermore, the vision of grid researches is to provide a collaborative space where scientists can share their data, resources and experiences with others. These issues motivate us to develop a service-based collaborative framework for data-intensive grid applications. In this paper, we describe our initial work towards this goal. We plan to provide an integrated and virtual infrastructure, which manages distributed and diverse data resources and services. By means of Web Services technologies, we can realize the interoperability among various types of resources and integrate computing services with storage services to serve data-intensive applications. By making use of portals and data-intensive applications built on the top of the framework, users will be able to manage and analyze large quantities of data with high performance and share useful data with others in a way of forming virtual groups to complete cooperative work.","1521-9097;15219097","POD:0-7695-2281-5","10.1109/ICPADS.2005.280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524402","","Collaboration;Collaborative work;Delay;Information retrieval;Internet;Performance analysis;Portals;Resource management;Virtual groups;Web services","Internet;distributed databases;grid computing;groupware;information retrieval;open systems;portals;resource allocation","Internet;Web Services technology;data-intensive grid application;distributed data resources;interoperability;portals;service-based collaborative framework","","2","","11","","","20-22 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Shape shifting tries for faster IP route lookup","H. Song; J. Turner; J. Lockwood","Appl. Res. Lab., Washington Univ., USA","13TH IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP'05)","20051205","2005","","","10 pp.","367","Some of the fastest practical algorithms for IP route lookup are based on space-efficient encodings of multi-bit tries (M. Degermark, et al., 1997, W. Eatherton, 1999). Unfortunately, the time required by these algorithms grows in proportion to the address length, making them less attractive for IPv6. This paper describes and evaluates a new data structure called a shape-shifting trie, in which the data structure nodes correspond to arbitrarily shaped subtrees of the underlying binary trie for a given set of address prefixes. The ability to adapt the node shape to the trie reduces the number of nodes that must be accessed to perform a lookup, especially for tries with large sparse regions. We give a fast algorithm for optimally dividing a trie into nodes so as to minimize the maximum lookup depth. We show that seven data structure accesses are sufficient for route tables with more than 150,000 IPv6 prefixes.
