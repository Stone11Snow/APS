The framework focuses on solving two main challenges posed by these kinds of documents: 1) data sparseness and 2) synonyms/homonyms. The former leads to the lack of shared words and contexts among documents while the latter are big linguistic obstacles in natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR). The underlying idea of the framework is that common hidden topics discovered from large external data sets (universal data sets), when included, can make short documents less sparse and more topic-oriented. Furthermore, hidden topics from universal data sets help handle unseen data better. The proposed framework can also be applied for different natural languages and data domains. We carefully evaluated the framework by carrying out two experiments for two important online applications (Web search result classification and matching/ranking for contextual advertising) with large-scale universal data sets and we achieved significant results.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416713","Web mining;classification;contextual advertising.;hidden topic analysis;matching;ranking;sparse data","Advertising;Data mining;Information security;Natural language processing;Predictive models;Text processing;Web search","Internet;advertising;document handling;information retrieval;natural language processing","advertising messages;data sparseness;hidden topic based framework;information retrieval;natural language processing;product descriptions;search result snippets;short Web documents;sparse documents","","23","","42","","20100218","July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many situations, the regulation rules require the acquisition of patients' consent before one can access the patients' medical information. However, in practice, patients oftentimes have difficulties determining whether they should permit a certain access request. In this article, we propose a quantitative approach to assist patients in consent management of their medical information. Our system evaluates access requests based on three factors (importance, sensitivity, normalcy) and makes personalized suggestion to patients. Our design is capable to handle requests in different categories. In situations where patients expect their data to be accessible to the requesters, our solution will make the consent management task effortless for patients. In less critical usage scenarios, our solution will recommend an informed decision by comparing risks and benefits associated with data access. Furthermore, our solution intends to enable patients to review past access activities periodically and can automatically detect potential over-accessing activities from various parties. We have implemented a prototype of our solution and performed simulations on real-world medical history records. We hope our work lays some technical ground for policy makers to derive best practices for health care organizations and enable enforcements of compliance laws such as HIPAA.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4407-6; POD:978-1-4577-0325-6","10.1109/HISB.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061385","access control;consent management;privacy","Dentistry;Hospitals;Knowledge based systems;Privacy;Security;Sensitivity","cost-benefit analysis;decision support systems;information retrieval;medical administrative data processing;medical computing","HIPAA;access request;data access;decision support;importance;normalcy;patient medical information consent management;patients medical information access;quantitative approach;risk-benefit comparison;sensitivity","","0","","13","","","26-29 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was found that different attack strategies were warranted depending on the outcome measure and the network structure. Overall, hub attacks were most effective at reducing network density and clustering, whereas fragmentation attacks were most effective at reducing the network's distance-based cohesion and average path length.

Preliminary data were collected (device-device proximity, duration, and location) gathered in pilot testing on the Blackberry Storm and HTC Hero (Android). Data are presented as distributions and visualization tools for evolving contact graphs, including Pareto distributions and power law exponents generated representative of face to face contacts. Finally, data are then demonstrated to be useful in estimating the potential of infection spread (e.g. respiratory illness), where a key transmission vector is person-person contact.

We adapt a broad-coverage and ambiguity-enabled natural language processing (NLP) system to produce domain-specific logical forms, using knowledge of the domain to zero in on the appropriate interpretation. The vocabulary of the logical forms is drawn from a domain theory that constitutes a higher-level abstraction of the contents of a set of related databases. The meanings of the terms are encoded in an axiomatic domain theory. To retrieve information from the databases, the logical forms must be instantiated by values constructed from fields in the database. The axiomatic domain theory is interpreted by the first-order theorem prover SNARK to identify the groundings, and then retrieve the values through procedural attachments semantically linked to the database. SNARK attempts to prove the logical form as a theorem by reasoning over the theory that is linked to the database and returns the exemplars of the proof(s) back to the user as answers to the query. The focus of this paper is more on the language task, however, we discuss the interaction that must occur between linguistic analysis and reasoning for an end-to-end natural language interface to databases. We illustrate the process using examples drawn from an HIV treatment domain, where the underlying databases are records of temporally bound treatments of individual patients.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4492-2; POD:978-1-4577-1648-5","10.1109/ICSC.2011.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061430","Deductive question answering;HIV drug resistance database;Natural language interfaces to databases;Natural language processing;Theorem proving","Bridges;Cognition;Databases;Drugs;Natural languages;Pragmatics;Semantics","computational linguistics;natural language processing;query processing;question answering (information retrieval);theorem proving;vocabulary","English access;English question;NLP system;ambiguity-enabled natural language processing;axiomatic domain theory;broad-coverage natural language processing;deductive question answering;domain-specific logical form;end-to-end natural language interface;first-order theorem prover SNARK;higher-level abstraction;language task;linguistic analysis;query;reasoning;structured database;vocabulary","","0","","28","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose DARE, a distributed adaptive data replication algorithm that aids the scheduler to achieve better data locality. DARE solves two problems, how many replicas to allocate for each file and where to place them, using probabilistic sampling and a competitive aging algorithm independently at each node. It takes advantage of existing remote data accesses in the system and incurs no extra network usage. Using two mixed workload traces from Face book, we show that DARE improves data locality by more than 7 times with the FIFO scheduler in Hadoop and achieves more than 85% data locality for the FAIR scheduler with delay scheduling.

This map can then be used to search a genome database for all features, related sequences, and metadata annotated with the selected ontology terms. Our code is fully functional and is being distributed as open source software.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4492-2; POD:978-1-4577-1648-5","10.1109/ICSC.2011.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061355","Controlled Vocabulary;GO term;Gene Ontology (GO);Interactive Graphical Interface;Relation;Visual Browser","Bioinformatics;Browsers;Databases;Genomics;Ontologies;Visualization","biology computing;data visualisation;genomics;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","GO Visual Browser;annotated metadata;domain ontologies;gene ontology visualization;genome database;genomic data retrieval;open source software;protein properties;semantic networks","","0","","18","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under the auspices of the SATS program, and with funding from the Mid-Atlantic Maryland SATS Lab<sup>1</sup>, Applied Systems Intelligence, Inc. is prototyping a Cockpit Associate, a knowledge-based decision aiding system that provides the pilot with relevant flight information commonly provided by a co-pilot. The Cockpit Associate can intelligently manage electronic checklists, select navigational charts, and recommend route revisions when world state changes (e.g. weather and traffic). This can improve a single pilot's awareness of pertinent flight information, and at the same time reduce the pilot's cognitive workload that is devoted to obtaining such information. We describe three main functions of the Cockpit Associate: (1) monitoring relevant world state, including pilot actions and aircraft status, (2) matching monitored world state against a model of general aviation flight activities in order to identify the current intent of the pilot (e.g. preparing for takeoff, or reacting to a given emergency), and (3) simplifying the retrieval of relevant information and alerts via use of existing onboard avionics suites and a special-purpose Cockpit Associate display. We present the Cockpit Associate's knowledge-based model of GA flight operations and its prototype implementation in a flight simulation environment. We also discuss a graphical display used to give the pilot shortcuts to a set of dynamically selected alerts and information aids, while leaving the pilot in full control of what information is viewed.

To improve user experience, one must consider dynamic quality of service measures and address the practical challenges they incur. In this paper, we propose using histograms and an area-to-right-of-threshold function to handle the fluctuation and absence of attributes values effectively.

The goal of the approach is to allow the programmer to specify a part of her intent imperatively (that is, give a partial program) and a part of her intent declaratively, by specifying which conditions need to be achieved or maintained. The task of the synthesizer is to construct a program that satisfies the specification. As an example, consider a partial program where threads access shared data without using any synchronization mechanism, and a declarative specification that excludes data races and deadlocks. The task of the synthesizer is then to place locks into the program code in order for the program to meet the specification. In this paper, we argue that quantitative objectives are needed in partial-program synthesis in order to produce higher-quality programs, while enabling simpler specifications. Returning to the example, the synthesizer could construct a naive solution that uses one global lock for shared data. This can be prevented either by constraining the solution space further (which is error-prone and partly defeats the point of synthesis), or by optimizing a quantitative objective that models performance. Other quantitative notions useful in synthesis include fault tolerance, robustness, resource (memory, power) consumption, and information flow.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-0714-7; POD:978-1-4503-0714-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064521","quantitative models;quantitative synthesis;synthesis","Context;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Games;Robustness;Synchronization;Synthesizers","constraint theory;formal specification;information retrieval;synchronisation","Boolean synthesis;computational power;constraint solving technology;declarative specification;fault tolerance;information flow;partial program synthesis;program specification;programmer productivity;quantitative synthesis;resource consumption;shared data access;synchronization mechanism","","0","","42","","","9-14 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When two vehicles are disconnected, they are not able to access data from each other. Data replication has been widely used to reduce the effect of intermittent connectivity and improve data access performance in distributed systems. However, many nodes in VANET may only have limited storage space, and thus cannot replicate all the data such as large music files or video clips. To address this problem, we propose an efficient data replication method for data access applications in VANETs. In this method the vehicles are grouped into a platoon and they contribute part of their buffers to replicate data for others in the same platoon and share data with them. When a vehicle leaves the platoon, it prefetches interested data and transfers its buffered data to other vehicles in advance so that they can still access the data after it leaves. We implement this algorithm in NS-2 and GrooveNet Simulators. The GroveNet Simulator is used to generate the vehicle mobility trace file, which is used in the ns-2 simulations. Extensive simulation results show that this method provides high data availability, low data access overhead, and low false alarm rate.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1894-6; POD:978-1-4577-1895-3","10.1109/ICECCT.2011.6077062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6077062","Data Access Application;Data Replication;Topology;Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs)","Ad hoc networks;Availability;Distributed databases;Monitoring;Prefetching;Roads;Vehicles","information retrieval;telecommunication network topology;vehicular ad hoc networks","GrooveNet simulator;VANET;data access application;data availability;data reduction;data replication method;data sharing;distributed system;false alarm rate;high vehicle mobility;music file;ns-2 simulation;storage space;vehicle mobility trace file;vehicular ad hoc network topology;video clip","","0","","35","","","12-13 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Shortest Path metric, the Number of Paths metric, and the Mean of Path Lengths metric are three attack graph-based security metrics that can extract security-relevant information. However, one's usage of these metrics can lead to misleading results. The Shortest Path metric and the Mean of Path Lengths metric fail to adequately account for the number of ways an attacker may violate a security policy. The Number of Paths metric fails to adequately account for the attack effort associated with the attack paths. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a complimentary suite of attack graph-based security metrics and specify an algorithm for combining the usage of these metrics.

In this paper, we present a novel methodology able to obtain a fast and accurate three-dimensional reconstruction of the fingertip by using a single two-view acquisition and a static projected pattern. The acquisition setup is less constrained than the ones proposed in the literature and requires only that the finger is placed according to the depth of focus of the cameras, and in the overlapping field of views. The obtained pairs of images are processed in order to extract the information related to the fingertip and the projected pattern. The projected pattern permits to extract a set of reference points in the two images, which are then matched by using a correlation approach. The information related to a previous calibration of the cameras is then used in order to estimate the finger model, and one input image is wrapped on the resulting three-dimensional model, obtaining a three-dimensional pattern with a limited distortion of the ridges. In order to obtain data that can be treated by traditional algorithms, the obtained three-dimensional models are then unwrapped into bidimensional images. The quality of the unwrapped images is evaluated by using a software designed for contact-based fingerprint images. The obtained results show that the methodology is feasible and a realistic three-dimensional reconstruction can be achieved with few constraints. These results also show that the fingertip models computed by using our approach can be processed by both specific three-dimensional matching algorithms and traditional matching approaches.

Such traceability applications often need to access data collected by individual enterprises in a distributed environment. Traditional centralized approaches (e.g., data ware-housing) are not feasible for these applications due to their unique characteristics such as large volume of data and sovereignty of the participants. In this paper, we describe an approach that enables applications to share traceability data across independent enterprises in a pure Peer-to-Peer (P2P) fashion. Data are stored in local repositories of participants and indexed in the network based on structured P2P overlays. In particular, we present a generic approach for efficiently indexing and locating individual objects in large, distributed traceable networks, most notably, in the emerging environment of the Internet of Things.

Unlike face to face teaching and learning methods in which teachers and managers can take decisions based on information from everyday classroom activities, decision making in online learning becomes more complex due to the online setting. Teachers need to get information from the online learning system on the learning processes and learners' activities in order to better support them during the learning process. On the other hand, managers need information on the usage of computational resources of the Virtual Campus to make the computational infrastructure as much efficient as possible. In this work we will address the use of massive processing and data mining techniques to assist teachers, managers and developers of a Virtual Campus in their decision making, aiming to better support teaching and learning processes. Our approach is based on processing log files of the online learning system (Virtual Campus, specific learning platform, document repositories) which keep information on online users during their interaction with and within the system. Log files, which are nowadays commonplace in all learning management systems, tend to be large to very large in size, and thus require a massive processing and then statistical analysis and data mining techniques to extract useful information on user activities, resource usage in the Virtual Campus and web content access, among others.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4456-4; POD:978-1-4577-0840-4","10.1109/EIDWT.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076426","Data Mining;Decision Support;Massive Data Processing;Online Learning;Virtual Campuses;Virtual Organizations","Communities;Context;Data mining;Discussion forums;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Mobile communication","Internet;computer aided instruction;content management;data mining;decision making;distance learning;distributed decision making;information retrieval;statistical analysis","Web content access;computational infrastructure;computational resources;data mining;decision making;distance learning;distance teaching;document repositories;information extraction;learning management system;log files;massive processing;online information;online learning system;statistical analysis;virtual campus","","1","","21","","","7-9 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. So there is a need for automatic music classification methods for organizing these collections into different classes according to the certain information. In this work, a new effective feature extraction method is proposed for the classification of music according to the genre. Based on the calculated features, a new feature set is proposed to characterize the music content. The multi-class SVM is used for the classification purposes, which is one of the best classifying engines among the existing ones. Experiment result shows that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods implemented on the same database. A retrieval method is also proposed and its accuracy is verified using the proposed classification algorithm.

Files are typically stored as sequences of data blocks, which have to be reconstructed in the retrieval process. This is commonly performed, among other approaches, through file carving, in general detecting the original block sequences by means of signatures of known headers and footers of files. Of course, this creates challenges with fragmented files, where blocks belonging to different files may be interleaved. Ways to classify file blocks into file types relying on their content may provide a support to achieve a successful reconstruction. We propose to classify file blocks using Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and we do so by studying in-depth the impact of an appropriate selection of the features used in the classification process. We analyze several potential features and test their performance over a large and representative collection of file blocks and file types. We find out that SVM classifiers can achieve a good accuracy and that a specific type of features (based on byte frequency distribution) performs well across almost all of the examined file types.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4485-4; POD:978-1-4577-0979-1","10.1109/ARES.2011.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6045955","File Block Classification;File Carving;Forensic Analysis;Machine Learning","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Entropy;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Support vector machines;Training","computer forensics;information retrieval;pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM classifiers;block sequence;byte frequency distribution;digital forensics;file block;file block classification;file retrieval;file type;fragmented file;support vector machine","","7","1","13","","","22-26 Aug. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For efficient searching in such historical documents, this paper presents a novel approach towards word spotting using string matching of character primitives. We describe the text string as a sequence of primitives which consists of a single character or a part of a character. Primitive segmentation is performed analyzing text background information that is obtained by water reservoir technique. Next, the primitives are clustered using template matching and a codebook of representative primitives is built. Using this primitive codebook, the text information in the document images are encoded and stored. For a query word, we segment it into primitives and encode the word by a string of representative primitives from codebook. Finally, an approximate string matching is applied to find similar words. The matching similarity is used to rank the retrieved words. The proposed method is tested on historical books of French alphabets and we have obtained encouraging results from the experiment.","1520-5363;15205363","Electronic:978-07695-4520-2; POD:978-1-4577-1350-7","10.1109/ICDAR.2011.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6065397","","Image segmentation;Indexing;Layout;Reservoirs;Shape;Text analysis","document handling;information retrieval;natural language processing","French alphabets;Primitive segmentation;character primitives;document images;historical document collections;primitive codebook;template matching;text string;water reservoir technique;word retrieval;word searching","","8","","9","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we used a three-stage method to recognize the GUs. At the first stage, all the GUs are classified into nine groups by decision tree using three features of the GUs. At the second stage, the GUs in each group are classified individually by five independent BP Neutral Networks whose inputs are other five feature vectors of the GUs. At the last stage, the five results of each GU group from the above five classifiers are combined to provide the final recognized result.

In a prior paper [9], we presented a tool called Process Model Requirements Gap Analyzer (ProcGap), which combines natural language processing, information retrieval, and semantic reasoning to automatically match and map textual requirements to domain-specific process models. Although the tool proved beneficial to users in reusing prior knowledge, by making it easy to use process models, the tool has one main drawback. It takes a long time to compare a very large requirements document, one that has a few thousand requirements, to a process model hierarchy with a few thousand capabilities. In this paper, we present how we solved this problem using Apache Hadoop. Apache Hadoop allows ProcGap to distribute matching task across several machines, increasing the tool's performance and usability. We present the performance comparison of running ProcGap on a single-machine, and our distributed version.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4492-2; POD:978-1-4577-1648-5","10.1109/ICSC.2011.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061371","Hadoop;Map-Reduce;Natural Language Processing;document and text processing","Computational modeling;Distributed databases;Manuals;Marketing and sales;Runtime;Semantics;Software","document handling;grammars;information retrieval;natural language processing","Apache Hadoop;ProcGap;capability model;information retrieval;natural language processing;process model requirement gap analyzer;semantic reasoning","","0","","9","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional data and information retrieval systems that support the current web are no longer adequate for knowledge seeking tasks. Knowledge retrieval systems will be the next generation of retrieval systems to serve those purposes. However, the key problem becomes how to construct the basic unit of knowledge retrieval, crossing from data retrieval, information retrieval to knowledge retrieval. From the perspective of knowledge presentation and user needs, the knowledge is a category with context. This paper proposes a semantic text deep mining based on knowledge element. The basic unit of knowledge retrieval and the semantic triangle model of knowledge element are discussed. Application of semantic triangle of knowledge element is given by an example of mining electronic medical records.

We have collected 25 years of data about LeT starting in 1985 and ending in 2010. The data is recorded on a monthly basis and includes the values of approximately 770 variables for each month. The variables fall into two categories -- action variables describing actions taken by LeT during a given month and environmental variables describing the state of the environment in which LeT was functioning. Based on this data, we have used our Stochastic Opponent Modelling Agent (SOMA) platform to automatically learn models of LeT's behavior. These models describe conditions under which LeT took various actions -- more importantly, the conditions act as predictors of when they will take similar actions in the future. In this paper, we focus on attacks by LeT in Jammu & Kashmir. We describe some conditions under which LeT ramps up offensive activities in Jammu & Kashmir.

Such interconnection can reasonably be achieved via gateways. This survey paper reviews concepts and defines a set of criteria that are relevant for the design of such gateways. Furthermore, it compares the applicability of common Internet communication standards like SNMP, LDAP, SQL, native web technologies, OPC XML-DA, and OPC UA as higher-level access protocols to field-level data, thus providing a basis for vertical integration on an application level.

However, due to the unpredictable node mobility in DTNs, traditional caching schemes cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we propose DAC, a novel caching protocol adaptive to the challenging environment of DTNs. Specifically, we exploit the social community structure to combat the unstable network topology in DTNs. We propose a new centrality metric to evaluate the caching capability of each node within a community, and solutions based on this metric are proposed to determine where to cache. More importantly, we consider the impact of the contact duration limitation on cooperative caching, which has been ignored by the existing works. We prove that the marginal caching benefit that a node can provide diminishes when more data is cached. We derive an adaptive caching bound for each mobile node according to its specific contact patterns with others, to limit the amount of data it caches. In this way, both the storage space and the contact opportunities are better utilized. To mitigate the coupon collector's problem, network coding techniques are used to further improve the caching efficiency. Extensive trace-driven simulations show that our cooperative caching protocol can significantly improve the performance of data access in DTNs.","2155-6806;21556806","Electronic:978-0-7695-4469-4; POD:978-1-4577-1345-3","10.1109/MASS.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076596","Contact Duration;Cooperative Caching;Delay Tolerant Networks","Communities;Cooperative caching;Measurement;Mobile communication;Protocols;Random variables;Time factors","cache storage;computer network performance evaluation;information retrieval;network coding;protocols;social sciences;telecommunication network topology","DAC;DTN;contact duration aware approach;cooperative caching protocol;coupon collector problem;data access;delay tolerant networks;mobile node;network coding technique;social community structure;social-based cooperative caching;specific contact pattern;storage space;trace-driven simulation;unpredictable node mobility;unstable network topology","","21","","30","","","17-22 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address this issue by proposing a word spotting based keyword search method for information retrieval in digitized collections of printed Urdu documents. The proposed method is based on segmentation of Urdu text in to partial words and representing each partial word by a set of features. To search a specific word (or phrase), the user provides a query in the form of an image. Comparing the features of the partial words in the query image with the ones already indexed, the user is provided with a list of documents containing occurrences of the queried word.

Many techniques to enforce privacy in LBS have been proposed in the literature, in some cases focusing on anonymizing the requests and in others on obfuscating information in order to decrease its sensitivity. In many cases privacy protection comes at some cost in terms of service precision and performance. In this paper we propose a novel technique that combines the above cited approaches, overcomes some of their limitations in terms of assumptions on adversary knowledge, while still guaranteeing service precision.

Splitting such multi-panel figures into individual subfigures is a necessary step for improved multimodal biomedical information retrieval. Prior to feature extraction for indexing and retrieval of biomedical figures it is necessary to classify image content in each subfigure by its modality (X-ray, MRI, CT, etc.) and other relevant criteria.

Four fraction images (i.e., sunlit canopy, shaded canopy, sunlit background, and shaded background) are calculated and used to develop the canopy closure and LAI. The results show that the predicted crown closure, which was inverted from the sunlit and shaded canopies, has a good agreement with the observed crown closure (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.725). The accuracy assessment indicates that the root mean square error (rmse) and the relative root mean square error (rmse_r) are 10% and 13.37% for the predicted crown closure, respectively. The LAI has the highest correlation coefficient with the shaded background, and it can be fitted by an exponential model (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.497).

One important issue is identification and selection of domain concepts for domain ontology learning when several hundreds or even thousands of terms are extracted and available from relevant text documents shared among the members of a domain. We present a novel domain concept acquisition and selection approach for ontology learning that uses affinity propagation algorithm, which takes as input semantic and structural similarity between pairs of extracted terms called data points. Real-valued messages are passed between data points (terms) until high quality set of exemplars (concepts) and cluster iteratively emerges. All exemplars will be considered as domain concepts for learning domain ontologies.
