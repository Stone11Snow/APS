The investigation was performed at a test site located in the southwest of Sweden consisting mainly of Norway spruce forests. Regression models predicting forest parameters from radar backscattering amplitude were developed and evaluated. The results showed a linear relationship between backscattering amplitude and forest stem volume, stem diameter, and tree height. The analysis also showed that the radar signal is strongly affected by ground slope conditions. The root mean square errors from the regression analysis, restricted to forest stands on near-horizontal ground, were found to be 66 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, 3.2 cm, and 2.3 m for stem volume, stem diameter, and tree height respectively. No saturation of the backscattered signal was observed up to the maximum stem volume of 625 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to a biomass of 375 tons ha<sup>-1</sup>.

The stream on the server can be considered as the hard real-time task in that the server must guarantee the continuity of streams like the hard real-time system must guarantee the deadline of tasks. The management of streams in the server is induced from the scheduling of real-time tasks. We propose hard read-time tasks models for the video server and the scheduling algorithms for real-time tasks. The real-time scheduling algorithms are used for admission control of streams, scheduling of disks, and management of buffers in the video server.

Observed differences between both signals are mainly attributed to atmospheric effects affecting SSM/I data. The use of a semi-empirical model during the 1992 rainy season shows that ΔT temporal evolution is mainly due to the variation of integrated water vapor content of the atmosphere, surface, and air temperature, soil moisture content, and bare soil fraction area. In order to retrieve biomass from SSM/I data, an inversion procedure is performed and compared to previous results obtained with ERS WSC data.

Answering a query in these applications usually involves selecting relevant information sources and generating a query plan to combine the data automatically. As significant progress has been made in source selection and plan generation, the critical issue has been shifting to query optimization. This paper presents a semantic query optimization (SQO) approach to optimizing query plans of heterogeneous multidatabase systems. This approach provides global optimization for query plans as well as local optimization for subqueries that retrieve data from individual database sources. An important feature of our local optimization algorithm is that we prove necessary and sufficient conditions to eliminate an unnecessary join in a conjunctive query of arbitrary join topology. This feature allows our optimizer to utilize more expressive relational rules to provide a wider range of possible optimizations than previous work in SQO. The local optimization algorithm also features a new data structure called AND-OR implication graphs to facilitate the search for optimal queries. These features allow the global optimization to effectively use semantic knowledge to reduce the data transmission cost. We have implemented this approach in the PESTO (Plan Enhancement by SemanTic Optimization) query plan optimizer as a part of the SIMS information mediator. Experimental results demonstrate that PESTO can provide significant savings in query execution cost over query plan execution without optimization","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.895804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=895804","","Application software;Computer networks;Cost function;Information retrieval;Information systems;Query processing;Relational databases;Spatial databases;Sufficient conditions;Topology","data structures;distributed databases;query processing;relational databases","AND-OR implication graphs;PESTO;SIMS information mediator;computer networks;conjunctive query;data retrieval;data structure;data transmission cost;expressive relational rules;global optimization;heterogeneous multidatabase systems;information system applications;join topology;local optimization;necessary conditions;optimal query searching;query execution cost;query plans;relevant information source selection;semantic query optimization;subqueries;sufficient conditions;unnecessary join elimination","","11","4","36","","","Nov/Dec 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Of interest in this paper are mobile procedures querying multiple databases distributed over a network. In the used execution model, mobile execution can profit from both migration, reducing amount of transmitted data, and data prefetching at the most beneficial site. To achieve the lowest response time, an execution strategy should suggest an appropriate mix of agent migration, remote database access and data prefetching. Since there is no universal strategy suggesting the optimal execution in all cases, we must resign ourselves to possibly no optimal solution. The main achievement of this paper consists in proposing four dynamic execution strategies of different implementation complexity with different behavior under various conditions.

Compositional parameters are extracted from images by image segmentation and object extraction procedures. Query is specified through an interactive procedure controlled by a genetic algorithm: First, a user selects one of seven composition templates, each of which represents the typical composition. The system then successively generates patterns of “composition models” according to the templates selected. These composition models describe the pattern of object distribution within an image. A user iteratively selects composition models which properly describe the composition he/she wants. As a result of this interactive and iterative process the system obtains parameter values for an evaluation function. The function are used for judging conformity of images to the query. This method reduces the user's burden of properly specifying the query corresponding to the composition and reflecting user's preference.

With this scenario in mind, we have developed three approaches for supporting multiple clients in combination with a so-called TXAgent (Transaction Processing Agent), which is an object in the fixed network which manages transactions on behalf of the client, and an approach to realise the client as a migrating object.

As a solution, we propose a general framework for mediated information gain: it minimizes and supports the human burden, clearly identifies the algorithmically tractable subtasks and assures a well-understood level of quality. We identify a “mediation task” as an extended amalgamation of searching, querying and updating in traditional information systems, and we introduce the notion of a “formal information state” which unifies and extends the classical notions of a schema, an instance, a query with additional specifications, and a returned answer. The quality is concerned with correctness, precision and completeness. Correctness is guaranteed by maintaining internal consistency, precision is achieved by embeddings identifying only the relevant parts of the sources, and completeness is reached by user interactions with revisions and by iteration.

The central idea is that similarity judgment has to be modeled along perceptual dimensions. Hence, we detect basic visual categories that people use in their judgment of similarity, and design a computational model that accepts patterns as input and, depending on the query, produces a set of choices that follow human behavior in pattern matching. There are two major research aspects to our work. The first one addresses the issue of how humans perceive and measure similarity within the domain of color patterns. To understand and describe this mechanism, we performed a subjective experiment which yielded five perceptual criteria used in comparison between color patterns (vocabulary), as well as a set of rules governing the use of these criteria in similarity judgment (grammar). The second research aspect is the implementation of the perceptual criteria and rules in an image retrieval system. Following the processing typical for human vision, we design a system to: (1) extract perceptual features from the vocabulary and (2) perform the comparison between the patterns according to the grammar rules. The modeling of human perception of color patterns is new - starting with a new color codebook design, compact color representation, and texture description through multi-scale edge distribution along different directions. Moreover, we propose new color and texture distance functions that correlate with human performance.

We identify a safe set of transformations supporting a wide variety of comparisons and show that this set is rich enough to formulate operations such as moving average and time scaling. We also show that queries expressed using safe transformations can efficiently be computed without prior knowledge of the transformations.

Our idea comes from the fact that space-based polarized radiance is mainly due to scattering in the atmosphere, because the polarized component of reflected light from the land surface is diffusely reduced by reaching the top of atmosphere. In other words, polarization data observed by satellite involve strong signal on atmospheric particles. It is shown here that POLDER-polarization data are available for aerosol study over land. Our algorithm for aerosol retrieval is based on the light scattering simulations for send-Stokes vector in the Earth atmosphere model. As a result, a global map of aerosol characteristics over the ocean and land is obtained.

In order to determine LST from IR satellite data the atmospheric influence on the measured radiance has to be accounted for. Provided that the current state of the atmosphere (vertical moisture and temperature profiles) and the surface emissivity are sufficiently well known, it is possible to calculate the atmospheric influence using a radiative transfer model (RTM), e.g. MODTRAN-3. RTMs do not linearise the atmospheric effect and variations of surface emissivity, elevation, and view angle are readily accounted for. However, RTMs are very expensive in terms of computing time and, therefore, not well suited to correct large quantities of data. In order to overcome this limitation, the possibility of substituting MODTRAN-3 by an artificial neural network (ANN) is investigated. The ANN was developed using the evolutionary algorithm ""Evolutionarer Netzwerk Optimierer"" (ENZO) in combination with the Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator (SNNS). The training and validation data consist of MODTRAN-3 calculations for TOVS Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) profiles. The final ANN was verified using RTM results for atmospheric situations described by ECMWF re-analyses (ERA-15). An additional advantage of the presented approach is that historically valuable single channel IR data can be corrected, e.g. the 25 years of METEOSAT data","","POD:0-7803-7031-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2001.976671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976671","","Artificial neural networks;Atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric modeling;Evolutionary computation;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Moisture;Satellites","atmospheric radiation;feedforward neural nets;geophysics computing;radiative transfer;remote sensing","ANN;ECMWF re-analyses;ENZO;ERA-15;Evolutionaerer Netzwerk Optimierer;IR satellite data;MODTRAN-3 calculations;RTM;SNNS;Stuttgart Neural Network Simulator;TIGR profiles;TOVS Initial Guess Retrieval;artificial neural network;atmospheric influence;elevation;energy-budget;evolutionary algorithm;land surface temperature;neural networks;profiles;radiance;radiative transfer modelling;surface emissivity;temperature profiles;thermal infrared;vertical moisture;view angle","","0","","13","","","2001","09 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to semiotics, semantics can be extracted at different levels of signification through a suitable set of rules which combine visual and auditory signs. An intermediate semantic level, which has to do with the combination of low-level signs, such as color, motion, and shape and their changes through time, accounts for the video expressiveness and the emotions provoked.

On the other hand we have to provide the user of the retrieval system with a suitable query tool where he can express his needs in terms he is familiar with. To this end the authors use search terms that origin in the application domain of the user and a graphical tool where the user can give training regions in remote-sensing data. The difference to existing systems is that we explicitly use the scale as a query element. The user has the possibility to indicate the typical size of objects and structures he is looking for.

The impressive 1800 km-wide swath coverage and 25 km resolution of SeaWinds wind vector retrievals are a vast improvement over currently available ocean surface wind vector measurements. In an operational forecasting environment, an understanding of a measured quantity's capabilities and limitations is just as important as its timeliness. The accuracy of high wind speed retrievals are important for determining the intensity of a storm as well as defining the gale force and storm force wind radii. The current Ku-band model function (NSCAT-2) appears to accurately predict the normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) up to around 30 m/s, which is about the upper wind speed limit contained in the matchup data sets used to empirically derive NSCAT-2, The C-band model function (CMOD4) departs from experimental data at around 19 m/s.

The objectives of the validation have been to optimize the algorithms, the processing settings and to predict the performance of the new products and algorithms. For the Level 1b product, the main focus of the validation test has been on the resolution of the propagation direction and the establishment of RMS errors (as compared to simulated spectra) for the main swell spectral parameters. The main result is that when ocean swell system was detected the propagation ambiguity was resolved in 93% of the cases. The spectral peak wavelength and propagation direction RMS were 50 m and 40°, respectively. The mean peak wavelength was for this data set 265 m, and the average azimuth cut-off value was 256 m. The authors conclude that the cross spectra product of the ENVISAT Wave Mode is superior to the existing ERS Wave Mode product in terms of signal-to-clutter ratio and propagation ambiguity.

A possible implementation of such an index is a lexicon, which maintains a complete list of terms in the database. Another approach is to partially index the database by extracting fewer terms but maintaining some information about each document.

Substituting the feature values of multimedia data, which are called sensitivity measures, for the factor scores enables a lot of multimedia data to be retrieved through the impression words such as beautiful and fresh.

As the Web grows, however, the number of matching pages increases at a tremendous rate. Users are often overwhelmed by the large answer set recommended by the search engines. Also, if a matching document is a hypertext, the document structure is destroyed and the individual pages that compose the document are returned instead. The logical starting point of the hyperdocument is thus hidden among the large basket of matching pages. Users need to spend a lot of effort browsing through the pages to locate the starting point, a very time consuming process. This paper studies the anchor point indexing problem. The set of anchor points of a given user query is a small set of key pages from which the larger set of documents that are relevant to the query can be easily reached. The use of anchor points helps solve the problems of huge answer set and low precision suffered by most search engines by considering the hyperlink structures of the relevant documents, and by providing a summary view of the result set.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/5326.885118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=885118","","Computer networks;Helium;IP networks;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Web pages;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;hypermedia;indexing;information resources;information retrieval;search engines","AltaVista;Web document retrieval;World Wide Web search engines;anchor point indexing;hyperdocument;hyperlink structures;hypertext;matching document;result set;search engines;summary view;user query","","3","2","20","","","Aug 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The model represents the footprint area as a combination of part dense, homogeneous vegetation and part bare soil (with homogeneous roughness and dielectric properties). Inversion of this model is then carried out using a retrieval procedure that incorporates a priori information in a quantitative manner The method is applied to the estimation of fractional cover over an area in Africa using WSC data from 1992 to 1995.

Proceedings of the IEEE","20020806","2000","","","523","526","Next generation database systems will need to support both textual data and other types of multimedia data. These two types of data differ in their organization and management. Multimedia data comprises static media like text and images, that do not vary with time, and dynamic or continuous media like audio and video, that varies with time and requires a guaranteed transfer rate. Conventional database systems are designed for managing textual and numerical data, and retrieving such data is often based on simple comparisons of text/numerical values. However, this simple method of retrieval is longer adequate for the multimedia data, since the digitized representation of images, video, or data itself does not convey the reality of these media items. Multimedia data has certain characteristics that complicate their storage in conventional databases or file systems. First, multimedia data tends to be voluminous. Second, continuous media data, such as video and audio have timing characteristics associated with them. The proposed method is to store multimedia objects in a relational database, which offers several advantages over file system storage, like secure back up, concurrent login, and faster retrieval. The paper shows how database systems can be architected to support multimedia data, making use of a relational database system such as MySQL and the application of real time video streaming in delivering such data. Based on the user query, the retrieved audio/video data is streamed over the Web using Real System G2 which provides high quality audio and video at all bit rates and even under lossy network conditions","","POD:0-7803-6312-4","10.1109/SECON.2000.845625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845625","","Database systems;File systems;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Relational databases;Streaming media;Timing","SQL;acoustic streaming;audio systems;educational computing;information resources;information retrieval;multimedia databases;multimedia servers;real-time systems;relational databases;video servers","MySQL database server;PHP;Real System G2;audio/video data;bit rates;concurrent login;continuous media;continuous media data;conventional database systems;digitized representation;fast retrieval;file system storage;guaranteed transfer rate;lossy network conditions;multimedia data;multimedia objects;next generation database systems;online Web based courses;real time video streaming;relational database;secure back up;static media;streaming audio/video;text/numerical values;textual data;timing characteristics;user query","","0","","6","","","2000","07 Apr 2000-09 Apr 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Increasingly, however, they are called upon to perform tasks in an environment not clearly bounded, that of hyperspace. How do we learn to surf in this unfamiliar medium? What strategies do people use when surfing through the unbounded space of hyperlinks or the World Wide Web (WWW)? In order to effectively teach students new surfing skills we must be able to understand how neophyte web users form the cognitive neurological networks that result in a mental pathway, or cognitive map, that makes more navigable the route to further information as well as the information they set out to find. A markovian modeling of users behavior is introduced and compared to a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) that represents the opinions of experts on how users surf the web. Experts are divided on what causes users to fail their queries on the web. This paper shows that a viable FCM model can be developed and some limit-cycle equilibria are uncovered. A FCM limit cycle repeats a sequence of events and actions. Limit cycles can reveal cognitive and behavioral patterns of users on the web. An adaptive FCM is built to reflect its causal behavior in time. This change reflects the users behavior as their knowledge of the web increases with time. The causal behavior learns from data.

These data repositories are implemented using hierarchical storage structures (HSS). One of the components of HSS is tertiary storage, which provides cost-effective storage for the vast amount of data manipulated by these applications. However it is crucial that the 3-4 orders of magnitude difference in access time between tertiary storage and secondary storage be bridged to allow online or near-online access to the tertiary resident data. This wide access-gap is mainly due to: the sequential nature of the most popular tertiary technologies (i.e., tapes) and the low number of drives per media in tertiary storage jukeboxes. In this paper we propose a novel data placement technique specifically designed for the serpentine tape technology, namely: wrap around data placement (WARP). We focus on tape technology because it provides the most cost-effective storage for very large databases, and more specifically on serpentine tapes because they are increasingly the technology of choice for mid-range and high-end systems. WARP may reduce the access time by 1 order of magnitude, depending on the tape device specifications and object sizes. An important feature of WARP is that it optimizes access-time independently of the retrieval order. This is achieved by exploiting the serpentine tape technology characteristics as opposed to the application characteristics.","","POD:0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.927005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927005","","Application software;Auditory displays;Costs;Databases;Electrical capacitance tomography;Explosions;Information retrieval;Memory;Reactive power;Software libraries","magnetic tape storage;storage management;very large databases","access time;data placement techniques;data repositories;drives;hierarchical storage structures;jukeboxes;near-online access;online access;secondary storage;serpentine tapes;tertiary storage;very large databases;wrap around data placement","","1","","19","","","4-7 Jan. 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Installing a computer output to laser disk (COLD) system helped Hershey Entertainment and Resorts save 1000 hours per year. A COLD system's basic advantage is the ability to archive print spool files from a host system in electronic format for fast retrieval. The Metafile COLD system creates a full-text index that specifies the location of each occurrence of a word. Searching the index is quicker than performing a full-text search for each query.

Proceedings of the IEEE","20020806","2000","","","201","204","There has been much interest in databases that store multimedia data, which comprise static media, like text and images, and dynamic or continuous media, like audio and video. Conventional database systems are designed for managing textual and numerical data. Storing and retrieving such data is often based on simple comparisons of text or numerical values. However, this method of storing and retrieval is not adequate for the multimedia data, since the digitized representation of these data types does not convey the reality of these media items. The conventional method is to store the large multimedia data in a file server and store the associated metadata in a database. The retrieval is done by downloading the files from one computer to the user's computer before playing it. The large size of these files results in long download times. The paper proposes an alternative method of storing multimedia data along with its associated metadata in an object-relational database. The proposed method offers faster retrieval time, secured backup, and concurrent login. The paper shows how database systems can be architected to support multimedia data, making use of an object-relational database system such as PostgreSQL. The main challenge is delivering data over the Web using real time video streaming. The results show that there is a significant change in retrieval rate and Web access time when data is stored in a single database instead of a file server. The application of a multimedia database thus created can be used in different application domains such as digital libraries, training and education, medical databases containing X-rays, etc","","POD:0-7803-6312-4","10.1109/SECON.2000.845469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845469","","Audio databases;Biomedical imaging;Database systems;File servers;Image databases;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Software libraries;Streaming media","SQL;information retrieval;multimedia databases;object-oriented databases;relational databases;video servers","PHP;PostgreSQL;Web access time;World Wide Web;concurrent login;continuous media;data types;digital libraries;digitized representation;download times;education;embedded streaming;large multimedia data;large video application streaming;medical databases;metadata;multimedia databases;object-relational database;real time video streaming;retrieval rate;retrieval time;secured backup;static media;training","","0","2","6","","","2000","07 Apr 2000-09 Apr 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although its techniques are general enough to apply to a wide range of domains, BIG specifically helps clients pick software packages. For example, a client can instruct BIG to recommend a database package for Windows 98 and specify constraints on both the search process and the product characteristics. BIG will then formulate a plan, locate and extract relevant information from both structured and unstructured documents, and return a recommendation to the client, along with supporting data. Our focus is on a recently developed capability, namely, to schedule information-gathering activity in a way that controls the money spent on acquiring information from sites that charge a fee for access. This capability supports an information marketplace on the Web, which we feel will eventually supersede (but obviously not completely replace) the current model of free information access supported by advertising fees","1089-7801;10897801","","10.1109/4236.832946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832946","","Advertising;Costs;Data mining;Databases;Humans;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Internet;Packaging;Software packages","information resources;information retrieval;search engines;software agents;software selection","BIG;Bounded Information Gathering;Web-based resource-bounded information-gathering agent;human decision process;information extraction;information location;information marketplace;resource bounded searches;software package selection;structured documents;unstructured documents","","3","1","10","","","Mar/Apr 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, choosing the best mirror site is a non-trivial task and a bad choice may give poor performance. We propose a scheme in which clients access multiple mirror sites in parallel to speedup document downloads while eliminating the problem of server selection. In our scheme, clients connect to mirror sites using unicast TCP connections and dynamically request different pieces of a document from different sites. The amount of data retrieved from a particular site varies depending on the network path/server conditions. Dynamic parallel-access can be easily implemented in the current Internet and does not require any modifications at the mirror sites. Using dynamic parallel-access, all clients experience dramatic speedups in downloading documents, and the load is shared among servers without the need for a server selection mechanism. Even in a situation where clients are connected through modem lines, dynamic parallel-access offers transmission rates at least as high as the fastest server","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:0-7803-5880-5","10.1109/INFCOM.2000.832261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=832261","","Bandwidth;Delay;Information retrieval;Internet;Load management;Mirrors;Modems;Network servers;Unicast;Web server","Internet;cache storage;client-server systems;delays;information retrieval;performance evaluation;transport protocols","Internet;client server system;document downloading;dynamic parallel access;mirror sites;performance;retrieval latencies;unicast TCP connections","","39","84","23","","","2000","26 Mar 2000-30 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use genetic algorithms to determine the relevance/importance of case features and to find optimal retrieval parameters. The optimisation is done using the data contained in the case-base.

To elicit the knowledge embedded in the case structure, a new knowledge representation, named structural cases (SCs), which is the basis of our system, is proposed in order to describe the relationships between two different cases. Based on this representation, a process of transforming the cases into a set of SCs is proposed, where two cases with similarity greater than a given threshold are merged into one SC. Moreover, algorithms for the interaction process based on the SCs are also proposed, which can be used to retrieve more suitable results.

A user of the Internet, at times, seeks information which he may not know to solve a problem.

The search engine then tries to infer and retrieve relevant documents and presents the results in a hit list. But, the relevant documents from the hit list can only be determined by the user. The quality of hit lists very depending on the effectiveness of the indexing process which generate the surrogates from the original documents. Usually, the quality of the hit list can be measured by the precision measure, i.e. the ratio of the number of retrieved and relevant documents over the number of retrieved documents. This measure has been used to evaluate ten major search engines using ten queries at cutoff points of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50. We have also introduced an overlap measure to determine the commonality of documents between the hit lists of various search engines.

Due to the stochastic nature of the cover type definitions, the database system not only retrieves images according to the estimated coverage but also according to the accuracy of that estimation given the current state of learning. For the latter, they introduce the concept of separability. They expand on the steps of Bayesian inference to compute the application-free content index using a family of data models, and on the description of the stochastic link using hyperparameters. In particular, they focus on the interactive nature of their approach, which provides instantaneous feedback to the user in the form of an immediate update of the posterior map, and a very fast, approximate search in the archive.
