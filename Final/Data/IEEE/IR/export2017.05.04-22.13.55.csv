For example, in a company several departments may successively need to buy business intelligence software and employees from these departments may have studied online about different business intelligence tools and their features independently. It will be productive to get them connected and share learned knowledge. We investigate fine-grained knowledge sharing in collaborative environments. We propose to analyze members' web surfing data to summarize the fine-grained knowledge acquired by them. A two-step framework is proposed for mining fine-grained knowledge: (1) web surfing data is clustered into tasks by a nonparametric generative model; (2) a novel discriminative infinite Hidden Markov Model is developed to mine fine-grained aspects in each task. Finally, the classic expert search method is applied to the mined results to find proper members for knowledge sharing. Experiments on web surfing data collected from our lab at UCSB and IBM show that the fine-grained aspect mining framework works as expected and outperforms baselines. When it is integrated with expert search, the search accuracy improves significantly, in comparison with applying the classic expert search method directly on web surfing data.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2411283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056511","Advisor search;Dirichlet processes;Dirichlet processes,;graphical models;text mining;text mining,","Collaboration;Data mining;Data models;Java;Knowledge engineering;Search problems","Internet;competitive intelligence;data mining;groupware;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;knowledge management","IBM;UCSB;Web surfing data;aspect mining framework;business intelligence software;business intelligence tools;collaborative environments;discriminative infinite hidden Markov model;employees;expert search method;fine-grained aspects;fine-grained knowledge sharing;nonparametric generative model","","1","","30","","20150309","Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Discovering and Leveraging Content Similarity to Optimize Collective on-Demand Data Access to IaaS Cloud Storage","B. Nicolae; A. Kochut; A. Karve","IBM Res., Ireland","2015 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing","20150709","2015","","","211","220","A critical feature of IaaS cloud computing is the ability to quickly disseminate the content of a shared dataset at large scale. In this context, a common pattern is collective on-demand read, i.e., accessing the same VM image or dataset from a large number of V Minstances concurrently. There are various techniques that avoid I/Ocontention to the storage service where the dataset is located without relying on pre-broadcast. Most such techniques employ peer-to-peer collaborative behavior where the VM instances exchange information about the content that was accessed during runtime, such that it impossible to fetch the missing data pieces directly from each other rather than the storage system. However, such techniques are often limited within a group that performs a collective read. In light of high data redundancy on large IaaS data centers and multiple users that simultaneously run VM instance groups that perform collective reads, an important opportunity arises: enabling unrelated VMinstances belonging to different groups to collaborate and exchange common data in order to further reduce the I/O pressure on the storage system. This paper deals with the challenges posed by such absolution, which prompt the need for novel techniques to efficiently detect and leverage common data pieces across groups. To this end, we introduce a low-overhead fingerprint based approach that we evaluate and demonstrate to be efficient in practice for a representative scenario on dozens of nodes and a variety of group configurations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8006-2; POD:978-1-4799-8007-9","10.1109/CCGrid.2015.156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152487","cloud storage;collective I/O;content similarity;deduplication;on-demand data access","Cloud computing;Collaboration;Context;Mirrors;Peer-to-peer computing;Prefetching;Virtual machine monitors","cloud computing;groupware;information retrieval;input-output programs;peer-to-peer computing;storage management","I/O contention;IaaS;cloud computing;cloud storage;collective on-demand data access;content similarity;peer-to-peer collaborative behavior;storage service","","3","","28","","","4-7 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be solved by diversification of the recommendation list, a process that implements a tradeoff between accuracy and diversity of recommended items. Normally, item metadata is used in the diversity measure. In certain cases however, the item metadata may not be available thus a different approach to measure diversity is required. The aim of this preliminary study is to determine whether latent features can be used to measure the diversity of recommended items. In order to resolve this we generated recommendation lists for 43 different users using the LDOS-CoMoDa dataset. We then evaluated the diversity of these lists using the standard intra-list diversity measure. In addition we calculated the diversity of each list by comparing the latent features (calculated using the matrix factorization approach) of each item on the list. The comparison of both value sets showed that they show similar characteristics which implies that latent feature space offers an alternative method of evaluating item diversity when no metadata is present.","","DVD:978-9-5323-3085-4; Electronic:978-9-5323-3082-3; POD:978-1-4799-8174-8","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160463","","Accuracy;Atmospheric measurements;Context;Frequency diversity;Motion pictures;Recommender systems","information retrieval;matrix decomposition;meta data;recommender systems","LDOS-CoMoDa dataset;content recommender system;item diversity evaluation;item metadata;latent feature space;matrix factorization approach;recommendation list diversity measurement;recommended item accuracy;standard intralist diversity measure;user experience;value sets","","0","","13","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a constantly growing interest in developing and evaluating music information retrieval (MIR) systems that can provide automated access to the music mood. The proposed method considers the different types of audio features. From each feature's frame, a bin histogram has been calculated to preserve all important information associated with it. The histogram bins of each feature are used to calculate the similarity matrix, and the number of similarity matrices depends on the number of audio features. Therefore, there are 59 similarity matrixes from the corresponding same amount of audio features. The intra and inter similarity matrix are used to calculate the intra-inter similarity ratio. These similarity ratios are sorted in descending order in each feature. Among them, some of the selected similarity ratios are ultimately used as prototypes from each feature and are used for classification by designing the nearest multi-prototype classifier. The Coimbra mood dataset is used to measure the overall performance of the proposed method. We achieved competitive classification accuracies as compared with other existing state-of-the-art music mood classification techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8679-8; POD:978-1-4799-8680-4","10.1109/ICIS.2015.7166610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166610","feature pool;histogram;multi-prototype;similarity matrix","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Histograms;Indexes;Mood;Music;Prototypes","information retrieval;matrix algebra;multimedia databases;music","Coimbra mood dataset;MIR systems;audio features;bin histogram;computational musicology;feature frame;intra-inter similarity ratio;multimedia database retrieval;music information retrieval systems;nearest multiprototype based music mood classification;similarity matrix","","0","","8","","","June 28 2015-July 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a hybrid approach for generating proofs of cloud search results. Specifically, we model search indices as sets and search operations as set intersections, and build proofs based on RSA accumulators and aggregated membership and no membership witnesses. Because generating witnesses for large sets is computationally expensive, we employ interval-based witnesses for fast proof generation. To reduce proof size, our hybrid method uses Bloom filters when set difference is large.

Human Sensor Web (HSW) is a network of people who interact with their devices in order to forward their observations to a designated receiving server in the form of messages (such as SMS and USSD). It capitalizes on the accessibility of ICT tools (such as mobile phones) by non-experts to use them as sensory nodes in order to generate useful data regarding various location-oriented phenomena - such as the status of public service facilities. We presumed and tested that with the controlled use of its context, the smartness of the HSW can be boosted. The smart system uses context to make intelligent analysis such as credibility assessment of user-generated data and context-aware retrieval of geo-information, which would have been impossible otherwise. In this paper, we proposed and tested a software architecture to achieve this goal. We deployed the design solution on a mobile reporting system for functionality of water points in rural Tanzania under the SEMA project.

These properties enable DWM to become an attractive candidate for replacing traditional memories. However, data accesses on DWM may require multiple shift operations before the port points to requested data, resulting in varying access latencies. Data placement, therefore, has a significant impact on the performance of data accesses on DWM. This paper studies compiler-based optimization techniques for data placement on DWM. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first work addressing data placement problem on DWM. We present an efficient heuristic, called Grouping-Based Data Placement (GBDP), for the data placement problem of a given data access sequence on DWM.

In the past, a significant amount of research has been focusing on the aspect of effective and efficient recognition. Yet, when context is shared with others, the resulting disclosure of personal information can have undesirable privacy implications. A common solution to this problem is the manual creation of an application-specific privacy policy that defines which information may be shared with whom. However, as the number of applications increases, such a manual approach becomes increasingly cumbersome and over time, it is likely to lead to incomplete or even inconsistent policies. In this paper, we discuss how a privacy policy can be derived automatically by analyzing the user's sharing behaviour when using online collaboration tools. Our approach retrieves shared content and the associated sharing settings, detects context types and automatically derives a privacy policy that reflects the user's past sharing behaviour. To validate our approach, we have implemented it as an extensible software library for the Android platform and we have developed plug-ins for two popular collaboration tools, namely Google Calendar and Facebook.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6654-0; POD:978-1-4673-6655-7","10.1109/IE.2015.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194273","Privacy policy;context-sharing;online services;policy derivation","Collaboration;Context;Data privacy;Facebook;Generators;Google;Privacy","Android (operating system);data privacy;information retrieval;social networking (online);software libraries","Android platform;Facebook;Google Calendar;application-specific privacy policy;automated user context recognition;automated user context sharing;automatic privacy policy generation;collaboration tools;context-sharing applications;information sharing;online collaboration tools;personal information disclosure;pervasive computing applications;plug-ins;privacy implications;shared content retrieval;software library;user sharing behavior analysis","","0","","20","","","15-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For mapping gaze information from captured video scenes to the original document, we adopted the Locally Likely Arrangement Hashing (LLAH) method for robust document retrieval. In our experimental system, participants read digital documents from the screen with and without the aesthetic GR parameter. Then, gaze data captured by the eye tracker's embedded camera is mapped to the corresponding original document.

Therefore, we investigated human inspired forgetting as a data reduction tool.

Most existing methods adopt shallow structures to perform multimodal representation learning. Due to a limitation of learning ability of shallow structures, they fail to capture the correlation of multiple modalities. Recently, multimodal deep learning was proposed and had proven its superiority in representing multimodal data due to its high nonlinearity. However, in order to learn compact and accurate representations, how to reduce the redundant information lying in the multimodal representations and incorporate different complexities of different modalities in the deep models is still an open problem. In order to address the aforementioned problem, in this paper we propose a hashing-based orthogonal deep model to learn accurate and compact multimodal representations. The method can better capture the intra-modality and inter-modality correlations to learn accurate representations. Meanwhile, in order to make the representations compact, the hashing-based model can generate compact hash codes and the proposed orthogonal structure can reduce the redundant information lying in the codes by imposing orthogonal regularizer on the weighting matrices. We also theoretically prove that, in this case, the learned codes are guaranteed to be approximately orthogonal. Moreover, considering the different characteristics of different modalities, effective representations can be attained with different number of layers for different modalities. Comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate a substantial gain of our method on retrieval tasks compared with existing algorithms.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2015.2455415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154455","Deep learning;multimodal hashing;similarity search","Binary codes;Complexity theory;Computer aided engineering;Correlation;Joints;Redundancy;Semantics","data structures;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra","compact hash codes learning;hashing-based orthogonal deep model;inter-modality correlation;intra-modality correlation;multimodal data;multimodal deep learning;multimodal representation learning;orthogonal deep structure;orthogonal regularizer;weighting matrix","","1","","55","","20150710","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes an agent-based model that simulates processes in which a digital object become obsolescent, thus a preservation action, such as the migration to the most appropriate format, is required. Agents monitor and control the local environment and deal with preservation issues individuating obsolescent formats based on global parameters such as their diffusion. They exchange information to find out the most suitable preservation action: suggestions are evaluated and propagated according to their reciprocal level of trust. The level of trust is automatically updated after every interaction through a feedback mechanism based on stigmergy. The paper shows that the framework has a stable behaviour under several use cases. Therefore this approach is suitable for digital archives that may take advantage of a multi-agent system which can either perform an autonomous preservation action or suggest a list of best candidate solutions to the user.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7079-7; POD:978-1-4799-7080-3","10.1109/ICMEW.2015.7169866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169866","ABM;Autonomous Actions;Digital Preservation;MAS","Aging;Computational modeling;Digital preservation;Market research;Monitoring;Stability analysis;Time-frequency analysis","digital preservation;information retrieval systems;multi-agent systems","agent-based model;autonomous digital preservation;digital archive;digital object;feedback mechanism;global parameter;multiagent approach;stigmergy","","0","","20","","","June 29 2015-July 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the graphs, nodes mean the content files or the groups, and edges mean correspondences or group members. The graphs are archived as relation catalogues separately from content files. We visualize the relations of content on a directed graph. To visualize the graphs, we use a method of locating nodes by horizontal directions and height. Nodes linked with a target node will be located on a horizontal circle and their height is decided by their relation catalogue. After deciding the node location, nodes and links are drawn using 3D graphics and animation. The visualization result called “polymorphic view” is used as a visual interface for selecting content. Selecting content on the visualized graph will expand new links and new content nodes additionally. We can show another content by tracing graph links. It becomes easy to understand the relations between digital content, because we can change the direction and size of the directed graph.

Considering the specific characteristics of social tags, we here introduce a new model named Joint Latent Dirichlet Allocation (JLDA) to capture the relationships among users, objects, and tags. The model assumes that the latent topics of users and those of objects jointly influence the generation of tags. The latent distributions is then inferred with Gibbs sampling. Experiments on two social tag data sets have demonstrated that the model achieves a lower predictive error and generates more reasonable topics.

The impossibility of reading all these documents is paving the way to semantic-based technologies that are able to extract from unstructured documents relevant information for analysts. Most solutions extract uncorrelated pieces of information from individual documents; few of them create links among related documents and, to the best of our knowledge, no technology focuses on the time evolution of relations among entities. We propose a novel approach for managing, querying and visualizing temporal knowledge extracted from unstructured documents that can open the way to novel forms of sense-making and decision-making processes. We leverage state-of-the-art natural language processing engines for the semantic analysis of textual data sources to build a temporal graph database that highlights relationships among entities belonging to different documents and time frames. Moreover, we introduce the concept of temporal graph query that analysts can use to identify all the relationships of an entity and to visualize their evolution over time. This process enables the application of statistical algorithms that can be oriented to the automatic analysis of anomalies, state change detection, forecasting. Preliminary results demonstrate that the representation of the evolution of entities and relationships allows an analyst to highlight relevant events among the large amount of open source documents.","2325-5366;23255366","Electronic:978-9-9499-5443-8; POD:978-1-4799-8812-9","10.1109/CYCON.2015.7158477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158477","decision-making;open sources;semantic analysis;sense-making;temporal query","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Databases;Decision making;Engines;Semantics;Time series analysis","decision making;document handling;information retrieval;natural languages;public domain software","decision-making processes;knowledge extraction;natural language;open source information;semantic-based technologies;sense-making;temporal knowledge management;temporal knowledge querying;temporal knowledge visualization;time evolution analysis;unstructured documents","","0","","34","","","26-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, to date, there is no principled method to collect or analyze API usability information that incorporates input from typical developers. In practice, developers often turn to Q&A websites such as stackoverflow.com (SO) when seeking expert advice on API use, the popularity of such sites has thus led to a very large volume of unstructured information that can be searched with diligence for answers to specific questions. The collected wisdom within such sites could, in principle, be of great help to API designers to better support developer needs, if only it could be collected, analyzed, and distilled for practical use. In this paper, we present a methodology that combines several techniques, including social network analysis and topic mining, to recommend SO posts that are likely to concern API design-related issues. To establish a comparison baseline, we introduce two more recommendation approaches: a reputation-based recommender and a random recommender. We have found that when applied to Q&A discussion of two popular mobile platforms, Android and iOS, our methodology achieves up to 93% accuracy and is more stable with its recommendations when compared to the two baseline techniques.","2160-1852;21601852","Electronic:978-0-7695-5594-2; POD:978-1-4673-7924-3","10.1109/MSR.2015.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7180082","API usability;application program interfaces;online Q&amp;A;recommendation systems;software ecosystems;stackoverflow","Androids;Communities;Computer bugs;Documentation;Humanoid robots;Usability","Web sites;application program interfaces;question answering (information retrieval);recommender systems;software engineering","API design;Q&A sites;SO posts;random recommender;reputation-based recommender;social network analysis;software developers;stackoverflow.com;topic mining","","1","","42","","","16-17 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PhaseLift is a recently introduced algorithm for phase recovery that is computationally tractable and numerically stable. However, initial rigorous performance guarantees relied specifically on Gaussian random measurement vectors. To date, it remains unclear which properties of the measurements render the problem well-posed. With this question in mind, we employ the concept of spherical t-designs to achieve a partial derandomziation of PhaseLift. Spherical designs are ensembles of vectors which reproduce the first 2t moments of the uniform distribution on the complex unit sphere. As such, they provide notions of “evenly distributed” sets of vectors, ranging from tight frames (t = 1) to the full sphere, as t approaches infinity. Beyond the specific case of PhaseLift, this result highlights the utility of spherical designs for the derandomization of data recovery schemes.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7353-1; POD:978-1-4673-7354-8; USB:978-1-4673-7352-4","10.1109/SAMPTA.2015.7148878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7148878","low rank matrix recovery;phase retrieval;spherical designs","Atmospheric measurements;Compressed sensing;Particle measurements;Phase measurement;Physics;Standards;Weight measurement","information retrieval;signal processing","Gaussian random measurement vector;amplitude measurement;data recovery scheme;partial derandomziation;phase information retrieval;phase recovery;phaselift;uniform distribution","","2","","38","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But does the asker's choice always match the popular vote? If so, is the asker's choice influenced by the community vote or is the community vote biased towards the accepted answer? And if the asker and community disagree, then can we determine any particular characteristics of posts that influence the choice of the asker and community differently, such as its size, readability, presence of code snippets and external links as well as similarity to the original question?

Specifically, the time-frequency (T-F) representations of the song are firstly decomposed into components, and each component approximately originates from a single sound source.

To crawl, store, and use such duplicated data implies a waste of resources, the building of low quality rankings, and poor user experiences. To deal with this problem, several studies have been proposed to detect and remove duplicate documents without fetching their contents. To accomplish this, the proposed methods learn normalization rules to transform all duplicate URLs into the same canonical form. A challenging aspect of this strategy is deriving a set of general and precise rules. In this work, we present DUSTER, a new approach to derive quality rules that take advantage of a multi-sequence alignment strategy. We demonstrate that a full multi-sequence alignment of URLs with duplicated content, before the generation of the rules, can lead to the deployment of very effective rules. By evaluating our method, we observed it achieved larger reductions in the number of duplicate URLs than our best baseline, with gains of 82 and 140.74 percent in two different web collections.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2407354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050346","Web technology;web crawling and normalization rules","Algorithm design and analysis;Crawlers;Noise;Search engines;Training;Transforms;Uniform resource locators","Internet;data mining;information retrieval","DUSTER;URL;Web collections;Web crawlers;content fetching;duplicate document removal;multiple alignment;multisequence alignment strategy;near-duplicate contents;ranking quality","","0","","15","","20150226","Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose an algorithm for finding an approximate Pareto frontier containing a family of solutions. The power of this approach is demonstrated on a Twitter dataset, where the nodes are hashtags and the layers correspond to (1) behavioral edges connecting pairs of hashtags whose temporal profiles are similar and (2) relational edges connecting pairs of hashtags that appear in the same tweets.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4673-6997-8; POD:978-1-4673-6998-5; USB:978-1-4673-6996-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7179013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7179013","Community detection;Twitter;multi-layer networks","Communities;Correlation;Linear programming;Optimization;Tagging;Twitter","Pareto optimisation;information retrieval;social networking (online)","Pareto frontier approximation;Pareto optimality;Twitter;behavioral edge connecting pairs;community detection;community structure encoding;hashtags;information extraction;multilayer social networks;multiple criterion optimization problem;relational edges connecting pairs;temporal profile","","2","","17","","","19-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The configuration of LSI, which depends on the underlying dataset, greatly influences the accuracy of the results. Therefore, one of the key challenges for applying LSI is finding an appropriate configuration. Evaluating results for each configuration is time consuming, and therefore, automatically determining an appropriate configuration for LSI improves the applicability of LSI based methods. We propose a fully automated technique to determine appropriate configurations for LSI to recover links between requirements artifacts. We evaluate our technique on six sets of requirements artifacts from industry and academia and show that the configurations selected by our approach yield results that are almost as accurate as results from configurations based on a ground truth like known links or expert knowledge.

There is a need to draw a systematic approach to understanding this using computational method. The rapid progress of biotechnology and bio-data analysis methods has led to the emergence and fast growth of a promising new field: bioinformatics. It is a field having incredible amount of bio-data which needs exhaustive analysis. Biodata is available as, Nucleotide sequences (DNA and RNA sequences), Protein sequences, Genomes and structures in the form of Biological networks (metabolic pathways, gene regulatory network and protein interaction network). In this paper I am presenting a framework to discover frequent patterns and modules from biological networks. From the study of different Biological networks it can be concluded that the best way to analyze and extract the information (frequent functional module) from biological network is through graph mining, since these networks can be modeled into different types of graphs according to the information needs to be extracted. But these graph based mining approach often leads to computationally hard problem due to their relation with sub graph isomorphism. Here I am using graph simplification technique, suitable to biological networks, which make it possible to help the graph mining problem computationally scalable and tractable to very large numbers of networks. So detection of frequently occurring patterns and modules will be a computationally simpler task since the reduction in the effective graph size significantly.","","DVD:978-1-4673-6910-7; Electronic:978-1-4673-6911-4; POD:978-1-4673-6912-1","10.1109/ICACEA.2015.7164735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7164735","Biological Networks;Data Mining;Graph Mining;Metabolic Pathways","Algorithm design and analysis;Computers;Data mining;Mathematical model;Proteins","bioinformatics;data mining;information retrieval","bioinformatics;biological networks;frequent pattern discovery;graph mining problem;graph simplification technique;information extraction;sub graph isomorphism","","0","","23","","","19-20 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing approximate duplicate-detection methods in the sliding window model are not memory-efficient, since that they don't incorporate the information on the query frequencies and membership likelihoods of the elements in a large universe U into their data structure design, while the information can be obtained with well-developed technique. In this paper, assuming that either the query frequency or membership likelihood is uniform for all elements in U, we adopt a block-wise updating strategy to design an memory-efficient data structure, called cell Bloom filter (CEBF), and an approximate duplicate-detection algorithm based on CEBF.

In the original proposal the configuration of location and size of the regions pairs was determined manually to optimally encode how energy flows around the spectral peak. Such manual selection has always been considered as a weakness in the process as it might not be adapted to the actual data being represented. In this paper we address this problem by proposing a unsupervised, data-driven method based on mutual information theory to automatically define an optimal MASK fingerprint structure.

We propose to use Gaussian component index based n-grams as acoustic features in a submodular function for unsupervised data selection. The submodular function provides a near-optimal solution in terms of the objective being optimized. Moreover, to further resolve the high out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate for morphologically-rich languages like Tamil, word-morph mixed language modeling is also considered. Our experiments are conducted on the Tamil speech provided by the IAPRA Babel program for the 2014 NIST Open Keyword Search Evaluation (OpenKWS14). We show that the selection of data plays an important role to the word error rate of the speech recognition system and the actual term weighted value (ATWV) of the keyword search system.

Work described in this paper represents an extension of previous Erlang-based concurrent activation. ACT-R's retrieval process is re-examined and optimized in this solution. Concurrency available in the execution platform is exploited to maximize the acceleration of declarative retrieval. The resulting implementation, referred to as Accelerated Declarative Memory (ADM), presents a high-performance activation calculation that enables practical use of more massive declarative memories. ADM presents new mechanisms to access and traverse declarative memory to reduce the overhead of executing retrievals. This solution offers retrieval latencies 20 times faster than the previous Erlang solution.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8676-7; POD:978-1-4799-8677-4","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176183","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176183","ACT-R;MapReduce;declarative memory;parallel activation calculation;semantic networks","Acceleration;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Context;Knowledge engineering;Mathematical model;Semantics","C++ language;cognition;data handling;information retrieval;parallel processing","ACT-R retrieval mechanism;ADM;C++;Erlang-based concurrent activation;MapReduce program model;cognitive architecture;declarative knowledge retrieval system;high performance declarative memory systems;high-performance activation calculation","","0","","9","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous surveys had asserted the need to include information literacy or information competencies, differentiated from already present tool literacy or technological competencies, in students' curricula on the University. The aim of this survey was to analyse the students' information competencies as well as examine the students' attitude towards introducing an undergraduate course, during which they would learn how to efficiently search for information in the electronic environment while preparing seminar papers and exams. Furthermore, to gain an insight into the students' information retrieval accuracy in course-related research, the authors of this paper shall evaluate their information behaviour, i.e. investigate whether the students develop an overall research plan or search in relevant information sources, e.g. peer-reviewed databases etc. The research results can be helpful to determine the importance of information awareness at this level of education.","","DVD:978-9-5323-3085-4; Electronic:978-9-5323-3082-3; POD:978-1-4799-8174-8","10.1109/MIPRO.2015.7160361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160361","","Databases;Electronic learning;Google;Information science;Libraries;Seminars","further education;information retrieval;information science education","Department of Information and Communication Sciences;Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences;University of Zagreb;course-related research;electronic environment;information awareness;information behaviour;information competencies;information literacy assessment;information retrieval accuracy;information sources;peer-reviewed databases;student curricula;technological competencies;tool literacy;undergraduate student perspective","","0","","13","","","25-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many practical settings, however, it is unclear whether a specific pieceof data is essential because either file system specifications are ambiguous or the importance of a specific data fielddepends on the operating system that processes the file system data. We therefore revisit Carrier's definition andshow that there are two types of essential data: strong and weak. While strongly essential corresponds to Carrier'sdefinition, weakly essential refers to application specific interpretations.

MyBSP supports and implements the Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) programming model, and introduces a module of parallel execution unit to achieve iterative processing, which avoids the restart cost of computation jobs, and therefore reduces the I/O overhead (e.g., network communication and disk access). Furthermore, we implement the MyBSP-based PageRank algorithm. Some experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance and scalability of our MyBSP prototype system with MapReduce model. The experimental results show that the speedup in MyBSP compared to MapReduce is about 3.5X for the small-size graph dataset.

In the last decade, popularity of such services has increased noticeably. Large number of unanswered questions is a major problem for the growth of such services. A common way to address this issue is to route a new question to some selected users who have the potentiality in answering the question. Expert finding is the process of selecting such potential answerers. In this article, we have introduced an efficient method for expert finding using the theme in query likelihood language (QLL) model. Theme of a query is nothing but its subject matter and we have decided it based on the parts of speech (POS) of the words in the query. Depending on the theme of the given question, its similarity to a question in the archive is determined using the QLL model. Aggregating the similarity values of the questions a user answered previously (i.e., in the archive), his/her expertise for the given question is obtained. The performance of the proposed method is verified on a real world dataset (obtained from Yahoo!

Since cloud is a collection of machines called servers and all users' data stored on these machines, it emerges the security issues of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Authentication and authorization for data access on cloud is more than a necessity. Our work attempts to overcome these security challenges. The proposed methodology provides more control of owner on the data stored on cloud by restricting the access to specific user for specific file with limited privileges and for limited time period on the basis of secret key using symmetric as well as asymmetric mechanism.

Although audio fingerprinting can greatly reduce its dimension while keeping audio identifiable, the dimension for audio fingerprints is still too high to scale up for big audio data. The tradeoff between accuracy (measured by precision and recall rate) and efficiency (measured by retrieval time) prevents further reduction in the dimension of fingerprints. This paper shows that a multi-stage filtering strategy can achieve both speedup and high accuracy, with the beginning stages focusing on speedup and the end stage emphasizing accuracy. With this strategy, an efficient cascaded filtering retrieval method is proposed that consists of filtering with Fibonacci hashing, the middle fingerprint, thresholds to quickly select candidate audios, and refining with an accurate and robust fingerprint on the candidate audios. Experiments with 500 000 audios show that the proposed method can achieve a speed gain more than 28 K times that of the Fibonacci hashing retrieval. After applying MP3 conversion, resampling, white noise addition, and background noise addition, the recall rates of the method are all above 99.45%, and the precision is the same as the Philips audio fingerprint, which is close to 100%.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2015.2460121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165676","Audio middle fingerprint;Philips audio fingerprint;big audio data;cascade filtering retrieval;content-based retrieval","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Audio databases;Filtering;Fingerprint recognition;Robustness","Internet;audio signal processing;filtering theory;information retrieval","Fibonacci hashing retrieval;Internet;MP3 conversion;audio fingerprinting;big audio data;efficient cascaded filtering retrieval method;multistage filtering strategy","","3","","16","","20150723","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The unstoppable trend draws researchers' attention to develop approaches to efficiently retrieve and manage multimedia data. The inadequacy of keyword-based search in multimedia data retrieval due to non-existent or incomplete text annotations has called for the development of a contentbased multimedia data management framework. Specifically, detecting high-level semantic concepts is one of the rapidly growing topics in this regard. In order to thoroughly identify semantic concepts in data which have different representations and are derived from different modalities, both positive and negative inter-concept correlations have been recently studied and explored to enhance the re-ranking performance. In this paper, an indirect association rule mining (IARM) approach is introduced to reveal the hidden correlation among semantic concepts. The effectiveness of IARM is evaluated by Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). Furthermore, normalization and score integration are performed to achieve the optimal classification results.

The possibility of detecting respondents capable of appropriately answering a newly posted question is examined and confirmed. Based on this, the proposed method uses the number of appearances of each respondent and scores them based on the distance between the factor scores of a question and previously posted answers. Impressions of statements were obtained for nine factors. Factor scores were estimated using multiple regression on the feature values of the statements. This method was evaluated by experiments that compared its precision and recall with those of methods based on average scores and distances. It was shown that the proposed method outperforms these other methods. It is also shown that, for a given question, the proposed method can successfully select those respondents who are more appropriate than around average.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8676-7; POD:978-1-4799-8677-4","10.1109/SNPD.2015.7176254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7176254","Answerer Introduction;Factor Score;Impression;Q&A Sites","Decision support systems","Internet;question answering (information retrieval)","Internet;Q&A sites;appropriate respondents;factor scores;multiple regression;questions at question-and-answer sites;selecting respondents","","0","","12","","","1-3 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing designs provide the basic functions with some customized features. Unfortunately, some important issues have always been ignored including privacy protection, QoS and cipher-text search. In this paper, we present Spy, our design for an anonymous storage overlay network on multiple personal cloud storage, supporting a flexible QoS awareness and cipher-text search. We reform the original Tor protocol by extending the command set and adding a tail part to the Tor cell, which makes it possible for coordination among proxy servers and still keeps the anonymity. Based on which, we proposed a flexible user-defined QoS policy and employed a Dynamic Searchable Symmetric Encryption (DSSE) scheme to support secure cipher-text search. Extensive security analysis prove the security on privacy preserving and experiments show how different QoS policy work according to different security requirements.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8006-2; POD:978-1-4799-8007-9","10.1109/CCGrid.2015.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152581","Cipher-text search;DSSE;PCS;Privacy Preserving;QoS","Cloud computing;Encryption;Indexes;Quality of service;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;information retrieval;quality of service;storage management","DSSE;QoS-aware anonymous multicloud storage system;Spy;Tor cell;Tor protocol;anonymous storage overlay network;cipher-text search;dynamic searchable symmetric encryption scheme;flexible QoS awareness;flexible user-defined QoS policy;multiple personal cloud storage;multiple personal cloud storages;overlay storage system;privacy protection;security requirements","","0","","31","","","4-7 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The employment of caches may be accomplished using graph-based and content-based criteria such as the position of a node in a network and content popularity. The contribution of this paper lies on the characterization of content popularity for on-path in-network caching. To this end, four dynamic approaches for identifying content popularity are evaluated via simulations. Content popularity may be determined per chunk or per object, calculated by the number of requests for a content against the sum of requests or the maximum number of requests. Based on the results, chunk-based approaches provide 23% more accurate content popularity calculations than object-based approaches. In addition, approaches that are based on the comparison of a content against the maximum number of requests have been shown to be more accurate than the alternatives.","1673-5447;16735447","","10.1109/CC.2015.7188521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7188521","caching technologies;content popularity;future internet;information-centric networks;network distributed architectures;on-path caching","Complexity theory;Heuristic algorithms;Measurement;Network topology;Peer-to-peer computing;Pollution;Probabilistic logic","Internet;cache storage;graph theory;information retrieval;telecommunication traffic","ICN;Internet infrastructure;content distribution;content popularity calculation;content retrieval;content-based criteria;graph-based criteria;information-centric network;network traffic;object-based approach;on-path in-network caching","","1","","","","","July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The review focuses on the Doppler signal extraction methods including the theory and analysis pertaining to the background of ultrasonic vibration measurement techniques. The phase modulated received signal in the vibration measurement system involves constant phase shift because of ultrasonic path length, phase shift introduced by Doppler effect because of vibrating object and the parametric phase shift caused by interaction of high frequency ultrasonic wave and low pressure developed by vibrating object. Among the three phase shifts, the Doppler phase shift contains the vibrating signal information and the extraction of Doppler signal helps in knowing the velocity of the vibrating object, amplitude and phase of the vibration. Various techniques of Doppler phase shift retrieval are categorised based on the modulation index estimation procedures from the received ultrasonic signal. An analysis is made based on the information retrieval methods for estimation of vibration signal parameters, range of the vibration amplitude, frequency and the preferable carrier frequency for transmission. Further, the analysis also presents various applications in which ultrasonic vibration measurements system are employed successfully.","1751-8822;17518822","","10.1049/iet-smt.2014.0176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7138694","","","Doppler measurement;feature extraction;information retrieval systems;parameter estimation;phase modulation;ultrasonic measurement;vibration measurement","Doppler signal extraction methods;carrier frequency;information retrieval methods;modulation index estimation;phase modulated received signal;ultrasonic vibration measurement systems;vibration amplitude;vibration frequency;vibration parameter estimation methods","","1","","","","","7 2015","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

Cloud Computing enables transmission of data over Internet and resource utilization at data centers. But during data sharing and resource utilization security plays a vital role since the chances of attacks increases. The data to be stored at data centers needs to be retrieved without any data loss and attack. Hence a multi key based data retrieved with encryption is proposed previously but the techniques require more computational time and hence increase the overall cost. Here in this paper a new and efficient is implemented which uses the concept of Cipher text policy attribute based encryption using elliptic curve based key generation. The implementation is based on the concept of generating a new attribute for each and every data to be send and encrypt the data using the generated attribute and forms a tupple and stored at the storage site. The receiver then authenticates himself and enters the attribute and hence decrypts the data. The proposed methodology implemented here provides efficient retrieval of data over cloud as well as reduces computational time and cost.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8432-9; Electronic:978-1-4799-8433-6; POD:978-1-4799-8434-3","10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7154994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7154994","Attribute based encryption;Cloud computing;DOS;Virtualization;multi-keyword retrieval","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Public key;Receivers","cloud computing;computer centres;cryptography;information retrieval","Internet;cipher text policy attribute based encryption;cloud computing;cloud data;data centers;data loss;data retrieval;data sharing;data transmission;elliptic curve based key generation;multikey based data;resource utilization security;storage site","","0","","16","","","25-27 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
