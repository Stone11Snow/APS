Assuming a set of spectrograms given a musical genre, the space spanned by the vectors of the obtained spectral bases is modeled statistically using mixtures of Gaussians, resulting in a description of the spectral base for this musical genre. This description is shown to improve classification results by up to 23.3% compared to MFCC-based models, while the compression performed by the factorization decreases training time significantly. Using a distance-based stability measure this compression is shown to reduce the noise present in the data set resulting in more stable classification models. In addition, we compare the mean squared errors of the approximation to a spectrogram using independent component analysis and nonnegative matrix factorization, showing the superiority of the latter approach.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.909434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432640","Audio classification;audio feature extraction;music information retrieval;nonnegative matrix factorization","Computer science;Digital recording;Gaussian processes;Instruments;Internet;Mood;Music information retrieval;Rhythm;Spectrogram;Timbre","Gaussian processes;audio signal processing;independent component analysis;matrix decomposition;mean square error methods;music;signal classification;spectral analysis","Gaussian mixture;distance-based stability measure;independent component analysis;mean squared error;musical genre classification;musical sound timbre;nonnegative matrix factorization-based feature;spectral basis;spectrogram approximation","","36","","35","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Previously implemented semantic smoothing models such as the translation model have shown good experimental results. However, these models are unable to incorporate contextual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic smoothing method that decomposes a document into a set of weighted context-sensitive topic signatures and then maps those topic signatures into query terms. The language model with such a context- sensitive semantic smoothing is referred to as the topic signature language model. In detail, we implement two types of topic signatures, depending on whether ontology exists in the application domain. One is the ontology-based concept and the other is the multiword phrase. The mapping probabilities from each topic signature to individual terms are estimated through the EM algorithm. Document models based on topic signature mapping are then derived. The new smoothing method is evaluated on the TREC 2004/ 2005 Genomics Track with ontology-based concepts, as well as the TREC Ad Hoc Track (Disks 1, 2, and 3) with multiword phrases. Both experiments show significant improvements over the two-stage language model, as well as the language model with context- insensitive semantic smoothing.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288146","Concept;Information Retrieval;Language Models;Multiword Phrase;Semantic Smoothing;Topic Signature","Background noise;Bioinformatics;Context modeling;Genomics;Helium;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Smoothing methods;Solid modeling;Training data","computational linguistics;document handling;expectation-maximisation algorithm;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","EM algorithm;ad hoc retrieval;context-sensitive semantic smoothing;contextual information;document model;multiword phrase;ontology-based concept;query terms;sense information;synonym information;topic signature language model;topic signature mapping;translation model;weighted context-sensitive topic signatures","","7","","36","","","Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By designing a classifier optimizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve using kernel rank, we provide a generic framework to optimize any differentiable ranking function using effective smoothing functions. kernel rank directly maximizes a 1-D quality measure of ROC, i.e., AUC (area under the ROC). It exploits the kernel density estimation to model the ranking score distributions and approximate the correct ranking count. The ranking metric is then derived and the learnable parameters are naturally embedded. To address the issues of computation and memory in learning, an efficient implementation is developed based on the gradient descent algorithm. We apply kernel rank with two types of kernel density functions to train the linear discriminant function and the Gaussian mixture model classifiers. From our experiments carried out on the development set for TREC Video Retrieval 2005, we conclude that (1) kernel rank is capable of training any differentiable classifier with various kernels; and (2) the learned ranking function performs better than traditional maximization likelihood or classification error minimization based algorithms in terms of AUC and average precision (AP).","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2007.906597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4351904","Area under ROC;ROC curve;information retrieval;multimedia database;semantic concept detection","","Gaussian processes;estimation theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia databases;pattern classification;video retrieval","Gaussian mixture model classifiers;TREC Video Retrieval 2005;differentiable ranking function;gradient descent algorithm;information retrieval;kernel density estimation;kernel rank;kernel-based learning algorithm;linear discriminant function;multimedia database;ranking metric;ranking score distributions;receiver operating characteristic curve;semantic concept detection;smoothing functions","","6","","27","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The first is to develop a knowledge base of industrial safety based on ontologies. The second phase is to index safety-related resources by concepts of the developed ontologies, which led to the realization of an information retrieval system.

The method of grouping visual patterns into image model based on generalized Hough transform is one of the most powerful techniques for image analysis. However, real-time applications of this method have been prohibited due to the computational intensity in similarity searching from a large centralized image collection. A query object is decomposed into non-overlapped blocks, where each of them is represented as a visual pattern obtained by detecting the line edge from the block using the moment-preserving edge detector. A voting scheme based on generalized Hough transform is proposed to provide object search method, which is invariant to the translation, rotation, scaling of image data. In this work, we describe a heterogeneous cluster-oriented CBIR implementation. First, the workload to perform an object search is analyzed, and then, a new load balancing algorithm for the CBIR system is presented.

Our system queries several general-purpose search engines and merges the returned search results into one ranked list. A major issue of developing a meta-search engine is how to integrate search results of different search engines. We propose a merging strategy that uses five features to estimate the merging score of a result entity. All result entities reported by source search engines are merged into one ranked list according to their merging scores. We intend to generate a high precision ranked list by raising the ranks of the documents that are in the medical domain. We conduct a search task to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. Experimental results show that our meta-search engine performs better than Google Web search engine. The proposed merging method can provide better search results for health information seekers.","","POD:1-4244-0942-X","10.1109/HEALTH.2007.381613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4265807","Health information retrieval;Machine learning;Merging strategy;Meta-search engine","Biomedical informatics;Cities and towns;Databases;Displays;Information retrieval;Internet;Merging;Metasearch;Search engines;Tellurium","Internet;medical information systems;merging;query formulation;search engines","Chinese health information;Internet;document ranking;information seeking;medical domain;merging strategy;meta-search engine;query formulation","","1","","8","","","19-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new approach based on stable pitch cues and signal energy. A computationally inexpensive method for feature extraction, which efficiently suppresses vibrato, is combined with information derived from the signal energy in the feature space. Onsets are localized by a median filter based peak picking method.

Our index scheme, as opposed to a traditional IR approach, can achieve quite balanced loads, avoid hop spots and single point of failure, reduce storage and maintenance costs, and offer some ranking mechanisms for matching objects. We use the compact disc (CD) records collected in FreeDB (http://freedb.org) as the experimental data set to evaluate our scheme.

A new set of distance measures are derived from the harmonic distance, the geometric distance, and their generalized variants according to the maximum likelihood theory. These measures can provide a more accurate feature model than the classical euclidean and Manhattan distances. We also find that the feature elements are often from heterogeneous sources that may have different influence on similarity estimation. Therefore, the assumption of single isotropic distribution model is often inappropriate. To alleviate this problem, we use a boosted distance measure framework that finds multiple distance measures, which fit the distribution of selected feature elements best for accurate similarity estimation. The new distance measures for similarity estimation are tested on two applications: stereo matching and motion tracking in video sequences. The performance of boosted distance measure is further evaluated on several benchmark data sets from the UCI repository and two image retrieval applications. In all the experiments, robust results are obtained based on the proposed methods.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.70714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359335","Algorithms;Artificial intelligence;Image classification;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition","","maximum likelihood estimation;statistical analysis;statistical distributions","distance functions;distance learning;distance measures;generalized variants;geometric distance;harmonic distance;maximum likelihood theory;motion tracking;similarity estimation;single isotropic distribution model;statistical analysis;stereo matching;video sequence","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photogrammetry;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","28","2","47","","","March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In the light of existing challenges and open issues concerning the actual cyberspace, this study proposes an approach for binding the ""semantic"" facet with the usual textual one, that together constitutes a typical web page, or specifically, a semantic web document. Through the use of unsupervised learning, we offer a new alternative of organizing web documents which emphasizes a direct separation between the syntactic and semantic facets of the web information. In this study, we discuss a collaborative proximity-based fuzzy clustering and show how this type of clustering is used to discover a structure of web information by a prudent reliance on the structures in the spaces of semantics and data. The method focuses on the reconciliation between the two separated facets of web information and a combination of results leading to a comprehensive data organization. The information arranged in this manner can provide an integral description of web resources, becoming in this manner an essential technique for the next generation of Web search engines.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358788","Information retrieval;Semantic Web;XML-based technologies;metadata;proximity-based collaborative clustering;spaces of semantics and data","","Web sites;content management;fuzzy set theory;groupware;information filtering;open systems;pattern clustering;search engines;semantic Web","Web information;Web page;Web search engines;automated tools;collaborative proximity-based fuzzy clustering;comprehensive data organization;content filtering;content retrieval;interoperability;proximity-based collaborative clustering;semantic Web content analysis;semantic Web document;semantic vision","","32","","38","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In context-aware ubiquitous learning environments, it is desirable that learning content is retrieved according to environmental contexts, such as learners' location. However, traditional information retrieval schemes are not designed for content retrieval in ubiquitous learning environments. Recently, folksonomies have emerged as a successful kind of applications for categorizing web resources in a collaborative manner. This paper focuses on the index creation problem for location-aware learning content retrieval. First, we propose a bottom-up approach to constructing the index according to the similarity between tags, which considers metadata and structural information of the teaching materials annotated by the tags. Then, a maintenance mechanism is designed to efficiently update the index. The index creation method has been implemented, and a synthetic learning object repository has been built to evaluate the proposed approach. Experimental results show that this method can increase precision of retrieval. In addition, impacts of different similarity functions on precision are discussed.","","POD:978-0-7695-3108-3","10.1109/WMUTE.2008.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4489801","Folksonomy;Information retrieval;Location-aware;Ubiquitous learning","Chromium;Collaboration;Communications technology;Content based retrieval;Context;Education;Indexing;Information retrieval;Insects;Wireless communication","computer aided instruction;content-based retrieval;indexing;ubiquitous computing","Web resources;context-aware ubiquitous learning;folksonomy-based indexing;index creation method;location-aware learning content retrieval;synthetic learning object repository","","2","","22","","","23-26 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The query processing algorithm uses an iterative information extraction technique to identify query concepts, and a retrieval function for systematically combining concepts with term statistics at multiple levels of context. We define context by variable length passages of text and different levels of document lexical structure including terms, sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents. Our results demonstrate improved search results in the presence of varying levels of semantic evidence, and higher performance using retrieval functions that combine document as well as sentence and passage level information versus using document, sentence or passage level information alone.

The key problems include solving synonymy and polysemy problem, and smoothing the seen term or not seen term in a document. In this paper, we propose a new method for topic language model. First, concept-based clustering is performed using improved fuzzy c-means. The clustering result is considered as the topics of document collections. The probability of a document generating the topics is estimated by the similarity between the document and each cluster. Then, the probability of the topics generating words is estimated using Expectation Maximization algorithm. At last, we integrate the above algorithms into aspect model to form our topic language model.

The cost of this task can be highly variable and depends on the particular user preferences for words when formulating queries in a given period of time.

While digital media capture and upload has become nearly universal with newer device technology, there is still a need for better tools and technologies to search large collections of multimedia data and to find and deliver the right content to a user according to her current needs and preferences. A renewed focus on the subjective dimension in the multimedia lifecycle, from creation, distribution, to delivery and consumption, is required to address this need beyond what is feasible today. Integration of the subjective aspects of the media itself - its affective, perceptual, and physiological potential (both intended and achieved), together with those of the users themselves will allow for personalizing the content access, beyond today's facility. This integration, transforming the traditional multimedia information retrieval (MIR) indexes to more effectively answer specific user needs, will allow a richer degree of personalization predicated on user intention and mode of interaction, relationship to the producer, content of the media, and their history and lifestyle. In this paper, we identify the challenges in achieving this integration, current approaches to interpreting content creation processes, to user modelling and profiling, and to personalized content selection, and we detail future directions. The structure of the paper is as follows: In Section I, we introduce the problem and present some definitions. In Section II, we present a review of the aspects of personalized content and current approaches for the same. Section III discusses the problem of obtaining metadata that is required for personalized media creation and present eMediate as a case study of an integrated media capture environment. Section IV presents the MAGIC system as a case stud- - y of capturing effective descriptive data and putting users first in distributed learning delivery. The aspects of modelling the user are presented as a case study in using user's personality as a way to personalize summaries in Section V.

The linear nature of speech, coupled with the lack of abstraction that the medium affords, means that listeners have to listen to long segments of a recording to locate points of interest. We explore temporal compression algorithms that attempt to reduce the amount of time users require to listen to speech recordings, while retaining the important content. This paper implements two main approaches to temporal compression: artificial speech rate alteration (speed-up) and unimportant segment removal (excision). We evaluate the effectiveness of these approaches by having listeners rate comprehension and listening effort for different types of temporal compression. For different compression levels, we compare performance of various implementations of speed-up and excision as well as techniques based on semantic features and acoustic features. Our results indicate that listeners prefer low compression levels, excision over speed-up, and algorithms based on semantic rather than acoustic features. Finally, listeners were negative about hybrid algorithms that used speed-up to indicate missing regions in an excised recording.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2008.916527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4443890","Information retrieval;speech processing;text processing;user interfaces","","audio recording;data compression;information retrieval;speech coding","acoustic feature;artificial speech rate alteration;information browsing;semantic feature;speech recordings;temporal speech compression;unimportant segment removal","","1","","30","","","May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In query-by-humming (QBH) systems, uncertainty can arise in query formulation due to user-dependent variability, such as incorrectly hummed notes, and in query transcription due to machine-based errors, such as insertions and deletions. We propose a fingerprinting (FP) algorithm for representing salient melodic information so as to better compare potentially noisy voice queries with target melodies in a database. The FP technique is employed in the QBH system back end; a hidden Markov model (HMM) front end segments and transcribes the hummed audio input into a symbolic representation. The performance of the FP search algorithm is compared to the conventional edit distance (ED) technique. Our retrieval database is built on 1500 MIDI files and evaluated using 400 hummed samples from 80 people with different musical backgrounds. A melody retrieval accuracy of 88% is demonstrated for humming samples from musically trained subjects, and 70% for samples from untrained subjects, for the FP algorithm. In contrast, the widely used ED method achieves 86% and 62% accuracy rates, respectively, for the same samples, thus suggesting that the proposed FP technique is more robust under uncertainty, particularly for queries by musically untrained users.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.912373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432653","Database searching;information retrieval;music;uncertainty","Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Information retrieval;Microelectronics;Multimedia systems;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Uncertainty","fingerprint identification;hidden Markov models;multimedia computing;query formulation","fingerprinting approach;hidden Markov model;machine-based error;multimedia information retrieval;query formulation;query-by-humming system;search algorithm","","20","1","34","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we propose a new generalized multiple instance learning algorithm that can work with any underlying density modeling techniques, and help propagate semantic concepts provided at the coarse granularity of video key-frames to finer grained regions.

Consultation records can also make people aware that they are not alone, because many individuals have suffered from the same or similar problems. Additionally, people can understand how to alleviate their depressive symptoms according to recommendations from health professionals. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes the use of a scenario-based representation, i.e., a symptom-based structural representation, to capture the depressive symptoms and their semantic relations, such as cause-effect and temporal relations, for understanding users' queries clearly. The symptoms and relations are identified from semantic mining and analysis of consultation records. The multilevel mixture model is adopted to estimate the relevance of queries and consultation records based on the structural information. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves higher precision than does a term-based flat representation. An experiment is also conducted to examine the effect of error propagation resulting from incorrect identification of symptoms and relations. Experimental results demonstrate that combining different approaches can improve the retrieval robustness.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2006.888705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4267696","Information retrieval (IR);multilevel mixture model (MMM);natural language processing;scenario-based representation;text mining","Frequency;Helium;Information retrieval;Internet;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Psychology;Robustness;Terminology;Text mining","data mining;data structures;information retrieval systems;medical administrative data processing;medical diagnostic computing;natural language processing;psychology","consultation records;depressive problems;error propagation;multilevel mixture model;natural language processing;psychiatric consultation record retrieval;scenario-based representation;semantic mining;symptom-based structural representation;user queries","Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Decision Support Techniques;Information Storage and Retrieval;Medical History Taking;Medical Records Systems, Computerized;Medical Subject Headings;Natural Language Processing;Psychiatry;Referral and Consultation","5","","31","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose we use a copy of Google 3D Warehouse, a database of user contributed models which is publicly available on the Internet. Given a model to tag, we find geometrically similar models in the corpus, based on distances in a reduced dimensional space derived from Zernike descriptors. The labels of these neighbors are used as tag candidates for the model with probabilities proportional to the degree of geometric similarity. We show experimentally that text based search for 3D models using our computed tags can approach the quality of geometry based search.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2261-6; POD:978-1-4244-2260-9","10.1109/SMI.2008.4548007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4548007","3D model search;H.3.1 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Content Analysis and Indexing—Indexing Methods;autotagging;labeling","Computational geometry;Content based retrieval;Information geometry;Information retrieval;Internet;Labeling;Search engines;Shape;Solid modeling;Spatial databases","Internet;data warehouses;information retrieval;text analysis","Google 3D Warehouse;Internet;geometry based search;text annotations;text autotagging;text search","","2","","8","","","4-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve searches in these conditions, we made two refinements to a well-known query expansion method. One uses transductive learning to obtain pseudorelevant documents, thereby increasing the total number of source documents from which expansion terms can be extracted. The other is a modified parameter estimation method that aggregates the predictions of multiple learning trials to sort candidate terms for expansion by importance.

A way to alleviate those problems is to resort to a wide range of knowledge about the users, their actions and the world that surrounds them. Systems that have done so lack an organizing principle that helps users refer to all the information that might be relevant. We propose a novel user interface paradigm, narrative-based interfaces, that provides such an organizing principle, showing how knowledge plays a central role in understanding the users' stories.

For an automated system without any prior knowledge of a recording, a possible solution is to perform an initial segmentation of the recording into notes or regions with some time-frequency contiguity, and then collect into groups those units that are acoustically similar, and hence have a high likelihood of arising from a common source. This article addresses the second subtask, and provides two main contributions: (1) a derivation of a suboptimal subset out of a wide range of common audio features that maximizes the potential to discriminate between pitched sources in polyphonic music and (2) an estimation of the improvement in accuracy that can be achieved by using features other than pitch in the grouping process. In addition, the hypothesis was tested that more discriminatory features can be obtained through the application of source separation techniques prior to feature computation. Machine learning techniques have been applied to an annotated database of polyphonic recordings (containing 3181 labeled audio segments) spanning a wide range of musical genres. Average source-labeling accuracies of 68% and 76% were obtained with a 10-dimensional feature subset when the number of sources per recording was unknown and known a priori.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2007.908128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4358091","Audio features;instrument classification;music information retrieval;timbre discrimination","","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music","annotated database;automated system;information retrieval;machine learning;music audio;music content description;polyphonic music;polyphonic recordings;time-frequency contiguity","","5","","55","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Face annotation usually requires many training data labeled by hand in order to build effective classifiers. This is particularly challenging when annotating faces on large-scale collections of media data, in which huge labeling efforts would be very expensive. As a result, traditional supervised face annotation methods often suffer from insufficient training data. To attack this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel Transductive Kernel Fisher Discriminant (TKFD) scheme for face annotation, which outperforms traditional supervised annotation methods with few training data. The main idea of our approach is to solve the Fisher's discriminant using deformed kernels incorporating the information of both labeled and unlabeled data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three types of multimedia testbeds: the FRGC benchmark face dataset, the Yahoo! web image collection, and the TRECVID video data collection. The experimental results show that our TKFD algorithm is more effective than traditional supervised approaches, especially when there are very few training data.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2007.911245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4407524","Face annotation;image annotation;kernel Fisher discriminant;multimedia information retrieval;supervised learning;transductive kernel Fisher discriminant;transductive learning","Content based retrieval;Face detection;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kernel;Large-scale systems;Object detection;Supervised learning;Training data;Videos","face recognition;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia systems","Web image collection;face annotation;large-scale collections;multimedia information retrieval;supervised face annotation methods;training data;transductive kernel Fisher discriminant","","18","","48","","","Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hu","Purdue Univ., West Lafayette","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","20070813","2007","18","8","1146","1158","In the past few years, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks have become a promising paradigm for building a wide variety of distributed systems and applications. The most popular P2P application till today is file sharing, e.g., Gnutella, Kazza, etc. These systems are usually referred to as unstructured, and search in unstructured P2P networks usually involves flooding or random walking. On the other hand, in structured P2P networks (DHTs), search is usually performed by looking up a distributed inverted index. The efficiency of the search mechanism is the key to the scalability of a P2P content sharing system. So far, neither unstructured nor structured P2P networks alone can solve the search problem in a satisfactory way. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of both unstructured and structured P2P networks to achieve more efficient search. Specifically, we propose to enhance search in unstructured P2P overlay networks by building a partial index of shared data using a structured P2P network. The index maintains two types of information: the top interests of peers and globally unpopular data, both characterized by data properties. The proposed search protocol, assisted search with partial indexing, makes use of the index to improve search in three ways: first, the index assists peers to find other peers with similar interests and the unstructured search overlay is formed to reflect peer interests. Second, the index also provides search hints for those data difficult to locate by exploring peer interest locality, and these hints can be used for second-chance search. Third, the index helps to locate unpopular data items. Experiments based on a P2P file sharing trace show that the assisted search with a lightweight partial indexing service can significantly improve the success rate in locating data than Gnutella and a hit-rate-based protocol in unstructured P2P systems, while incurring low search latency and overheads.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2007.1035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288111","C.2.4 Distributed Systems;H.3.3 Information Search and Retrieval","Buildings;Delay;Indexing;Legged locomotion;Network servers;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Scalability;Search problems","database indexing;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing;protocols;search problems","Gnutella;P2P content sharing system;distributed inverted index;distributed systems;file sharing;partial indexing;peer-to-peer search problem;search protocol;structured P2P networks;unstructured P2P overlay networks","","37","","45","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Simulation experiments were made using mixtures of musical sounds and mixed speech utterances. The proposed method outperformed two reference methods in the evaluations and showed a high level of robustness in processing signals where important parts of the audible spectrum were deleted to simulate bandlimited interference.

Semantic concepts such as cars, planes, roads, people, animals, and different types of scenes (outdoor, night time, etc.) can be automatically detected in the video with reasonable accuracy. This leads us to ask how can they be used automatically and how does a user (or a retrieval system) translate the user's information need into a selection of related concepts that would help find the relevant video clips, from the large list of available concepts. We illustrate how semantic concept retrieval can be automatically exploited by mapping queries into query classes and through pseudo-relevance feedback. We also provide evidence how a semantic concept can be utilized by users in interactive retrieval, through interfaces that provide affordances of explicit concept selection and search, concept filtering, and relevance feedback. How many concepts we actually need and how accurately they need to be detected and linked through various relationships is specified in the ontology structure.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2008.916355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472084","Concept-based video retrieval;high-level semantic concepts;information retrieval;multimedia computing","Animals;Bridges;Data mining;Feedback;Image color analysis;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Roads;Shape","relevance feedback;video retrieval","interactive retrieval;pseudo-relevance feedback;semantic concept retrieval;video retrieval","","36","","73","","","April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nevertheless, the representative character bitmaps are required for recognizing the captions. This paper has the following novelty: (1) SCB extraction and identification, (2) symbol extraction, and (3) semantic interpretation of the identified captions and symbols.

The decentralized unstructured P2P model with certain overheads, i.e., peer clustering and update procedures, is adopted to compromise with the structured one while still reserving flexible routing control when peers join/leave or network fails. The peer CBIRM engine is designed to utilize multi-instance query with multi-feature types to effectively reduce network traffic while maintaining high retrieval accuracy. It helps to enhance the knowledge discovery and image data mining capability. The proposed P2P-CBIRM system provides the scalable retrieval and mining function that the query scope and retrieval accuracy can be adaptively and progressively controlled. To improve the query efficiency (recall-rate/query-scope), it effectively utilizes both: 1) forwarding query message (forward phase) to reduce the query scope and 2) transmitting retrieval results (backward phase) such that activated peers keep filtering high similarity images on the link-path toward the query peer. Experiments show that the query efficiency of the scalable retrieval approach is better than previous methods, i.e., firework query model and breadth-first search. It provides a scalable knowledge discovery platform for efficient image data mining applications. We also proposed to optimally configure the P2P-CBIRM system such that, under a certain number of online users, it would yield the highest recall rate. Simulations demonstrate that, with the optimal configuration, recall rates can be improved to 2.5 to 3 times larger while the network traffic of each peer is reduced to 30% of the original, under the same number of on-line users.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2007.911821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4432613","Content-based information retrieval and mining;image database;multi-instance query;optimal system configuration;peer-to-peer (P2P) networks;scalable retrieval and mining","Communication system traffic control;Content based retrieval;Control systems;Data mining;Engines;Filtering;Image retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Traffic control","content-based retrieval;data mining;image retrieval;information filtering;pattern clustering;peer-to-peer computing;search engines;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","content-based image retrieval;decentralized unstructured P2P model;flexible routing control;image data mining capability;knowledge discovery;multiinstance query;network traffic;optimal peer-to-peer configuration;peer CBIRM engine;peer clustering;scalable peer-to-peer network;similarity image filtering;update procedures","","8","","23","","","Feb. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
