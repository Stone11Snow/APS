In this paper, a keyphrase extraction approach based on the naive Bayesian classifier is proposed. To determine whether a phrase is a keyphrase, the following features of a phrase in a given document are adopted: its term frequency, whether to appear in the title, abstract and headings (subheadings), and its frequency appearing in the paragraphs of the given document. The approach is evaluated by the standard information retrieval metrics of precision and recall. Experiment results show that this approach is very practical: it can achieve high precision and recall; especially the recall it can achieve is over 80 percent","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0605-6; POD:1-4244-0604-8","10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4072202","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Natural language processing;Text mining","Bayes methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","information retrieval metrics;keyphrases extraction;machine learning;naive Bayesian classifier","","0","","8","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And not only is the volume increasing, but so is the variety, as well as the ways of combining information from different sources to derive insights. Not surprisingly, our most pressing technological and business problem is finding what we need in this sea of information. The dominant paradigm for addressing this problem is information retrieval (Modem Information Retrieval, Ricardo Baeza-Yates and Berthier Ribeiro-Neto, ACM Press, 1999). In this paradigm, the user enters a query (typically a few words typed into a search box), and the system retrieves documents matching the query, ranking the matches based on an estimate of their relevancy to the query. If the system finds many matches, the user sees only the highest-ranked matches. The popularity of Web search systems such as Google shows that the information retrieval paradigm can be effective. An information access framework empowers users by explicitly focusing on the interaction between users and the system. The key problem for information access systems isn't guessing which matching document is most relevant, but establishing a dialogue in which users progressively communicate their information goals while the system provides immediate, incremental feedback that guides users in the pursuit of those goals","1520-9202;15209202","","10.1109/MITP.2007.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4079499","aggregation;dynamic clustering;enterprise information access;faceted search;query refinement;treemap;visualization","Content management;Control systems;Feedback;Information retrieval;Libraries;Lifting equipment;Natural languages;Pressing;Project management;Web search","Internet;Web sites;query processing;search engines","Web search system;digitally stored information;document retrieval;enterprise information access;information retrieval;query processing;user experience","","1","1","","","","Jan.-Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In GroCoca, we define a tightly-coupled group (TCG) as a collection of peers that possess similar mobility pattern and display similar data affinity. A family of algorithms is proposed to discover and maintain all TCGs dynamically. Furthermore, two cooperative cache management protocols, namely, cooperative cache admission control and replacement, are designed to control data replicas and improve data accessibility in TCGs. A cache signature scheme is also adopted in GroCoca in order to provide information for the mobile clients to determine whether their TCG members are likely caching their desired data items and to perform cooperative cache replacement Experimental results show that GroCoca outperforms the conventional caching scheme and standard COoperative CAching scheme (COCA) in terms of access latency and global cache hit ratio.

The cases contain the business proposals and the business operations in which they are measured using similarity function. RCR builds the cluster information of the cases that is able to 1) search replacement for the unavailability of the Web services, 2) find dissimilarities in the repeated requests and 3) determine partiality in matching.

The Web documents are well characterized by the hypertext and the hypertext can be used to determine the relevance of the document to the search domain. The semantics of the link characterizes the semantics of the document referred. In this article, a novel, and distinctive focused crawler named LSCrawler has been proposed. This LSCrawler system retrieves documents by speculating the relevancy of the document based on the keywords in the link and the surrounding text of the link. The relevancy of the documents is reckoned measuring the semantic similarity between the keywords in the link and the taxonomy hierarchy of the specific domain.

In our approach, each image in the database is segmented into regions associated with homogenous color, texture, and shape features. By exploiting regional statistical information in each image and employing a vector quantization method, a uniform and sparse region-based representation is achieved. With this representation, a probabilistic model based on statistical-hidden-class assumptions of the image database is obtained, to which the expectation-maximization technique is applied to analyze semantic concepts hidden in the database. An elaborated retrieval algorithm is designed to support the probabilistic model. The semantic similarity is measured through integrating the posterior probabilities of the transformed query image, as well as a constructed negative example, to the discovered semantic concepts. The proposed approach has a solid statistical foundation; the experimental evaluations on a database of 10 000 general-purposed images demonstrate its promise and effectiveness","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2006.888350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4060959","Content-based image search and retrieval;hidden concept discovery;image databases;image region analysis;probabilistic retrieval model;relevance feedback","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases;Vector quantization","content-based retrieval;expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture;visual databases","content-based image retrieval;expectation-maximization technique;hidden concept discovery;homogenous color;image database;image segmentation;image texture;regional statistical information;semantics-intensive image retrieval;shape features;sparse region-based representation;transformed query image;vector quantization method","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","31","","34","","","Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The statistical analysis of a term (word or phrase) frequency captures the importance of the term within a document. However, to achieve a more accurate analysis, the underlying data representation should indicate terms that capture the semantics of the text from which the importance of a term in a sentence and in the document can be derived. A new concept-based representation that relies on the analysis of the sentence semantics, rather than, the traditional analysis of the document dataset only is introduced. The proposed conceptual ontological graph representation denotes the terms which contribute to the sentence semantics. Then, each term is chosen based on its position in the proposed representation. Lastly, the selected terms are associated to their documents as features for the purpose of indexing in the text retrieval. Experiments using the proposed conceptual ontological graph representation in text retrieval are conducted. The evaluation of results is relied on two quality measures, the precision and the recall. Both of these quality measures improved when the newly developed representation is used to enhance the performance of the text retrieval","2375-9232;23759232","POD:0-7695-2702-7","10.1109/ICDMW.2006.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4063595","","Data analysis;Data mining;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Ontologies;Performance analysis;Statistical analysis;Text analysis","graph theory;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis;text analysis","concept-based representation;conceptual ontological graph representation;data representation;document dataset;phrase analysis;sentence semantics;statistical analysis;text retrieval;word analysis","","4","","11","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A feature database combining color moments, color histograms, Gabor wavelet and shape features is applied in our image retrieval system.

A shape component formed by grouping connected disk centers may use many heavily overlapping disks to represent a simple shape part. Sometimes, these representative disks form complicated structures. A generalized skeleton transform was recently introduced which allows a shape to be represented as a collection of modestly overlapped octagonal shape parts. However, the generalized skeleton transform needs to be applied many times. Furthermore, an octagonal component is not easily matched up with another octagonal component. In this paper, we describe a octagon-fitting algorithm which identifies a special maximal octagon for each image point in a given shape. This transform leads to the development of two new shape decomposition algorithms. These algorithms are more efficient to implement; the octagon-fitting algorithm only needs to be applied once. The components generated are better characterized mathematically. The disk components used in the second decomposition algorithm are more primitive than octagons and easily matched up with other disk components from another shape. The experiments show that the new decomposition algorithms produce as efficient representations as the old algorithm for both exact and approximate cases.

In our paper we provide a methodology to preprocess the TSP.

One approach to this integration is to have a software layer on top of an information retrieval (IR) system and an RDBMS (relational database management system). A core operation in this top layer is to join the intermediate results from the two underlying systems (called the IR results and the DB results correspondingly) in order to produce the final ranked results for each query. Unfortunately, most conventional join algorithms are inefficient for this operation. In this paper, we propose one simple join algorithm called binary search join (BSJ) for the operation of joining the IR results and the DB results. This algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the IR results are already ranked by relevance and that the DB results are already sorted by the join attribute. It scans the IR results and for each IR result tuple performs a binary search over the DB results. We analytically and empirically study the performance of BSJ in comparison with several conventional join algorithms on a repository of Chinese news Web pages.

In the preprocessing stage, a set of reference models are selected from the database using cluster analysis, and distances between database models and reference models are computed and stored. Then in the query stage, for a certain query model, searching is accelerated by reducing the large amount of model comparisons using triangle inequality based on the reference distances computed before.

The Southeast Atlantic Coastal Ocean Observing System (SEA-COOS) has implemented an information management (IM) program to enable the integration and interfacing of the observation, modeling, and user application components of SEACOOS. The primary components of the IM system are the data inputs, the multiple functions and processes applied to the data, the products and tools derived from the data, and documentation describing all of the above. The SEACOOS experience has identified important requirements for a regionally-based IM system. Key to the success of the IM program is the development of standards to ensure consistency and quality of data and information, and development of appropriate interfaces for delivery of a variety of applications to an equally diverse variety of users. Primary areas of development are data transport; data format, naming conventions and quality control; visualization, and metadata. Essential also is a communications structure and networked problem-solving team. Sufficient resources are also critical to insure reliability including redundancy of personnel expertise and equipment.

HICSS 2007. 40th Annual Hawaii International Conference on","20070129","2007","","","71","71","When dealing with genres of Web pages, there are two important aspects to be taken into account. On the one hand, the Web is fluid, unstable and fast-paced. On the other hand, genres on the Web are instantiated in Web pages, which are a complex type of document, more composite and unpredictable than paper documents. These two aspects are interwoven and often result in classification hurdles. In this paper, the author suggests analyzing these classification problems in terms of two broad textual phenomena: genre hybridism and individualization. The identification of these two phenomena helps pinpoint the range of flexibility that an automatic classification system should have. More precisely, genre hybridism accounts for multi-genre variation within the individual Web page, while individualization refers to absence of any recognized genre in a Web page. In a few words, the aim of this paper is to show that Web pages need a zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme, i.e. a scheme that allows zero genre or multi-genre classification, in addition to the traditional single-genre classification","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:0-7695-2755-8","10.1109/HICSS.2007.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4076514","","Data mining;Face detection;Information retrieval;Labeling;Multidimensional systems;Software libraries;Stress;Web pages","Internet;classification","Web page;classification;genre hybridism;genre individualization","","6","","44","","","Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a topology re-formation algorithm for flooding-based P2P networks. In the proposed algorithm, each peer observes responses that passed through itself and re-forms the topology so that peers with a content matching the query can be located near the query issuer.

Due to the mechanical nature, the I/O subsystem is generally the performance bottleneck of a VOD system, and there have been a number of caching algorithms to overcome the disk bandwidth limitation. In this paper, we propose a novel caching strategy, referred to as client-assisted interval caching (CIC) scheme, to balance the requirements of I/O bandwidth and cache capacity, in a cost-effective way. The CIC scheme tends to use the cache memory available in clients so as to dramatically reduce the demand on the I/O bandwidth of the server. Our objective is to maximize the number of requests that can be supported by the system and minimize the overall system cost. Experimental results show the superior of CIC scheme to the traditional Interval Caching (IC) scheme, with respect to request accepted ratio and average servicing cost per stream.","1531-2216;15312216","POD:0-7803-9746-0","10.1109/ICON.2006.302687","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4087758","","Bandwidth;Cache memory;Costs;Data engineering;Geographic Information Systems;Information retrieval;Materials requirements planning;Motion pictures;Network servers;Streaming media","cache storage;client-server systems;video on demand;video servers;video streaming","CIC scheme;VOD;client-assisted interval caching strategy;disk bandwidth limitation;video server;video stream;video-on-demand system","","4","","14","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel evolutionary method called evolutionary group algorithm (EGA) is proposed for complicated time-consuming optimization problems such as finding optimal parameters of content-based image indexing algorithms. In the new evolutionary algorithm, the image database is partitioned into several smaller subsets, and each subset is used by an updating process as training patterns for each chromosome during evolution. This is in contrast to genetic algorithms that use the whole database as training patterns for evolution. Additionally, for each chromosome, a parameter called age is defined that implies the progress of the updating process. Similarly, the genes of the proposed chromosomes are divided into two categories: evolutionary genes that participate to evolution and history genes that save previous states of the updating process. Furthermore, a new fitness function is defined which evaluates the fitness of the chromosomes of the current population with different ages in each generation. We used EGA to optimize the quantization thresholds of the wavelet-correlogram algorithm for CBIR.

The intermittent connectivity, which results from this lack of end-to-end connection, is a dominant problem that leads to user frustration. Existing research to provide the mobile user with a mirage of constant connectivity generally presents mechanisms to handle disconnections when they occur. In contrast, the system we propose in this paper provides ways to handle disconnections before they occur. We present a data bundling system for intermittent connections (DBS-IC) comprised of a stationary agent (SA) and a mobile agent (MA). The SA proactively gathers data the user has previously specified, and opportunistically sends this data to the MA. The SA groups the user-requested data into one or more data bundles, which are then incrementally delivered to the MA during short periods of connectivity. We fully implement DBS-IC and evaluate its performance via live tests under varying network conditions.

Despite the fact that speckle is caused by the scattering process itself, it must be considered as a noise source due to the complexity of the scattering process. The presence of speckle makes data interpretation difficult, but it also affects the quantitative retrieval of physical parameters. In the case of one-dimensional SAR systems, speckle is completely determined by a multiplicative noise component. Nevertheless, for multidimensional SAR systems, speckle results from the combination of multiplicative and additive noise components. This model has been first developed for single-look data. The objective of this paper is to extend the single-look data model to define a multilook multidimensional speckle noise model. The asymptotic analysis of this extension, for a large number of averaged samples, is also considered to assess the model properties.

The quality of the learning objects that they store as well as the mechanisms provided to easily find them for reusing are very important. Learning objects board (LOB), built around the ""stock exchange"" metaphor, brings a new concept of learning objects repositories pushing users motivation to produce good learning objects as well as increasing the cooperation between users either by submitting suggestions, comments or rating existing learning objects. To achieve such high level of motivation and interest some kind of healthy competition is promoted, assigning credits to users and setting a value cost for each learning object.

Annotation and retrieval are posed as classification problems where each class is defined as the group of database images labeled with a common semantic label. It is shown that, by establishing this one-to-one correspondence between semantic labels and semantic classes, a minimum probability of error annotation and retrieval are feasible with algorithms that are 1) conceptually simple, 2) computationally efficient, and 3) do not require prior semantic segmentation of training images. In particular, images are represented as bags of localized feature vectors, a mixture density estimated for each image, and the mixtures associated with all images annotated with a common semantic label pooled into a density estimate for the corresponding semantic class. This pooling is justified by a multiple instance learning argument and performed efficiently with a hierarchical extension of expectation-maximization. The benefits of the supervised formulation over the more complex, and currently popular, joint modeling of semantic label and visual feature distributions are illustrated through theoretical arguments and extensive experiments. The supervised formulation is shown to achieve higher accuracy than various previously published methods at a fraction of their computational cost.

This paper proposes an approach to construct the user's profile based on ontology described in OWL. Ontology provides a formal way to describe the domain semantics by expressing the concepts and relations between them. In our method, the features in the vector space model are defined as the instances in the ontology, and their semantic relations are represented by the means of concept-properties model. We also designed a method to compute the semantic association between the instances according to the length of their paths in the ontology graph.

Regarding the problem that multi-discipline digital libraries are isolated and dispersed without sufficient interconnection, a grid-based system framework and simulation platform are designed for case study","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0326-x; POD:1-4244-0325-1","10.1109/SPCA.2006.297565","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4079136","Cross-media retrieval;Grid;Multimedia content mining;Pervasive computing","Application software;Content based retrieval;Content management;Information retrieval;Multimedia computing;Multimedia systems;Pervasive computing;Resource management;Space technology;Streaming media","content-based retrieval;data mining;digital libraries;grid computing;indexing;multimedia computing;ubiquitous computing","cross-media retrieval;digital libraries;distributed environment;grid technology;multimedia content indexing;multimedia content mining;pervasive computing","","0","","15","","","3-5 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Methods used at AWE to Retrieve Radiographic Dose and Spot Size From LSP Simulations of Radiographic Diodes","P. Martin; D. Short; I. Crotch; J. Threadgold","AWE, Reading, Berkshire, RG7 4PR, United Kingdom","2005 IEEE Pulsed Power Conference","20070205","2005","","","806","809","AWE is developing high performance (1000R at 1 m, <2 mm spot size) flash X-ray sources to radiograph explosively driven heavy metal experiments. Intense electron beam diodes are being developed to deliver this capability from pulsed power drivers in a new hydrodynamics research facility known as the CPF [1]. The Large Scale Plasma (LSP) Particle In Cell (PIC) code [2] is being used extensively at AWE in the program to develop improved intense electron beam diodes. LSP does not currently incorporate direct methods to calculate radiographic parameters relevant to AWE such as the dose or spot size associated with a radiographic diode. There is therefore a need for methods that allow retrieval of experimentally measurable radiographic quantities from LSP simulations of radiographic diodes [3]. Two approaches are currently employed at AWE to retrieve such data. Firstly the primary output from LSP may be ported to a suitable Monte Carlo transport code such as MCNP [4]. MCNP can tally the expected Bremsstrahlung radiation from diodes and transport this radiation through simulations of experimental radiographic experiments to infer the spot size and dose from the diode. Secondly the LSP target methods may be used to gain information on the fluence and angular distributions of the electrons at the high atomic number target which may be further processed into source intensity distribution information. These methods are outlined and examples given, the methods have been found to agree with each other and with experiment to around 10%. The target method has been extended to 3D simulations and initial results from these methods are presented.","2158-4915;21584915","CD-ROM:0-7803-9190-x; POD:0-7803-9189-6","10.1109/PPC.2005.300784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4084340","","Atomic measurements;Diodes;Electron beams;Hydrodynamics;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Monte Carlo methods;Plasma sources;Plasma x-ray sources;Radiography","Monte Carlo methods;bremsstrahlung;plasma diodes;plasma sources;radiography","AWE;Bremsstrahlung radiation;LSP;MCNP;Monte Carlo transport code;electron beam diodes;flash X-ray sources;hydrodynamics research facility;large scale plasma;particle in cell code;pulsed power drivers;radiographic diodes;radiographic dose;source intensity distribution;spot size","","1","","5","","","13-17 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Buoys which drift off-location can pose hazards to mariners, and in coastal waters may cause environmental damage. Moreover, retrieval, repair and replacement of drifting buoys may be delayed when data would be most useful. Such gaps in coastal buoy data can pose a threat to national security by reducing maritime domain awareness. The concept of self-positioning buoys has been advanced to reduce installation cost by eliminating mooring hardware. We here describe technology for operation of reduced cost self-positioning buoys which can be used in coastal or oceanic waters. The ASC SCOUT model is based on a self-propelled, GPS-positioned, autonomous surface craft that can be pre-programmed, autonomous, or directed in real time. Each vessel can communicate wirelessly with deployment vessels and other similar buoys directly or via satellite. Engineering options for short or longer term power requirements are considered, in addition to future options for improved energy delivery systems. Methods of reducing buoy drift and position-maintaining energy requirements for self-locating buoys are also discussed, based on the potential of incorporating traditional maritime solutions to these problems. We here include discussion of the advanced Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) communications draft protocol which offers improved wireless communication capabilities underwater, to adjacent vessels, and to satellites. DTN is particularly adapted for noisy or loss-prone environments, thus it improves reliability. In addition to existing buoy communication via commercial satellites, a growing network of small satellites known as PICOSATs can be readily adapted to provide low-cost communications nodes for buoys. Coordination with planned vessel Automated Identification Systems (AIS) and International Maritime Organization standards for buoy and vessel notificat- - ion systems are reviewed and the legal framework for deployment of autonomous surface vessels is considered","0197-7385;01977385","CD-ROM:1-4244-0115-1; POD:1-4244-0114-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2006.307074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4099173","","Artificial satellites;Communications technology;Costs;Disruption tolerant networking;Hazards;Information retrieval;Logistics;Marine technology;Sea measurements;Sea surface","Global Positioning System;protocols;remotely operated vehicles;underwater acoustic communication;underwater vehicles;wireless sensor networks","AIS;ASC SCOUT model;Automated Identification Systems;DTN communications;GPS-positioned autonomous surface craft;International Maritime Organization standards;PICOSAT;Un-Buoy solution;advanced Delay Tolerant Networking;autonomous surface craft technology;buoy communication;buoy drift;coastal buoy data;coastal waters;commercial satellites;communications infrastructure;draft protocol;drift off-location;drifting buoys;energy delivery systems;environmental damage;loss-prone environments;mariners;moored buoys;mooring hardware;national security;position-maintaining energy requirements;self-locating buoys;self-positioning smart buoys;traditional maritime solutions;underwater vessels;wireless communication capabilities","","5","1","12","","","18-21 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Understanding the statistical characteristics of the data transferred via HTTP helps better model traffic patterns. In this work, we conduct an empirical study by employing an experiment that accesses roughly 34,000 of the most popular Web sites on the Internet today and crawls their Web pages. We collect metadata information on the retrieved roughly two million objects. We determine statistics and distributions based on object sizes, occurrence of specific types, and sizes of specific types. The data of the distributions produced can be used as a template model for Web-traffic modeling in future research. We further note an intriguing result that 5.7% of HTTP traffic from Web servers to clients is due to sending spacer objects (image files representing a 1times1 white-space pixel) or to stale links referencing non-existing files. Such squander in bandwidth is not due to overhead and can be minimized by simple additions to the HTML standard and by automating the process of removing stale links","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0674-9; POD:1-4244-0673-0","10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2006.301928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085443","","Access protocols;Bandwidth;Information retrieval;Internet;Pixel;Statistical distributions;Traffic control;Web pages;Web server;White spaces","Internet;Web sites;hypermedia;meta data;transport protocols","HTTP traffic pattern;Internet traffic;Web page;Web server;Web sites;Web traffic modeling;data distribution;hypertext transfer protocol;metadata information;spacer object;stale link;statistical data transfer characteristics;template model","","4","","11","","","19-21 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In context aware system design, sensors are the primary means for data acquisition. To make such systems effective, sensors need to provide data that is accurate and reflects real time situations and events. Such data is not always readily available and may require a considerable number of in-field experiments with prototypes to gather it. In the absence of good sensor data, the situation aware models and functionality become largely ineffective. This paper proposes the use of qualitative and quantitative information gathered from logs and user research to directly generate artificial sensor data and models or complement existing sensor acquisition techniques. Data obtained via a human perspective based approach is accurate in terms of scenario requirements and user preferences, and complements sensor based data very well. This approach is similar to end-user tailoring, and preference elicitation methodologies. Furthermore, this approach allows designers to generate models that can be evaluated first before narrowing down the selection of sensors, attributes, and implementation infrastructure, thus keeping the design cost low. We present this approach with the help of a case study that involves the design of interruption aware cell phone simulations. We also propose the need for using similar human perspective based approaches in scenarios where sensor data acquisition is not accurate or feasible","2155-7578;21557578","CD-ROM:1-4244-0618-8; POD:1-4244-0617-X","10.1109/MILCOM.2006.302436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4086661","Context Aware Systems;Information and Preference Elicitation;Interruption Handling","Cellular phones;Context awareness;Context modeling;Costs;Data acquisition;Humans;Information retrieval;Robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems","cellular radio;data acquisition;mobile computing;sensor fusion","cell phone simulation;context awareness;data acquisition mechanism;human perspective based approach;information awareness;learning;qualitative information gathering;quantitative information gathering;sensor","","3","","16","","","23-25 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
