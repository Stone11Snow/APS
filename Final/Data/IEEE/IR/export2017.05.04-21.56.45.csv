The proposed system has implemented both Daubechies and Gabor wavelets. The feature vectors extracted from the images are used to organize the images through access methods, which are the basis to perform the query-by-content operations over the images.

Convenient access to a collection requires an index, which is manually created at great labor and expense. Since current handwriting recognizers do not perform well on historical documents, a technique called word spotting has been developed: clusters with occurrences of the same word in a collection are established using image matching. By annotating ""interesting"" clusters, an index can be built automatically. We present an algorithm for matching handwritten words in noisy historical documents. The segmented word images are preprocessed to create sets of 1-dimensional features, which are then compared using dynamic time warping. We present experimental results on two different data sets from the George Washington collection.

To identify the target images of interest in the database in the conceptual level, the presented system makes use of keywords as the input of searching vehicle. The system consists of two subsystems, i.e., semantic indexing and query expansion. In the semantic indexing, the subsystem includes three main building blocks, namely, keyword extraction, keyword expansion, and keyword weighting. The information of WordNet is used to extend existing keywords associated with images. This design intends to overcome the drawbacks in conventional keyword-based image retrieval system. Next, the resulting word set is filtered by a filter to extract common words from the word set and set up the image indexing for the corresponding image. In the query expansion, corpus is used to help users find relative or precise results in the facing dilemma of too few or too many query results for a given query. The designed semantic image indexing and retrieval system is integrated with IWiLL, a web-based language learning platform to further illustrate the value of the designed system.","","POD:0-7803-7761-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2003.1206056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206056","","Computer networks;Computer science;Data mining;Filters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Multimedia databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;indexing","CanFind;IWiLL;keyword expansion;keyword extraction;keyword weighting;query expansion;searching vehicle;semantic image indexing;semantic image retrieval;web-based language learning platform","","0","2","11","","","25-28 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assessment is conducted at three levels: radiometric level of accuracy, improvement in interclass separability, and classification accuracy. Results obtained from hazy scenes and their dehazed counterparts are compared with those from reference or ""benchmark"" clear scenes. Radiometric analyses of pseudoinvariant features (dense forest stands) indicate that effective haze reduction can be realized for differential HOT response levels of up to 20 for Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes. This level of atmospheric contamination is severe enough to result in significant thematic class confusion, wherein visible-band radiances of vegetated areas are at levels normally associated with urban features under clear sky conditions.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.811817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206732","","Contamination;Information retrieval;Layout;Optical sensors;Optical surface waves;Radiometry;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Satellite broadcasting;Terrain mapping","atmospheric optics;atmospheric techniques;image classification;radiometry;terrain mapping","Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes;atmospheric contamination;classification accuracy;dehazed counterparts;dense forest stands;haze optimized transform;haze removal methods;haze suppression methodology;hazy scenes;image processing;information retrieval;interclass separability;land cover classification performance;postprocessing applications;radiometric analyses;satellite imagery;terrain mapping;thematic class confusion;urban features;vegetated areas;visible-band correction","","18","1","17","","","May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, a computationally efficient approximation of the image-to-model chamfer distance is obtained by embedding binary edge images into a high-dimensional Euclidean space. Second, a general-purpose, probabilistic line matching method identifies those line segment correspondences between model and input images that are the least likely to have occurred by chance.

Equivalence constraints provide relational information about the labels of data points, rather than the labels themselves. Our work is motivated by the observation that in many real life applications partial information about the data can be obtained with very little cost. For example, in video indexing we may want to use the fact that a sequence of faces obtained from successive frames in roughly the same location is likely to contain the same unknown individual. Learning using equivalence constraints is different from learning using labels and poses new technical challenges. In this paper we present three novel methods for clustering and classification, which use equivalence constraints. We provide results of our methods on a distributed image querying system that works on a large facial image database, and on the clustering and retrieval of surveillance data. Our results show that we can significantly improve the performance of image retrieval by taking advantage of such assumptions as temporal continuity in the data. Significant improvement is also obtained by making the users of the system take the role of distributed teachers, which reduces the need for expensive labeling by paid human labor.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPR.2003.1211531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1211531","","Computer science;Costs;Data mining;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Surveillance;Training data","equivalence classes;face recognition;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);visual databases","classification;data clustering;data point label;distributed image querying system;equivalence constraint;face sequence;facial image database;image retrieval;learning from partial knowledge;partial information;relational information;semisupervised learning;surveillance data;temporal continuity;video indexing;video retrieval","","60","","13","","","18-20 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this algorithm poses certain problems when the number of documents or the number of words is very large.

The forthcoming SCORM 1.3 standard will resolve some of these limitations, but we have identified six additional functional requirements. The learning management system should enable adaptivity, the retrieval of history and state, comparison of results, tracking for pedagogical research, shared reference databases, and problem scenario databases. Each requirement is illustrated with examples from learning material developed in one of the research projects.

This paper describes the implementation of a specific GSD service which is realized as an extended part of the OGSI technology preview. OGSI (open grid services infrastructure) has implemented the fundamental interfaces of OGSA. It provides a container registry service for the query in grid services. However, this service does not provide full flexibility for GSD, since it only supports querying among services registered to the local service container. The implemented GSD service is a decentralized one and is based on WS-inspection. It is designed as a high-level service, which is based upon the container registry service, provided in OGSI, so that direct access towards low-level data structure is avoided. The implementation details will be discussed in this paper, including the whole GSD mechanism and some more specific discovery methods used. Some furthering issues on the GSD implementation will also be discussed in this paper. Analysis on parallel and sequential searching algorithms will be given in a separate section, based on an ideal k-way tree model of the grid topology.

A prototype system has been developed, which automatically splits a video into shorter unit called shots, extract representative frames from each shot and estimates motion information in the neighborhood of the r-frame with the phase correlation method.

However, for each routing procedure, system returns location information of the requested file only and the characteristics of system workload are seldom considered. We propose the UCP2P routing algorithm which introduce ""superobject"" to take advantage of spatial locality among file accesses. When a client retrieves a file, UCP2P routing algorithm may send location information of several other correlated files in addition within one routing procedure. No further routing procedure is needed if the client requests any of these files later. By this mechanism, we can greatly reduce the routing overhead. Our preliminary simulation results show UCP2P achieves a great routing performance improvement over the previous algorithms.","","POD:0-7695-1972-5","10.1109/WIAPP.2003.1210296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210296","","Computer architecture;Computer science;High performance computing;Information retrieval;Internet;Music information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Scalability;System performance","client-server systems;performance evaluation;spatial data structures;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","UCP2P routing algorithm;correlated file;file access;location information;network architecture;peer-to-peer system performance;routing performance;spatial locality","","1","","10","","","23-24 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose distortion discriminant analysis (DDA), which fulfills all four of these requirements. DDA constructs a linear, convolutional neural network out of layers, each of which performs an oriented PCA dimensional reduction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DDA on two audio fingerprinting tasks: searching for 500 audio clips in 36 h of audio test data; and playing over 10 days of audio against a database with approximately 240 000 fingerprints. We show that the system is robust to kinds of noise that are not present in the training procedure.

This repetitive nearest neighbor computation in high dimensional feature spaces is expensive, particularly when the number of items in the data set is large. In this context, we suggest a search algorithm that supports relevance feedback for the general quadratic distance metric.

Proceedings","20030811","2003","","","49","54","The rapidly expanding technology of cellular communications, wireless LAN (local area network), wireless data networks and satellite will give mobile users capability of accessing information anywhere and anytime. One of the important components of this environment is the server with broadcasting capabilities. Data are fetched from the server and being broadcast to the air. Mobile users keep listening within the air and catch those data that interest him. In one of the work known as the Acharya algorithm (Acharya et al., 1995) has focused on developing algorithm for arranging the sequence order of data to be broadcasted. The work has generated the sequence of data to be broadcast with the policy of broadcasting more popular data compare to the less popular one. However, the work does not covers the overhead issue incurred by the disk during actual data retrieval task in order to satisfy the broadcasting order. In this paper, we present a data organization called sequence to be used as a data storing method in the server to support broadcasting environments. Our scheme, the sequence order of data to be stored on physical disk, is basically similar in pattern to the sequence order of data to be broadcasted. Having this approach the server's disk incurs less overhead (seek and latency). We show by simulation result that our scheme has reduced the overhead of Acharya scheme by average 60%. We also work on multiple disks with the same speed and configuration as opposed by the Acharya scheme, which used different disk speed and configuration.","","POD:0-7695-1985-7","10.1109/GMAG.2003.1219665","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1219665","","Artificial satellites;Cellular networks;Communications technology;Information retrieval;Local area networks;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Network servers;Satellite broadcasting;Wireless LAN","broadcasting;client-server systems;data communication;file organisation;information retrieval;information storage;mobile computing","Acharya algorithm;broadcasting;cellular communication;data order sequencing;data organization;data retrieval;data storing;information access;local area network;mobile computing;satellite;sequence;server;wireless LAN;wireless data network","","3","","20","","","16-18 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach is based on a Bayesian classifier and treats positive and negative feedback examples with different strategies. Positive examples are used to estimate a Gaussian distribution that represents the desired images for a given query; while the negative examples are used to modify the ranking of the retrieved candidates. In addition, feature subspace is extracted and updated during the feedback process using a principal component analysis (PCA) technique and based on user's feedback. That is, in addition to reducing the dimensionality of feature spaces, a proper subspace for each type of features is obtained in the feedback process to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method increases the retrieval speed, reduces the required memory and improves the retrieval accuracy significantly.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2003.815254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1217269","","Asia;Bayesian methods;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Negative feedback;Principal component analysis","Bayes methods;Gaussian distribution;belief networks;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation;principal component analysis;relevance feedback","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian estimation;Bayesian framework;CBIR;Gaussian distribution;PCA;content-based image retrieval;feature subspace extraction;feedback approach;negative feedback;positive feedback;principal component analysis;progressive learning;relevance feedback;retrieval accuracy;retrieval speed","","98","1","27","","","Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

TTL-based consistency, as exemplified by DNS and Web caches, is a policy in which a data item, once retrieved, remains valid for a period known as the ""time-to-live"". Cache systems using large TTL periods are known to have high hit rates and scale well, but the effects of using shorter TTL periods are not well understood. We model hit rate as a function of request arrival times and the choice of TTL, enabling us to better understand cache behavior for shorter TTL periods. Our formula for the hit rate is closed form and relies upon a simplifying assumption about the interarrival times of requests for the data item in question: that these requests can be modeled as a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. Analyzing extensive DNS traces, we find that the results of the formula match observed statistics surprisingly well; in particular, the analysis is able to adequately explain the somewhat counterintuitive empirical finding of Jung et al. that the cache hit rate for DNS accesses rapidly increases as a function of TTL, exceeding 80% for a TTL of 15 minutes.","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:0-7803-7752-4","10.1109/INFCOM.2003.1208693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208693","","Bandwidth;Computer science;Delay;Domain Name System;Information retrieval;Internet;Laboratories;Random variables;Statistical analysis;Statistical distributions","Internet;cache storage","DNS;Internet caches;Web caches;cache hit rates modeling;identically distributed random variables;request arrival times;shorter time-to-live periods;time-to-live based consistency policy","","31","6","18","","","30 March-3 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data must also be topologically accurate and up-to-date as it often represents real-world changing phenomena. Current multiresolution schemes use complex opaque data types, which limit the capacity for in-database object manipulation. By using z-values and B<sup>+</sup>trees to support multiresolution retrieval, objects are fragmented in such a way that updates to objects or object parts are executed using standard SQL (Structured Query Language) statements as opposed to procedural functions. Our approach is compared to a current model, using complex data types indexed under a 3D (three-dimensional) R-tree, and shows better performance for retrieval over realistic window sizes and data loads. Updates with the R-tree are slower and preclude the feasibility of its use in time-critical applications whereas, predictably, projecting the issue to a one-dimensional index allows constant updates using z-values to be implemented more efficiently.","1099-3371;10993371","POD:0-7695-1964-4","10.1109/SSDM.2003.1214980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214980","","Data mining;Displays;Geographic Information Systems;Information retrieval;Information technology;Multimedia databases;Relational databases;Spatial databases;Spatial resolution;Warehousing","data models;geographic information systems;information retrieval;tree data structures;visual databases","3D R-tree;B+tree;SQL;Structured Query Language;multiresolution geospatial database;multiresolution retrieval;object fragmentation;object manipulation;object retrieval;object updating;one-dimensional index;three-dimensional;z-value","","0","2","15","","","9-11 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Technol., Uppsala Univ., Sweden","Proceedings International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium","20030728","2003","","","9 pp.","","While prefetch has proven itself useful for reducing cache misses in multiprocessors, traffic is often increased due to extra unused prefetch data. Prefetching in multiprocessors can also increase the cache miss rate due to the false sharing caused by the larger pieces of data retrieved. The capacity prefetching strategy proposed in this paper is built on the assumption that prefetching is most beneficial for reducing capacity and cold misses, but not communication misses. We propose a simple scheme for detecting the most frequent communication misses and suggest that prefetching should be avoided for those. We also suggest a simple and effective strategy for reducing the address traffic while retrieving many sequential cache lines called bundling. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches, we have evaluated both strategies for one of the simplest forms of prefetching, sequential prefetching. The two new strategies applied to this bandwidth-hungry prefetch technique result in a lower miss rate for all studied applications, while the average amount of address traffic is reduced compared with the same application run with no prefetching. The proposed strategies could also be applied to more sophisticated prefetching techniques for better overall performance.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:0-7695-1926-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213088","","Application software;Bandwidth;Buildings;Communication system traffic control;Design optimization;Information retrieval;Information technology;Prefetching;Proposals;Protocols","cache storage;memory protocols;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation","address traffic;bundled capacity prefetching;bundling;cache misses;communication misses;miss penalty reduction;multiprocessors;performance;sequential cache lines;sequential prefetching","","3","","27","","","22-26 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A computationally efficient approach to indoor/outdoor scene classification","N. Serrano; A. Savakis; A. Luo","","Object recognition supported by user interaction for service robots","20030709","2002","4","","146","149 vol.4","Prior research in scene classification has shown that high-level information can be inferred from low-level image features. Classification rates of roughly 90% have been reported using low-level features to predict indoor scenes vs. outdoor scenes. However, the high classification rates are often achieved by using computationally expensive, high-dimensional feature sets, thus limiting the practical implementation of such systems. We show that a more computationally efficient approach to indoor/outdoor classification can yield classification rates comparable to the best methods reported in the literature. A low complexity, low-dimensional feature set is used in conjunction with a two-stage support vector machine classification scheme to achieve a classification rate of 90.2% on a large database of consumer photographs.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-1695-X","10.1109/ICPR.2002.1047420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047420","","Computational efficiency;Content based retrieval;Error analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Spatial databases;Support vector machine classification;Testing","feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;learning automata;radial basis function networks;visual databases","Support Vector Machine;consumer photograph database;image classification;image database;image retrieval;indoor scenes;low-dimensional feature set;outdoor scenes;radial basis function representation","","23","24","8","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1208999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1208999","","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;High performance computing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Large-scale systems;Vectors;Web pages;Web search","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;search engines","Web link structure;Web pages;Web search;context-sensitive ranking algorithm;context-specific importance scores;keyword search queries;large-scale search system;query context;query keywords;search-query result ranking;topic-sensitive PageRank","","268","70","30","","","July-Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Motivated by the maximal and optimal matching theories in graph analysis, a new similarity measure of video clips is defined based on the representation and modeling of bipartite graph. Four different factors: visual similarity, granularity, interference and temporal order of shots are taken into consideration for similarity ranking. These factors are progressively analyzed in the proposed approach. Maximal matching utilizes the granularity factor to efficiently filter false matches, while optimal matching takes into account the visual, granularity and interference factors for similarity measure. Dynamic programming is also formulated to quantitatively evaluate the temporal order of shots. The final similarity measure is based on the results of optimal matching and dynamic programming. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is effective and efficient in retrieving and ranking similar video clips.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1220918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220918","","Bipartite graph;Cameras;Computer science;Dynamic programming;Graph theory;Information retrieval;Interference;Internet;Matched filters;Optimal matching","dynamic programming;graph theory;image matching;image retrieval;video signal processing","bipartite graph;dynamic programming;granularity;graph theory;interference;maximal matching;optimal matching;temporal order of shots;video clip retrieval;visual similarity","","3","","11","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20030728","2003","","","22","31","We propose a new storage model called MBSM (multiresolution block storage model) for laying out tables on disks. MBSM is intended to speed up operations such as scans that are typical of data warehouse workloads. Disk blocks are grouped into ""super-blocks,"" with a single record stored in a partitioned fashion among the blocks in a superblock. The intention is that a scan operation that needs to consult only a small number of attributes can access just those blocks of each super-block that contain the desired attributes. To achieve good performance given the physical characteristics of modern disks, we organize super-blocks on the disk into fixed-size ""mega-blocks."" Within a megablock, blocks of the same type (from various super-blocks) are stored contiguously. We describe the changes needed in a conventional database system to manage tables using such a disk organization. We demonstrate experimentally that MBSM outperforms competing approaches such as NSM (N-ary storage model), DSM (decomposition storage model) and PAX (partition attributes across), for I/O bound decision-support workloads consisting of scans in which not all attributes are required. This improved performance comes at the expense of single-record insert and delete performance; we quantify the trade-offs involved. Unlike DSM, the cost of reconstructing a record from its partitions is small. MBSM stores attributes in a vertically partitioned manner similar to PAX, and thus shares PAX's good CPU cache behavior. We describe methods for mapping attributes to blocks within super-blocks in order to optimize overall performance, and show how to tune the super-block and mega-block sizes.","1098-8068;10988068","POD:0-7695-1981-4","10.1109/IDEAS.2003.1214908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214908","","Costs;Data engineering;Data warehouses;Database systems;Delay;Information retrieval;Magnetic heads;Multiresolution analysis;Optimization methods;Volume measurement","attribute grammars;data handling;data models;data warehouses;database management systems;disc storage;information storage;optimisation;storage allocation","DSM;I/O bound decision-support workload;MBSM model;N-ary storage model;NSM;PAX CPU cache behavior;attribute mapping;attribute storage;conventional database system;data warehouse workload;database design;decomposition storage model;delete performance;disk block;disk organization;disk physical characteristic;fixed-size megablocks;multiresolution block storage model;partition attributes across;partitioned fashion;performance optimization;scan operation;single-record insert;super-block organization;table lay out;table management;vertical partition","","5","13","16","","","16-18 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While many of these efforts evolved in the context of specific applications, their ultimate motivation was the enhancement of basic understanding-particularly in the area of the relations between various approximate-reasoning methodologies. In this presentation we review applied methods stemming from these foundations-relating fuzzy-logic concepts to notions of utility, cost, and similarity-emphasizing the need for the understanding of basic conceptual structures in the development of effective approaches to treat a wide variety of problems. We will review recent applications of approaches based on this view of fuzzy logic to three major Intelligent-system development problems: distributed robotics, qualitative description of complex objects, and knowledge discovery and retrieval in very large databases. We will present major technical issues arising in the consideration of these problems while addressing also fundamental questions of essential importance to the development and understanding of applicable approaches. In particular, we will consider matters related to the notions of team and individual goals, negotiation, and agent-based preferences in the context of distributed robotics; the concepts of cluster and clustering in the context of data analysis and understanding; and the relations between knowledge-based structures, such as ontologies and know ledge-bases, and similarity measures in the context of information-retrieval problems.","","POD:0-7803-7810-5","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1209316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209316","","Costs;Data analysis;Deductive databases;Distributed databases;Fuzzy logic;Information retrieval;Intelligent robots;Intelligent structures;Ontologies;Solids","data mining;deductive databases;fuzzy logic;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;intelligent robots;software agents;very large databases","agent-based preferences;approximate-reasoning;clustering;complex objects;conceptual semantics;cost;distributed robotics;fuzzy-logic approaches;individual goals;information-retrieval problems;intelligent-systems applications;knowledge discovery;knowledge retrieval;knowledge-bases;negotiation;ontologies;qualitative description;similarity;team goals;utility;very large databases","","0","","","","","25-28 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, existing studies are usually focused on architectural issues. The problem of designing an efficient server to implement these new multicast VoD architectures has received little attention. While existing server designs using round-based schedulers can still be used, results show that such designs are suboptimal as they do not exploit the characteristics of fixed-schedule periodic broadcasting channels. We address this challenge by presenting an efficient server design for a recent multicast VoD architecture called Super-Scalar Video-on-Demand (SS-VoD).

Such teaching goals can be greatly supported by computer-based applications, which can offer access to vast amounts of historical texts and data to be used next to the main scholar textbook and be analyzed by pupils. Still, existing applications seem to be quite inadequate for this purpose, as they require that the pupil be already informed on a matter, before the initiation of a quest for data.

Unfortunately, annotating complete courses thoroughly with LOM metadata can be a tedious task. We show how additional inference rules can make this task easier, and allow us to derive additional metadata from existing ones. Additionally, using these rules as integrity constraints helps us to define the constraints on LOM fields, thus taking an important step towards a complete axiomatization of LOM metadata (with the goal of transforming the LOM definitions from a simple syntactical description into a complete ontology). We used RDF metadata descriptions and an inference language explicitly developed for RDF (TRIPLE) to represent metadata and axioms. We show how these rules can be applied for the extensions of course metadata, the creation of views onto the metadata or metadata consistency checking.","","POD:0-7695-1967-9","10.1109/ICALT.2003.1215216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215216","","Communications technology;Content based retrieval;Data models;Information retrieval;Information systems;Ontologies;Resource description framework","educational computing;educational courses;information retrieval;meta data","RDF metadata description;educational course;educational resources;inference rules;information retrieval;integrity constraint rules;learning object metadata;metadata axiomatization;metadata consistency checking;metadata course extension;syntactical description","","10","","","","","9-11 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our experimental results show that by combining our algorithm for choosing the number of virtual servers with a greedy algorithm for mapping virtual servers to disks, users can expect range query retrieval performance within 4% of the optimum achievable in practice on average, in all configurations studied.

In this paper, this difficult problem is converted into a constrained optimization problem, and the iteration-free clustering (IFC) algorithm based on the Lagrangian function, is presented for adapting the existing indexing structure for a nonstationary database. Experimental results concerning recall and precision indicate that the proposed method provides a binary tree that is almost optimal. Simulation results further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can maintain 94% precision in seven-dimensional feature space, even when the number of new-coming images is one-half the number of images in the original database.

In this paper we present the architecture of a modular object retrieval system. It is based on a dataflow concept which allows flexible adaptations to different tasks. This concept facilitates parallel processing as well as distributed computing. We also present a dynamic load balancing service for heterogeneous environments that has been integrated to improve system performance. First experiments show that the developed balancer performs better than standard balancing techniques in this environment.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:0-7695-1926-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2003.1213423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1213423","","Application software;Computer vision;Concurrent computing;Distributed computing;Distributed processing;Image processing;Information retrieval;Load management;Middleware;Operating systems","computer vision;data flow computing;distributed object management;image retrieval;middleware;parallel programming;performance evaluation;resource allocation","CORBA;adaptive visual object retrieval;computer vision;dataflow;distributed computing;dynamic load balancing service;flexible adaptations;heterogeneous environments;image processing;middleware;modular object retrieval system;parallel computing;parallel processing;system performance","","2","","22","","","22-26 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WIAPP 2003","20030709","2003","","","79","89","In the presence of multiple mirror servers that can serve the same information, clients can improve their performance when downloading large files by concurrently retrieving different parts of the file from different servers. In previous work, experiments with a single client have shown the potential for parallel downloading schemes to improve the performance perceived by this single client. We consider the question of what happens when parallel downloading is widely adopted within the Internet. To that end we start with an experimental evaluation of various parallel downloading schemes and their performance from the perspective of a single client. We use these results as a benchmark for a set of simulations in which we investigate the performance of parallel downloading when performed by multiple clients. We find that, because parallel downloading incurs additional overhead as a result of its use of more network connections, large-scale use of this technique can actually lead to overall degradation of the performance experienced by clients. Further, we uncover a ""fairness"" tradeoff in that any performance improvement experienced by clients performing parallel downloading comes at the expense of clients who simply go to a single server to retrieve files.","","POD:0-7695-1972-5","10.1109/WIAPP.2003.1210291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1210291","","Conferences;Degradation;Educational institutions;File servers;Information retrieval;Internet;Large-scale systems;Mirrors;Network servers;Web server","Internet;client-server systems;file servers","Internet;file downloading;multiple client;multiple mirror servers;network performance degradation;parallel downloading;simulations","","20","","19","","","23-24 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They do not provide sufficient information for an effective selection of relevant documents. Previous research has proposed the utilization of query expansion to deal with this problem. However, expansion terms are usually determined on term co-occurrences within documents. In this study, we propose a new method for query expansion based on user interactions recorded in user logs. The central idea is to extract correlations between query terms and document terms by analyzing user logs. These correlations are then used to select high-quality expansion terms for new queries. Compared to previous query expansion methods, ours takes advantage of the user judgments implied in user logs. The experimental results show that the log-based query expansion method can produce much better results than both the classical search method and the other query expansion methods.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1209002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209002","","Indexing;Information retrieval;Search engines;Search methods;Statistical analysis;Thesauri;Vocabulary;Web sites","Internet;Web sites;data mining;query formulation;relevance feedback;search engines","Web queries;World Wide Web;document selection;experimental results;high-quality expansion terms;information retrieval;probabilistic model;query expansion;query expansion methods;query terms;search engines;term co-occurrences;user interactions;user judgments;user log mining","","114","7","38","","","July-Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many video coding standards such as H.263+ and MPEG-2 make the compressed video signals more vulnerable to channel errors because of error propagation due to using variables length coding (VLC). Channel errors cannot only result in false decoding of current bits but also make the decoder lose synchronization. The data between the errors and next resynchronization marker (RM) will be discarded even if they are not corrupted by channel errors. Early resynchronization can retrieve unaffected data between the errors and next RM, which can greatly reduce error propagation due to using VLC. We combined early resynchronization with deliberately designed ED and EC technologies and tested three early resynchronization schemes in our simulation. It has been found that the third scheme can give the best tradeoff between the final reconstructed image quality and searching times.","","POD:7-5635-0686-1","10.1109/ICCT.2003.1209730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1209730","","Decoding;Error correction codes;Image coding;Image quality;Information retrieval;Information science;Robustness;Transform coding;Video coding;Video compression","decoding;error correction;error detection;synchronisation;telecommunication channels;variable length codes;video coding;visual communication","H.263+;MPEG-2;VLC;channel errors;early resynchronization;error concealment;error detection;error propagation;reliable video decoding;resynchronization marker;unaffected data retrieval;variable length coding;video signal compression","","2","1","10","","","9-11 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 2000, NASA launched the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Advanced Land Imager (ALI) to test new technology that could improve the TM/ETM+ sensor series, yet ensure Landsat data continuity. The study reported here quantified the continuity of satellite-retrieved surface reflectance (ρ) for the three most recent Landsat sensors (Landsat-4 TM, Landsat-5 TM, and Landsat-7 ETM+) and the EO-1 ALI sensor. The study was based on ground-data verification and, in the case of the ETM+ to ALI comparison, coincident image analysis. Reflectance retrieved from all four sensors showed good correlation with ground-measured reflectance, and the sensor-to-sensor data continuity was excellent for all sensors and all bands. A qualitative analysis of the new ALI spectral bands (4p: 0.845-0.890 μm and 5p: 1.20-1.30 μm) showed that ALI band 5p provided information that was different from that provided by the ETM+/ALI shortwave infrared bands 5 and 7 for agricultural targets and that ALI band 4p has the advantage over the existing ETM+ near-infrared (NIR) band 4 and ALI NIR band 4 of being relatively insensitive to water vapor absorption. The basic conclusion of this study is that the four sensors can provide excellent data continuity for temporal studies of natural resources. Furthermore, the new technologies put forward by the EO-1 ALI sensor have had no apparent effect on data continuity and should be considered for the upcoming Landsat-8 sensor payload.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.813213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1220228","","Earth;Image analysis;Image sensors;Information retrieval;NASA;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Satellites;Space technology;Testing","geophysical equipment;geophysical techniques;terrain mapping","400 to 2500 nm;ALI;Advanced Land Imager;EO-1;ETM+;Earth Observing One;IR;Landsat TM;data continuity;equipment;geophysical measurement technique;hyperspectral remote sensing;infrared;instrument;land surface;multispectral remote sensing;satellite remote sensing;terrain mapping;visible","","13","","11","","","June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Five popular TV broadcast genre are studied including sports, cartoon, news, commercial and music. A novel statistically based approach is proposed comprising two important ingredients designed for implicit semantic content characterisation and class identities modelling. First, a spatial-temporal audio-visual ""concatenated"" feature vector is composed, aiming to capture crucial clip-level video structure information inherent in a video genre. Second, the feature vector is further processed using principal component analysis to reduce the spatial-temporal redundancy while exploiting the correlations between feature elements. This gives rise to a compact representation fro effective probabilistic modelling of each video genre.

By introducing the functional scheme into the model, only a few numbers of parameters, which are called 2-D functional AR parameters, can describe the image features simply and accurately. These characteristics make the model suitable for image identification applications. Some experiments of image identification are performed, and the results verify that the proposed model accurately represents the image feature, and the image can be correctly identified.
