This makes it difficult to look for comparable results in the literature since search options are limited to textual descriptions and/or similar-appearing results depicted in the paper figures. We demonstrate a method for quantitative comparison of source-resolved results (e.g., ERPs, ERSPs) across different EEG studies. Our proposed source-resolved EEG measure search engine receives search queries composed of event-related EEG measures, each associated with an estimated brain source location to be compared using Measure Projection Analysis (MPA) to all records in the search engine database accumulated by automated data analysis workflows applied to data of multiple studies. A similarity-ranked list of events from other studies that have elicited similar EEG dynamics in nearby source-locations is then returned to the user along with their experiment and event metadata. We performed a search query using this method through 52 event-related ERSP measures from four studies for Left Precentral Gyrus source measures similar to an input ERSP pattern associated with RSVP target detection, obtaining results consistent with the EEG literature and giving information about the interpretation of the phenomenon of interest not possible to infer from the single input study.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0248-4; POD:978-1-4799-0246-0","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2013.6736802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6736802","","Brain modeling;Electronic publishing;Information services;Internet;Neuroscience;Search engines;Time-frequency analysis","electroencephalography;information retrieval;medical information systems;search engines","EEG analysis-publication workflow;EEG search engine;RSVP target detection;automated data analysis workflow;brain source location;event-related EEG dynamics;event-related ERSP measure;left precentral gyrus source;measure projection analysis;textual description","","2","","12","","","3-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Being as part of the field of new representational forms investigation, this work aims at designing, analyzing and communicating architecture. Thanks to its wide professional relapses, its prefiguration of architectural projects and its diffusion through different media, this is a highly developed research area (also at an international level). This is due to continuous development and usage of informatics technologies also in the architectural representation field. New forms of multimedia communication allow using image in all of its forms, from movement to ""real-time"" visualization, to the so-called ""augmented reality""; so we overcome the text and image dichotomy using the iconic processing as a critical-interpretative instrument. Computer modeling techniques, used for the project communication at different scales, are particularly suited for the analysis of architecture - especially the not-built-ones. They allow the reconstruction of the design process which lead to the spatial, morphological, functional configuration. Italian architects of the second half of last century, represented the national vanguard of contemporary architectural culture through their works. Going over the evolution of their design experimentations we need to involve both the institutional structures delegated to project materials storage, and those responsible for the valorization and dissemination of the architectural culture in Italy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3170-5; POD:978-1-4799-3171-2; USB:978-1-4799-3169-9","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6743822","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743822","analysis of the architecture;archival documents;interpretation;video-communication","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computers;Media;Multimedia communication;Solid modeling;Visualization","augmented reality;data visualisation;history;information retrieval systems","Italian master work;Italy;architectural culture dissemination;architectural culture valorization;architectural project;augmented reality;computer modeling techniques;contemporary architectural culture;critical-interpretative instrument;cultural heritage;design process;digital archive;graphic layout;iconic processing;image dichotomy;information technology;multimedia communication;project communication;project material storage;real-time visualization;virtual concreteness","","0","","8","","","Oct. 28 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is used in bio-computing applications where the algorithms are commonly used for retrieval of information such as sequence analysis and gene/protein identification. Extremely large amount of data in the form of strings has to be processed in such bio-computing applications. Therefore, improving the performance of multiple string matching algorithms is always desirable. Multicore architectures are capable of providing better performance by parallelizing the multiple string matching algorithms. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is the one that is commonly used in exact multiple string matching algorithms. The focus of this paper is the acceleration of Aho-Corasick algorithm through a multicore CPU based software implementation.

They can do this efficiently and inexpensively for one reason: Photochemical film is cheap and easy to preserve. All you need is a cold room that's not too humid and not too dry, and the chemically processed film will last for 100 years or longer. Film archivists know that because many works from the earliest days of motion pictures, produced in the first decade of the 20th century or even before, are still around. Centuries from now, it'll be easy enough to retrieve whats stored on such films-a process that requires little more than a light source and a lens- even if information about how exactly those movies were made is lost.","0018-9235;00189235","","10.1109/MSPEC.2014.6745882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745882","","Digital images;Economics;Motion pictures;Storage automation","entertainment;information retrieval;photographic lenses","chemically processed film;cold room;digital movie storage;information retrieval;lens;light source;motion pictures;movie studios;photochemical film","","0","","","","","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two of the main difficult issues in handling this system are tackled in this paper. First, when people use voice retrieval systems, new created ""hot words"" are inputted as the keywords. In order to ensure the quality of the user experience, it is important to increase the recognition performance of these hot words. Second, for our applications, the retrieval domain is given. How to automatically select in domain data from the web data and update domain-specific language models is another problem which needs to be solved. To address these issues, in the system the latest text training data are obtained by searching web data related to the top ranking hot words. Based on the data, a block-based language modeling method is proposed to automatically build and update domain-specific language models. Meanwhile, in-domain high frequency words and phrases are added into the lexicon for the lexicon updating. From real world users' voice retrieval dataset, experimental results showed that through the updating of our system, consistent improvements were achieved for in-domain voice retrieval recognition.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2548-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-2549-0; POD:978-1-4799-2550-6","10.1109/CIS.2013.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746364","blockbased language model;domain-specific language model;voice retrieval","Adaptation models;Data models;Entertainment industry;Hidden Markov models;Speech recognition;Training;Training data","Internet;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","Web data search;Web-based language model domain adaptation;automatic language model update;block-based language modeling method;domain-specific language models;hot word recognition;in-domain high-frequency phrases;in-domain high-frequency words;in-domain voice retrieval recognition;lexicon updating;recognition performance;text training data;voice retrieval dataset;voice retrieval system","","0","","12","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Internet of Things (loT) philosophy can be applied for connecting smartphone users for various transportation applications. This paper develops Facebook-based carpooling, and proposes Twitter-based traffic monitoring and Flickr-based incident reporting applications. The SNS services provide application programming interfaces (A PIs) that allow external users to access their databases. The APls provide a basis for the development of transportation applications for each service. Facebook can allow a group of friends to share a ride based on their attributes which are available in their personal information sections. Twitter can be used for sharing traffic conditions on the roads. Flickr can be customized as a geo-tagged collision reporting tool with real-time close-up photos of traffic collisions. It is found that available APls are useful for implementing SNS-based transportation applications.

Lab., Univ. de Valencia, Vale&#x0300;ncia, Spain","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20140227","2014","52","8","4881","4894","In the satellite hyperspectral measures, the contributions of light, surface, and atmosphere are mixed. Applications need separate access to the sources. Conventional inversion techniques usually take a pixelwise spectral-only approach. However, recent improvements in retrieving surface and atmosphere characteristics use heuristic spatial smoothness constraints. In this paper, we theoretically justify such heuristics by analyzing the impact of spatial information on the uncertainty of the solution. The proposed analysis allows to assess in advance the uniqueness (or robustness) of the solution depending on the curvature of a likelihood surface. In situations where pixel-based approaches become unreliable, it turns out that the consideration of spatial information always makes the problem to be better conditioned. With the proposed analysis, this is easily understood since the curvature is consistent with the complexity of the sources measured in terms of the number of significant eigenvalues (or free parameters in the problem). In agreement with recent results in hyperspectral image coding, spatial correlations in the sources imply that the intrinsic complexity of the spatio-spectral representation of the signal is always lower than its spectral-only counterpart. According to this, the number of free parameters in the spatio-spectral inverse problem is smaller, so the spatio-spectral approaches are always better than spectral-only approaches. Experiments using ensembles of actual reflectance values and realistic MODTRAN irradiance and atmosphere radiance and transmittance values show that the proposed analysis successfully predicts the practical difficulty of the problem and the improved quality of spatio-spectral retrieval.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2285731","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6658876","Complexity of irradiance‚Äìreflectance‚Äìtransmittance;Complexity of irradiance??reflectance??transmittance;curvature analysis;inverse problems in remote sensing;spatial information;spatio-spectral principal component analysis (PCA)","Atmosphere;Atmospheric measurements;Complexity theory;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Hyperspectral sensors;Principal component analysis","constraint handling;correlation theory;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image coding;image representation;information retrieval;inverse problems;spatiotemporal phenomena;spectral analysis","MODTRAN irradiance;atmosphere characteristics;atmosphere radiance;eigenvalues;heuristic spatial smoothness constraint;hyperspectral image coding;intrinsic complexity;irradiance-reflectance-transmittance ambiguity;pixel-based approach;pixelwise spectral only approach;satellite hyperspectral measures;spatial correlation;spatial information;spatio-spectral inverse problem;spatio-spectral retrieval;spatio-spectral signal representation;surface characteristics retrieval;transmittance","","3","","34","","20131108","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The family pictures and films constitute the very first audiovisual global fund. This heritage presents as many individual life traces as the essential component of a collective history. Digitization is widely used today by institutions, but also by private individuals. Together, it is possible to highlight these documents on the Internet and build the social and cultural history of a country, a region, a city, a community... That is the editorial project carried out by www.notrehistoire.ch, dedicated to the French-speaking Swiss audiovisual archives. The platform gathers and combines documents (pictures, films, sound recordings, stories) from family archives and institutional funds in a refined editing environment, supervised by a moderator. As a ‚Äúwork in progress‚Äù, these archives enrich interest groups related to personalities, places, events and daily life facts to create the French-speaking Swiss collective memory. The platform favors the sharing of knowledge, helps connecting generations, social categories, private individuals and institutions (libraries, museum, radio, television, etc.). www.notrehistoire.ch is also a social network that gives its members the opportunity to take part in a project of public interest. It is a unique platform in Switzerland. Free of charge, in the service of the community, it is edited by the Foundation for the Safeguarding of the Audiovisual Heritage of the Swiss Radio Television (Fondation pour la sauvegarde du patrimoine audiovisuel de la Radio TeÃÅleÃÅvision Suisse, FONSART). In terms of statistics, since its creation on October 29, 2009 in French-speaking Switzerland (1.2 million inhabitants): 41'300 archived documents (39'000 pictures, 1'200 videos, 1'100 audios); 2'350 members, 17 institutions (Swiss Radio Television, RTS, ICRC archives, League of Nations archives, International Labor Office archives, etc.), 728 interest groups, 850'000 visitors from 160 countri- s (Switzerland, France, Belgium, Canada, United States...), 8'100'000 views. www.notrehistoire.ch offers a smartphone app (Iphone, Android) which uses geolocation to discover pictures and films from the place where they were made at the time. An Ipad app is currently being developed. By using web technologies and the main social networks, www.notrehistoire.ch shows that a simple tool and a coherent editorial project favors the conservation and use of audiovisual archives. The platform allows the public to become actors in the construction process of a collective memory, it supports the sense of belonging to a community and the sharing of knowledge.

Metadata based similarity measures are used by many websites for music recommendation and retrieval. Metadata attached to music files as text generally include title, albums, genre, artist etc. The main limitation of this method is that it can only work if metadata is available with the music. It may produce wrong results if incorrect metadata is associated with the music file. Present Meta data based systems also lack in analyzing contents. We have conducted experiments with Indian film songs in pairs and triplets to understand listener's perception of similarity. We analyzed content based parameters such as voice, mood, instruments used, lyrics, rhythms, tune etc and their relative importance in similarity perception to majority of the listeners. We propose to use both metadata and content based parameters. We worked on few parameters and worked with some algorithms in our prototype. Our findings can be useful for music Information Retrieval System and the concept is applicable to all musical forms.

The moulds can be classified into two main categories: those made in the workshops of the sculptors working in bronze, most of whom were Florentine artists active in the 18th century, and those that were made by modelers in the factory using sculptures from private collections (in particular, antique marbles and bronze statuettes) or models that were specially made in the factory. The project is organized according to two workflows and includes the creation of a system for archiving, managing and retrieving the information which is called the Doccia Digital Archive System (DDA System). The first workflow is used for the sets of moulds for which we have no information concerning the positive (archetype). For the non-invasive exploration of the moulds we used 3D scans of the inside of the mould followed by the virtual reconstruction of the figure. The second workflow deals with groups of moulds that were part of the documentary campaigns conducted in 1960-1968 and in 2009-2010. For both of the workflows, there is an art historical study that completes the description of the sets of moulds being examined. The input into the DDA System of this vast quantity of heterogeneous data gathered during the development of the two workflows will make it possible for users at the Doccia Museum and the factory as well as ceramic restorers and scholars in Italy and other countries to make use of the information and the images.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3211-5; POD:978-1-4799-3212-2","10.1109/SITIS.2013.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727215","3D scanning;Plaster moulds;plaster casts;porcelain;wax casts","Art;Conferences;Head;Porcelain;Production facilities;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","cataloguing;computer graphics;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;museums","3D scans;DDA system;Doccia digital archive system;Doccia museum;Florentine artists;Ginori factory;antique moulds;cataloguing;ceramic restorers;documentary campaigns;figure virtual reconstruction;information retrieval;sophisticated digital technologies","","0","","24","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To reduce the size of big data, we divide the dataset into well separated clusters with bounded aspect ratios, locating them in different peers in ring network, using random projection tree(RP-tree). To limit the number of network accesses, we put similar subgroups adjacent to each other. Then, we construct one LSH hash table for each subgroup using optimal parameters.

The sequence of pages viewed by the user in a particular time-frame, i.e., the session, captures his/her interest in a specific topic. Clustering of these sessions is therefore needed to provide customized services to the users having similar interests. In this article, we propose a novel and accurate similarity measure, P<sub>sim</sub>, between two web pages and a method of clustering the web sessions using a recently developed Fast Optimal Global Sequence Alignment Algorithm (FOGSAA). FOGSAA is an optimal global alignment algorithm which is used to align the pairs of sessions. It computes the pair-wise distances, which is used to cluster the sessions in similar groups. FOGSAA aligns the sessions in much less time and results in an average time gain of 35.84% over the conventional dynamic programming based Needleman-Wunsch's method, where both are generating the same optimal alignment. Therefore, application of FOGSAA to align the sessions makes the procedure faster and at the same time maintains the quality.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2177-5; Electronic:978-1-4799-2178-2; POD:978-1-4799-4960-1","10.1109/RAICS.2013.6745488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745488","","Clustering algorithms;Dynamic programming;NASA;Servers;Time measurement;Web mining;Web pages","Internet;data mining;dynamic programming;information retrieval;pattern clustering","FOGSAA;Needleman-Wunsch method;Web mining;Web pages;Web session clustering;dynamic programming;fast optimal global sequence alignment algorithm;pairwise distance;similarity measure","","3","","20","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For an attribute of interest, given a few seed examples or indicative features for the attribute, we first obtain a ranked list of 'list pages' potentially containing additional dictionary terms. Our ranking model ranks pages from the enterprise corpus based on their 'list' content using several visual and lexical features. We gather users' judgement of the result pages and the model continuously learns from this feedback. We compare different techniques of dictionary curation using rule based extractors and visual features of pages. Based on rule writing exercise, we show the benefit of dictionaries for leaf node attributes, in writing rule based extractors for higher level nodes in an ontology. We have implemented a dictionary curation system based on these ideas.

Creation epics, origination epics, and heroic epics have been orally transmitted or circulated among many ethnic groups. As a leading academic institution in the field of epic studies, the Institute of Ethnic Literature (IEL), Chines Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) has been committed to collecting, preserving, and exploring Chinese ethnic epic traditions for more than three decades so far. Since 2011, IEL has launched a key project entitled ‚ÄúIEL Archives for Ethnic Minorities' Oral Traditions in China‚Äù at CASS level to construct a digital database to document and manage oral tradition materials, including epic tradition materials collected by research fellows from IEL during these years. The Epic Collection at IEL's Documentation Center for Ethnic Literature in China encompasses 43 ethnic minorities' epics handed down in the mainland China, especially the Three Grand Epics, namely Tibetan-Mongolian epic King Gesar/Geser, Mongolian epic Jangar, and Kirgiz epic Manas, which are still performed by the epic singers and storytellers from the different ethnic groups in the remote areas. Its main repositories possess audio-visual recordings, photographs, and varied manuscripts or texts with regard to different thematic data or data sets on epic traditional skills, expressive forms, social practices, ritual events, as well as life histories of epic performers and folk artists. The goal of the digital database, as established by IEL's plan, to serve for both academic studies and public promotion, along with the increasing need to share data, has made it essential to customize discipline-based metadata standards and facilitate the integration of different database.

These architectures are suitable for implementations with low retrieval latency, but are limited to small networks that store a few hundred data entries. In this paper, a new hardware architecture of SCNs is proposed that features a new data-storage technique as well as a method we refer to as Selective Decoding (SD-SCN).

However, because of the overabundance of clinical research articles, it is time consuming to add new content manually to any CKS such as UpToDate<sup>¬©</sup> and to ensure that it is consistent with evidence. For this reason, many CKS such as Mayo Clinic's AskMayoExpert use expert-based (and not evidence-based) knowledge learned from peer-to-peer communication. The main motivation of this work is to explore methods for assigning references automatically to expert-written content. The system employs information retrieval (IR) techniques to retrieve related sentences from MEDLINE abstracts as evidence candidates and then uses a machine learning model trained with physician's evaluation score on certain journals for re-ranking. Finally, the system utilizes citation counts of individual articles for further refining the ranking. A preliminary evaluation using 59 UpToDate sentences and respective citations as gold standard showed that the median ranking improved 11 folds after adding the journal and citation relevance metrics on the top of baseline that only uses the semantic relevance metric.

Score-driven non-negative matrix factorisation is then adopted in the transformation. Furthermore, this study also proposes pitch-wise alignment considering each pitch sequence (i.e. the row of piano roll) separately. Results based on the MIDI-Aligned Piano Sounds database show that approximately 88% of notes match their onsets, deviating from the ground truth by less than 50 ms.

The Sudan is a country rich in artefacts that go back to the dawn of history: archaeological remains, art, manuscripts that date back to beginning of Islam, books, archival documents, documentary film, hundreds of thousands of hours of video, television and radio, millions of photographs. The National Archives alone hold 76 million photographic negatives. This rich heritage is at risk. At risk from the heat, dust and humidity, from obsolescence of media: the documentary film in the film archive, for instance, can only be accessed on ancient and deteriorating equipment, for which no spare parts for repair can be found. These materials record history and culture of the country that is fast disappearing in the modern world. If these artefacts themselves are lost, so too will be the knowledge of a way of life.

Recent years have witnessed many approaches proposed for keyword search over XML and RDB. However, those approaches cannot intelligently exploit hidden semantics in XML or RDB, and thus encounter serious problems in processing keyword queries. In this paper, we point out mismatches between query answers returned by existing approaches and the common expectations in keyword search over XML and RDB. We analyze these mismatches and discover that the main reasons are due to the unawareness of semantics of object, relationship and attribute in databases. To capture these semantics, we construct Object Relationship (OR) data graph for XML and Object Relationship Mixed (ORM) data graph for RDB, and propose an intelligent keyword search based on OR and ORM data graph model to retrieve more informative answers. Finally, to further facilitate the usability of keyword search, we also show our ongoing work to enhance the expressive power of keyword queries. Particularly, we 1) enable users to explicitly indicate their search intentions by relation, attribute and tag names in keyword queries; 2) handle recursive relationships and identifier-dependency relationships (IDD) in databases; and 3) incorporate aggregate function into keyword queries so that users can explore databases with aggregate queries.","2375-933X;2375933X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3919-0; POD:978-1-4799-3920-6","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2014.6741406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6741406","","Databases;Educational institutions;Keyword search;Search problems;Semantics;Steiner trees;XML","XML;graph theory;information retrieval systems;query processing;relational databases","IDD;OR data graph model;ORM data graph model;RDB;data-centric XML;identifier-dependency relationships;information retrieval system;intelligent keyword search;keyword query processing;object relationship data graph;object relationship mixed data graph;query answers;relational databases;tag names","","0","","15","","","15-17 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a peer-to-peer (P2P) system, every ""peer"" can play the role of a client and a server at the same time, hence sharing responsibilities among all parties. As in practice some peers or connecting links may be heavily loaded in comparison to others, load balancing algorithms are necessary to ensure a fair distribution of the load among participating peers. In this survey, we present load management solutions in P2P systems. According to the level at which they operate, we classify the different approaches into three categories: object placement, routing protocol, and underlay. The first two approaches tackle information lookup and retrieval in the overlay network, while the last one addresses traffic imbalance at the level of the underlying network.","1553-877X;1553877X","","10.1109/SURV.2013.060313.00157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6554306","Load balancing;decentralized systems;distributed hash tables;peer-to-peer","IP networks;Load management;Organizations;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing;Servers;Topology","client-server systems;file organisation;information retrieval;peer-to-peer computing;resource allocation;routing protocols;telecommunication traffic","P2P system;centralized server;client-server paradigm;fair load distribution;information lookup;information retrieval;load balancing algorithms;load management solutions;object placement;peer-to-peer distributed hash tables;peer-to-peer systems;routing protocol;traffic imbalance;underlay","","11","","65","","20130709","First Quarter 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Both manual and automated approaches are employed and have their own benefits and pitfalls. Generally, measuring one's expertise uses one metric (facet) like number of publications and to build a comprehensive profile of the expert, a multi-metric technique is proposed here with user defined weight-age constants for each metric and it also identifies that using multiple metrics for ranking of experts, is better than using one metric. This approach is further modelled using collaborative system architecture. We use two data sources Google Scholar and PubMed to get data about metrics to locate and rank medical experts and we evaluate our results for top 10 experts in 40 different sub-categories of the medical science. Further, results were evaluated by exploring each expert's available information on the world wide web.

Building Information Modeling (BIM) for new museum building design has been in use since the past decade. It allows architects, engineers and consultants to digitally co-design structures and exhibit spaces needed for museum collections. This process leads to a complete digitization of the physical museum, creating a parametric model that opens up a possibility for future integration with the museum's and community's digital artifacts. Museums are also currently in the process of exploring participatory digital strategies with their user communities and engage them in collection, digitization and archival processes. A new element in the participation by visitors and community would be to engage them digitally with the museum's building model and its physical space. Can BIM, community's and visitors' historic digital collections be integrated to create a shared and collaborative museum digital ecosystem? How will this digital building model of a historic museum space serve as a parametric platform for the digital artifacts of the participating community? Could a museum exhibit the community's digital artifacts via 3d Projection Mapping using the BIM model of the interior of the museum? By this, visitors and community could then insert their own historic collections into the museum, exhibit them through AV projections and thus transform the museum space as a stage for the display of the community's collections. Along these lines, this paper investigates various digital and participatory methods to engage user communities with museum buildings. It also explores inherent challenges towards an integrated museum model, and raises questions of sustainability that come along with it.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3170-5; POD:978-1-4799-3171-2; USB:978-1-4799-3169-9","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6744806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6744806","3D Projection;Architectural mapping;BIM","","history;information retrieval systems;museums","3D projection mapping;AV projections;BIM model;archival processes;building information modeling;collaborative museum digital ecosystem;community digital artifacts;community digital collections;cultural heritage museums;digitization processes;museum building design;museum collections;parametric museum model;participatory digital strategy;shared museum digital ecosystem;visitor historic digital collections","","0","","","","","Oct. 28 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The collection consists of negatives and positives, on glass plates and film, from the late nineteenth century up to the more recent high-resolution digital photography. A short overview of important moments in the experiences of digitizing this material, including the scientific data on the represented objects and scenes, will be presented with examples pointing out why certain decisions proved to be very fruitful, but also sometimes rather painful. Digitization is a broad and vague concept, so KIK-IRPA had to face all kinds of evolutions over the years, the advantages and disadvantages of the law of the handicap of a head start, the lack of information then against the flooding of information now, the personalities of the people involved, institutional mentalities, and more. All this will be taken into account to arrive at the speeding up of digitization during the last decade. In recent years some external opportunities did influence the process, and as such also the pace of reacting, pro-actively at times, to these new situations. Two specific cases of content delivery to Europeana will be presented as use cases: one with 1,500 digital images of Art Nouveau art works and a more massive project with 100,000 digital objects, both with roughly the same time span and budget.

It also improves understanding of interrelationship between genes and gene products (GPs). Currently, one of the most commonly used tools for functionally annotating genes and GPs is the Gene Ontology (GO), which describes genes/GPs using a machine-readable language. To measure the semantic similarity between two GO terms, many studies that are based on GO topology have recently been reported. However, a comprehensive assessment and general guidelines for validating these methods are lacking. In this paper, we collect a large dataset to evaluate five often-used semantic similarity measure methods by estimating sequence similarity, phylogenetic profile similarity, and structural similarity. We further compare the measures in terms of their clustering performance using domains extracted from SCOP database. We describe some key aspects of these measure methods and discuss how the limitations may be addressed as well as some open problems.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1309-1; POD:978-1-4799-1311-4","10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732457","gene ontology;gene products;semantic functional similarity","Biological information theory;Correlation;Current measurement;Integrated circuits;Phylogeny;Proteins","bioinformatics;evolution (biological);genetics;genomics;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;proteins;semantic networks","GO term similarity measures;GO topology;Gene Ontology;SCOP database;big biological data;biologically relevant information retrieval;clustering performance;comprehensive assessment;functional GP annotation;functional gene annotation;gene interrelationship;gene product;general guidelines;machine-readable language;often-used semantic similarity measure methods;phylogenetic profile similarity;protein function prediction methods;semantic functional similarity measures;sequence similarity;structural similarity;topology-based metrics","","1","","35","","","18-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, widely-used identity management mechanisms that solely rely on username/password are inadequate to meet the strong security and privacy requirements for protecting sensitive user information and medical data. Two-factor authentication approaches that are more convenient and user friendly than existing solutions have been given top priority in the healthcare sector where the majority of healthcare practitioners and patients are not tech-savvy. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based identity management framework-SIM-to enhance the security and usability of user identity management in healthcare information systems. SIM leverages the popularity and computational power of smartphone. Within the SIM framework, a person employs a smartphone to centrally store and manage her identity credentials and authenticates herself to healthcare applications using two-factor authentication without typing any identity credentials. Moreover, SIM provides patients with a patient-controlled authorization mechanism to help patients manage the accesses to their PHRs in a secure and convenient manner. Using an existing EMR system-Arkansas Trauma Image Repository-as an example, we demonstrate that SIM can be applied to a real-world healthcare information system to enhance its protection of user credentials and sensitive information.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1309-1; POD:978-1-4799-1311-4","10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732600","","Authentication;Browsers;Hospitals;Malware;Servers","cryptographic protocols;data protection;electronic health records;health care;human computer interaction;information retrieval;security of data;smart phones;telemedicine","Arkansas Trauma Image Repository application;EHR systems;EMR systems;PHR access management;PHR systems;SIM framework;central identity credential management;central identity credential storage;convenient user identity management;healthcare applications;healthcare information systems;healthcare sector;identity credential authentication;identity management mechanisms;medical data protection;patient-controlled authorization mechanism;privacy requirements;real-world healthcare information system;security requirements;smartphone computational power;smartphone-based identity management framework;two-factor authentication approaches;user credential protection;user friendly;user identity management security;user identity management usability;user information protection;username-password authentication approaches","","0","","27","","","18-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"The patrimonialization process of advertising: From scorn and mistrust to documentary heritage, archive, and history","C. Armand","Ecole Normale Super. of Lyon (ENS Lyon), Lyon, France","2013 Digital Heritage International Congress (DigitalHeritage)","20140220","2013","1","","671","674","This short essay aims at tracing the patrimonialization process of advertising from the 19th century to nowadays. The process followed third steps. First, advertising evolved from a despised object to a valuable cultural artifact. Considered as useless or deceitful in first place, advertising has gradually managed to gain legitimacy as a useful and even necessary tool for both companies that want to sell their products and for consumers in search of information, and finally as a cultural artifact and a work of art worthy of being collected or entering museums or exhibitions (from French poster designers such as Jules CheÃÅret or Toulouse-Lautrec to the ""creative revolution"" in the 1960s or the more recent exhibitions ""Goudemalion"" at the ""MuseÃÅe des Arts DeÃÅcoratifs"" in Paris in 2012). This process of recognition is mainly due to the efforts made by advertisers who participate in the profesionalization process of their activities at the time. The second and more recent step, from a cultural object to an archive, raises such sensible issues as collecting and preserving advertisements; digitization (digitized/digital-born ads; methods and tools); metadata and semantic. As a specific archive, torn between abundance and scarcity or unequal quality of data, it requires a specific ""literacy"" from archivists who need to be trained for that purpose. The case of Duke University will serve to illustrate these questions. The last step from an available archive to a historical material also requires a special ""literacy"" for historians to build databases and corpora, to identify and select the accurate documents, to choose the appropriate methodology and tools to examine and interpret this specific material. Finally, the question of whether and how to use advertising as a material to imagine new forms of historical narratives (visual or digital narratives, virtual exhibits) will be explored. Last but not least, we will examine the transformation of ads in- the last decade through digital approaches, the impact of digitization on copyright and on the preservation and study of advertising.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3170-5; POD:978-1-4799-3171-2; USB:978-1-4799-3169-9","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6743814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6743814","(visual) art;advertising;archive;curation;digital humanities;heritage;museum;visual history","Advertising;Art;Companies;Cultural differences;History;Materials;Visualization","advertising;history;information retrieval systems","advertising patrimonialization process;archive;copyright;cultural artifact;digital narratives;documentary heritage;historical material;historical narratives;profesionalization process;virtual exhibits;visual narratives","","0","","14","","","Oct. 28 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic design of the game is based on a three body problem: that medical progress depends on the interaction of the doctor, the patient and the disease. Players have to successfully interact with different social classes, make business decisions and treat patients with a number of different illnesses in order to complete the game. In addition, the project brings in archival documents as primary source material that the player must access through the library in order to complete mini-games and quests.

However, such systems cannot directly use the previous centralized methods or broadcasting methods, which generate high cost of mobile Internet access, node overload, and high server bandwidth cost with the tremendous number of mobile users. We propose a distributed Social-based mObile Q&A System (SOS) with low overhead and system cost as well as quick response to question askers. SOS enables mobile users to forward questions to potential answerers in their friend lists in a decentralized manner for a number of hops before resorting to the server. It leverages lightweight knowledge engineering techniques to accurately identify friends who are able to and willing to answer questions, thus reducing the search and computation costs of mobile nodes. The trace-driven simulation results show that SOS can achieve a high query precision and recall rate, a short response latency and low overhead. We have also deployed a pilot version of SOS for use in a small group in Clemson University. The feedback from the users shows that SOS can provide high-quality answers.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514871","Question and answer systems;online social networks;peer to peer networks","Internet;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Motion pictures;Servers;Twitter","Internet;knowledge engineering;mobile computing;question answering (information retrieval);search engines;social networking (online)","Clemson University;SOS;Web search engines;broadcasting methods;centralized server;distributed mobile Q&A system;distributed social-based mobile Q&A system;lightweight knowledge engineering techniques;mobile Internet access;mobile nodes;nonfactual questions;question and answer systems;quick response;response latency;server bandwidth cost;social information;social networks;social-based Q&A systems;trace-driven simulation","","2","","64","","20130513","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Towards a context-aware IDE-based meta search engine for recommendation about programming errors and exceptions","M. M. Rahman; S. Yeasmin; C. K. Roy","Comput. Sci., Univ. of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK, Canada","2014 Software Evolution Week - IEEE Conference on Software Maintenance, Reengineering, and Reverse Engineering (CSMR-WCRE)","20140227","2014","","","194","203","Study shows that software developers spend about 19% of their time looking for information in the web during software development and maintenance. Traditional web search forces them to leave the working environment (e.g., IDE) and look for information in the web browser. It also does not consider the context of the problems that the developers search solutions for. The frequent switching between web browser and the IDE is both time-consuming and distracting, and the keyword-based traditional web search often does not help much in problem solving. In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that exploits the APIs provided by three popular web search engines-Google, Yahoo, Bing and a popular programming Q & A site, StackOverflow, and captures the content-relevance, context-relevance, popularity and search engine confidence of each candidate result against the encountered programming problems. Experiments with 75 programming errors and exceptions using the proposed approach show that inclusion of different types of contextual information associated with a given exception can enhance the recommendation accuracy of a given exception. Experiments both with two existing approaches and existing web search engines confirm that our approach can perform better than them in terms of recall, mean precision and other performance measures with little computational cost.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3752-3; POD:978-1-4799-3753-0","10.1109/CSMR-WCRE.2014.6747170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747170","API mashup;Context code;Context-based search;Cosine similarity;IDE-based search","Context;Equations;Mathematical model;Measurement;Programming;Search engines;Web search","Internet;application program interfaces;information retrieval;recommender systems;search engines;ubiquitous computing","API;Bing;Eclipse IDE-based Web search solution;Google;StackOverflow;Web search engines;Yahoo;content-relevance confidence;context-aware IDE-based meta search engine;context-relevance confidence;contextual information;programming Q & A site;programming errors;programming exceptions;recommendation accuracy;search engine confidence;software development;software maintenance","","9","","18","","","3-6 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Homm-sw: Networks-of-stories to value tangible and intangible heritage in museums","M. Russo; R. Ghose; M. Mattioli","Dipt. di Econ. Marco Biagi, Univ. of Modena & Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy","2013 Digital Heritage International Congress (DigitalHeritage)","20140220","2013","1","","451","451","Social inclusion, lifelong learning and the regeneration of competence networks are key processes which foster innovation. Museums may play an important role in these processes and ICT can strongly support the effectiveness of the interventions required. Among them, digital tools used to tell stories are becoming increasingly popular. Narratives in new dimensions enable the formation of personal and community identities, and the construction of meanings [1], [2]. Homm-sw supports multimedia narratives which enhance tangible and intangible heritage in education and cultural mediation, as well as in tourism. Developed by Officina Emilia (Italy) and Crafts Museum (India), the application is online at www.hommmuseums-software.org. So far, it implements the engine for creating and managing the activity `networks-ofstories', to create a nonlinear and open multimedia narration [3],[4]. In the last decade, digital storytelling has spread rapidly due to the growth and possibilities offered by new ICT devices [5], [6]. Together with crowd sourcing it can deepen and enrich the understanding of tangible and intangible heritage. Digital storytelling still faces some critical challenges: creation of content on tangible and intangible heritage, classification and re-use of existing documents and clips, cooperative and coordinated production of new content. Moreover, for effective exploratory paths and a more analytical approach to browsing material, contents must be set in the overall perspective of the narrations, to ensure narration is coherent. Finally, validation and dissemination of related outcomes must respect scientific standards. Homm-sw is based on four pillars: (1) a web system for creating and managing the community of users, authors, administrators of the sw platform and of contents; (2) ICT information points in the museum that integrate contents; (3) a website with a personal workspace that allows for the possibility to 'prolong the visit after the visit'; (4) a- working group for production and content management, and a set of collaboration tools used to expand the storage of content. Homm-sw has tools that: support educators, also in contrasting learning difficulties, in developing inclusive and collaborative educational practices; support curators; facilitate crowd sourcing; create a personal web repository of contents and connections; share contents to be published, if approved by the administrator; create a network of contents and applications, at different levels for different users and specific needs. Homm-sw extends the museum experience. Before the visit: users can have a general look at museum contents and note, in their online personal desktop, what they are interested in. During the visit: users can retrieve their notes and add what is available on the museum's exhibits and augmented reality, hands-on activities and multimedia contents, living laboratories, demonstration programs. Homm-sw in the onsite-mode allows only notes and memos, to fully enjoy what the museum uniquely offers. After the visit: users access their online workspace to retrieve and explore their notes, and any other content, as much as they wish. Beyond those common to other ICT tools in use in museums, Homm-sw has two key innovative functions. First, recording and retrieval of users' activities: during the visit in a museum, the visitor accessing her account may browse and take notes in her personal workspace and then retrieve and explore them, and many more, as much as she likes after the visit. Second, narratives presented through a set of related clips (videos, albums, texts) are easily seen in the conceptual map proposed by the curators. Homm-sw can be shared with non-profit organizations which intend to develop new features and share the upgrade with previous users and with new users, on the same conditions. Other engines will be implemented according to the demands of users, together with multichannel and multilingual extension.

However, the notion of ‚Äúmobile phone‚Äù has not changed accordingly: the majority of the people consider this device as a phone without thinking the implications of their digital life when using it. In this paper we demonstrate how to steal user's credentials and sensitive information in general from the memory of an Android device. We do so by analysing how mobile applications manage users data when these are loaded in the memory of the device. We use this findings to create a malware application able to retrieve login credentials from memory of the target applications, exploiting vulnerabilities due to both the user behavior and the poor practices when developing mobile applications. Finally, and most importantly, we show that this attack is not noticed by the mobile phone user both in terms of visibility and mobile phone performance.","","Electronic:978-1-908320-22-3; POD:978-1-4799-3552-9; USB:978-1-908320-17-9","10.1109/WorldCIS.2013.6751023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751023","android phone;malware;memory analysis;personal information","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Smart phones;Trojan horses","information retrieval;invasive software;mobile computing;smart phones","Android phones;digital life;in-memory credential robbery;login credential retrieval;malware application;mobile phones;sensitive information;user behavior;user credentials;user data management","","0","","19","","","9-12 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the world of information technology the changes happens rapidly. As the new technologies always changes the world of information representation, the effect is to find out relevant pieces of information is quite difficult because of the heavy noise, cluttering with distracted features(like advertisements, links, scrollers etc.) in the whole web page. Information or useful content extraction from the web pages(structured or semi strutured) becomes a critical issue for web users and web miners. The user can be misguided by the noise of the web page. So the information extraction from the web page carries a huge importance. A confusing puzzle for information extraction is to define the noise domain and its removal. In the recent studies we all well known about the wrapper induction, feature extractor, back propagation algorithm of neural network, content extractor, PAT trees, etc. In the paper followed by the abstract we investigate the DOM tree segmentation with class attribute based approach. The class attribute can be used with all HTML elements inside the `BODY' section of the document. It is used to create different classes of an element, where each class can have its own properties.

In this paper we (1) define three classes of irrelevant segments, (2) propose visual feature extraction methods to obtain irrelevance indicators for each class and (3) present an extensible framework to detect irrelevant segments in laparoscopic videos. The framework includes a training component that learns a prediction model using nonlinear regression with a generalized logistic function and a segment composition algorithm that derives segment boundaries from the fuzzy frame classifications. The experimental results show that our method performs very good both for the classification of individual frames and the detection of segment boundaries in videos and enables considerable storage space savings.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-5140-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-2171-3; POD:978-1-4799-4655-6","10.1109/ISM.2013.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746473","endoscopic video;fuzzy classification;irrelevant scene detection;segment composition;video segmentation","Endoscopes;Image color analysis;Laparoscopes;Predictive models;Surgery;Training;Videos","feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;image classification;image segmentation;information retrieval systems;medical image processing;object detection;regression analysis;storage management;surgery;video retrieval;video signal processing","fuzzy frame classification;generalized logistic function;irrelevance indicators;irrelevant segments;laparoscopic surgery;laparoscopic videos;nonlinear regression;prediction model;relevance segmentation;relevant scene retrieval;segment boundary detection;segment composition algorithm;storage capacity;storage space saving;video archives;video footage;visual feature extraction method","","8","","14","","","9-11 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
