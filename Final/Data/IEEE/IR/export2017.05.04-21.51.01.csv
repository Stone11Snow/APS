Advances in data storage and image acquisition technologies have enabled the creation of large image datasets. In order to deal with these data, appropriate information systems (e.g., image digital libraries) have been developed to efficiently manage such collections. One of the most common retrieval approaches is to employ so-called content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Basically, these systems try to retrieve images similar to a user-defined pattern (e.g., image example). Their goal is to support image retrieval based on content properties (e.g., shape, color, or texture), which are often encoded in terms of image descriptors. This demonstration presents a new CBIR system based on configurable components. The main novelty resides in its content-based image search component (CBISC) that supports queries on image collections. CBISC is based on the OAI (H. Suleman et al. (2003)) principles, and thus provides an easy-to-install search engine to support querying images by content. As with the OAI protocol, queries are posed via HTTP requests and the responses are encoded in XML.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336222","","Content based retrieval;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Memory;Search engines;Shape;Software libraries;XML","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;image retrieval;information retrieval systems","CBIR system;content-based image retrieval;digital libraries;image acquisition;open archives initiative;search component","","0","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of labeled samples to learn correctly and suffer from the problems of context and concept uncertainty when only a limited number of labeled samples are available. To address the problems of context and concept uncertainty, we have proposed a novel framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (a) Using the salient objects to achieve a middle-level understanding of video contents and enhance the quality of features on discriminating among different semantic video concepts; (b) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (c) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integrate the unlabeled samples to enable incremental classifier training and address the problem of context uncertainty; (d) Proposing a cost-sensitive video classification technique to address the problem of concept uncertainty over time; (e) Supporting automatic video annotation via semantic classification.

When an organization member sends a meeting request with required information to MS3, the MS3 will retrieve the invitees' information from Personal Meeting Scheduling, Ontology (PMSO) Repository and send a response to GFDA. Then, GFDA utilizes these invitees' information along with the PMSO and meeting information to infer the suitable meeting time slots.

Usually, each algorithm is tested on a different (small) database of 3D models, and thus no direct comparison is available for competing methods. We describe the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB), a publicly available database of polygonal models collected from the World Wide Web and a suite of tools for comparing shape matching and classification algorithms. One feature of the benchmark is that it provides multiple semantic labels for each 3D model. For instance, it includes one classification of the 3D models based on function, another that considers function and form, and others based on how the object was constructed (e.g., man-made versus natural objects). We find that experiments with these classifications can expose different properties of shape-based retrieval algorithms. For example, out of 12 shape descriptors tested, extended Gaussian images by B. Horn (1984) performed best for distinguishing man-made from natural objects, while they performed among the worst for distinguishing specific object types. Based on experiments with several different shape descriptors, we conclude that no single descriptor is best for all classifications, and thus the main contribution of this paper is to provide a framework to determine the conditions under which each descriptor performs best.","","POD:0-7695-2075-8","10.1109/SMI.2004.1314504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1314504","","Benchmark testing;Biological system modeling;Classification algorithms;Computer science;Information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Shape;Software tools;Spatial databases;Web sites","Internet;computational geometry;data visualisation;image matching;image retrieval;visual databases","3D model database;3D shape matching;Gaussian images;Princeton Shape Benchmark;World Wide Web;geometric algorithms;geometric matching;man-made objects;multiple semantic labels;natural objects;polygonal model database;shape classification;shape database;shape descriptors;shape representations;shape-based retrieval","","391","1","40","","","7-9 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to facilitate autonomous information retrieval, it is necessary to create a standard framework for the semantic Web. The existing Web contains a considerable amount of data. It is an alluring target for data mining. Most of the data stored on Web pages is weakly structured. Mining or otherwise accessing the data in context from multiple sites is difficult; particularly when others construct the Web pages and their internal structure is not clearly understood. A standard way of viewing and organizing data into an ontology is essential for sharing data and interoperability between Web sites. A semantic Web standard has evolved through extensive iteration and was approved in late 2003. Fully autonomous or semi-autonomous discovery and development of ontologies is the only feasible way to transition to the semantic Web. One enabling strategy is to merge existing, vetted ontologies into a single ontology. The pre-merged ontologies would likely be similar in some respects and distinct in others. This paper discusses how to possibly merge multiple ontologies into a single viable ontology. It seeks an effective way to merge ontologies without losing any information (and possibly gaining some information in the process). When comparing ontologies, a similarity measure would be necessary. The measure would be used to measure the similarity two existing ontologies. This similarity measure is necessarily imprecise.","","POD:0-7803-8376-1","10.1109/NAFIPS.2004.1337376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1337376","","Computer science;Data mining;HTML;Information retrieval;Internet;Merging;Ontologies;Organizing;Semantic Web;Web pages","data mining;information retrieval;knowledge representation;open systems;semantic Web","Internet;autonomous information retrieval;data mining;data sharing;interoperability;ontology merging;semantic Web","","1","","6","","","27-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But they are commonly degraded by multiplicative noise. Sometimes, in case of image transferring from the imaging system carrier via communication line, impulse bursts can also take place. Thus, in order to improve useful information retrieval, the image preprocessing is required, and quite often it has to be performed in real time or, at least, rather quickly. For the considered application and noise properties, one approach to image processing can be the use of multistage procedures. At the first stage, the multiplicative noise variance can be evaluated (this stage is optional and can be skipped if statistical characteristics of noise are a priori known). Then we propose to apply the specially designed method for detection and removal of impulse bursts. Finally, the three-state texture/detail preserving hard-switching locally adaptive filtering (LAF) of pre-processed image is to be performed that serves suppression of remained multiplicative noise. The main goal of this article is to concentrate on fast hardware-software realization of the proposed multistage filtering procedure. Since we ought to provide the ability to operate in real time it is reasonable to use specialized hardware units that implement basic algorithm blocks. Thus, the pipeline architecture is the best choice for providing optimal computation load of the hardware units used for ensuring the highest overall processing speed for the proposed multistage filter. On the other side, such approaches will be also efficient in the case of multiprocessor software realization.","","POD:0-7803-8411-3","10.1109/MSMW.2004.1345840","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1345840","","Adaptive filters;Degradation;Design methodology;Filtering;Hardware;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pipelines;Radar imaging","adaptive filters;airborne radar;filtering theory;hardware-software codesign;noise;pipeline processing;pipelines;radar imaging;telecommunication switching","MM-band images;algorithm blocks;communication line;detection method;hardware-software realization;image preprocessing;image processing;image transfer;imaging system;impulse bursts;locally adaptive filtering;multiplicative noise;multiplicative noise variance;multiprocessor software realization;multistage adaptive filtering;multistage procedure;noise suppression;optimal computation load;pipeline architecture;pre-processed image;real time operation;side-look aperture radars;state texture;statistical properties","","0","","3","","","21-26 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason, searching the Web is a promising approach to find things in the real world. We present NEXAS, an extension to Web search engines that attempts to find real-world entities relevant to a topic. Its basic idea is to extract proper names from the Web pages retrieved for the topic. A main advantage of this approach is that users can query any topic and learn about relevant real-world entities without dedicated databases for the topic. In particular, we focus on an application for finding authoritative people from the Web. This application is practically important because once personal names are obtained; they can lead users from the Web to managed information stored in digital libraries. To explore effective ways of finding people, we first examine the distribution of Japanese personal names by analyzing about 50 million Japanese Web pages. We observe that personal names appear frequently on the Web, but the distribution is highly influenced by automatically generated texts. To remedy the bias and find widely acknowledged people accurately, we utilize the number of Web servers containing a name instead of the number of Web pages. We show its effectiveness by an experiment covering a wide range of topics.

They can help overcome the sense of isolation and culture shock, by illustrating to an individual how others have similar experiences. We are building a digital collection to support this exchange of experiences.

VKB has been enhanced to include direct search interfaces for NSDL and Google. Users create a visualization of search results while selecting and organizing materials for their current activity. Additionally, metadata applicators have been added to VKB. This interface allows the rapid addition of metadata to documents and aids the user in the extraction of existing metadata for application to other documents. A study was performed to compare the selection and organization of documents in VKB to the commonly used tools of a Web browser and a word processor.

While tools that index, classify, rank and retrieve documents from such libraries are important, it would be worthwhile to complement these tools with information available on the Web. We propose one such technique that uses a topical crawler driven by the information extracted from a research document. The goal of the crawler is to harvest a collection of Web pages that are focused on the topical subspaces associated with the given document. The collection created through Web crawling is further processed using lexical and linkage analysis. The entire process is automated and uses machine learning techniques to both guide the crawler as well as analyze the collection it fetches.

"A similarity learning approach to content-based image retrieval: application to digital mammography","I. El-Naqa; Yongyi Yang; N. P. Galatsanos; R. M. Nishikawa; M. N. Wernick","Med. Sch. of Washington Univ., St. Louis, MO, USA","IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","20041004","2004","23","10","1233","1244","In this paper, we describe an approach to content-based retrieval of medical images from a database, and provide a preliminary demonstration of our approach as applied to retrieval of digital mammograms. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) refers to the retrieval of images from a database using information derived from the images themselves, rather than solely from accompanying text indices. In the medical-imaging context, the ultimate aim of CBIR is to provide radiologists with a diagnostic aid in the form of a display of relevant past cases, along with proven pathology and other suitable information. CBIR may also be useful as a training tool for medical students and residents. The goal of information retrieval is to recall from a database information that is relevant to the user's query. The most challenging aspect of CBIR is the definition of relevance (similarity), which is used to guide the retrieval machine. In this paper, we pursue a new approach, in which similarity is learned from training examples provided by human observers. Specifically, we explore the use of neural networks and support vector machines to predict the user's notion of similarity. Within this framework we propose using a hierarchal learning approach, which consists of a cascade of a binary classifier and a regression module to optimize retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We also explore how to incorporate online human interaction to achieve relevance feedback in this learning framework. Our experiments are based on a database consisting of 76 mammograms, all of which contain clustered microcalcifications (MCs). Our goal is to retrieve mammogram images containing similar MC clusters to that in a query. The performance of the retrieval system is evaluated using precision-recall curves computed using a cross-validation procedure. Our experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the learning framework can accurately predict the perceptual similarity reported by human observers, thereby se- - rving as a basis for CBIR; 2) the learning-based framework can significantly outperform a simple distance-based similarity metric; 3) the use of the hierarchical two-stage network can improve retrieval performance; and 4) relevance feedback can be effectively incorporated into this learning framework to achieve improvement in retrieval precision based on online interaction with users; and 5) the retrieved images by the network can have predicting value for the disease condition of the query.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2004.834601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339430","","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Displays;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Mammography;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pathology","content-based retrieval;diseases;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;neural nets;optimisation;radiology;relevance feedback;support vector machines","clustered microcalcifications;content-based image retrieval;cross-validation procedure;digital mammography;disease condition;hierarchal learning approach;neural networks;online human interaction;optimisation;precision-recall curves;radiologists;regression module;relevance feedback;similarity learning approach;support vector machines","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Diseases;Calcinosis;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Computer Simulation;Database Management Systems;Decision Support Systems, Clinical;Female;Humans;Information Storage and Retrieval;Mammography;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Precancerous Conditions;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;User-Computer Interface","144","3","41","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to effectively utilize Grids, users need to be connected to the best available resources at any given time. As Grids are in constant flux, users cannot be expected to keep up with the configuration and status of the Grid, thus they must be provided with automatic resource brokering for selecting and ranking resources meeting constraints and preferences they specify. This work presents a new OGSI-compliant resource selection and ranking framework called Surfer that has been implemented as part of NASA's Information Power Grid (IPG) project. Surfer is highly extensible and may be integrated into any Grid environment by adding information providers knowledgeable about that environment.

Digital libraries of trails offer advantages over paper guidebooks in that they are more accurate, dynamic and not limited to the experience of the author(s). The basic representation of a trail is a GPS track log, recorded as recreators travel on trails. As users complete trips, the GPS track logs of their trips are submitted to the central library voluntarily. A major problem is that track logs will overlap and intersect each other. We present a method for the combination of overlapping and intersecting GPS track logs to create a network of GPS trails. Each trail segment in the network can then be characterized by automatic and manual means, producing a digital library of trails. We also describe the TopoFusion system which creates, manages and visualizes GPS data, including GPS networks.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336099","","Biological system modeling;Data visualization;Global Positioning System;Humans;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Navigation;Resource management;Roads;Software libraries","Global Positioning System;Internet;data visualisation;digital libraries;geographic information systems;public libraries","GPS track log;TopoFusion system;central library;data visualization;digital trail library;user submitted digital library","","0","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ADEPT education and evaluation team interviewed professors about their use of geography information as they prepare for class lectures, as compared to their research activities. We found that professors desired the ability to search by concept (erosion, continental drift, etc.) as well as geographic location, and that personal research collections were an important source of instructional materials. Resources in geospatial digital libraries are typically described by location, but are rarely described by concept or educational application. This paper presents implications for the design of an educational digital library from our observations of the lecture preparation process. Findings include functionality requirements for digital libraries and implications for the notion of digital libraries as a shared information environment. The functional requirements include definitions and enhancements of searching capabilities, the ability to contribute and to share personal collections of resources, and the capability to manipulate data and images.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336116","","Earth;Education;Geography;Human factors;Information resources;Information retrieval;Permission;Prototypes;Psychology;Software libraries","digital libraries;educational courses;educational technology;geographic information systems;geography;information retrieval;teaching;visual databases","Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype project;classroom lectures;educational digital library design;geography information;geography professors;geospatial digital libraries;information seeking behavior;lecture preparation process;shared information environment;undergraduate instruction;user analysis","","1","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the touted benefits of the semantic Web is that it will make searches more precise and efficient by leveraging metadata about Web-delivered content. Faceted metadata retrieval is an approach to providing users access to large collections of semistructured data and content that promises an improvement in usability over that available using more traditional search methods. We illustrate how the online proceedings for the 2003 Dublin Core Conference were implemented by combining traditional and innovative knowledge organization techniques. The 2003 Dublin Core Conference Proceedings served as a test-bed for generating a faceted metadata retrieval interface from instance metadata, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies expressed in RDF and RDF Schema. We share lessons learned in the design and implementation of the proceedings, and in particular focus on emerging best practices for representing and sharing metadata using Dublin Core Metadata recommendations, new interpretations of traditional Library and Information Science information retrieval techniques, and implementations of semantic Web standards.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240493","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336215","","Information retrieval;Standards","content management;digital libraries;information retrieval;meta data;online front-ends;semantic Web;standards","Dublin Core 2003 Conference Proceedings;Dublin Core Metadata recommendations;Information Science information retrieval technique;RDF Schema;Resource Description Framework;Web-delivered content;controlled vocabularies;faceted browsing;faceted metadata retrieval interface;faceted navigation;innovative knowledge organization techniques;instance metadata;metadata-based navigation;ontologies;semantic Web standards;semistructured data collection","","0","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In twenty contextual interviews in home and workplace settings, we investigated how people encounter and save published material in the form of paper and electronic clippings. We found that sharing forms a significant use for, encountered materials. Furthermore, the function of these clippings extends far beyond a simple exchange of content to inform the recipient; in fact, the content itself may have little immediate value to the recipient. We also found the practice to be ubiquitous: all of our participants had both shared clippings with others and received them themselves. Specifically, This work reports on: (1) how sharing encountered items fits into the broader spectrum of clipping practices; (2) the function and value of the shared information; and (3) the social role of sharing the encountered information. We conclude that from a technological standpoint, we should think beyond an email model for sharing encountered information and, from a social perspective, we should attend to how sharing this sort of material contributes to the strength of social ties outside of a traditional information needs framework.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336125","","Collaborative work;Computer interfaces;Consumer electronics;Documentation;Employment;Human factors;Information retrieval;Marketing management;Software libraries;User interfaces","digital libraries;electronic publishing;information retrieval;online front-ends;user interfaces","collaboration;digital library;electronic clippings;electronic periodicals;email model;encountered information;information needs;information sharing;user interface","","2","2","23","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work addresses the impact of resource selection (data source and capability) in the data collection process as it may affect significantly the quality and completeness of the data. We present preliminary research that demonstrates that the data collection process depends on two orthogonal variables: the data sources involved in the process, and the selection of capabilities available at these resources.

The experimental results show that the critical errors are minimized and the method is robust to capturing and encoding parameters of MP3 and AAC bit streams. Due to the efficiency obtained from fuzzy-region modeling and improved accuracy via rule-based semantic approach, the method is designed specifically for the audio-based multimedia indexing and retrieval systems.","","POD:0-7803-8379-6","10.1109/ISCCSP.2004.1296516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296516","","Audio coding;Background noise;Content based retrieval;Design methodology;Digital audio players;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Speech;Streaming media","audio coding;data compression;fuzzy set theory;signal classification","AAC audio;advanced audio coding;audio multimedia indexing;fuzzy approach;fuzzy region modeling;retrieval systems","","1","5","5","","","21-24 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our comparison shows that, the performance under the optimal scheduling is sensitive to the outage probability P<sub>out</sub> of sensors in a given region. If P<sub>out</sub> is large than the threshold, the performance of scheduling suffers from missing data samples, and simple random access outperforms optimal scheduling.","","POD:0-7803-8379-6","10.1109/ISCCSP.2004.1296259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1296259","","Computer networks;Gaussian processes;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Media Access Protocol;Military computing;Optimal scheduling;Performance loss","Gaussian processes;Markov processes;information retrieval;large-scale systems;mobile radio;scheduling;wireless sensor networks","Gauss Markov field reconstruction;Poisson field;data retrieval strategies;large-scale sensor network;scheduling","","1","","9","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many previous methods for this purpose defined functions on concentric spheres as approximation of 3D geometry for spherical harmonic transform (SHT). In this paper, we point out that this is not robust as the surface of a model may shift between different shells under perturbation, and multi-layer of surfaces may exist in one shell, making the function definition ambiguous. To solve these problems, we propose a method to characterize 3D shape using delta functions. Then, spherical functions are defined by sampling in the frequency domain of the delta functions for SHT. By doing so, our method can support retrieval with controllable acuity, which benefits wider range of applications and facilitates customization to different users. Experiments have shown that our method is more robust than previous approaches.","1550-4085;15504085","POD:0-7695-2234-3","10.1109/PCCGA.2004.1348328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1348328","","Application software;Biological system modeling;Frequency domain analysis;Geometry;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Robustness;Shape;Solid modeling;Spatial databases","computational geometry;harmonic analysis;image retrieval;transforms","3D geometry;concentric spheres;delta functions;robust method;shape-based 3D model retrieval;spherical functions;spherical harmonic transform","","2","","18","","","6-8 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The capability of discriminating images based on 9D-SPA representation is much more powerful than any spatial representation method based on minimum bounding rectangles or centroids of objects. The similarity measures using 9D-SPA representation provide a wide range of fuzzy matching capability in similarity retrieval to meet different user's requirements. Experimental results showed that our system is very effective in terms of recall and precision. In addition, the 9D-SPA representation can be incorporated into a two-level index structure to help reduce the search space of each query processing. The experimental results also demonstrated that, on average, only 0.1254 percent ∼ 1.6829 percent of symbolic pictures (depending on various degrees of similarity) were accessed per query in an image database containing 50,000 symbolic pictures.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1350760","65;D-SPA;Index Terms- Image database;similarity retrieval;spatial relations;visualization.","Content based retrieval;Deductive databases;Image coding;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Query processing;Visualization","content-based retrieval;data visualisation;image retrieval;knowledge representation;spatial reasoning;visual databases","9direction spanning area representation;content-based image retrieval system;data visualization;encoding;iconic indexing;image database;query processing;similarity retrieval;spatial reasoning;spatial relations","","17","","29","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The Variations2 Indiana University Digital Music Library is a large test-bed project funded in part by Phase 2 of the Digital Libraries Initiative, with support from the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities. This demonstration shows the current state of the Variations2 test-bed software, focusing on the search user interface. Libraries of digitized multimedia content provide access to virtual entities. In the case of music, where there may be many performances and arrangements of a given work, newer metadata models that are less item-centric or book-centric promise superior search capabilities for digital library users. The Variations2 metadata model is one such model. Like the functional requirements for bibliographic records (FRBR) from the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) our model is work-centric. Moreover, we have implemented a digital music library system based on that metadata model. One benefit of the Variations2 search user interface is the use of music-specific search fields such as key or performer. A second benefit is the ability to navigate directly to the desired work within a multiwork item. A third benefit is the introduction of stepwise disambiguation of the user's search criteria. The disambiguation process varies depending both on what fields the user fills in and the actual content of the digital library. Thus our implementation demonstrates some of the benefits of a work-centric, music-specific metadata model.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336226","","Data models;Databases;Human factors;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Navigation;Software libraries;Software testing;User interfaces","authoring systems;cataloguing;content management;digital libraries;information retrieval;meta data;multimedia computing;music;user interfaces","Variations2 test-bed software;bibliographic records;cataloging;digital music library;digitized multimedia content;search user interface;virtual entities;work-centric metadata","","0","1","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the experiments, the pre-process of image retrieval is on nearly 60,000 images from the Corel database, and the experimental results of IR4IR clearly show the advantage of the new methods for its application.","","POD:0-7803-8292-7","10.1109/ISSPIT.2003.1341114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1341114","","Art;Content based retrieval;Engines;Explosives;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Pixel;Visual databases","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval;visual databases","Corel database;colour features;content-based image retrieval system;image remodeling technique;least-significant-bit;pixel colour channels","","0","","8","","","14-17 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A central notion that helps resolve these issues is to facilitate global reach of digital technology to sources of valuable heritage.

(1989). The model was parameterized using field data collected for nine forest types, which were selected through combined analysis of 1 : 4000 aerial photographs and light detection and ranging data. The simulated SAR backscatter data demonstrated a good correspondence at most frequencies and polarizations with Airborne SAR data. Analysis of scattering mechanisms revealed dominance of C-band horizontal-vertical (HV) volume scattering and increases with small-branch/foliage biomass, dominance of L- and P-band HH trunk-ground scattering and increases with trunk biomass, and dominance of L-band HV volume (branch) scattering and increases with large-branch biomass. The study concluded that above-ground biomass estimated using empirical relationships with selected SAR channels will be more reliable for forests of similar structural form due to dominance of microwave interaction with particular biomass components and the strength and consistency of relationships between these and the affiliated components that represent the total. In mixed-species forests, retrieval will be compromised by interaction with a greater diversity of structures and variability in relationships between structural components. Although empirical relationships with selected combinations of channels (e.g., L-band HH/HV) might allow retrieval of component and total biomass of forests containing trees of similar form (e.g., as mapped using Landsat sensor data), the use of SAR inversion models was considered a more appropriate route for retrieving the biomass of forests containing a mix of structural forms.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.834633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1344166","Forestry;radar;scattering;simulation","Australia;Backscatter;Biomass;Frequency;Information retrieval;L-band;Light scattering;Optical polarization;Radar scattering;Synthetic aperture radar","airborne radar;backscatter;forestry;optical radar;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","Australia;C-band horizontal-vertical volume scattering;L-band HH trunk-ground scattering;LIDAR data;Landsat sensor data;P-band HH trunk-ground scattering;SAR channels;SAR inversion models;above-ground biomass retrieval;aerial photographs;airborne SAR data;biomass components;branch biomass;branch scattering;foliage biomass;light detection and ranging;microwave interaction;microwave scattering;mixed-species forests;polarizations;scattering mechanisms;simulated SAR backscatter data;small-branch biomass;structural components;structure diversity;subtropical Queensland;synthetic aperture radar;trunk biomass;wave scattering model;woodlands","","42","","36","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we show how the availability of a semantic similarity evaluation engine can be used to enhance several functionalities of Web-based applications. In particular we show how such an infrastructure can be used to detect and suggest new relation instances, as well as propose an inferred ordering for the presentation of related information that reflects the semantic closeness of the corresponding information.

We have extended the page-turning algorithm we reported at last year's JCDL into a scaleable, systematic approach that allows users to view and interact with realistic visualizations of any textual-based document in a Greenstone collection. Here, we further motivate the approach, illustrate the system in use, discuss the system architecture and present a user evaluation. Our work leads us to believe that far from being a whimsical gimmick, physical book models can usefully complement conventional document viewers and increase the perceived value of a digital library system.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336103","","Algorithm design and analysis;Books;Computer science;Electronic publishing;Human factors;Information retrieval;Java;Software libraries;Typesetting;Visualization","Java;data visualisation;digital libraries;document handling;electronic publishing;information retrieval;meta data","Greenstone collection;bizarre homage;digital library document;electronic book;information seeking process;page-turning algorithm;system architecture;textual-based document","","2","6","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, two kinds of correlation filters, minimum average correlation energy (MACE) and extended maximum average correlation height (EMACH), are applied as adaptive shift locators to detect and locate smudgy character strings in complex tabular color flight coupon images. These strings in irregular tabular coupon are computer-printed characters but of low contrast and could be shifted out of the table so that we cannot detect and locate them using traditional algorithms. In our experiment, strings are extracted in the preprocessing phase by removing background and then based on geometric information, two correlation filters are applied to locate expected fields. We compare results from two correlation filters and demonstrate that this algorithm is a high accurate approach.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1343850","65;Index Terms- Document analysis;correlation theory.;graphics recognition;pattern analysis","Adaptive filters;Data mining;Graphics;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Object detection;Pattern analysis;Principal component analysis;Printing","computational geometry;computer graphics;correlation theory;document image processing;filtering theory;image colour analysis;object detection","adaptive shift locators;complex table environment;computer printed characters;correlation filters;extended maximum average correlation height;geometric information;irregular tabular coupon;low contrast character strings;minimum average correlation energy;object detection;smudgy character strings;tabular color flight coupon images","","7","1","24","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Meta-search engines help a bit by having a better coverage of the WWW. However, users are still overwhelmed by the large amount of irrelevant results returned by a search. A promising approach to tackle the problem is personalized search. Thus the problem of capturing users' personal information need and re-organizing the results has attracted a lot of attention. In this paper, we present a meta-search engine that extracts users' preference implicitly and provides immediate response by re-ranking the results. Re-ranking is done by using the Naive Bayesian classifier and the resemblance measure. Moreover, we show that the users' preference can be succinctly represented by a few keywords.","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-2209-2","10.1109/CMPSAC.2004.1342671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1342671","","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Data mining;Filtering;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Search engines;Web search;Web sites;World Wide Web","Bayes methods;Internet;information retrieval;search engines","Excalibur;Naive Bayesian classifier;Web search engines;World Wide Web;personalized meta search engine;user personal information","","2","7","8","","","28-30 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, available information systems offer very limited support for managing such data in an integrated fashion, and such integration is often based on geographic coordinates alone. Furthermore, such systems do not fully support image content management (e.g., photos of landscapes or living organisms), a requirement of many BIS end-users. In order to meet their needs, these users e.g., biologists, environmental experts - often have to alternate between distinct biodiversity and image information systems to combine information extracted from them. This cumbersome operational procedure is forced on users by lack of interoperability among these systems. This hampers the addition of new data sources, as well as cooperation among scientists. The approach provided in this project to meet these issues is based on taking advantage of advances in digital library (DL) innovations to integrate networked collections of heterogeneous data. It focuses on creating the basis for a biodiversity information system under the digital library perspective, combining new techniques of content-based image retrieval and database query processing mechanisms. This approach solves the problem of system switching, and provides users with a flexible platform from which to tailor a BIS to their needs.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336212","","Biodiversity;Content management;Data mining;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information systems;Management information systems;Organisms;Software libraries;Technological innovation","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;distributed databases;ecology;geographic information systems;image retrieval;visual databases","biodiversity information system;content-based image retrieval;database query processing mechanism;digital library innovation;ecological data;geographical feature;heterogeneous data;image content management;image information system","","0","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The statistical approach overcomes the limitations of the dictionary based approach. The statistical approach is developed by utilizing the statistical information about the association of adjacent characters in Chinese text collected from the Chinese corpus. Both known words and unknown words can be segmented by the statistical approach. However, errors may occur due to the limitation of the corpus. In this work, we have conducted the error analysis of two Chinese text segmentation techniques using statistical approach, namely, boundary detection and heuristic method. Such error analysis is useful for the future development of the automatic text segmentation of Chinese text or other text in oriental languages. It is also helpful to understand the impact of these errors on the information retrieval system in digital libraries.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336133","","Content based retrieval;Dictionaries;Error analysis;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mutual information;Natural languages;Research and development management;Software libraries;Systems engineering and theory","computational linguistics;error analysis;indexing;information retrieval;natural languages;statistical analysis;text analysis","Chinese document indexing;Chinese information retrieval;Chinese text segmentation;boundary detection;digital libraries;error analysis;heuristic method;information retrieval system;statistical approach","","0","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, the query processing for XML documents can be flexible and reflect user??s mind in detail. However, such a query processing cannot catch the hidden semantics between resources, called by ??Metadata??. The search using metadata guarantees more fitting results for user??s various queries and can return the results based on resources. Therefore, the metadata will play an important role in the future and the standard model for representing metadata like RDF is needed. RDF is written as a XML serialization using XML-based syntax. The existing XML documents also can be converted to RDF document with some modification. Designing XML to be in the RDF format has numerous benefits. So, the representation of data using the RDF format is activated for the next generation of Web. In this paper, we propose the strategy for the transition from existing XML documents into RDF. Then, we introduce the method for storing RDF using a resource, a Property, a Value, and a Class table in relational database.","","POD:89-5519-119-7","10.1109/ICACT.2004.1293023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1293023","Metadata;Storage Structure;XML to RDF","Computer science education;Data engineering;Educational institutions;HTML;Information retrieval;Query processing;Relational databases;Resource description framework;Robots;XML","","","","0","1","7","","","9-11 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aP-tree requires only small modifications to the popular multiversion structural framework and, thus, can be implemented and applied easily in practice. We also present models that accurately predict the space consumption and query cost of the aP-tree and are therefore suitable for query optimization. Extensive experiments confirm that the proposed methods are efficient and practical.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1350765","65;Index Terms- Database;aggregation.;range queries;spatial database","Aggregates;Concrete;Cost function;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Multidimensional systems;Query processing;Spatial databases;Spatial indexes;Vehicles","query processing;visual databases","aggregate Point-tree;query optimization;range aggregate query processing;spatial database;spatial index","","24","","41","","","Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
