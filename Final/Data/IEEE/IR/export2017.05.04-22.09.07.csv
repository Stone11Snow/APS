Through hypertext transfer protocol connection module this method firstly realizes the function of acquiring all content in the web pages, and then uses regular expression technology to mark all sensitive information in every single web page. With the marked pages the method then uses the analysis function to judge whether the page belongs to the illegal pages and via the database management module stores the results of the analysis. Finally the method through visual display technology reveals the analysis results. Experiments show that this method based on information extraction technology can quickly and effectively find the sensitive information network has been released to help managers promote the efficiency of website maintenance.","","CD:978-1-4673-8513-8; Electronic:978-1-4673-8515-2; POD:978-1-4673-8516-9; Paper:978-1-4673-8514-5","10.1109/CCI.2016.7778921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778921","classified information system;information extraction;web technology","Data mining;Databases;HTML;Ontologies;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;database management systems;hypermedia;information retrieval;transport protocols","Web information extraction;Web pages;Web site maintenance;classified network;database management module;hypertext transfer protocol connection module;regular expression technology;sensitive information extraction;sensitive information network;visual display technology","","","","","","","13-15 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient Indexing of Billion-Scale Datasets of Deep Descriptors","A. B. Yandex; V.

SIFT-like descriptors, however, are quickly being replaced with descriptors based on deep neural networks (DNN) that provide better performance for many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new dataset of one billion descriptors based on DNNs and reveal the relative inefficiency of IMI-based indexing for such descriptors compared to SIFT data. We then introduce two new indexing structures, the Non-Orthogonal Inverted Multi-Index (NO-IMI) and the Generalized Non-Orthogonal Inverted Multi-Index (GNO-IMI). We show that due to additional flexibility, the new structures are able to adapt to DNN descriptor distribution in a better way. In particular, extensive experiments on the new dataset demonstrate that these data structures provide considerably better trade-off between the speed of retrieval and recall, given similar amount of memory, as compared to the standard Inverted Multi-Index.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.226","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780595","","Computer vision;Correlation;Indexing;Vector quantization","data structures;indexing;information retrieval;neural nets;transforms","DNN descriptor distribution;GNO-IMI;SIFT vectors;SIFT-like descriptors;billion-scale datasets;billion-scale nearest neighbor search systems;computer vision tasks;data structures;deep descriptors;deep neural networks;generalized nonorthogonal inverted multiindex;indexing structures;inverted multiindex","","","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach does not explicitly represent high-level semantic concepts, but rather seeks to progress directly from image features to text. In this paper we investigate whether this direct approach succeeds due to, or despite, the fact that it avoids the explicit representation of high-level information. We propose a method of incorporating high-level concepts into the successful CNN-RNN approach, and show that it achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art in both image captioning and visual question answering. We also show that the same mechanism can be used to introduce external semantic information and that doing so further improves performance.

"Yin and Yang: Balancing and Answering Binary Visual Questions","P. Zhang; Y. Goyal; D. Summers-Stay; D. Batra; D. Parikh","","2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)","20161212","2016","","","5014","5022","The complex compositional structure of language makes problems at the intersection of vision and language challenging. But language also provides a strong prior that can result in good superficial performance, without the underlying models truly understanding the visual content. This can hinder progress in pushing state of art in the computer vision aspects of multi-modal AI. In this paper, we address binary Visual Question Answering (VQA) on abstract scenes. We formulate this problem as visual verification of concepts inquired in the questions. Specifically, we convert the question to a tuple that concisely summarizes the visual concept to be detected in the image. If the concept can be found in the image, the answer to the question is ""yes"", and otherwise ""no"". Abstract scenes play two roles (1) They allow us to focus on the highlevel semantics of the VQA task as opposed to the low-level recognition problems, and perhaps more importantly, (2) They provide us the modality to balance the dataset such that language priors are controlled, and the role of vision is essential. In particular, we collect fine-grained pairs of scenes for every question, such that the answer to the question is ""yes"" for one scene, and ""no"" for the other for the exact same question. Indeed, language priors alone do not perform better than chance on our balanced dataset. Moreover, our proposed approach matches the performance of a state-of-the-art VQA approach on the unbalanced dataset, and outperforms it on the balanced dataset.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780911","","Cognition;Image color analysis;Knowledge discovery;Libraries;Natural languages;Semantics;Visualization","computer vision;image retrieval;question answering (information retrieval)","VQA;abstract scenes;binary visual question answering;binary visual questions;compositional language structure;computer vision aspects;low-level recognition problems;multimodal AI;visual content","","","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Case for Software Specific Natural Language Techniques","D. Binkley; D. Lawrie","Loyola Univ.

Initial results have been quite positive. For example, when applied to problems such as feature location or re-establishing traceability links, IR techniques work well on their own, and often even better in combination with more traditional source code analysis techniques such as static and dynamic analysis. However, recently there has been growing awareness among SE researchers that IR tools and techniques are designed to work under a different set of assumptions than those that hold for a software system. Thus it may be beneficial to consider IR inspired tools and techniques that are specifically designed to work with software. One aim of this work is to provide quantitative empirical evidence in support of this observation. To do so a new technique is introduced that captures the level of difficulty found in an information need, the true, often latent, information that a searcher desires to know. The new technique is used to compare two test collections: the natural language TREC 8 collection and the software engineering JabRef collection. Analysis of the data leads to three significant findings. First, the variation in difficulty of the SE information needs is much larger than that of the natural language information needs, second, the most challenging of the SE information needs is far easier than the least challenging of the natural language information needs, and finally, variations of the queries used to uncover a latent information need have far less impact in the natural language collection than in the software engineering collection.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3848-0; POD:978-1-5090-3849-7","10.1109/SCAM.2016.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7781812","Information need;corpus quality","Complexity theory;Natural languages;Search engines;Software;Software engineering;Vocabulary","data analysis;information retrieval;natural language processing;program diagnostics;software engineering","IR techniques;JabRef collection;data analysis;dynamic analysis;information retrieval;natural language TREC 8 collection;software engineering;software specific natural language techniques;source code analysis techniques;static analysis","","","","","","","2-3 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users search for recipes for their meals from the recipe sites. However, when they search for a recipe using an ingredient name, numerous similar pages which are coincidentally similar or which have been plagiarized are found for them. Moreover, a user who searches for a recipe usually does not select a high-ranking recipe from the search results, reacting better than one might with usual web searches. Given many similar recipes included in the search results, it appears to be difficult for them to compare multiple recipes. Actually, when users compare similar recipes, they must better understand the different points of similar recipes. That need for comparison imposes a great burden on users. Therefore, a system classifying the results of user searches according to similar pages in real time would be beneficial for users. In this paper, we propose a clustering method for user-generated recipe sites based on page structure and main ingredient and main seasoning of the food. It provides a means of classifying the user search results according to similar pages. We conducted an experiment to measure the benefits of our proposed method. The experiment results presents the benefits of our proposed method, which classifies similar recipes based on the main ingredients and main seasonings.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0979-4; POD:978-1-5090-0980-0","10.1109/NBiS.2016.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789780","Recipe Clustering User-generated recipe site","Clustering methods;Data mining;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Information systems;Real-time systems;Web search","Web sites;humanities;information retrieval;pattern classification;pattern clustering","Web search;page structure;recipe search;search results classification;similar recipes clustering;user-generated recipe sites","","","","","","","7-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This procedure will be used for estimating the performance of widely used classification algorithms, whose performance has been ascertained in many real-world problems with respect to well-known classification benchmarks, both in terms of number of selected features and classification accuracy. Moreover, the technique herein described will provide a useful tool in the context of medical diagnosis.

The system parses the question and estimates an initial viewpoint that is likely to contain information for answering the question based on prior environment knowledge. Then, it autonomously navigates towards the viewpoint while dynamically adapting to changes and new information. The output of the system is an image of the most relevant part of the environment that allows the user to obtain an answer to their question.

Priming a recurrent neural network with this combined information, and the submitted question, leads to a very flexible visual question answering approach.

Although, such diseases can be caused by multi-loci interactions, locus-by-locus studies are prevailing. Recently, two-loci analysis has been shown promising (Marchini et al, 2005), and multi-loci analysis is expected to find even deeper disease-associated interactions. Unfortunately, an exhaustive search among all possible corresponding multi-markers can be unfeasible even for small number of SNPs let alone the complete genome. In this paper we first propose to extract informative (indexing) SNPs that can be used for reconstructing of all SNPs almost without loss (He and Zelikovsky, 2006). In the reduced set of SNPs, we then propose to apply a novel combinatorial method for finding disease-associated multi-SNP combinations (MSCs).

Their success relies predominantly on two aspects of the feedback generated by their members: quality and speed. Of these, the former reflects on the reputation of the community, whilst the latter is indicative of the efficiency of the Q&A system to correctly answer a given question. In this paper, we present a three phase study for identifying and recommending topical experts in Q&A communities. The first phase investigates the most relevant criteria for identifying reputable members of the community (often experts in a given field), the second phase introduces an approach based on semantic annotations to ascertain their area of specialism, and the last phase presents a method to recommend experts to answer questions in their areas of expertise. Our evaluation (carried out using real-world data from the Biology Stack Exchange Q&A community) shows that the numbers of answers provided by each member can be used as reliable indicators of expertise, and semantic annotations can be successfully used to identify the topics in which they specialize. Furthermore, on average, 74% of the recommendations suggested by our method were successful.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9041-5; POD:978-1-4673-9042-2","10.1109/ICALT.2016.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757009","Q&A communities;semantic annotations;topical experts;user reputation","Biology;Collaboration;Correlation;Informatics;Natural language processing;Reliability;Semantics","question answering (information retrieval)","information exchange;knowledge creation;question and answer communities;semantic annotations;topical experts","","","","","","","25-28 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A potential collision graph (PCG) is constructed to represent the tubes and their potential collision relationship. Based on the PCG, tube rearrangement is achieved by filling the tubes into synopsis video in a deterministic way, which decreases computational complexity.

This paper proposes to generate a multilingual base of skills in a novel bottom-up approach that finds its roots from the terminology used by candidates in professional social networks. The knowledge base is built by leveraging the Linked Open Data project DBpedia, as well as the tags of a Q&A website, StackOverflow. The large-scale experiments on real-world job offers show that the coverage and precision of the skills extraction are higher using this base than existing bases.

We propose and validate the approach of collecting and analyzing sleep logs that are generated and shared through a sleep-tracking mobile application. We highlight the value of this data by combining it with users' social media data. The results provide a validation of using social media for sleep studies as the collected sleep data is aligned with sleep data from other sources.

Furthermore, the task must often be performed repeatedly throughout early phases of the project. In this paper we first explore the effort needed to manually build a high-level domain model capturing the functional components. We then present MaRK (Mining Requirements Knowledge), which identifies and retrieves the documents containing descriptions of functional components in the domain model. Domain analysts can use this information to to specify requirements. We introduce and evaluate an algorithm which ranks domain documents according to their relevance to a component and then highlights sections of text which are likely to contain requirements-related information.

The goal of this study is to automatically quantify the characteristics of roads for demands that can be described using keywords such as “fashionable”. To achieve this goal, we propose a two-stage method that analyzes social media and road networks. First, our method estimates the topic distribution (i.e., the characteristics) of each point-of-interest (POI) by analyzing geotagged texts with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model. Next, it uses a Markov random field model to estimate the characteristics of each road on the basis of those of POIs and the road networks associated with the POIs. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that our method achieves statistically significant improvements over baseline methods in terms of ranking quality in the information retrieval for roads in three areas given 25 keywords.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2846-7; POD:978-1-5090-2847-4; USB:978-1-5090-2845-0","10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7752270","","Automobiles;Bicycles;Legged locomotion;Navigation;Resource management;Roads;Social network services","Markov processes;information retrieval;social networking (online);text analysis;traffic information systems","Markov random field model;POI;geo-tagged texts;information retrieval;latent Dirichlet allocation model;point-of-interest;road characteristics;road networks;route determination;social media analysis;topic distribution;two-stage method","","","","","","","18-21 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This proposed system was designed by extending our previous analysis approach, correlation-based information hierarchical structuring method (CIHSM), to correspond with user's demand. Previous version of CIHSM could extract features of NDSs using association rule mining and visually present result of analyses as a hierarchical tree in which each node consists of a subgroup of NDSs. However, this version was not necessarily to extract the feature required by user in the case of weak trend. If it tried to extract every association rule even though their correlation degrees are very weak, the number of the derived association rules is so large that previous CIHSM cannot manage these. Therefore, this paper presents a modified CIHSM corresponding to on-demand requests. In this on-demand CIHSM, users provide their demands in advance. And on-demand CIHSM tries to extract as many as possible association rules and eliminate every association rule not relevant to user's demand. This on-demand CIHSM only provides detailed information consistent with user's demand.

To simplify the authentication procedure and reduce the need to manage multiple credentials to access services, electronic identification (eID) schemes have been introduced that involve many service providers (SPs) and identity providers (IDPs) which verify the identity of users and facilitate the user to authenticate him/herself to SPs. In federated eID schemes, IDPs store identifiable user information (attributes), often with a unique ID, and attest on these attributes to SPs. In this work, we address the privacy concerns of storing user attributes at the IDP which allows the IDP to profile the user's behaviour and activities. We propose to store the attributes in a privacy friendly manner so that they cannot be directly linked to a particular user even if the data is leaked. Then we incorporate private information retrieval (PIR) in the usual authentication flow of federated eID scheme so that the IDP can perform its role of authenticating and managing the user's identity without turning into a privacy hotspot. Finally, through a proof-of-concept implementation we show a practical variant of our scheme in which the IDP, with millions of users, partitions its database.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2914-3; POD:978-1-5090-2915-0","10.1109/NTMS.2016.7792448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792448","","Authentication;Cryptography;Databases;Privacy;Protocols;Servers","Web services;data privacy;information retrieval;private key cryptography","IDPs;Internet services;PIR;SPs;authentication procedure;electronic identification;face-to-face interactions;federated eID schemes;homomorphic encryption;identifiable user information;identity providers;private information retrieval;service providers;user activities;user behaviour;user identification;user privacy","","","","","","","21-23 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of them store knowledge in a non-structured or semi-structured way, hindering the semantic and automatic processing of this knowledge. In this paper we present a summary of an case-based organizational memory ontology, which aims at contributing to the design of an organizational memory based on cases, so that it can be used to learn, reasoning, solve problems, and as support to better decision making as well. The objective of this Organizational Memory is to serve as base for the organizational knowledge exchange in a processing architecture specialized in the measurement and evaluation. One key aspect associated with the measurement process is that the measures must be consistent and comparable in any moment for making decisions properly. In this way, the processing architecture is based on the C-INCAMI framework (Context-Information Need, Concept model, Attribute, Metric and Indicator) to define the measurement projects. Additionally, the proposal architecture uses a big data repository to make available the data for consumption and to manage the Organizational Memory, which allows a feedback mechanism in relation with online processing. The relation between the data stream processing, the big data repository and the Organizational Memory will be shown. In order to illustrate its utility a practical case associated with the weather radar (WR) of the Experimental Agricultural Station (EAS) INTA Anguil (La Pampa State, Argentina) is shown.

Previous works have established a loose, global association between QA sentences and images. However, many questions and answers, in practice, relate to local regions in the images. We establish a semantic link between textual descriptions and image regions by object-level grounding.

To solve this problem, high-quality answer prediction or best answer prediction has been one of important topics in social media. These user-generated answers often consist of multiple “views”, each capturing different (albeit related) information (e.g., expertise of the asker, length of the answer, etc.). Such views interact with each other in complex manners that should carry a lot of information for distinguishing a potential best answer from others. Little existing work has exploited such interactions for better prediction. To explicitly model these information, we propose a new learning-to-rank method, ranking support vector machine (RankSVM) with weakly hierarchical lasso in this paper.

Software organizations often use bug tracking systems to manage bug reports collected from developers and users. In order for software developers to understand and reproduce configuration bugs, it is vital for them to know whether a bug in the bug report is related to configuration issues, this is not often easily discerned due to a lack of easy to spot terminology in the bug reports. In addition, to locate and fix a configuration bug, a developer needs to know which configuration options are associated with the bug. To address these two problems, we introduce CoLUA, a two-step automated approach that combines natural language processing, information retrieval, and machine learning. In the first step, CoLUA selects features from the textual information in the bug reports, and uses various machine learning techniques to build classification models, developers can use these models to label a bug report as either a configuration bug report or a non-configuration bug report.

Despite its importance, many junior developers lack sufficient testing education and expertise. When faced with a task they are unfamiliar with, developers often use online resources to find code for adaptation or reference. Code search engines and repository mining tools have been created to assist developers, particularly less experienced ones, with finding solutions to common coding problems. However, many of these search engines lack the capability to facilitate test case searches. This has prevented developers from taking advantage of the massive analytical knowledge embodied in test cases written by other developers. In this paper we introduce TestEX, a web-based test case search engine designed to make finding useful test cases easier for developers. The strength of TestEX is the combination of three unique strategies for providing developers with useful and relevant test cases: (i) test-case identification within source code, (ii) test case categorization, and (iii) semantic mapping to the concern being searched via TestEX. Through the paper we present TestEX's Architecture, features and potential use cases. Furthermore, we report a study which was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our test case search engine.

Learning Object metadata are lack of interactivity and address operational deficiencies. Though, a content-structure and systematic approach needs to be established. A promising method to employ learning object metadata adaptation is to use semantic Web technologies. Expressing semantics in Learning material can heal interoperability issues and improve information retrieval by providing knowledge representation inherent in xml syntax and applying inference rules.

Then, distractors of a question are retrieved by considering all words having the same category with the answer to be distractors. Finally, all generated question phrases and distractors are scored by linear regression models and then ranked to get the most acceptable question phrases and distractors.

Every day, a tremendous number of comments and reviews towards different aspects of our lives is generated through social networks and other websites. A large portion of these data is written in Arabic which is the fifth most used language on internet and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. However, the templatic morphology of Arabic language makes it a difficult language in the fields of information retrieval. In light of the scarcity of Arabic opinion mining systems, this paper introduces a complete approach to prepare, model and classify Arabic comments and reviews.

In this work, we designed and implemented a framework to train deep neural networks using Spark, fast and general data flow engine for large scale data processing. The design is similar to Google software framework called DistBelief which can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large scale deep networks.

Consequently, many of these initiatives have failed to deliver the benefits expected for e-commerce companies. Therefore, it is now important to revisit the literature in order to understand the process of implementation by exploring the relevant factors for each phase of B2C e-commerce implementation. To locate papers that represent the topic adequately, full-text papers in ABI/INFORM, Elsevier, Emerald and ScieneDirect search archives published between 2006 and 2015 were selected. The keywords employed in the academic search were limited in extent to the title and body text search by selecting keywords, namely, 1) e-commerce implementation and 2) B2C e-commerce implementation. Based on a content analysis of the reviewed literature, this paper has identified 19 (nineteen) factors that contribute to the implementation process of B2C e-commerce systems. All these factors were then mapped into the implementation process which corresponding phases in Kotter's model that were guided by academic literature and organizational success stories (i.e., four case studies that were most relevant to the research context were reviewed). A conceptual framework is then proposed, which contributes to the theoretical understanding of B2C e-commerce implementation process studies.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2549-7; POD:978-1-5090-2550-3; USB:978-1-5090-5144-1","10.1109/ICCOINS.2016.7783182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7783182","Business-to-Customer (B2C);Content analysis;Implementation process;Kotter's model;Lewin's model","Adaptation models;Companies;Computers;Electronic commerce;Information systems","electronic commerce;information retrieval;organisational aspects;text analysis","ABI/INFORM archives;B2C e-commerce;Elsevier archives;Emerald archives;Kotter's model;ScieneDirect search archives;academic search;body text search;business-to-customer electronic commerce;content analysis;e-commerce companies;keyword selection;organizational success stories;plug and play exercise;title search","","","","","","","15-17 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Twitter is chosen in this study because of its update intensity about traffic congestion that is higher than those of other social networks. Bekasi City is chosen for this case study because it has sufficient potential of data source from Twitter. Data processing from the social network needs information network approach such as performing information extraction and classification. The classification is performed to distinguish between the data which are related and not related to the traffic condition using SVM (Support Vector Machine). The information extraction is performed to obtain valuable information, including location, traffic condition, congestion causes, weather condition, and time of occurrence. The experiment that has been performed shows that the information extraction and classification method that is used gives a good result and better from previous study, which is 86% for classification, 81% for traffic location, 78% for congestion causes, 96% for weather condition, and 98-100% for time of occurrence extraction.

Compared with the traditional RNN language model, LSTM is better in analyzing emotion of long sentences. And as a language model, LSTM is applied to achieve multi-classification for text emotional attributes.

Research in archival system has focused very little on dynamic data replication to serve availability, but has instead been directed more at improving system availability through static replications. We propose an archival system, which automatically avoids unnecessary replicas and also places them to a read intensive node dynamically, instead of previously defined static locations. Traditionally, same security mechanism is used to secure all archival data objects. Our designed archival system applies different security levels for different data objects depending on their sensitivity and also varies the security level accordingly as sensitivity of the data objects varies from time to time. We have reduced the operational load by using light weight cryptographic algorithm and there is a tremendous change in the speed of data object retrieval. We have designed a periodical re-encryption mechanism to highly sensitive data objects which provides security against slow attack. Research in the recent past has comparatively focused very little on using survivability of a node to distribute the right information but has instead been directed more to estimate the life time of the data being stored. We have designed a system which dynamically places the right information in the right node.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1022-6; POD:978-1-5090-1023-3; Paper:978-1-5090-1020-2; USB:978-1-5090-1021-9","10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779435","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7779435","","Cryptography;Lead;Reliability;Sensitivity","cryptography;information retrieval systems","archival data object sensitivity;archival system;data object retrieval;dynamic data replication;dynamically balanced security;highly sensitive data objects;light weight cryptographic algorithm;periodical re-encryption;security level;static replications;system availability;system reliability","","","","","","","6-8 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such an information sharing essentially requires a data access control mechanism when the product data relate to sensitive business issues. However, existing access control solutions are ill-suited to the RFID-enabled supply chain, as they are not scalable in handling a huge number of tags, introduce vulnerability to the product data, and perform poorly to support privilege revocation of product data. We present a new scalable industry data access control system that addresses these limitations. Our system provides an item-level data access control mechanism that defines and enforces access policies based on both the participants' role attributes and the products' RFID tag attributes.

In order to achieve this, ICN is based on the paradigm of publish-subscribe and the concepts of naming and in-network caching. Current approaches to ICN employ caches within networks to minimize the latency of information retrieval. Content may be distributed either in caches along the delivery path(s), on-path caching or in any cache within a network, off-path caching. While approaches to off-path caching are comparable to traditional approaches for content replication and Web caching, approaches to on-path caching are specific to the ICN area. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the caching problem in ICN, with a focus on on-path caching. To this end, a detailed analysis of the existing caching policies and forwarding mechanisms that complement these policies is given. A number of criteria such as the caching model and level of operation and the evaluation parameters used in the evaluation of the existing caching policies are being employed to derive a taxonomy for on-path caching and highlight the trends and evaluation issues in this area.

Moreover, whether the features are sequential or static will dictate which classification method can be applied as most of the machine learning algorithms are designed to deal with either one or another type of data. In real-life scenarios, however, it is often the case that both static and dynamic features are present, or can be extracted from the data. In this work, we demonstrate how generative models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) artificial neural networks can be used to extract temporal information from the dynamic data. We explore how the extracted information can be combined with the static features in order to improve the classification performance. We evaluate the existing techniques and suggest a hybrid approach, which outperforms other methods on several public datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5206-6; POD:978-1-5090-5207-3","10.1109/DSAA.2016.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796887","Ensembles;Feature extraction;HMM;LSTM;Sequence classification","Brain modeling;Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Transforms","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","hidden Markov models;information extraction;long short-term memory artificial neural networks;machine learning algorithms;multivariate sequence classification method","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, retrieval technology of mass data is analyzed, finally a high-performance retrieval method of mass data based on Hadoop is proposed.

Answers and Stack Overflow provide a new way of asking and answering questions which are not well served by general web search engines. Due to the huge volume and ever-increasing number of questions, not all new questions can get fully answered in required time. Therefore, it is of great significance to design some effective strategies of recommending experts for new questions. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized recommendation method for routing new questions to a group of experts. Different from prior work which only considers the topic modeling or the link structure, we aim at recommending new questions to more appropriate experts by considering both of these two factors. Moreover, we design a new strategy of network construction with the personalization fully considered. The comparison experiments are conducted with Stack Overflow data and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the recommendation performance over other methods in expert recommendation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2846-7; POD:978-1-5090-2847-4; USB:978-1-5090-2845-0","10.1109/ASONAM.2016.7752346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7752346","CQA;Expert Recommendation;Network Construction;Topic Modeling","Algorithm design and analysis;History;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Routing;Social network services;Standards","Web sites;question answering (information retrieval);text analysis","CQA Web sites;Stack Overflow data;community question answering;link structure;network construction;personalized recommendation;topic modeling","","","","","","","18-21 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SANs use semantic representation of a question as query to search for the regions in an image that are related to the answer. We argue that image question answering (QA) often requires multiple steps of reasoning. Thus, we develop a multiple-layer SAN in which we query an image multiple times to infer the answer progressively. Experiments conducted on four image QA data sets demonstrate that the proposed SANs significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art approaches. The visualization of the attention layers illustrates the progress that the SAN locates the relevant visual clues that lead to the answer of the question layer-by-layer.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780379","","Bicycles;Cognition;Convolution;Dogs;Feature extraction;Logic gates;Semantics","image representation;image retrieval;natural language processing;question answering (information retrieval)","attention layers visualization;image question answering;multiple-layer SAN;natural language question answering;question semantic representation;stacked attention networks","","","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Image Question Answering Using Convolutional Neural Network with Dynamic Parameter Prediction","H. Noh; P. H. Seo; B. Han","Dept. of Comput.

For the adaptive parameter prediction, we employ a separate parameter prediction network, which consists of gated recurrent unit (GRU) taking a question as its input and a fully-connected layer generating a set of candidate weights as its output. However, it is challenging to construct a parameter prediction network for a large number of parameters in the fully-connected dynamic parameter layer of the CNN. We reduce the complexity of this problem by incorporating a hashing technique, where the candidate weights given by the parameter prediction network are selected using a predefined hash function to determine individual weights in the dynamic parameter layer. The proposed network-joint network with the CNN for ImageQA and the parameter prediction network-is trained end-to-end through back-propagation, where its weights are initialized using a pre-trained CNN and GRU. The proposed algorithm illustrates the state-of-the-art performance on all available public ImageQA benchmarks.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780380","","Computer vision;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Knowledge discovery;Logic gates;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms","backpropagation;image classification;image retrieval;neural net architecture;question answering (information retrieval)","CNN learning;GRU;adaptive parameter prediction;back-propagation;convolutional neural network learning;dynamic parameter layer;dynamic parameter prediction;fully-connected dynamic parameter layer;gated recurrent unit;hash function;hashing technique;image question answering;joint network;public ImageQA benchmark","","1","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper seeks to simultaneously exploit the representational capacity of deep networks and the compositional linguistic structure of questions. We describe a procedure for constructing and learning neural module networks, which compose collections of jointly-trained neural ""modules"" into deep networks for question answering. Our approach decomposes questions into their linguistic substructures, and uses these structures to dynamically instantiate modular networks (with reusable components for recognizing dogs, classifying colors, etc.). The resulting compound networks are jointly trained. We evaluate our approach on two challenging datasets for visual question answering, achieving state-of-the-art results on both the VQA natural image dataset and a new dataset of complex questions about abstract shapes.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8851-1; POD:978-1-4673-8852-8","10.1109/CVPR.2016.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780381","","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Dogs;Knowledge discovery;Neural networks;Semantics;Visualization","image representation;neural nets;question answering (information retrieval)","VQA natural image dataset;compositional linguistic structure;deep networks;neural module networks;representational capacity;visual question answering","","1","","","","","27-30 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even smaller communities recognize that their traditional ""best-practice solutions"" are no longer sufficient anymore. The project ""Large-Scale Data Management and Analysis (LSDMA)"" of the German Helmholtz Association supports their research centres since 2012 in analyzing their data. The activities include developments of community-specific solutions and provide, in addition, generic technologies for data management, data access, data security, data preservation. and data analysis. The talk gives an overview on selected activities and results of LSDMA. New Big Science projects are entering the scene putting the term ""large-scale data"" to a new level. The European XFEL will generate extremely intense flashes of X-rays for exploring the nano-world at unprecedented precision. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will consist of thousands of telescopes to be built in deserts of South Africa and Australia. The images taken from the Universe will be the sharpest of all astronomy. The talk will present the challenges of these projects seen from the IT's perspective. For example, even in the first phase with only 10% of the telescopes installed, SKA will produce data rates of the order of a few Zettabytes per year. Topics considered in the talk are new IT-concepts like ""taking computing to the data"", integrating cloud computing into a scientific work flow, secure data federation, developing long-term e-infrastructures for supporting multi-disciplinary science.","","CD:978-1-5090-0887-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-0888-9; POD:978-1-5090-0889-6","10.1109/UKSim.2016.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796678","","Africa;Arrays;Data analysis;Europe;Physics;Telescopes;X-rays","astronomical image processing;cloud computing;data analysis;information retrieval;security of data;telescopes","LSDMA;SKA;cloud computing;data access;data analysis;data preservation;data security;large-scale data management and analysis;square kilometre array;telescopes","","","","","","","6-8 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
