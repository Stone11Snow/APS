Today's retrieval methods are typically limited to keywords searches or sub-string matches, therefore, users may often miss critical information when searching the Web. After reviewing the real world semantic Web, additional research is needed on the geospatial semantic Web. We are rich in geospatial data but poor in up-to-date geospatial information and knowledge that are ready to be used by anyone who wants to use it. In this paper, we implement an approach for querying geospatial semantic by integrating spatial reasoning that contributes to the development of geospatial semantic Web. It is important to establish a geospatial semantics that support for effective spatial reasoning for performing geospatial semantic query. People are more understandable spatial relation (i.e. qualitative reasoning) through natural language instead of metric measurements (i.e. quantitative reasoning). Qualitative spatial reasoning is necessary because the common-sense reasoning which humans apply to spatial issues is generally qualitative. These include the use of qualitative modifiers, proxy place names to support effective spatial ontologies with a formal semantics; the representation of those semantics such that they are available to machines for processing and to people for understanding. Compared to earlier keyword-based and information retrieval techniques that rely on syntax, we use semantic approaches in our spatial queries. Semantic approaches needs the development of ontologies. We use ontology mapping because such complex semantic comparisons between domain values of different data sets cannot be done using a simple algorithm or a fully automatic method. To be efficient and effective querying, we integrate geospatial reasoning such as coordinate relationships, topological relationships, spatial inference and etc","","POD:4-88552-216-1","10.1109/APSITT.2005.203669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593476","geospatial;ontology;semantic;spatial reasoning;topological","Humans;Inference algorithms;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Natural languages;Ontologies;Semantic Web","common-sense reasoning;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;semantic Web;spatial reasoning","common-sense reasoning;coordinate relationships;formal semantics;geospatial reasoning;geospatial semantic Web;geospatial semantic query;information retrieval techniques;keywords searches;natural language;ontology mapping;proxy place names;qualitative modifiers;qualitative spatial reasoning;spatial inference;spatial ontologies;sub-string matches;topological relationships;up-to-date geospatial information","","1","","15","","","10-10 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for log-based relevance feedback that integrates the log of feedback data into the traditional relevance feedback schemes to learn effectively the correlation between low-level image features and high-level concepts. Given the error-prone nature of log data, we present a novel learning technique, named soft label support vector machine, to tackle the noisy data problem. Extensive experiments are designed and conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms based on the COREL image data set. The promising experimental results validate the effectiveness of our log-based relevance feedback scheme empirically.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.1599389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1599389","Content-based image retrieval;log data;log-based relevance feedback;relevance feedback;semantic gap;support vector machines.;user issues","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Frequency;History;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Multimedia databases;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback;support vector machines;visual databases","CBIR;COREL image data set;content-based image retrieval;history log;image features;learning technique;soft label support vector machine;unified log-based relevance feedback scheme","","87","","50","","","April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, due to the experimental nature of existing instruments and algorithms and a very limited reference database from actual experiments, potential users have not recognized the along-track InSAR as a readily available tool for current measurements until now. In order to promote the use of InSAR and to validate and demonstrate current measurements on the basis of instrument parameters and data processing techniques proposed earlier, the authors have carried out experiments with an airborne X-band along-track InSAR over spatially varying current fields at two test sites in the German Bight of the North Sea. In this paper, an overview of the experimental scenarios and the acquired data is given, and the newly implemented algorithms for the retrieval of two-dimensional (2-D) surface current fields from the InSAR raw data are described. Using acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data and predictions of a numerical circulation model as reference, a root mean square (rms) error of spatial variations in the InSAR-derived current fields on the order of 0.1 m/s at an effective resolution of about 100 m is obtained, which is consistent with theoretical expectations. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed iterative correction scheme for nonlinearities of the InSAR imaging mechanism on the basis of numerical simulations works well and leads to a significant improvement. Altogether, it is concluded that the proposed technique for current measurements by along-track InSAR is efficient, robust, and sufficiently mature for applications that require high-resolut- ion snapshots of surface current fields within areas of some square kilometers, such as the monitoring of bathymetric changes in coastal waters.","0364-9059;03649059","","10.1109/JOE.2005.857508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593803","Current measurements;interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR);remote sensing","Acoustic testing;Current measurement;Data processing;High-resolution imaging;Image databases;Information retrieval;Instruments;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry","oceanographic techniques;radiowave interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","German Bight;North Sea;X-band;airborne along-track InSAR;current measurements;interferometric synthetic aperture radar","","26","","15","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are three main data types in the Web: content (text, multimedia), structure (links that form a graph) and Web usage (transactions from Web logs). We emphasize the last type of data, in particular a new subfield called query mining. Server logs of search engines store traces of queries submitted by users, which include queries themselves along with Web pages selected in their answers. Query mining is based in the fact that user queries in search engines and Web sites give valuable information on the interests of people. In addition, clicks after queries relate those interests to actual content. The framework is based on a new vectorial representation of query traces which allows to treat them similarly to documents in traditional information retrieval systems. Also, we consider the problem of reducing the bias in the selections caused by the particular answer rankings computed by the search engine. We show the application of the clustering framework to two problems: relevance ranking boosting and query recommendation. Finally, we show with experiments the effectiveness of our approach.

The model is a special case of the, generally intractable, switching Kalman filter model.

Single sensor systems typically can use a single carrier frequency and a simple device embodiment because tagging is riot required. In a multisensor environment, it is necessary to both identify the sensor and retrieve the sensed information. This paper presents the concept of orthogonal frequency coding (OFC) for implications to SAW sensor technology. The OFC offers all advantages inherent to spread spectrum communications, including enhanced processing gain and lower interrogation power spectral density (PSD). It is shown that the time ambiguity in the OFC compressed pulse is significantly reduced as compared with a single frequency tag having the same code length, and additional coding can be added using a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence. The OFC approach is general and should be applicable to many differing SAW sensors for temperature, pressure, liquid, gases, etc. Device embodiments are shown, and a potential transceiver is described. Measured device results are presented and compared with coupling of modes (COM) model predictions to demonstrate performance. Devices then are used in computer simulations of the proposed transceiver design, and the results of an OFC sensor system are discussed.","0885-3010;08853010","","10.1109/TUFFC.2006.1593376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1593376","","Acoustic sensors;Acoustic waves;Frequency;Information retrieval;Sensor systems;Surface acoustic wave devices;Surface acoustic waves;Tagging;Temperature sensors;Transceivers","pseudonoise codes;sensor fusion;spread spectrum communication;surface acoustic waves","SAW tagging;coupling of modes model;multisensor environment;orthogonal frequency coding;power spectral density;pseudo-noise sequence;spread spectrum communications;surface acoustic wave","Computer-Aided Design;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Information Storage and Retrieval;Product Labeling;Radio Waves;Telecommunications;Telemetry","31","2","15","","","Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A minimum description length (MDL)-based Gaussian model is then proposed to statistically characterize the audio features. Audio segmentation segments the audio stream into a sequence of homogeneous subsegments using the MDL-based Gaussian model. A hierarchical threshold-based classifier is then used to classify each subsegment into different audio types. Finally, a heuristic method is adopted to smooth the subsegment sequence and provide the final segmentation and classification results. Experimental results indicate that for TDT-3 news broadcast, a missed detection rate (MDR) of 0.1 and a false alarm rate (FAR) of 0.14 were achieved for audio segmentation. Given the same MDR and FAR values, segment-based audio classification achieved a better classification accuracy of 88% compared to a clip-based approach.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.852988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1597267","Audio classification;audio segmentation;minimum description length;multiple change-points","Acoustic signal detection;Broadcasting;Decoding;Hidden Markov models;Information management;Information retrieval;Multimedia communication;Robust stability;Speech recognition;Streaming media","Gaussian processes;audio signal processing;signal classification","Gaussian model;audio classification;audio stream;false alarm rate;minimum description length;missed detection rate;multiple change-point audio segmentation;silence deletion procedure","","20","","26","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One reason for this is that there is a high degree of variance in medical reporting in such cases, masking statistical anomalies that might otherwise be apparent. In this article, we present an application that employs a novel two-level fusion architecture designed to contend with this problem. The lower-level fusion step detects and tracks the indication of an outbreak of some sort given a set of noisy patient records, based on an information retrieval technique called latent semantic analysis. The higher level fusion step then determines the type of outbreak, based on dynamic Bayesian networks that model cause-effect interrelationships among several sources of information such as terrorist activities, environment, diseases and symptoms. We have developed and demonstrated feasibility of the approach via simulated outbreak events provided by the BioWar simulation platform.","","POD:0-7803-9286-8","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1592014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592014","Biosurveillance;Data Fusion;Dynamic Bayesian Networks;Latent Semantic Analysis;Syndromic Surveillance","Bayesian methods;Discrete event simulation;Diseases;Influenza;Information resources;Information retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging;Rivers;Surveillance;Terrorism","belief networks;information retrieval;medical information systems;semantic networks;sensor fusion;surveillance","BioWar simulation platform;biosurveillance;data fusion approach;dynamic Bayesian network;feasibility;information retrieval technique;latent semantic analysis;medical reporting;outbreak event;patient records;two-level fusion architecture","","1","","15","","","25-28 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The normalization of radii lengths also makes the process invariant to scaling. To represent shapes with holes inside them the method is extended by considering a number of concentric circles centered at the centroid and computing radii histograms for the portion of the shape within each of the circles.

It is unified because it subsumes an array of disparate concepts, interfaces and protocols under a single semi-transparent umbrella. It is modular because it defines a small set of orthogonal multi-purpose communication primitives (building blocks) for discovery. These primitives cover service identification, service description retrieval, data publication as well as minimal and powerful query support. The architecture is open and flexible because each primitive can be used, implemented, customized and extended in many ways.

An important challenge is how to best utilize information from multiple instruments to further improve the quality of retrievals. In this study, we explored whether the accuracy of AOT retrievals could be improved by fusion of ground- and satellite-based data using neural network techniques. MISR and MODIS satellite data were obtained for several 16-day periods during 2002 and 2003 covering the continental USA. These data are joined spatially and temporally with AOT measurements from 34 AERONET ground-based stations over the continental USA. The R<sup>2</sup> accuracies of MODIS and MISR retrievals were estimated at 0.57 and 0.66, when AERONET AOT is used as the ground truth. When radiance and geometric attributes are used together with MISR and MODIS AOT as attributes for prediction of AERONET AOT, the R<sup>2</sup> accuracy was increased up to 10%.","","POD:0-7803-9286-8","10.1109/ICIF.2005.1591916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1591916","AERONET;MISR;MODIS;aerosols;data fusion","Aerosols;Atmosphere;Earth;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Instruments;MODIS;Remote sensing;Satellites;Spatial resolution","aerosols;atmospheric optics;image resolution;image retrieval;image sensors;neural nets;radiometers;remote sensing;sensor fusion;spectrometers","AERONET;AOT retrieval;MISR;MODIS data;USA;aerosol optical thickness;aerosol robotic network;data fusion;ground-based remote sensing;moderate resolution imaging spectrometer;multiangle imaging spectroradiometer;neural network technique;satellite-based remote sensing","","0","","20","","","25-28 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present here a practically motivated study of a frequent pattern extraction from sequences of data objects that are described within a domain ontology. As the complexity of the descriptive structures is high, an entire framework for the pattern extraction process had to be defined. The key elements thereof are a pair of descriptive languages, one for individual data and another one for generic patterns, a generality relation between patterns, and an Apriori-like method for pattern mining.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607479","","Data mining;Explosions;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Machine learning;OWL;Ontologies;Scalability;Tree graphs;Web server","data mining;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","abstraction level;data format;data object sequence;descriptive language;domain knowledge;domain ontology;frequent pattern extraction;frequent pattern mining;sequential pattern format","","0","","16","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Image repositories are used in the following context: 1. Acquisition - to store medical image data obtained from modality acquisition systems (XRAY, MR, CTscanners etc); 2. second work spot - medical image data stored in a repository as described in point (1) is moved to a workstation from which radiologists can view and perform post processing actions on the medical image data; 3) PACS - the images stored as described in points (1) and (2) are then archived to a central repository commonly referred to as PACS (picture archiving and communications system). The operations in the hospital workflow such as image storage and retrieval, viewing, post processing can be served by a generic repository component using which different modalities can develop their own clinical applications. This paper talks about the challenges that are imminent in realizing such a repository component and the possibility of how they can be overcome. While doing so this paper also describes how the component satisfies the characteristics of a COTS product. This component is used for storage and retrieval of medical image data with the underlying storage being a commercial RDBMS.","","POD:0-7695-2515-6","10.1109/ICCBSS.2006.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1595763","","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Hospitals;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Information systems;Picture archiving and communication systems;Printing;Workstations","PACS;image retrieval;medical image processing;software packages","COTS-like generic medical image repository;PACS;RDBMS;generic repository component;hospital workflow;medical image post processing;medical image retrieval;medical image storage;medical image viewing;modality acquisition system;picture archiving and communications system;radiology database management system","","0","","5","","","13-16 Feb. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This functionality significantly contributed to the scalability of the Web, since it reduced the amount of interaction between the sender and the recipient. Current approaches of extending the World Wide Web from a collection of human-readable information, connecting humans, into a network that connects computing devices based on machine-processable semantics of data lack this feature and are instead based on tightly-coupled message exchange. In this paper, we (1) show that Web services based on the message-exchange paradigm are not fully compliant with core paradigms of the Web itself, (2) outline how the idea of persistent publication as a communication paradigm can be beneficially applied to Web services, and (3) propose a minimal architecture for fully Web-enabled semantic Web services based on publication in shared information spaces, which we call triple space computing.","","POD:0-7695-2484-2","10.1109/ECOWS.2005.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1595733","","Computer architecture;Computer networks;Humans;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Scalability;Service oriented architecture;Web services;Web sites;World Wide Web","information retrieval;message passing;semantic Web","Web-enabled semantic Web services;World Wide Web;human-readable information;information exchange;information network;machine-processable semantics;message exchange;persistent publication;shared information spaces;triple space computing","","11","","21","","","14-16 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through our study, it is revealed that the argument array API needs to provide a means to copy arguments for duplicated task assignment. Timing of data transfer in the non-blocking RPC and a method to retrieve execution information for each RPC are expected to be standardized in the GridRPC.

However, sentence aligned parallel corpora are more efficient than non-aligned parallel corpora for cross language information retrieval and machine translation applications. In this paper, we present a new approach to aligning sentences in bilingual parallel corpora based on the text character length between successive punctuates. A probabilistic score is assigned to each proposed correspondence of texts, based on the scaled difference of lengths of the two texts (in characters) and the variance of this difference. Using this score, the time required for punctuates matching decreased and the sentence alignment precision increased.

Since IE is born for special application domain, which has clear pragmatic information, we believe that the integration of comprehensive information and IE is excellent.

Mean vectors and covariance matrices are computed from feature distributions of training samples with known categories and from individual images with varying partitions on the assumption that, distributions are multivariate Gaussian. Statistical distance measures utilize these parameters in similarity matching functions to minimize the probability of retrieval error. For category specific retrieval, a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) is trained on the samples to predict the categories of query and database images. Based on the online prediction, precompiled category specific statistical parameters are utilized in similarity measure functions. For partition specific retrieval, individual images are partitioned into non-overlapping blocks of different sizes and a joint feature vector of color and texture features are extracted from each block to generate the distribution and estimate the parameters. Experimental results on a generic image database with ground truth are reported. Performances of two statistical distance measures, namely Bhattacharyya and Mahalanobis are evaluated and compared with Euclidian distance measure, which show the effectiveness of the proposed technique.","1558-2809;15582809","POD:0-7803-8922-0","10.1109/IST.2005.1594536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1594536","","Covariance matrix;Distributed computing;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Parameter estimation;Probability;Spatial databases;Support vector machines","Gaussian distribution;covariance matrices;error statistics;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;image sampling;image texture;support vector machines","Bhattacharyya distance;Mahalanobis distance;block based partition;color texture;covariance matrix;image database;image retrieval system;joint feature vector distribution;mean vector;multiclass SVM;multivariate Gaussian distribution;online prediction;precompiled category;query image;retrieval error probability;similarity matching function;statistical distance measure;support vector machine;training sample","","3","","15","","","13 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model-vectors that construct the model space are more appropriate for the image content and are applied to each individual image. Soft labels are then given to the unannotated images during the propagation procedure, and as a keyword, each label is associated with a membership confidence in probability.

We review the design of the MDT calibration software for ATLAS and present performance results obtained with detailed GEANT4-based simulation and real data from the recent combined test beam.","1082-3654;10823654","POD:0-7803-9221-3","10.1109/NSSMIC.2005.1596227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1596227","","Algorithm design and analysis;Calibration;Data mining;Detectors;Information retrieval;Large Hadron Collider;Mesons;Monitoring;Software design;Spectroscopy","calibration;drift chambers;high energy physics instrumentation computing;muon detection;particle spectrometers","80 mum;Atlas monitored drift tube chambers;GEANT4-based simulation;Large Hadron Collider;autocalibration procedure;calibration software;high-pressure monitored drift tube chambers;muon spectrometer;precision tracking detectors;reconstruction algorithms;space-time relation","","3","","10","","","23-29 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm uses a modification of the gravitational algorithm proposed by Gomez et al. but using only the distance measures (a notion of space is not required). This approach is useful when similarities (and/or then distances) between pages can be defined and compute quickly, but the definition of a space is computationally expensive.

Understanding its temporal semantics is important in many NLP applications, such as information extraction, document summarization and question answering. Temporal expression normalization involves mapping from the different classes of expressions to the values of certain temporal attributes. A temporal expression may belong to one or more classes, but each class of expressions normally shares the same mapping procedure. In this paper, we explore the possibility of applying multi-label classification techniques in the context of temporal expression normalization. More specifically, two models, named independent binary classification model and compared binary classification model, are evaluated, compared and analyzed. Once the possible class(es) of a temporal expression is determined, the corresponding mapping rules are called to transform it into the corresponding attribute(s). Experiments on a substantiate data collection show that, based on the result of machine learning classification, the performance of temporal expression normalization is comparable with that of deliberate rule set.","","POD:0-7803-9361-9","10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598755","","Data mining;Guidelines;Information processing;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Natural languages;Nominations and elections;Speech","classification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;text analysis","Chinese temporal expression normalization;NLP;compared binary classification model;independent binary classification model;machine learning;multilabel classification;natural language processing;temporal semantics","","2","","18","","","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we investigate a new method for 3D model retrieval based on orthogonal projections. We assume that 3D models are composed of trigonal meshes. Algorithms proceed first by a normalization step in which the 3D models are transformed into canonical coordinates. Then each model is orthogonally projected onto six surfaces of the projected cube which contains it. A following step is feature extraction of the projected images which is done by moment invariants and polar radius Fourier transform. The feature vector of each 3D model is composed of the features extracted from projected images with different weights. Our system validates that this means can distinguish 3D models effectively. Experiments show that our method performs quit well.","","POD:0-7695-2473-7","10.1109/CAD-CG.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1604629","","Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Computer graphics;Feature extraction;Fourier transforms;Helium;Histograms;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape","Fourier transforms;feature extraction;method of moments;solid modelling","3D model retrieval;3D modeling;moment invariants;orthogonal projections;polar radius Fourier transform;trigonal meshes","","2","","22","","","7-10 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fed. de Minas Gerais, Brazil","Third Latin American Web Congress (LA-WEB'2005)","20060306","2005","","","9 pp.","","The Web is a large source of geographic information. Many Web documents have one or more spatial references, such as place names, addresses, zip codes or phone numbers. These spatial references are usually found in a semistructured fashion, which allows humans to identify and assign a geographic meaning to documents. In this paper, we discuss the important role that gazetteers, which are spatial catalogues of place names, can play in automating this process, and introduce the Locus gazetteer. Locus has been designed to hold not only place names for entities such as cities and rivers, but also to handle intra-urban place names, such as street names, urban landmarks, and postal addresses, along with their spatial relationships, through an ontology of places. We demonstrate that ontologically-enhanced gazetteers, such as Locus, are very useful for discovering the geographic context present on Web pages, and are often used in many other applications, such as in address geocoding for geographic information systems. To efficiently accomplish these tasks, the gazetteer must have a large database of spatial references; however, such a database is hard to obtain in emergent countries such as Brazil, in which available official geographic databases are limited and not well updated. As a way to tackle this problem, we describe a semi-automatic method used to populate the Locus gazetteer with geographic content extracted directly from the Web. To evaluate our work, an experiment was conducted, focusing on testing the Locus gazetteer data quality and comprehensiveness.","","POD:0-7695-2471-0","10.1109/LAWEB.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592372","","Cities and towns;Data mining;Geographic Information Systems;Humans;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Rivers;Search engines;Spatial databases;Web pages","Internet;data mining;geographic information systems;search engines;visual databases","Locus gazetteer;Web document;Web page;geographic database;geographic information system;geographic knowledge discovery;intra-urban place name;ontologically-enhanced gazetteer;semiautomatic method;spatial reference database","","4","4","21","","","31 Oct.-2 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm is implemented and compared with some of the existing models.","","POD:0-7695-2452-4","10.1109/NWESP.2005.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592437","","Automation;Computer science;Data engineering;Database languages;Filters;Information retrieval;Information technology;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantic Web","ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;semantic Web","RDF based repository system;information retrieval;ontology server;ranking algorithm;semantic Web based information query system","","1","","15","","","22-26 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The binary search algorithm is used to coordinate the transmissions from multiple tags to one reader. In this paper, we propose a new approach to use interference cancellation in the binary search algorithm, which achieves time saving of around 50% to read all tags' IDs. In addition, for algorithms with and without interference cancellation, we analyze the reliability of ID detection and obtain analytical results of the average probability of success for ID detection","2155-7578;21557578","POD:0-7803-9393-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2005.1605802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1605802","","Algorithm design and analysis;Information retrieval;Interference cancellation;Intrusion detection;MIMO;Multiaccess communication;RFID tags;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Signal processing algorithms","interference suppression;radiofrequency identification;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels","ID detection;ID information;RFID systems;binary search algorithms;interference cancellation;multiple tags;wireless channel","","2","","15","","","17-20 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Natural language processing and knowledge","M. Nagao","","2005 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","20060227","2005","","","1","","Summary form only given. Natural language processing (NLP) requires varieties of knowledge. When we consider about man-machine dialogue we have to prepare lots of knowledge, and also strong inference functions such as logical inference and common sense reasoning. In this paper the author explains some new developments in knowledge for computational linguistics, then discuss about what kind of knowledge is required for a dialogue system. Information retrieval on the Web is an important technology. Estimating the confidence degree of information is a very difficult problem. The author discusses some possible ways of estimating the confidence degree of information. Natural language processing technologies as well as logical and common sense reasoning are involved in the estimation.","","POD:0-7803-9361-9","10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598694","","Communications technology;Computational linguistics;Dictionaries;Information retrieval;Internet;Man machine systems;Natural language processing","common-sense reasoning;computational linguistics;human computer interaction;information retrieval;natural languages","NLP;World Wide Web;common sense reasoning;computational linguistics;information retrieval;logical inference;logical reasoning;man-machine dialogue;natural language processing","","2","","","","","Oct. 30 2005-Nov. 1 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
