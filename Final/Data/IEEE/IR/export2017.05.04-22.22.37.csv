In this paper, we develop a visualization tool to analyze the geographical locations of spammers based on the integration of MaxMind and WhoIS databases with Google Maps API. The visualization tool provides an insight into spam origins, along with patterns of spammers identified from spam activity. A key component in the development of this tool is its extensible framework allowing for the addition of resources to retrieve more information about a spammer and analyze additional patterns of spammers for spam analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6044-9; POD:978-1-4673-6043-2","10.1109/ComComAp.2013.6533610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6533610","IP Geolocation;Network Visualization;Security Visualization;Spam Analysis","Data visualization;Google;IP networks;Unsolicited electronic mail;Visual databases","data analysis;data visualisation;geographic information systems;information retrieval;invasive software;unsolicited e-mail","Google Maps API;MaxMind databases;WhoIS databases;current security analytic tools;cyber attacks;honeypots collectors;information retrieval;malware collectors;spam email geolocation visualization;spammer geographical locations","","1","","9","","","1-4 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results show that good recognition performance can be achieved using such limited data information for gait biometric (around 85% of rank 5 identification rate and 8.6% of EER).

This requirement allows the compiler and hardware to aggressively optimize unannotated accesses, which are assumed to be data-race-free (""safe"" accesses), while still preserving the intuitive thread interleaving semantics known as sequential consistency (SC). However, unannotated data races are easy for programmers to accidentally introduce and difficult to detect, and thus the safety and correctness of programs can be significantly compromised. The authors argue instead for a safety-first approach, whereby the compiler and hardware treat every memory access as potentially unsafe unless it is proven otherwise. In this way, SC semantics is guaranteed for all programs, whether data-race-free or not. The authors show that the performance and design cost of this approach is insignificant in practice, because the majority of accesses can be proven safe through a simple static or dynamic analysis, and memory ordering constraints can be ignored for such accesses without violating SC. Together with their earlier work on an efficient SC-preserving compiler, their SC hardware provides end-to-end SC semantics at the language level with low overhead.","0272-1732;02721732","","10.1109/MM.2013.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6493304","hardware/software interfaces;parallel architectures;sequential consistency","Computer architecture;Computer interfaces;Hardware;Parallel processing;Sequential analysis;Software engineering","information retrieval;program compilers;program diagnostics;programming language semantics;storage management","SC hardware;SC-preserving compiler;concurrency semantics standardisation;data-race-free;dynamic analysis;end-to-end SC semantics;language level;memory accesses;memory models;programming languages;programs correctness;safety-first approach;sequential consistency;static analysis;unannotated accesses;unannotated data races","","0","","14","","20130403","May-June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Campus social network service is a special type of enterprise social network service. Cloud social network service platform on campus provides information communication, knowledge sharing, and online collaboration services to campus users in different aspects of colleges and universities through multiple social domains. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of data management in the platform which is performed by domain data manager. The purpose of data management is to keep the flexibility of data storage while providing integrated interfaces for data access, data maintenance and database schema maintenance. In other words, integrated and flexible data management gives cloud social network platform better scalability and maintainability. In order to do this, we first divide data space of the platform into logical data space and physical data space. Then we set up data mapping model between the two data spaces. Finally, we build up four services in domain data manager. With all these considerations, we expect to be able to optimize data storage to achieve faster data access speed without the need to modify the code of the platform.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2964-4; POD:978-1-4673-2963-7","10.1109/ICCSNT.2012.6526148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526148","Campus Social Network Service;Cloud Computing;Data Management;Multi-Domain","","cloud computing;data handling;database management systems;educational administrative data processing;groupware;information retrieval;social networking (online);storage management","Internet applications;campus social network service;cloud social network service platform;data access;data mapping model;data storage;database schema maintenance;domain data manager;enterprise social network service;flexible data management;information communication;integrated data management;knowledge sharing;logical data space;online collaboration services;physical data space","","1","","10","","","29-31 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method improves the quality of CS services by studying the data duplication of a CS system.

Due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the rapid growth of online information, text classification has become one of the key techniques for handling and organizing text data. Despite the huge textual information that is available online and it increases every day, effective retrieval is becoming more difficult. Text categorization is one solution to tackle this problem. In this paper, we present and analyze the results of the application of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the classification of Arabic language documents. The work on automatic categorization of Arabic documents using Artificial Neural Network is limited. The system's primary source of knowledge is an Arabic text categorization (TC) corpus built locally at the University of Jordan and available at http://nlp.ju.edu.jo. This corpus is used to construct and test the ANN model. Methods of assigning weights and features reductions that reflect the importance of each term are discussed. Each Arabic document is represented by the term weighting scheme. Since the number of unique words in the collection set is big, features reduction methods have been used to select the most relevant features for the classification. The experimental results show that ANN model using features reduction methods achieves better result than the performance of basic ANN on classifying Arabic document.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4994-1; POD:978-1-4673-6462-1","10.1109/UKSim.2013.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6527466","neural network;pca;text classification;vector space model","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Frequency measurement;Support vector machine classification;Text categorization;Training","classification;feature extraction;information retrieval;natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","ANN model;Arabic language document classification;Arabic text categorization;Arabic text classification;TC;University of Jordan;artificial neural network;digital form;features reduction;online information;retrieval;text data handling;text data organizing","","3","","20","","","10-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Undoubtedly, how to cache effectively is of primary concern in ICN. However, caching strategies such as Least Recently Used(LRU) are not tailored for the characteristics of content retrieval in ICN, thus compromising the capability of in-network storage. In this paper, we propose a new caching strategy called LUV-Path, in which all the routers along the delivery path will implicitly cooperate in deciding whether to cache the content and each content cached will be assigned a value that combines Least Unified Value(LUV) with router's distance from provider to reflect its relative importance. We evaluate LUV-Path with cache algorithms including LRU, FIFO under various network topology such as highly structured string and tree topologies and irregularly structured Abilene network. Our results suggest that LUV-Path significantly outperforms other caching strategies in reducing customer delay and network traffic as well as alleviating provider pressure across various network topologies with different structural property consistently.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6203-0; POD:978-1-4673-6200-9","10.1109/Innovations.2013.6544392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544392","Information-Centric Networking;LRU;cache algorithm","Data models;Delays;Network topology;Probability;Routing protocols;Topology","cache storage;computer networks;information retrieval;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","Abilene network;ICN;LUV;cache algorithms;caching strategies;computer network routing;computer networks;content cached;content delivery path perspective;content retrieval;content retrieval shift;information centric networking;innetwork caching;innetwork storage;least recently used;least unified value;network topology;routers distance;tree topologies","","0","","13","","","17-19 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the reverse chronological order property and the homepage page limit also increase the difficulty of information retrieval. Therefore, the information publishers should recommend users based on the users' personal preference. In order to match user demands, we present a method using ""user influence"" to solve the recommendation problem.

Therefore recommender system has been introduced. It attempts to predict items or products that a user may be interested in. However, despite all the efforts, recommender systems are still in need of further development and more advanced recommendation modeling methods as these systems must take into account additional requirements on user preferences. An important contribution of this paper is TCO (Termite Colony Optimization) approach to recommender systems, the proposed approach provides a decision making model which is used by termites to adjust their movement trajectories. This approach has been tested on Large Market data and also on MovieLens data. Retail recommendation has continuous data and various constraints before achieving optimized suggestions.

Consider a general form of the problem where a client who holds a private input interacts with a server who holds a private DP (e.g. a decision tree or a branching program) with the goal of evaluating his input on the DP without learning any additional information. Many known private database query problems such as symmetric private information retrieval and private keyword search can be formulated as special cases of this problem. Most of the existing works on the same problem focus on optimising communication. However, in some environments (supported by a few experimental studies), it is the computation and not the communication that may be the performance bottleneck. In this study, we design `computationally efficient' protocols for the above general problem, and a few of its special cases. In addition to being one-round and requiring a small amount of work by the client (in the RAM model), the proposed protocols only require a small number of exponentiations (independent of the server's input) by both parties. The proposed constructions are, in essence, efficient and black-box reductions of the above problem to 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer. It is proved that the proposed protocols secure (private) against `malicious' adversaries in the standard ideal/real-world simulation-based paradigm.","1751-8709;17518709","","10.1049/iet-ifs.2012.0032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6543346","","","client-server systems;data privacy;information retrieval;program diagnostics;query processing;software performance evaluation","1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer;RAM model;black box reductions;branching program;client-server paradigm;computationally efficient protocols;decision tree;malicious adversaries;oblivious DP evaluation problem;oblivious decision program evaluation;private DP;private database query problems;private keyword search;real-world simulation-based paradigm;standard ideal simulation-based paradigm;symmetric private information retrieval","","0","","","","","June 2013","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

This study describes an approach to continuous archiving on a defined time interval for active and inactive data within a database. In financial systems, downtime is never desirable in operations such as database maintenance. Database-level archiving operation can be in many ways. However, there is often need for short-term downtime for this operation. In this study, a structure will be proposed which has a downtime occurrence within milliseconds. Archiving can be done to another database on the same server or can be done to another database on a different server. The first reason for archiving is acceleration to data access. The second target is reducing cost for processor, memory, disk and network resources. With archiving, beside data access, maintenance and administration facilitation can be enhanced. At the same time, it has also a simple methodology to access and query the inactive data. The proposed method requires partitioning with certain intervals, daily, monthly or weekly, to be archived. Seamless data transfer can be possible with partitioning for a table on a particular schema and function. And finally, the active and inactive data separated under a partitioned view. In this way, the database management system can explore and know the data location and access during the query processing.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5613-8; POD:978-1-4673-5612-1","10.1109/TAEECE.2013.6557304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6557304","archive;archiving;availibility;database;performance","Acceleration;Databases;Maintenance engineering","database management systems;financial data processing;information retrieval systems;query processing","active data;administration facilitation;continuous archiving;data access;data location;data maintenance;data reading ratio;database maintenance;database management system;database-level archiving operation;disk cost reduction;financial applications;financial systems;historical data;inactive data;memory cost reduction;network resource cost reduction;processor cost reduction;query processing;seamless data transfer;short-term downtime;zero downtime archiving model","","0","","13","","","9-11 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users can post questions on a wide variety of topics, other users provide answers, usually within minutes. Participants are not compensated for their services and anyone can freely gain value from the efforts of the users, Stack Exchange is therefore a gift economy. Users, however, do gain reputation points when other users "" upvote"" their questions and/or answers. Stack Exchange thus functions as a learning community with a strong reputation-seeking element that creates a valuable public good, viz. the question and answer archive. The incentive structure of the community suggests that over time, the quality of the product (viz., delivered answers) steadily improves, and furthermore, that any individual who durably participates in this community for an extended period also would enjoy an increase in the quality of their output (viz., the answers they provide). We investigate the validity of these widely held beliefs in greater detail, using data downloaded from Stack Exchange. Our analysis indicates that these intuitions are actually not supported by the data, indeed the data suggests that overall answer scores decrease, and that people's tenure with the community is unrelated to the quality of their answers. Most interestingly, we show that answering skill, i.e. getting high average answer scores, which is different than reputation, is evident from the start and persists during one's tenure with the community. Conversely, people providing low rated answers are likely to have done so from the start.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5015-2; POD:978-1-4799-0234-7","10.1109/SocialInformatics.2012.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542441","","","Internet;data mining;question answering (information retrieval)","Q&A archive;answering skill;gift economy;learning community;question & answer Internet community;stack exchange mining;valuable public good","","6","","16","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Techniques such as web caching and web prefetching have been employed successfully in order to reduce this latency. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) such as Akamai 111 provide the advantage of better performance and high availability through a network of distributed servers hosting a large portion of the internet content by offloading traffic directly served from the content provider's origin infrastructure.

Huge amount of information is expected to be generated, raising at the same time significant concerns: the generated information has to be organized in a meaningful way that facilitates the development of a variety of applications, and it should be protected against unauthorized access.

Tags have proven to be invaluable information for searching, mining, and recommending resources. In practice, however, not all resources receive the same attention from users. As a result, while some highly-popular resources are over-tagged, most of the resources are under-tagged. Incomplete tagging on resources severely affects the effectiveness of all tag-based techniques and applications. We address an interesting question: if users are paid to tag specific resources, how can we allocate incentives to resources in a crowd-sourcing environment so as to maximize the tagging quality of resources? We address this question by observing that the tagging quality of a resource becomes stable after it has been tagged a sufficient number of times. We formalize the concepts of tagging quality (TQ) and tagging stability (TS) in measuring the quality of a resource's tag description. We propose a theoretically optimal algorithm given a fixed “budget” (i.e., the amount of money paid for tagging resources). This solution decides the amount of rewards that should be invested on each resource in order to maximize tagging stability. We further propose a few simple, practical, and efficient incentive allocation strategies. On a dataset from del.icio.us, our best strategy provides resources with a close-to-optimal gain in tagging stability.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4673-4910-9; POD:978-1-4673-4909-3","10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544866","","Earth;Google;Radio spectrum management;Resource management;Stability analysis;Tagging;Uniform resource locators","information retrieval;resource allocation;social networking (online);text analysis","close-to-optimal gain;crowd-sourcing environment;del.icio.us dataset;highly-popular resources;incentive allocation strategies;incentive-based tagging;incomplete tagging;over-tagged resources;resource annotation;resource tagging quality maximization;social tagging system;tagging stability maximization;text descriptions;under-tagged resources","","4","","18","","","8-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we added Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms for stream mining inside an event processing engine, called Esper. Using the system, these two algorithms were compared over LastFM social music site data and by using tumbling windows. The better-performing FP-Growth was selected and used in creation of a real-time rule-based recommendation engine. Our most important findings show that online association rule mining can generate (1) more rules, (2) much faster and more efficiently, and (3) much sooner than offline rule mining.

This manifestation motivates us to extend the capabilities of conventional E-learning systems so that the information can be accessed at the real-time based on the user's location. In this paper, the e-Learning system is used for the LBL with the help of navigation capabilities without modifying the existing systems. The learning content geocoding, reverse-geocoding, and real-time learning plan generation based on the user preferences and constraints have been proposed.

This hampers document exchange, as well as their annotation and retrieval. While information retrieval mechanisms concentrate on textual features (corpus analysis), annotation approaches either target specific formats or require that a document follows interoperable standards. This work presents our effort to handle these problems, providing a more flexible solution. Rather than trying to modify or convert the document itself, or to target only textual characteristics, the strategy described in this work is based on an intermediate descriptor - the document shadow. A shadow represents domain-relevant aspects and elements of both structure and content of a given document, as defined by a user group. Rather than annotating documents themselves, it is the shadows that are annotated, thereby providing independence between annotations and document formats. Our annotations take advantage of the LOD initiative. Via annotations users can derive correlations across shadows, in a flexible way. Moreover, shadows and annotations are stored in databases, therefore allowing uniform database treatments of heterogeneous documents.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5304-5; POD:978-1-4673-5303-8","10.1109/ICDEW.2013.6547416","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6547416","","Biodiversity;Data mining;Databases;Feature extraction;Semantics;Standards;XML","Internet;content management;data structures;document handling;information retrieval;open systems","LOD initiative;Web annotation;annotations users;complex documents;database storage;distributed documents;document annotation;document conversion;document exchange;document shadow;domain-relevant aspects;flexible document representation;heterogeneous documents;information retrieval mechanisms;interoperable standards;textual characteristics;textual features;uniform database treatments","","2","","25","","","8-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although telecommunication infrastructures are incapacitated and millions of people experienced hindered Internet access, mobile phone usage soars as people access wireless networks to communicate and seek information regarding an event such as a natural disaster. The demands for communication and information during crisis events distinctly differ from the typical data loads seen during normal operation in both traffic and content. Detecting the anomalies in network traffic data that occur during disruptive events such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and political uprisings can provide potential aid to first responders and be a potentially useful public surveillance tool.

The term ""next time"" characterizes the combination of real time data flows from collective sources with massive computing power with the aim of predicting the future. In other words, if you can compute ""fast enough"" using real time data sets then you can accurately predict what happens next. Central to this process is the Google Trends service that provides generalized statistics in regard to the popularity of web search terms submitted to Google. The paper combines the conclusions derived from other approaches to the prediction problem with Google Trends data in order to predict the outcome of six national elections races in two countries, Greece and Spain. The results of the proposed model reaffirm our hypothesis that web search terms popularity is directly related to voters decisions in both countries and thus can be used to predict the final outcome with great accuracy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4952-1; POD:978-1-4673-6239-9; USB:978-0-7695-4952-1","10.1109/WAINA.2013.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6550399","Google Insights;Google Trends;elections;prediction;web search","Data models;Google;Market research;Nominations and elections;Predictive models;Terminology;Web search","Internet;information retrieval;politics","Google trends service;Greek elections;Spanish elections;Web search data;Web search terms;future prediction;general purpose model;massive computing power;real time data flows;real time data processing","","3","","13","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Social media, therefore, has created an enormous challenge for scientists trying to keep pace with developments in their field. Most of the previous studies have adopted broad-brush approaches which tend to result in providing limited analysis. To handle these problems properly, we introduce our real-time Twitter trend mining system, RT<sup>2</sup>M, which operates in real-time to process big stream datasets available on Twitter. The system offers the functions of term co-occurrence retrieval, visualization of Twitter users by query, similarity calculation between two users, Topic Modeling to keep track of changes of topical trend, and analysis on mention-based user networks. We also demonstrate an empirical study on 2012 Korean presidential election. The case study reveals Twitter could be a useful source to detect and predict the advent and changes of social issues, and analysis of mention-based user networks could show different aspects of user behaviors.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4998-9; POD:978-1-4799-0045-9","10.1109/SOCIETY.2013.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6545966","Korean presidential election;network analysis;real-time Twitter trend miming system;social media mining;topic modeling","Communities;Market research;Media;Moon;Nominations and elections;Real-time systems;Twitter","data mining;data visualisation;information retrieval;politics;social networking (online)","Korean presidential election;RT<sup>2</sup>M;Twitter user visualization;big stream dataset processing;cooccurrence retrieval;information behavior;mention-based user network;novel knowledge discovery;real-time Twitter trend mining system;real-time online information channel;similarity calculation;social issues;social media;topic modeling;topical trend change tracking;user behavior;user query","","3","","31","","","8-10 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, concerns of sensitive information on cloud potentially causes privacy problems. Data encryption protects data security to some extent, but at the cost of compromised efficiency. Searchable symmetric encryption (SSE) allows retrieval of encrypted data over cloud. In this paper, we focus on addressing data privacy issues using SSE. For the first time, we formulate the privacy issue from the aspect of similarity relevance and scheme robustness. We observe that server-side ranking based on order-preserving encryption (OPE) inevitably leaks data privacy. To eliminate the leakage, we propose a two-round searchable encryption (TRSE) scheme that supports top-k multikeyword retrieval. In TRSE, we employ a vector space model and homomorphic encryption. The vector space model helps to provide sufficient search accuracy, and the homomorphic encryption enables users to involve in the ranking while the majority of computing work is done on the server side by operations only on ciphertext. As a result, information leakage can be eliminated and data security is ensured. Thorough security and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme guarantees high security and practical efficiency.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425381","Cloud;data privacy;homomorphic encryption;ranking;similarity relevance;vector space model","Cloud computing;Data privacy;Encryption;Servers;Vectors","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;information retrieval;relevance feedback","OPE;SSE;TRSE scheme;ciphertext;cloud computing;data outsourcing;data privacy leakage elimination;data security;encrypted cloud data retrieval;high-quality data services;homomorphic encryption;order-preserving encryption;performance analysis;searchable symmetric encryption;sensitive information;server-side ranking;similarity relevance;top-k multikeyword retrieval security;two-round searchable encryption scheme;vector space model","","24","","30","","20130201","July-Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, their detection is challenging due to extensive memory requirements and execution time. In this paper, we present a novel, parallel k-clique community detection method, based on an innovative technique which enables connected components of a network to be obtained from those of its subnetworks. The novel method has an unbounded, user-configurable, and input-independent maximum degree of parallelism, and hence is able to make full use of computational resources. Theoretical tight upper bounds on its worst case time and space complexities are given as well. Experiments on real-world networks such as the Internet and the World Wide Web confirmed the almost optimal use of parallelism (i.e., a linear speedup). Comparisons with other state-of-the-art k-clique community detection methods show dramatic reductions in execution time and memory footprint.

Manual data collection is difficult and sending ground robots to collect information can be complex due to uneven terrain. Alternately, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be used to collect data from sensor networks. The UAV will fly over the sensors gathering the data. However, to minimize the flight time of the UAV and maximize the network lifetime, a joint route optimization for UAV and sensor network must be carried out. Additionally, the UAV has kinematic constraints and communication range limitations. Determining solution with these constraints is difficult and computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a heuristic solution by decoupling the problem into four sub-problems. The first is to determine clusters of sensors with communication range limitations. The second is to efficiently connect the clusters. The third is to design the route inside the cluster that will maximize the information collection and the fourth is to design a path planner for the UAV for data collection. We show the proposed solution through an example.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-3108-1; POD:978-1-4673-3107-4","10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549957","","Joints;Kinematics;Optimization;Robot sensing systems;Vehicles;Wireless sensor networks","autonomous aerial vehicles;information retrieval;mobile robots;optimisation;path planning;robot kinematics;terrain mapping;wireless sensor networks","UAV;communication range limitations;data retrieval;flight time;ground robots;heuristic solution;information collection;joint route optimization;joint route planning;kinematic constraints;large scale data gathering;manual data collection;network lifetime;path planner;remote deployments;remote sensor networks;uneven terrain;unmanned aerial vehicle","","3","","11","","","15-18 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional malware detection uses signature-based methods, but these methods can be evaded by obfuscation or polymorphism. So the behavior-based detection techniques were proposed recently. To capture the apps' behavior, previous works either use OS level tool such as strace to capture system call, or intercept high level API by modifying the virtual machine. However, the information retrieved from the former method is too difficult to understand the program's behavior, and the technique used in latter method requires to modify the emulator, which it is not compatible when the Android version upgrade. In this paper, we proposed a new light-weight method to understand the applications' behavior by logging program's API and corresponding arguments.

By locating a just-in-time prefetching push proxy in the cloud and routing mobile client web requests through it, web page load times can be perceivably reduced. Our analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the use of a push proxy results in a much smaller dependency on the mobile client to network latency than seen in environments where no proxy is used, in particular, only one full round trip from client to server is necessary regardless of the number of resources referenced by a web page. In addition, we find that the ideal location for a push proxy minimizes the latency between the proxy and the servers that the mobile client accesses through it, in contrast to traditional proxies which are best deployed in a manner that minimizes the latency between client and proxy.","1550-445X;1550445X","Electronic:978-0-7695-4953-8; POD:978-1-4673-5550-6","10.1109/AINA.2013.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531870","dynamic push;latency reduction;web proxy","Browsers;Equations;HTML;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Prefetching;Servers","Web sites;information retrieval;just-in-time;mobile radio;network servers;storage management","Internet access;Web page load times;Web pages;Web site operators;cloud mobile client Web requests;high latency wide-area wireless networks;just-in-time prefetching push proxy;mobile Web acceleration;mobile client access;routing mobile client Web requests;user satisfaction","","2","","21","","","25-28 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed work identifies the potential use of Bluetooth and EyeOS cloud computing platform to track students' attendance and to efficiently store and retrieve the same. The challenges associated with the state-of-the-art technologies for automation are data heterogeneity, availability, consistency and fault tolerance. The problem with Schema based SQL database is that it is not scalable horizontally and provides poor fault tolerance to partitions. The issue with the schema free NoSQL databases is that it can provide either availability and fault tolerance or consistency and fault tolerance but not all three features together.

"Question and Answering Made Interactive: An Exploration of Interactions in Social Q&A","Z. Liu; B. J. Jansen","Coll. of Inf.

Although it has been investigated by a number of works lately, so far still little has been known about how people interact with each other in order to satisfy their information needs in social Q&A. With the aim to understand the patterns of user interactions in the social Q&A context, as well as factors that may affect such kind of back-and-forth communications, in this work we collect over 1,000 question and answering dialogues from Sina Weibo. Statistical analyses including ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, linear regression and independent t-test are performed in order to answer our proposed research questions. Our results demonstrate the importance of studying the interactions in social Q&A given that about half of our collected question-answer pairs are of interactive nature. From the quantity perspective, we observe that questions within more complicated topics, such as ""Healthcare"" and ""Education"" generate more interactions. Significantly positive correlation is also noticed between social tie strength and the number of interactions. By manually annotating all interactive answers, we also indicate the importance of weak ties in providing high quality answers and interactions. Based on our results, we proposed potential implications for future design and implementations.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4998-9; POD:978-1-4799-0045-9","10.1109/SOCIETY.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6545959","Social Q&amp;A;Weibo;information exchange;information seeking;social networks;social search","Business;Communities;Educational institutions;Entertainment industry;Medical services;Twitter","question answering (information retrieval);regression analysis;social networking (online)","ANOVA;Pearson correlation;Sina Weibo;Web 2.0 techniques;independent t-test;linear regression;social Q&A;social question and answering;statistical analyses","","0","","37","","","8-10 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, the use of multimedia file via smartphone is becoming popular and tends to be general and widely used among users. Unfortunately, the loading system has a common problem which is a long delay during load. Due to the long delay time of the traditional client-server multimedia file retrieval service, the Mobile Cloud System (MCS) is proposed to solve the problem. Cloud computing architecture provides high efficiency of sharing the CPU and memories of different computing devices over the network. Therefore the MCS makes use of the vacant memory of a set of smartphones to shorten the downloading time. With the help of Cloud computing, users can receive multimedia file faster.","","Electronic:978-89-94364-22-3; POD:978-1-4673-0894-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6530295","cloud computing;mobile phone;multimedia retrieval","","client-server systems;cloud computing;information retrieval;mobile computing;multimedia systems;operating systems (computers);smart phones","Internet;MCS;client-server multimedia file retrieval service;cloud computing architecture;loading system;mobile cloud system;mobile devices;mobile phones;operating system providers;personal computer;smartphone","","1","","12","","","3-5 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The documents as well as the sentences are indexed using traditional term indexing measures, which do not take the context into consideration. Therefore, the sentence similarity values remain independent of the context. In this paper, we propose a context sensitive document indexing model based on the Bernoulli model of randomness. The Bernoulli model of randomness has been used to find the probability of the cooccurrences of two terms in a large corpus. A new approach using the lexical association between terms to give a context sensitive weight to the document terms has been proposed. The resulting indexing weights are used to compute the sentence similarity matrix. The proposed sentence similarity measure has been used with the baseline graph-based ranking models for sentence extraction. Experiments have been conducted over the benchmark DUC data sets and it has been shown that the proposed Bernoulli-based sentence similarity model provides consistent improvements over the baseline IntraLink and UniformLink methods [1].","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205756","Lexical association;document indexing;text summarization","Computational modeling;Context;Context modeling;Equations;Indexing;Mathematical model;Measurement","graph theory;information retrieval;probability;random processes;text analysis;word processing","Bernoulli randomness model;Bernoulli-based sentence similarity model;baseline IntraLink method;baseline UniformLink method;baseline graph-based ranking models;benchmark DUC data sets;context sensitive weight;context-based word indexing model;document indexing weights;document sentence similarity values;document summarization;document terms;lexical association;sentence extraction;sentence indexing weights;sentence similarity matrix;term cooccurrence probability","","13","","56","","20120529","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To rank entities, we exploit the redundancy abound in their snippets; however, such redundancy is noisy as not all the snippets represent information relevant to the desired relation. To explore useful information from such noisy redundancy, we abstract the task as a distantly supervised ranking problem - based on coarse entity-level annotations, deriving a relation-specific ranking function for the purpose of online searching. As the key challenge, without detailed snippet-level annotations, we have to learn an entity ranking function that can effectively filter noise; furthermore, the ranking function should also be online executable. We develop Pattern-based Filter Network (PFNet), a novel probabilistic graphical model, as our solution. To balance the accuracy and efficiency requirements, PFNet selects a limited size of indicative patterns to filter noisy snippets, and inverted indexes are utilized to retrieve required features. Experiments on the large scale CuleWeb09 data set for six different relations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PFNet model, which outperforms five state-of-the-art relational entity ranking methods.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4673-4910-9; POD:978-1-4673-4909-3","10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544878","","Accuracy;Indexes;Logic gates;Noise;Noise measurement;Redundancy;Training","feature extraction;graph theory;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","CuleWeb09 data set;PFNet;coarse entity-level annotation;distant supervision;distantly supervised ranking problem;entity ranking function;feature retrieval;indicative pattern;inverted index;noise filtering;noisy redundancy;noisy snippet filtering;online searching;pattern-based filter network;probabilistic graphical model;rank learning;relation-specific ranking function;relational entity search;snippet-level annotation","","0","","22","","","8-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is because traditional search engines are not able to index or access all information. The information which can be retrieved by following hypertext links are accessed by such traditional search engines. The forms which are not accessed by traditional search engines include login or authorization process. Hidden web refers to that part of the web which is not accessed by traditional web crawlers. An important problem of retrieving desired and good quality of information from huge hidden web database is how to find out and identify the entry points of hidden web databases i.e., forms, in the Web. The traditional web crawlers may be unable to retrieve all information from deep web databases. Therefore it is the main cause of motivation for retrieving information from deep web. Issues and challenges related to the problem are also discussed. An architecture for accessing hidden web databases that uses an intelligent agent technology through reinforcement learning is proposed. The experimental results show that the reinforcement learning helps in overcoming existing problems and outperforms the existing hidden web crawlers in terms of precision and recall.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5758-6; POD:978-1-4673-5759-3","10.1109/CICT.2013.6558108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6558108","Hidden Web;Hidden Web Database;Hidden web crawling;Reinforcement learning","Crawlers;Databases;Feature extraction;Intelligent agents;Learning (artificial intelligence);Search engines;Support vector machine classification","distributed databases;hypermedia;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);search engines","authorization process;deep Web;hidden World Wide Web database crawler;hypertext links;information extraction;information retrieving;intelligent agent technology;login process;reinforcement learning;search engines","","0","","20","","","11-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The correctness of data stored in a database is defined by the faithful execution of only valid (authorized) transactions. In this paper we address the question of whether it is necessary to trust a database server in order to trust the data retrieved from it. The lack of trust arises naturally if the database server is owned by a third party, as in the case of cloud computing. It also arises if the server may have been compromised, or there is a malicious insider. In particular, we reduce the level of trust necessary in order to establish the authenticity and integrity of data at an untrusted server. Earlier work on this problem is limited to situations where there are no updates to the database, or all updates are authorized and vetted by a central trusted entity. This is an unreasonable assumption for a truly dynamic database, as would be expected in many business applications, where multiple clients can update data without having to check with a central server that approves of their changes. We identify the problem of ensuring trustworthiness of data at an untrusted server in the presence of transactional updates that run directly on the database, and develop the first solutions to this problem. Our solutions also provide indemnity for an honest server and assured provenance for all updates to the data. We implement our solution in a prototype system built on top of Oracle with no modifications to the database internals. We also provide an empirical evaluation of the proposed solutions and establish their feasibility.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4673-4910-9; POD:978-1-4673-4909-3","10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544853","","Cloud computing;Databases;Digital signatures;Hardware;Protocols;Servers","authorisation;business data processing;cloud computing;data integrity;database management systems;file servers;information retrieval;trusted computing","business applications;central server;cloud computing;data authenticity;data integrity;data retrieved trustworthiness;data storage;database server;malicious insider;prototype system;transactional updates;truly dynamic database;trust level;trustworthy data;unreasonable assumption;untrusted databases;untrusted server","","3","","24","","","8-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such user-generated contents are mixture of temporal topics (e.g., breaking events) and stable topics (e.g., user interests). Due to their different natures, it is important and useful to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in social media. However, such a discrimination is very challenging because the user-generated texts in social media are very short in length and thus lack useful linguistic features for precise analysis using traditional approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to detect both stable and temporal topics simultaneously from social media data. Specifically, a unified user-temporal mixture model is proposed to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics. To improve this model's performance, we design a regularization framework that exploits prior spatial information in a social network, as well as a burst-weighted smoothing scheme that exploits temporal prior information in the time dimension. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our proposal on two real data sets obtained from Del.icio.us and Twitter. The experimental results verify that our mixture model is able to distinguish temporal topics from stable topics in a single detection process. Our mixture model enhanced with the spatial regularization and the burst-weighted smoothing scheme significantly outperforms competitor approaches, in terms of topic detection accuracy and discrimination in stable and temporal topics.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4673-4910-9; POD:978-1-4673-4909-3","10.1109/ICDE.2013.6544864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544864","","Equations;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Media;Twitter","Internet;information retrieval;linguistics;social networking (online);text analysis","Del.icio.us;Twitter;UGC;Web 2.0;burst-weighted smoothing scheme;linguistic features;online social media;spatial regularization;stable topic detection;temporal topic detection;user-generated contents;user-temporal mixture model","","1","","29","","","8-12 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the Web, the structured data are usually presented as lists, records or tables. Present methods require to identity the boundaries of data regions before separating them into records. Because records do not always have the same count of items or occur in consecutive sections, these methods often fail to handle such complicated or noisy pages. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic method called Two-Stage Web Record Extraction (TSWRE) to extract records from an open domain corpus. This approach uses a bottom-up analysis that starts with sequences of visually similar attribute sequences. It first identifies attribute sequences based on distinct tag paths of the ordered DOM tree of the document. The method exploits the position interleave characteristics of the attribute sequences to estimate how likely the sequences belong to the same records. Empirical experiments show that our method achieves promising performance compared to existing methods and is scalable to a large corpus.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4463-0; POD:978-1-4673-4464-7","10.1109/ICCSE.2013.6554015","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6554015","Information extraction;data record extraction;multiple sequence alignment","Abstracts;Art;HTML;Road transportation","Internet;information retrieval;text analysis;trees (mathematics)","bottom-up analysis;data region;distinct tag paths;information extraction;open domain corpus;ordered DOM tree;position interleave characteristics;structured data extraction;two-stage Web record extraction;visually similar attribute sequences","","0","","22","","","26-28 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to being intuitive and useful, factorization based models, including the Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) model, are one of the most common approachs for building recommender systems. In this study, we focus on how a recommender system can be built for online services and how the parameters of an NMF model should be selected in a recommender system setting. We first present a general system architecture in which any kind of factorization model can be used. Then, in order to see how accurate the NMF model fits the data, we randomly erase some parts of a real data set that is gathered from an online food ordering service, and we reconstruct the erased parts by using the NMF model. We report the mean squared errors for different parameter settings and different divergences.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5563-6; POD:978-1-4673-5562-9","10.1109/SIU.2013.6531312","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531312","Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF);Online Services;Recommender Systems","Architecture;Bayes methods;Buildings;Collaboration;Data models;Internet;Recommender systems","Internet;catering industry;information retrieval;matrix decomposition;order processing;recommender systems","Internet;NMF model;automatic recommender system;factorization based model;factorization based recommender system;mean squared error;nonnegative matrix factorization;online food ordering service;online service;parameter setting;system architecture","","0","","8","","","24-26 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. In this paper, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online to address this difficulty. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly supervised bootstrapping approach for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large collection of online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1-measure of 82.5 percent in comparative question identification and 83.3 percent in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. Additionally, our ranking results show highly relevance to user's comparison intents in web.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2011.210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042862","Information extraction;bootstrapping;comparable entity mining;sequential pattern mining","Algorithm design and analysis;Cities and towns;Data mining;Equations;Pattern matching;Portable media players;Reliability","Internet;data mining;decision making;question answering (information retrieval)","F1-measure;automatic comparable entity mining;comparable entity extraction;comparative question identification;human decision making process;online question archive;weakly supervised bootstrapping approach","","2","","17","","20111013","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These resources mainly provide manufacturing indicators for the control of the manufacturing processes. The search technique is based on a semantic mapping approach supported by a manufacturing process ontology and a process control dictionary. The ontology and the dictionary provide the required semantics to find out the purpose of use of the manufacturing indicators in the control process. In this way, the proposed search technique enables the end user (the engineer) to explore the resource repositories in the company and to understand the usefulness of the resources found, so to reuse the adequate indicators for the control process. The general approach has been experimented within the STMicroelectronics Company and has shown promising results.","1078-8743;10788743","Electronic:978-1-4673-5007-5; POD:978-1-4673-5006-8","10.1109/ASMC.2013.6552796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6552796","Bottom-up search;Dictionary;Indicator;Manufacturing process;Ontology","Companies;Dictionaries;Manufacturing processes;Process control;Semantics","information resources;information retrieval;manufacturing data processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);process control;semiconductor industry","STMicroelectronics;bottom-up search technique;information retrieval enhancement;manufacturing indicators;manufacturing information resources;manufacturing process control;manufacturing process ontology;process control dictionary;resource repositories;semantic mapping approach;semiconductor industries","","0","","10","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Twitter news classification using SVM","I. Dilrukshi; K. De Zoysa; A. Caldera","University of Colombo School of Computing, 7, Sri Lanka","2013 8th International Conference on Computer Science & Education","20130715","2013","","","287","291","With the development of web blogs, Social Networks, many news providers used to share their news headlines in various web sites and web blogs. Now-a-days in Sri Lanka, there are many news groups whom share their news headlines in micro blogging services such as Twitter. These data may carry out much valuable information which will relevant to many social research areas. Thus, the purpose of this research is to classify news into different groups so that the user could identify the most popular news group in a given country for a given time. The short messages were extracted from Twitter micro blog. Several active news groups were chosen to extract the short messages. Each short message was classified manually into 12 groups. These classified data were used to train the machine learning techniques. Words of each short message was considered as features and a feature vector was created using bag-of-words approach in order to create the instances. The data were trained using SVM (Support Vector Machine) machine learning techniques. The main reason of using SVM for the current study is, SVM supports high dimensional data. Current research is a high dimensional problem as a large number of features will be collected using short messages. Cross validation was done in order to avoid the biasness of data. The performance of the system will be the effectiveness of the system. Thus precision and recall values are calculated to measure the performance of the system. F<sub>β</sub> was calculated to obtain a single value measurement. The results show that the system provides high performance for most groups. However, the group development-government does not show much performance using SVM.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4463-0; POD:978-1-4673-4464-7","10.1109/ICCSE.2013.6553926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553926","SVM;Text classification;Web mining","Accidents;Blogs;Computers;Education;Support vector machines;Vectors","data mining;electronic messaging;electronic publishing;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online);support vector machines","SVM machine learning techniques;Sri Lanka;Web blogs;Web sites;bag-of-words approach;data training;feature vector;group development government;high dimensional data;short message classification;short message extraction;social networks;support vector machine;twitter microblog;twitter news classification","","8","","17","","","26-28 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As time goes on, more Chinese new words appear, these new words and their English translations are not collected in the bilingual dictionary used in the CLIR or machine translation system, so they belong to the OOV name entities. From observation, we know Chinese OOV name entities actually can be categorized into multiple types, so in this paper, we propose and implement an Chinese-English OOV translation mining system, and follow the divide and conquer strategy, we further categorize the Chinese OOV name entities into three types: Foreign word, Chinese name, and Chinese abbreviation, and then deal with them separately. When this system is combined with new word mining system, we can collect new name entities for the bilingual dictionary. From the experiment, we can observe that categorizing the Chinese OOV words helps find translations of OOV words and get a decent result.","","Electronic:978-89-94364-20-9; POD:978-1-4673-0876-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528661","OOV translation","","data mining;divide and conquer methods;information retrieval;language translation;natural language processing;vocabulary","CLIR;Chinese OOV name entities;Chinese abbreviation;Chinese name;Chinese-English OOV translation mining system;bilingual dictionary;cross language information retrieval;divide and conquer strategy;foreign word;machine translation system;out of vocabulary;word mining system","","0","","9","","","23-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
