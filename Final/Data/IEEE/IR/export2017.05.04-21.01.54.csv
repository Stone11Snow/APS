Color of object can play an important role in recognizing that object from the image. Different kinds of color spaces have been established and studied in the past for image retrieval. In this paper also we have studied hue, saturation and value (HSV) color space. We used a feature extraction technique based on the adaptive segmentation of the image using its color information. By using different ranges of hue, saturation and value, image is first classified into n number of areas, and then each area is partitioned into m number of segments. Our focus is in the domain of photographic images with an essentially unlimited range of topics.

Inst., Worcester, MA","IEEE INFOCOM 2009","20090602","2009","","","963","971","Distributed sensor data storage and retrieval has gained increasing popularity in recent years for supporting various applications. While distributed architecture enjoys a more robust and fault-tolerant wireless sensor network (WSN), such architecture also poses a number of security challenges especially when applied in mission-critical applications such as battle field and e-healthcare. First, as sensor data are stored and maintained by individual sensors and unattended sensors are easily subject to strong attacks such as physical compromise, it is significantly harder to ensure data security. Second, in many mission-critical applications, fine-grained data access control is a must as illegal access to the sensitive data may cause disastrous result and/or prohibited by the law. Last but not least, sensors usually are resource-scarce, which limits the direct adoption of expensive cryptographic primitives. To address the above challenges, we propose in this paper a distributed data access control scheme that is able to fulfill fine-grained access control over sensor data and is resilient against strong attacks such as sensor compromise and user colluding. The proposed scheme exploits a novel cryptographic primitive called attribute-based encryption (ABE), tailors, and adapts it for WSNs with respect to both performance and security requirements. The feasibility of the scheme is demonstrated by experiments on real sensor platforms. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to realize distributed fine-grained data access control for WSNs.","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:978-1-4244-3512-8","10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5062007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5062007","","Access control;Cryptography;Data security;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Memory;Mission critical systems;Robustness;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","access control;cryptography;wireless sensor networks","attribute-based encryption;battle field;distributed data access control;e-healthcare;fault tolerance;sensor data;wireless sensor networks","","17","","26","","","19-25 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This class of attacks relates to malicious activity of an intruder against applications, which use a database for storing data. The application uses SQL to retrieve data from the database and web server mechanisms to put them in a web browser. A poor implementation allows an attacker to modify SQL statements originally developed by a programmer, which leads to stealing or modifying data to which the attacker has not privileges. While the attack consists in modification of SQL queries sent to the database, they are the only one source of information used for detecting attacks. Intrusion detection problem is transformed into classification problem, which the objective is to classify SQL queries between either normal or malicious queries. GEP is used to find a function used for classification of SQL queries. Experimental results are presented on the basis of SQL queries of different length. The findings show that the efficiency of detecting SQL statements representing attacks depends on the length of SQL statements. Additionally we studied the impact of classification threshold on the obtained results.","1089-778X;1089778X","POD:978-1-4244-2958-5","10.1109/CEC.2009.4983190","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4983190","","Application software;Computer science;Data security;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intrusion detection;Phase detection;Web server","SQL;genetic algorithms;online front-ends;query processing;security of data","SQL;Web application attack detection;Web browser;Web server mechanisms;data retrieval;intrusion detection problem;metaheuristic gene expression programming","","2","","15","","","18-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DOM is a widely used data model for memory representation of the documents, but had shown some shortage in parsing and representing large or very large documents. Wasting resources and processing time overhead are results of applying large XML documents to the DOM parser. SGML is the XML parent. It was using GROVE (graph representation of property value) as its abstract data model to solve the problems that encountered into the SGML family and as a standardized data model that represents the information contained within the SGML document. Grove is defined formally by a data modeling language called property set. In this paper, the grove idea is popularized as a data model that might solve DOM's problems. The grove is being built by a grove builder. Using Grove will provide addressing and enable the messages between sites to specify which nodes are to be affected.

Local descriptors are used to describe the visual contents of an image. Image signatures and similarity retrieval are based on the images' color and texture features. The main motivation of the system design is to use simple and efficient techniques to maintain reasonable computational and storage cost. The proposed technique has three system components: feature extraction, image database indexing and similarity retrieval. First, the use of circular sectors is proposed to represent local first order moment for the color feature. In addition, a local direction technique is used for texture feature extraction. Secondly, the hash indexing of the images' color properties is used to map the database images into classes. Hash indexing speeds up the search and enhances the system scalability for large image databases. Thirdly, for similarity retrieval, a degree of similarity is defined based on a weighted sum of the color and texture features. In addition, the similarity retrieval incorporates a minimum accepted degree of similarity provided by the user. The test of similarity is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the index is used to directly hit a class to which the query image may belong. In the second stage, a detailed sequential search is performed to retrieve the most similar images within that class. The simple design of the system and experimental selection of system parameters guarantee that the system maintains reasonable storage and computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that the average precision of retrieved images is enhanced especially for higher accepted degrees of similarity.","2161-5322;21615322","POD:978-1-4244-3807-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2009.5069365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069365","CBIR;image databases;image feature extraction;image indexing;image signature;image similarity retrieval","Computational efficiency;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Scalability;Spatial databases;Testing","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;visual databases","WAY-LOOK4 system;content-based image retrieval;hash indexing;image database indexing;image signatures;query image;similarity retrieval;texture feature extraction","","2","","21","","","10-13 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The role of the RS is in assigning different colors to different covers of land to distinguish their existence and change with time and to allow all kinds of analysis.

"Meeting NERC requirements for oscillography and disturbance monitoring by collecting data from relays","C. Jones; D. Smith; J. Schnegg","American Electric Power, USA","2009 62nd Annual Conference for Protective Relay Engineers","20090527","2009","","","83","91","The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the region reliability councils have mandated electric utilities to monitor their power systems at critical locations throughout their system. The monitoring systems are to be phased into service by 2010. American Electric Power (AEP) and Tarigma Corporation with assistance from Schweitzer Engineering Laboratories, Inc. (SEL) have developed a disturbance monitoring system to provide an alternative to traditional monitoring equipment to meet these monitoring requirements. This paper will discuss the collection of event and synchrophasor data from relays to satisfy the NERC requirements for disturbance monitoring. Event data from relays on the AEP system is currently retrieved, stored locally and then moved to several server sites on the AEP system. This same approach will be taken with synchrophasors and allow AEP to use this data to meet the disturbance requirements mandated by NERC. Combining these two approaches provides the means for AEP to save millions of dollars by not having to purchase conventional recording equipment for their system in order to meet the NERC requirements. This approach provides a very cost-effective means of capturing event and disturbance data in stations that could typically justify the need for conventional recording equipment. Since this approach is a fraction of the cost of traditional disturbance monitoring equipment, monitoring can be justified in smaller stations. This paper addresses the challenges of retrieving the data from relays in a way that meets the NERC requirements. The economics of the traditional approach of collecting data versus using data captured by relays will be contrasted. Techniques for storing the data locally and moving the data efficiently and securely to corporate servers for engineering access will also be examined.","","POD:978-1-4244-4182-2","10.1109/CPRE.2009.4982505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4982505","","Councils;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Power engineering and energy;Power industry;Power system relaying;Power system reliability;Relays;Reliability engineering","SCADA systems;oscillographs;power engineering computing;power system control;power system management;power system measurement;power system relaying;power system reliability","NERC requirement;North American Electric Reliability Corporation;disturbance monitoring;oscillography monitoring;synchrophasor data","","0","","","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ALS project is a decennal joint effort led by researchers at the Dipartimento di Scienze Filologiche e Linguistiche of the University of Palermo that has the purpose to track and study the geo-linguistic and lexicographic processes about the function and usage of the Sicilian dialect.The main goal of the work described in this paper is to develop an information retrieval methodology that incorporates the directions of linguistic investigation embedded into the ALS questionnaire into a querying tool abstracting away from the intricacies of SQL or XML query constructs. We do this setting up a methodology and data retrieval tool that is scalable and general enough to allow, firstly, evaluation of linguistics' hypotheses about regional language and dialect evolution in space and time, and, secondly, to help discover new directions of investigation.This works presents the process of knowledge discovery. Starting from conceptualization of few basic ideas, concepts have been extracted from the DBMS through an XML-based mapping and used as building blocks for further investigations. The interaction with users is very intuitive, and the results are incrementally and automatically proposed to the researchers, who may determine to use them as new knowledge to maintain for further use or discard them.","","POD:978-1-4244-3569-2","10.1109/CISIS.2009.151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066774","ALS project;Knowledge Discovery;XML mapping;automatic query;relational database","Buildings;Competitive intelligence;Data mining;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Iterative methods;Ontologies;Relational databases;Software systems;XML","XML;data mining;database management systems;linguistics;query processing","ALSDB database;DBMS;Linguistic Atlas of Sicily project;Sicilian dialect;XML-based knowledge discovery;XML-based mapping;data pattern identification;data retrieval;geo-linguistic process;information overflow;information retrieval;intelligent systems;lexicographic process;querying tool;structured information","","2","","23","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe a novel procedure for making chroma features even more robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation while keeping their discriminative power. Our idea is based on the generally accepted observation that the lower mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) are closely related to timbre. Now, instead of keeping the lower coefficients, we discard them and only keep the upper coefficients. Furthermore, using a pitch scale instead of a mel scale allows us to project the remaining coefficients onto the twelve chroma bins. Our systematic experiments show that the resulting chroma features have indeed gained a significant boost towards timbre invariance.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959974","Chroma feature;MFCC;audio matching;music retrieval;timbre-invariance","Cepstral analysis;Cepstrum;Content based retrieval;Decorrelation;Harmonic analysis;Instruments;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Timbre","audio signal processing;information retrieval;music;pattern matching;spectral analysis","audio matching;chroma-based audio features;instrumentation;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;music data analysis;music retrieval;musical octave;pitch scale;spectral component identification;timbre changes","","5","","9","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These results suggest that complex-network theory can be a useful approach to the study of software systems. The special properties of SCNs provide a more repeatable and deterministic way to study the evolution and optimization of complex networks.

As for a dialog strategy, we introduced a new criterion based on efficiency in information retrieval and consistency with understanding hypotheses to select an appropriate system response. Using such criterion, the system removes the ambiguity so that users do not feel that a response that conflicts with the actual user intent is unnatural. We developed a spoken dialog system using these techniques and showed dialog examples in which misrecognition was naturally corrected.

Eng., Univ. of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA","2009 Data Compression Conference","20090526","2009","","","163","172","Volume visualization with random data access poses significant challenges. While tiling techniques lead to simple implementations, they are not well suited for cases where the goal is to access arbitrarily located subdimensional datasets (e.g., being able to display an arbitrary 2D planar ldquocutrdquo from a 3D volume). Significant effort has been devoted to volumetric data compression, with most techniques proposing to tile volumes into cuboid subvolumes to enable random access. In this paper we show that, in cases where subdimensional datasets are accessed, this leads to significant transmission inefficiency. As an alternative, we propose novel server-client based data representation and retrieval methods which can be used for fast random access of oblique plane from 3D volume datasets. In this paper, 3D experiments are shown but the approach may be extended to higher dimensional datasets. We use multiple redundant tilings of the 3D object, where each tiling has a different orientation.We discuss the 3D rectangular tiling scheme and two main algorithm components of such 3D system, namely, (i) a search algorithm to determine which tiles should be retrieved for a given query and (ii) a mapping algorithm to enable efficient encoding without interpolation of rotated tiles. In exchange for increased server storage, we demonstrate that significant reductions in average transmission rate can be achieved relative to conventional cubic tiling techniques, e.g., nearly 40% reduction in average transmission rate for less than a factor of twenty overhead in storage before compression. Note that, as shown in our earlier work on the 2D case, the storage overhead will be lower after compression (e.g., in 2D the relative increase in storage in the compressed domain was at least a factor of two lower than in the uncompressed domain).","1068-0314;10680314","POD:978-0-7695-3592-0","10.1109/DCC.2009.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4976460","fast random access;retrieval;tiling","Bandwidth;Biomedical imaging;Costs;Data compression;Data visualization;Displays;Image coding;Image storage;Information retrieval;Tiles","data compression;data structures;information retrieval","3D object datasets;average transmission rate;data retrieval methods;fast random access;fast random oblique plane access;mapping algorithm;overlapped tiling;server-client based data representation methods;subdimensional datasets;volume visualization","","1","","12","","","16-18 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the characteristics of data sets used by each of these research groups are remarkably different, it is not possible to compare the efficiency of these methods.

Distances are computed by a weighted measure, the weights being related to the capability of feature spaces of representing relevant images as nearest-neighbors. This approach is proposed to weights individual features, feature subsets, and also to weight relevance scores computed from different feature spaces.

Consequently, a more flexible and intelligent retrieval approach is required. The goal of this paper is to explore the scope of requirements and architectural options to solve this problem.

LACT is based on latent Dirichlet Allocation, an information retrieval method which is used to index and analyze source code documents as mixtures of probabilistic topics. For an initial evaluation, we performed two studies. In the first study, LACT was compared against an existing tool, MUDABlue, for classifying 41 software systems written in C into problem domain categories. The results indicate that LACT can automatically produce meaningful category names and yield classification results comparable to MUDABlue. In the second study, we applied LACT to 43 software systems written in different programming languages such as C/C++, Java, C#, PHP, and Perl. The results indicate that LACT can be used effectively for the automatic categorization of software systems regardless of the underlying programming language or paradigm. Moreover, both studies indicate that LACT can identify several new categories that are based on libraries, architectures, or programming languages, which is a promising improvement as compared to manual categorization and existing techniques.","2160-1852;21601852","POD:978-1-4244-3493-0","10.1109/MSR.2009.5069496","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5069496","","Computer architecture;Computer languages;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Java;Manuals;Open source software;Performance evaluation;Software libraries;Software systems","C language;information retrieval;public domain software;software architecture;software libraries","C language;LACT technique;MUDABlue;automatic categorization software system;information retrieval method;latent Dirichlet allocation;open-source repository;probabilistic topic model;programming language;software architecture;software library;source code document","","30","1","17","","","16-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a model is presented to estimate leaf area index (LAI) of reed canopy from TM or ETM+ image data firstly. The model classifies the background of reed canopy into soil and water, then calculates and output a lookup table (LUT). Following it, LAI mapping was conducted based on the BP neural network model, which was trained using the data of actual measurement and LUT. On the base of accurately inversing LAI, the paper monitored the oriental migratory locust plague using two temporal LAI data and found the hazard domain and extent. The conclusion was obtained from this study: on the basis of retrieving LAI precisely, through detecting the variation of two temporal TM data, we can monitor the hazard domain and extent of the oriental migratory locust plague well and truly.","","POD:978-0-7695-3563-0","10.1109/ETTandGRS.2008.184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070368","Leaf Area Index;Neural network;Oriental Migratory Locust;TM Data","Bidirectional control;Educational technology;Geoscience and remote sensing;Hazards;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Reflectivity;Remote monitoring;Soil;Table lookup","backpropagation;environmental science computing;hazards;monitoring;table lookup;vegetation mapping","BP neural network;LAI mapping;geographic scale;hazard domain;leaf area index;locust population dynamics monitoring;lookup table;oriental migratory locust plague;reed canopy;remote sensing;temporal TM data","","0","","7","","","21-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We study the actual data collected from a disk drive manufacturing company. Our work emphasizes the HGA manufacturing data. However, the data from the Wafer and the Slider processes are also explored as they may affect the yield of the HGA production. In our algorithm, the data is first retrieved from the data warehouse, and then pre-processed using the regular data cleaning techniques. The critical external and internal data from all operations that are related to the HGA production (machine parameters and product attributes) are used as inputs in our algorithm. The data preparation steps are added to improve the raw data quality. Subsequently, our decision tree technique is employed to categorize decision options that indicate problems on the actual manufacturing environment. Finally, the root causes of the yield degradation will be identified in three categories of attributes (machine, material and method). The data analysts in a HDD company can use this tool to automatically summarize the problems on the manufacturing line. Yield can then be improved by adjusting parameters and/or attributes as suggested by the algorithm. In this paper, we also describe the algorithm through a simple example. Further study will be performed and the experiments will be elaborated in the near future.","","POD:978-1-4244-3569-2","10.1109/CISIS.2009.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066772","Data Mining;Decision Tree;Fault Pattern Analysis;HDD Manufacturing;Yield Improvement","Algorithm design and analysis;Cleaning;Data warehouses;Decision trees;Degradation;Disk drives;Information retrieval;Manufacturing;Pattern analysis;Production","assembling;data analysis;data warehouses;decision trees;disc drives;electronic equipment manufacture;fault diagnosis;hard discs;magnetic heads","C4.5 decision tree technique;HDD company;HGA manufacturing data;HGA production;data analysis;data cleaning techniques;data warehouse;disk drive manufacturing company;fault pattern analysis algorithm;raw data quality","","0","","14","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve the transparence, tremendous computing power is in need not only in WLAN where users access directly but also in the Internet where information is retrieved and sent. Bandwidth is crucial to improve userpsilas transparent experience when providing services such as video on demand. Network processors (NPs) are specialized design for fast packet processing to achieve a broad bandwidth. The banked register file on NPs is to provide operands parallel fetching and support a large number of registers to reduce memory access, whereas it may also impose some restrictions and problems. This paper discusses the dual-bank register allocation problem for Intelpsilas network processor IXP. Its register file is physically partitioned into two banks. If two source operands are specified in an instruction, they must come from different banks. This makes the IXP register allocator, which allocates registers and assigns bank, tricky and different from conventional ones. We first present an algorithm that provides optimal solution to the graph partition problem. Then a framework for IXP register allocation is established with it. Experimental result shows the framework is effective in practice.","","POD:978-1-4244-3569-2","10.1109/CISIS.2009.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066849","","Bandwidth;Delay;Information retrieval;Internet;Pervasive computing;Registers;Streaming media;Ubiquitous computing;Video on demand;Wireless LAN","Internet;storage management;ubiquitous computing","IXP register allocation;Internet;WLAN;banked register file;dual-bank register allocation;graph partition problem;network processor;packet processing;parallel fetching;ubiquitous computing","","0","","13","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, automatic object segmentation is a hard work, for it is difficult for computer to determine which is object and which is not automatically. In this paper, a novel segmentation algorithm for color image was proposed, this algorithm needs ones to identify an object contained area firstly,and then a 3-D color histogram is calculated to represent the sub-image and background, at last, object can be segmented through compare the distance between object and background. This entire based on such a hypothesis:in expand of sub-image the background gray value probability distributes is continuous. This algorithm avoids the disadvantage in color image segmentation of conventional methods.

In this paper, we focus on the modeling of chord sequences by probabilistic N-grams. Previous studies using these models have achieved limited success, due to overfitting and to the use of a single chord labeling scheme. We investigate these issues using model smoothing and selection techniques initially designed for spoken language modeling. This approach is evaluated over a set of songs by The Beatles, considering several chord labeling schemes. Initial results show that the accuracy of N-grams is increased but that additional improvements may still be achieved in the future using more advanced, possibly music-specific, smoothing techniques.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959518","Music;N-grams;model selection;model smoothing;probabilistic modeling","Dictionaries;Hidden Markov models;History;Labeling;Music information retrieval;Natural languages;Robustness;Smoothing methods;Testing;Training data","information retrieval;music;probability;smoothing methods","audio-to-symbolic music transcription;automatic style identification;computer-assisted composition;model smoothing techniques;musical chord sequences;polyphonic music retrieval;probabilistic N-grams;single chord labeling scheme","","8","","9","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, color histogram and color changing ratio are used for computing a similarity measure in this paper.

The challenge of this problem concerns the big heterogeneity of the multimedia indexation algorithms and the weak semantic aspect they address. Our solution considers a generic interface for the indexation algorithms, an implementation as Web services, as well as a semantic description in terms of WSMO (Web Service Modeling Ontology) of their functionality and orchestration. Original contribution of the article concerns the idea of organizing the various multimedia metadata types into a generic structure,used to express the user queries, the algorithms' generic interface, as well as the algorithms' WSMO metadata. This approach facilitates the definition of algorithm combination rules, and enables the reduction of the multimedia retrieval task to a metadata matching process.","","POD:978-1-4244-3569-2","10.1109/CISIS.2009.180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5066946","Multimedia indexing;Semantic Web services;algorithm generic interface","Competitive intelligence;Content based retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Ontologies;Software algorithms;Software systems;Vocabulary;Web services","Web services;database indexing;meta data;multimedia databases;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Web service modeling ontology;Web services orchestration solution;generic structure;metadata matching process;multimedia indexation algorithms;multimedia metadata;multimedia retrieval task;semantic description;semantic multimedia indexing;semantic multimedia retrieval;user complex queries","","1","","5","","","16-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Making synchronization customizable is highly desirable as different deployment scenarios of the same program often prioritize synchronization choices differently. Unfortunately, such customizations cannot be accomplished in the conventional non-modular implementation of synchronization. To enable customizability, we present FlexSync, an aspect oriented synchronization library, to enable the modular reasoning and the declarative specification of synchronization. Complex Java systems can simultaneously work with multiple synchronization mechanisms without any code changes. The FlexSync load-time weaver performs deployment time optimizations and ensures these synchronization mechanisms consistently interact with each other and with the core system. We evaluated FlexSync on commercially used complex Java systems and observed significant speedups as a result of the deployment-specific customization.","0270-5257;02705257","POD:978-1-4244-3453-4","10.1109/ICSE.2009.5070537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5070537","","Buffer storage;Buildings;Concurrent computing;Data structures;Delay;Fluctuations;Information retrieval;Java;Software libraries;Yarn","Java;object-oriented programming;optimisation","Java synchronization;aspect-oriented approach;concurrent program;nonmodular implementation;optimization","","3","","23","","","16-24 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
