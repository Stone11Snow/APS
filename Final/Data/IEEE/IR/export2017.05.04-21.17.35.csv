We introduce ontology to capture the semantic relations between words, which provide a solution for ambiguity and richness of natural language. The index scheme proposed in this paper transforms the keyword search to the match process of concepts, and implementing keyword search based on semantic.

The adaptation technique is implemented by making use of the MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation specification. The approach is validated for five different scalable coding formats.

However, it suffers from the problem that the query concept is diverse and the numbers of the positive and the negative images are imbalanced. As a consequence, the positive samples obtained by active learning are inadequate, which degrades the learning efficiency. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel method based on angle-diversity and hyperplane shifting to increase the number of positive images in the active learning results.

Many indexing methods were proposed to index the spatial data efficiently. All these methods use several heuristics to index spatial data efficiently. The performance efficiency of a spatial data indexing structure is usually evaluated by the ability to answer queries by accessing the smallest possible number of pages in the disk. Today, research in this field has turned towards the development of powerful analytical methods to predict the performance of the spatial data indexing structures for arbitrary inputs. While several diverging approaches are made to address this issue, approaches based on estimating the MBR extents have gained momentum and are applicable to generic data rather than data belonging to specific domains. This paper proposes improvements to those methods that estimate the length of extents of MBRs to predict the number of disk access that are required to answer a window query.

Retrieved quantities are the fractional cloud coverage of the GOME footprint, the cloud-top albedo, and the cloud-top height. A data fusion technique is applied to calculate the fractional cloud cover of GOME footprints from GOME's polarization measurement devices. Furthermore, cloud-top albedo and cloud-top height are retrieved simultaneously from GOME measurements around the oxygen A-band by a neural network approach. We compare our results with corresponding results from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) radiometer onboard the first European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) METEOSAT Second Generation 1 geostationary spacecraft. Our analysis revealed that GOME-derived basic cloud properties are of remarkably high quality. GOME slightly underestimates the cloud coverage of footprints, which was expected since GOME is mainly sensitive to optically thick water clouds. GOME measurements are limited to the ultraviolet and visible part of the solar spectrum, which hampers the detection of optically thin clouds. For both the cloud-top height and the cloud-top albedo, we found a small bias relative to SEVIRI results. The overall uncertainty of retrieved total ozone columns with respect to cloud parameters is about 1%-2%.

In this paper we address the diversity of programming interfaces for link layer information as well as sensor measurement data as one of the few critical problems that have not in our opinion been addressed thoroughly enough. We propose the use of the unified link-layer API (ULLA) for wireless sensor networks. It offers a common interface to retrieve link layer information independently of the deployed radio technology considerably simplifying development process of link-aware protocols and applications. The ULLA can be used not only by applications running locally on sensor nodes but also remotely by applications running in an end-user device. Additionally, ULLA allows to retrieve sensor readings via the same convenient interface. The interface offers a powerful notification mechanism, which can be used to monitor the sensor network and trigger certain actions when either the communication environment changed, for instance an ad hoc route disappeared, or the sensor readings pass a threshold, e.g. usable for fire-alarm. These features essentially generalize the approach taken by TinyDB to include link-layer information as well, and further extend the abstraction of the sensor network as a database. A prototype implementation of ULLA on Telos B motes has been made to demonstrate the feasibility of the ULLA approach. The footprint of the implementation is very acceptable, and performance offered sufficient even for protocols taking per-packet decisions based on link conditions.

Rich visual information is often thrown away in basic annotation-based image retrieval because its relationship to the semantic content is not always clear. To ensure that appropriate visual information is included, we propose using visual clustering within pre-processing and post-processing steps of text-based retrieval. A clustering algorithm finds pairs of images that are nearly identical and are, therefore, presumed semantically similar. The output from basic retrieval systems is a ranked list of images based only on lexical term matching. The obtained cluster knowledge is then used to modify the ranking result during the post-processing step. Low ranked images considered nearly identical to more highly ranked images are then pulled up. The modularity of this architecture allows us to integrate a data mining process without having to change core information retrieval systems. Evaluation on a cross-language image retrieval test collection showed that this method improved retrieval performance for certain queries in multilingual settings.","","POD:0-7695-2847-3","10.1109/AINAW.2007.251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221078","","Clustering algorithms;Content based retrieval;Context;Data mining;Database languages;Image retrieval;Informatics;Information retrieval;Testing;Visual communication","computational linguistics;data mining;image matching;image retrieval;information retrieval systems;pattern clustering;text analysis","annotation-based image retrieval;data mining process;information retrieval system;lexical term matching;multilingual image retrieval;semantic content;text-based retrieval;visual clustering algorithm;visual knowledge mining","","1","","8","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike from the traditional tuple or page-based caching systems, semantic caching systems exploit the idea of reusing cached query results to answer new queries based on the query containment and rewriting techniques.

TVM is a sequence of 3D models made for real-world dynamic objects. In TVM, detailed information of 3D objects such as shape, color, and motion is stored. Therefore, TVM is an attractive technology for the next-generation multimedia. However, the management of TVM database for archiving and retrieving is a significant problem because it is difficult to locate and track feature points in TVM. For efficient and effective archive and retrieval systems, motion extraction and tracking is essential. In our approach, skeletons are extracted from TVM using Reeb graph, and motion tracking is achieved by fitting a reference skeleton to the others. We defined a geodesic function using principal component analysis (PCA) for fast and noiseless skeleton extraction. Robust fitting has been realized by an end node tracking strategy. In addition, we have developed an efficient motion retrieval system compatible to conventional motion capture (mocap) data using the extracted skeleton. As a result, low-cost query generation using mocap systems and cross search between TVM and mocap data have been achieved.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4285074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285074","","Biological system modeling;Costs;Data mining;Humans;Information retrieval;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Skeleton;Spatial databases;Tracking","computer animation;differential geometry;graph theory;information retrieval;mesh generation;principal component analysis","Reeb-graph-based skeleton fitting;fast motion tracking;geodesic function;motion extraction;motion retrieval;next-generation multimedia;principal component analysis;real-world dynamic objects;robust motion tracking;skeleton extraction;time-varying mesh","","7","","13","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the problem of subtopic segmentation by proposing a fuzzy model for the semantics of both words and sentences. The model has three characteristics. First, it can deal with the uncertainty in the semantics of words and sentences. Secondly, it can measure the fuzzy similarity between the fuzzy semantics of sentences. Thirdly, it can develop a fuzzy algorithm for segmenting a text into several subtopic segments. The experiments, especially for a short text with a small corpus in a specific domain, indicate that the method can efficiently increase the accuracy of subtopic segmentation over previous methods.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2006.889911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286978","Fuzzy modeling;fuzzy semantics;semantic similarity measurement;small corpus;topic segmentation","Broadcasting;Computer errors;Computer science;Councils;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Internet;Multidimensional systems;Uncertainty","fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;text analysis;word processing","automatic summarization;corpus subtopic segmentation;essay scoring;fuzzy algorithm;fuzzy semantics;fuzzy similarity;information retrieval;text segmentation","","0","","31","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes an ontology-based software component description scheme with OWL Web ontology language. In this scheme, the component description information that is provided by user is associated with ontology to present semantic meaning, which builds the foundation for semantic reasoning in the component retrieval process. The semantic-based software component retrieval system is also constructed in this paper. This approach can retrieve component based on semantic description of the components. The whole approach extends the software reusable library to the World Wide Web.

A relevance feedback information retrieval process usually includes several rounds of query refinement. Each round incurs exchange of tens of images between the mobile device and the server. With limited wireless bandwidth, this process can incur substantial delay making the system unfriendly to use. We address this issue by considering a client-side relevance feedback (CRF) technique. Since relevance feedback is done on client side, system response is instantaneous significantly enhancing system usability. Furthermore, since the server is not involved in relevance feedback processing, it is able to support thousands more users simultaneously.

To solve this problem, a novel pre-aggregation algorithm, MDHEGA (Grouping Aggregation based on the Multi- dimension Hierarchical Encoding ) ,is proposed in this paper. By using the small multi-dimension hierarchical encoding and their prefix path, MDHEGA can rapidly retrieve the matching dimension hierarchical encoding and evaluate the set of query ranges for each dimension. As a result, the algorithm can greatly reduce the disk I/Os and highly improve the efficiency of OLAP queries.

The huge increase in amount of information present on Web poses new challenges in clustering regarding to underlying data model and nature of clustering algorithm. Document clustering techniques mostly rely on single term analysis of document data set. To achieve more accurate document clustering, more informative feature such as phrases are important in this scenario. Hence first part of the paper presents phrase-based model, Document Index Graph (DIG), which allows incremental phrase-based encoding of documents and efficient phrase matching. It emphasizes on effectiveness of phrase-based similarity measure over traditional single term based similarities. In the second part, a Document Index Graph based Clustering (DIGBC) algorithm is proposed to enhance the DIG model for incremental and soft clustering. This algorithm incrementally clusters documents based on proposed cluster-document similarity measure. It allows assignment of a document to more than one cluster. The DIGBC algorithm is more efficient as compared to existing clustering algorithms such as single pass, K-NN and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC) algorithm.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0716-8; POD:1-4244-0715-X","10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4289851","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data analysis;Data models;Educational institutions;Encoding;HTML;Information retrieval;Text analysis;Web sites","Internet;encoding;information retrieval","Web document clustering;document index graph;information retrieval;phrase matching;phrase-based encoding;phrase-based similarity;soft clustering","","3","1","8","","","20-23 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, generalized constraints are proposed to specify the attribute values associated with nouns by means of adjectives. Then, after recognizing a noun phrase in a sentence, it could be transformed into a generalized constraint. This way, a lot of data could be retrieved from documents in NL, and used to deduce new information. Protoforms allow describing the deep semantic structure of propositions.

In certain circumstance, however, users concern more about objects of their interest and only wish to retrieve images containing relevant objects, while ignoring irrelevant image areas (such as the background). Previous work on retrieval of objects of user's interest (OUT) normally requires complicated segmentation of the object from the background. In this paper, we propose a method that utilize color, texture and shape features of a user specified window containing the OUI to retrieve relevant images, whereas complicated image segmentation is avoided. We use color moments and subband statistics of wavelet decomposition as color and texture features respectively. The similarity is first calculated using these features. Then shape features, generated by mathematical morphology operators, are further employed to produce the final retrieval results. We use a wide range of color images for the experiments and evaluate the performance of the proposed method in different color spaces, including RGB, HSV, YCbCr. Although simple, the method has produced promising results.","","POD:0-7695-2909-7","10.1109/SNPD.2007.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287606","","Artificial intelligence;Content based retrieval;Distributed computing;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Shape;Software engineering;Statistics","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;mathematical morphology;wavelet transforms","HSV;RGB;YCbCr;candidate images;color moments;content-based image retrieval;feature extraction;mathematical morphology;query image;subband statistics;user interest;wavelet decomposition","","8","","6","","","July 30 2007-Aug. 1 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We explore the possibility of using Web services composition for network management considering two approaches: in the first one a single device needs to be contacted and its information composed; in the second one, many devices need to be contacted and the information retrieved from them need to be composed. We show that using proper tools one can not only really use Web services composition for network management, but also that such use can be integrated with traditional management technologies that are unlike to be abandoned in short and mid terms. Moreover, we investigate the performance of Web services compositions for network management considering response time and network traffic. Performance investigations are crucial because Web services protocols are based on plain text XML documents and impose a processing overhead, which may prevent their adoption depending on the requirements and limitations of the management environment.","1550-3607;15503607","POD:1-4244-0353-7","10.1109/ICC.2007.323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4288994","","Communications Society;Delay;IP networks;Informatics;Information management;Information retrieval;Simple object access protocol;Technology management;Telecommunication traffic;Web services","Web services;XML;computer network management;protocols","Web services composition;performance evaluation;plain text XML documents;processing overhead;simple network management protocol","","6","","13","","","24-28 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three steps are made. Firstly, when a user submits a query request to a query node, a process of character set reduction is performed using iDistance index in different data nodes, followed by sending the candidate characters to the executing nodes through a package-based transfer technique. Secondly, a refinement process of the candidate characters is conducted in the executing nodes in parallel to get the answer set. Finally, the answer set is transferred to the query node. The proposed method incorporates a uniform-start- distance-based character data allocation policy and character reduction algorithm. The analysis and experimental results show that the performance of the algorithm is effective in minimizing the response time by decreasing network transfer cost and increasing the parallelism of I/O and CPU.","2160-4908;21604908","POD:0-7695-2871-6","10.1109/GCC.2007.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293822","","Bandwidth;Computer science;Costs;Databases;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Neodymium;Packaging;Parallel processing","grid computing;query formulation;query processing","Chinese calligraphic character databases;character reduction algorithm;character set reduction;data grid;data-grid-based k nearest neighbor query;iDistance index;query request;retrieval efficiency;similarity queries;uniform-start-distance-based character data allocation policy","","1","","20","","","16-18 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our image representation, the object is described as a constellation of GCs, where each one encodes information about some local part and the spatial relations from this part to others (that is, the part's context). We show how such a representation can be used with fast procedures that learn the object category with weak supervision and efficiently match the model of the object against large collections of images. In the learning stage, we show that, by integrating our representation with Boosting, the system is able to obtain a compact model that is represented by very few features, where each feature conveys key properties about the object's parts and their spatial arrangement. In the matching step, we propose direct procedures that exploit our representation for efficiently considering spatial coherence between the matching of local parts. Combined with an appropriate data organization such as inverted files, we show that thousands of images can be evaluated efficiently. The framework has been applied to different standard databases, and we show that our results are favorably compared against state-of-the-art methods in both computational cost and accuracy.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293210","boosting;contextual information;object recognition;retrieval;spatial pattern","Boosting;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image recognition;Image representation;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Principal component analysis;Spatial coherence;Spatial databases","image matching;image representation;image retrieval;object recognition;visual databases","Boosting;context-based object-class recognition;data organization;generalized correlograms;image representation;object category;object matching;spatial arrangement;spatial coherence;standard databases","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Documentation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Statistics as Topic","31","2","36","","","Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Selection of appropriate resources for executing the user jobs is one of the most important features of any grid environment because non-optimal resource selection may spoil the ultimate objective of the grid environment. User describes its request for resources using some resource specification language. These specifications lead to a lot of ambiguities in resource description which may lead to selection of undesired resources. The resources with attribute values too higher than the required values can be selected with existing matchmaking mechanisms. This is not optimal and may leads to wastage of resources. In existing matchmaking mechanisms, all the resource attributes are treated equally whether they have great impact on better execution of user job or not. This paper suggests an intelligent matchmaking mechanism which uses fuzzy logic to select most appropriate resources for user jobs according to user specified criteria. It also helps to select most reliable resources as well.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0893-8; POD:1-4244-0892-X","10.1109/ICEE.2007.4287316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287316","","Art;Boolean functions;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Resource management;Specification languages;Supercomputers;Writing","fuzzy logic;grid computing;resource allocation","fuzzy logic;grid environment;intelligent matchmaking mechanism;optimal resource selection;resource specification language","","0","","11","","","11-12 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though emphasis is on the case of a single inclusion, enabling the derivation of closed-form mathematical results in illuminating fashion, the approach extends to the case of (an unknown number of) well-separated inclusions. Within an asymptotic field formulation derived from exact contrast-source vector integral formulations satisfied by the time-harmonic fields and using proper reciprocity relationships of the dyadic Green's functions, the multistatic response matrix of the inclusion is constructed from the leading-order term of the fields. Its singular value structure is analyzed in detail for a dielectric or a magnetic contrast, or both contrasts. This is performed in the case of a unique electric dipole array operated in the transmit/receive mode at a single frequency.

Prior work has focused on hard-and soft-modeling of query classes and learning weights for each class, while the class partition is either manually defined or learned from data but still insensitive to the testing query. We propose a query-dependent fusion strategy that dynamically generates a class among the training queries that are closest to the testing query, based on light-weight query features defined on the outcome of semantic analysis on the query text. A set of optimal weights are then learned on the dynamic class, which aims to model both the co-occurring query features and unusual test queries. Used in conjunction with the rest of our multimodal retrieval system, dynamic query classes performs favorably with hard and soft query classes, and the system performance improves upon the best automatic search run of TRECVID05 and TRECVID06 by 34% and 8%, respectively.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284946","","Engines;Fusion power generation;Government;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Multimedia communication;System performance;Tellurium;Testing;Web search","query processing;video retrieval;video signal processing","dynamic multimodal fusion;information-retrieval problem;multimodal search;query-dependent fusion strategy;semantic analysis;video search","","7","2","10","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data are represented by a finite mixture model based on the generalized Dirichlet distribution. The generalized Dirichlet distribution has a more general covariance structure than the Dirichlet distribution and offers high flexibility and ease of use for the approximation of both symmetric and asymmetric distributions. This makes the generalized Dirichlet distribution more practical and useful. An important problem in mixture modeling is the determination of the number of clusters. Indeed, a mixture with too many or too few components may not be appropriate to approximate the true model. Here, we consider the application of the minimum message length (MML) principle to determine the number of clusters. The MML is derived so as to choose the number of clusters in the mixture model that best describes the data. A comparison with other selection criteria is performed. The validation involves synthetic data, real data clustering, and two interesting real applications: classification of Web pages, and texture database summarization for efficient retrieval.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2007.1095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293203","AIC;EM;Finite mixture models;LEC;MDL;MML;data clustering;generalized Dirichlet mixture;image database summarization;information theory;webmining","Bayesian methods;Computer vision;Image databases;Information retrieval;Information theory;Pattern recognition;Stochastic processes;Unsupervised learning;Web mining;Web pages","data handling;data structures;unsupervised learning","Web page classification;asymmetric distribution approximation;data representation;finite generalized Dirichlet mixture model estimation;general covariance structure;generalized Dirichlet distribution;high-dimensional data;high-dimensional unsupervised selection;minimum message length;mixture modeling;real data clustering;synthetic data;texture database summarization","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Natural Language Processing;Pattern Recognition, Automated","70","","69","","","Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our multi-modality ontology, which integrates both image features and text information, is extended to provide a ranking mechanism. Ranking is calculated from correlation in each modality and is used to refine the semantic matchmaking result. To benchmark our results, we use the top 200 images of Google Image Search for each category to do the experimental comparison. Google Image Search claims to be the most comprehensive on the Web, with billions of images indexed and available for viewing. For different categories of animals in the canine family, we found averages of about 60% of top 200 images are correct images. Google returns even more false results outside this range. Therefore any bigger image set will become meaningless in our experiment. The medium size of the data set is fine since we are testing the retrieval performance on web images and concerned mainly with the precision of top retrievals. We believe the canine domain is challenging as demonstrated by the visual variance of objects and backgrounds. Twenty animal categories, containing animal images and corresponding web pages, are collected to form a systematic animal family. Results show that we can classify perceptually close animal species which share similar appearances as we can infer their hidden relationships from the canine family graph. By assigning a ranking to the semantic relationships we show unequivocal evidence that our improved model achieves good accuracy.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284700","Multi-Modality Ontology;Ranking Correlation;Semantic Matchmaking;Web Image Retrieval","Animals;Biomedical imaging;Image retrieval;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Taxonomy;Testing;Tree data structures;Web pages","Internet;image classification;image retrieval","Google Image Search;multimodality ontology;semantic matchmaking;semantic retrieval system","","3","","6","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of this migration is to permit an easy mapping of the existing data, schemas and programs, while integrating the different fuzzy concepts. This paper presents two migration strategies. The first one, named ""partial migration"", is useful to introduce fuzzy queries in RDB without changing existing data. The ""total migration"" is the second migration strategy which offers in addition to the flexible querying, the possibility to store imprecise data.

An image retrieval method combined color and texture features is proposed in this paper. According to image texture characteristic, a kind of image feature statistic is defined. By using feature weight assignment operators designed here, the method can assign weight to color and texture features according to image content adaptively and realize image retrieval based on combined image features.

However, the direct distributions of queries into the network will cause a large traffic overhead and high energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a localized query forwarding scheme based on the processing of query's name. In contrast to the conventional distributions of data query message, a query's name is resolved into the IDs of corresponding group of sensor nodes before being distributed to the network. Therefore, the query is efficiently forwarded into the network within a localized area. The proposed approaches highly reduce the query overhead in the network and save the energy consumption of sensor nodes.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-1178-5; POD:1-4244-1177-7","10.1109/ITST.2007.4295886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4295886","Attribute;Localized Area;Query;Sensor Network","Capacitive sensors;Communications technology;Electronic mail;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Multicast protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","data communication;query processing;wireless sensor networks","data query;energy consumption;localized query forwarding scheme;message distribution scheme;sensor networks;traffic overhead","","0","","7","","","6-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The challenge in VoD application is to stream uninterrupted, synchronous and good quality multimedia data from a video server to a user over a high-speed network. Large number of concurrent users accessing a VoD system present a generic problem because of the load imposed on the video server. In this context, buffer management plays a critical role in retrieval and transfer of data. It also ensures that all the requests are guaranteed a sufficient amount of the buffer in order to improve the efficiency of the video server by reducing the initial latency. We have performed extensive analysis of the buffer requirements and conducted several runs of simulation experiment. The results show that preemption-based buffer allocation (PBBA) scheme reduces initial latency (over the number of user requests in service from one to maximum capacity) to twice that of the conventional scheme and the reneging probability is 5% to 6% with the mean reneging time of 30 seconds. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance of the video-on-demand system.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0716-8; POD:1-4244-0715-X","10.1109/ADCOM.2006.4289948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4289948","Bandwidth;Buffer management;Initial latency;Reneging probability;Video-on-Demand system","Bandwidth;Buffer storage;Delay;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Maintenance engineering;Microprocessors;Network servers;Streaming media;Video sharing","multimedia systems;resource allocation;storage management;video on demand;video streaming","buffer management;high-speed network;mean reneging time;multimedia data;preemption-based buffer allocation;reneging probability;video server;video-on-demand system","","0","","9","","","20-23 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Majority of the users' requests requires retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image. In image databases, images are represented by symbolic images. Spatial relationships in a symbolic image are represented by 2D strings. In Image Database Systems, conventionally 2D strings that are converted into triples represent symbolic pictures or objects. A unique hash address is assigned to each triple, which represents the picture. It serves the purpose of retrieval of images by reducing pattern matching. The calculation of new unique hash keys for all triples is required while inserting new image. In order to overcome these problems we present a solution in this paper that is the concept of a 3D hash function which speeds up the computation of the associated values for the picture objects.","","POD:0-7695-2928-3","10.1109/CGIV.2007.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293695","2D string;3D hash function;Image database systems;image retrieval;perfect hashing function","Image converters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Pattern matching;Spatial databases;Visual databases","image retrieval;pattern matching;visual databases","2D strings;3D hash function;image database systems;image retrieval;pattern matching;symbolic pictures","","1","","18","","","14-17 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme for keyword-searchable encryption is considered as one of crucial building blocks that solves the security problems of privacy and data confidentiality in many settings, such as outsourced database systems and mail (or file) servers. However, most existing schemes support only a single keyword for searching, but do not allow for boolean combinations of keywords. It makes the use of schemes impractical in real applications. To address this problem, we propose an efficient construction for conjunctive keyword-searchable encryption, in which the size of trapdoors is almost same as that for searching a single keyword. Our construction is proven secure against adaptive chosen-keyword attacks in the random oracle model under the external co-Diffie-Hellman assumption.

Replica selection is one important problem in replication optimization, because Grid application may need to retrieve data from many distributed nodes and do computation on their own local machine in parallel. In this paper, we focus on how to determine an appropriate set of replicas that at least cover the data, and farthest utilize the system parallel computing capacity.
