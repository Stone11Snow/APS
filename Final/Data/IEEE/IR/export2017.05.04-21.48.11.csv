Unlike conventional databases, scientific data is mostly read-only and its volume can reach to the order of petabytes, making a compact index structure vital. Bitmap indexing has been successfully applied to scientific databases by exploiting the fact that scientific data are enumerated or numerical. Bitmap indices can be compressed with valiants of run length encoding for a compact index structure. However even this may not be enough for the enormous data generated in some applications such as high energy physics. In this paper, we study how to reorganize bitmap tables for improved compression rates. Our algorithms are used just as a preprocessing step, thus there is no need to reuse the current indexing techniques and the query processing algorithms. We introduce the tuple reordering problem, which aims to reorganize database tuples for optimal compression rates. We propose Gray code ordering algorithm for this NP-Complete problem, which is an in-place algorithm, and runs in linear time in the order of the size of the database. We also discuss how the tuple reordering problem can be reduced to the traveling salesperson problem.

Celebrating the Past ... Teaming Toward the Future (IEEE Cat. No.03CH37492)","20050418","2003","1","","210 Vol.1","","Summary form only given. The WindSat payload on the Coriolis satellite produces approximately 200 MBytes of data per orbit, or 3.0 GB per day. The WindSat team has developed a Ground Data Processing Software (GDPS) to process 100% of available downlink data, providing accurate and precise data products as dictated by the WindSat mission requirements. The GDPS consists of four main processors: the Raw Data Record Processor (RDRP), the Temperature Data Record Processor (TDRP), the Sensor Data Record (SDRP), and the Environmental Data Record Processor (RDRP). The RDRP receives the WindSat data stream, including receiver, calibration, housekeeping and spacecraft attitude data. The RDRP decodes, unpacks, reformats and merges these data in preparation for further the remaining processing. The TDRP receives the formatted data and provides the first four critical functions. First the TDRP calibrates the raw counts into radiances using the calibration target measurements and the sensor calibration constants file. Then, each channel is geolocated using the scan angle, spacecraft attitude and ephemeris, and the antenna pointing offsets. Using the spacecraft ephemeris and an ionosphere model, the Faraday rotation is calculated. The Faraday rotation angle and the spacecraft attitude and ephemeris are then used to calculate various antenna parameters, such as the earth incidence angle, the polarization rotation angle and the surface compass azimuth angle, which describes the sensor look direction on the surface. These data are forwarded on to the SDRP. The next level of processing occurs in the SDRP, which forms the third and fourth elements Stokes parameters by taking the difference of the appropriate polarizations. The antenna pattern correction (APC) follows, using stored cross-coupling correction matrices and feed spillover efficiencies. Because each frequency set has a different beamwidth and relative pointing, the final stage of the SDRP resamples and averages the beams to- yield collocated pixels at a common resolution. This is the highest level of phase 1 (brightness temperature) processing before the EDRP. The EDRP provides the WindSat Level 2 processing. The inputs to the EDRP are the calibrated, geolocated, co-registered WindSat Stokes parameters at 10.7, 18.7, and 37 GHz, and the vertical and horizontally polarized brightness temperatures at 6.8 and 23.8 GHz. These sets of 16 quantities form the basic measurement vector for the retrieval. The primary retrieval algorithm is an optimal estimation technique that simultaneously solves for ocean surface wind speed and direction, as well as sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric parameters such a precipitable water vapor, rain rate and cloud liquid water.","","POD:0-933957-30-0","10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282430","","Calibration;Data processing;Economic indicators;Information retrieval;Ocean temperature;Polarization;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Space vehicles;Temperature sensors","Faraday effect;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;clouds;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic techniques;rain;wind","10.7 GHz;18.7 GHz;23.8 GHz;37 GHz;6.8 GHz;Antenna Pattern Correction;Coriolis satellite;Environmental Data Record Processor;Faraday rotation angle;Ground Data Processing Software;Raw Data Record Processor decode;Sensor Data Record;Stokes parameters;Temperature Data Record Processor;WindSat mission;WindSat-ground data processing;antenna pointing offsets;atmospheric parameters;basic measurement vector;brightness temperature;calibration target measurements;cloud liquid water;downlink data;ionosphere model;ocean surface wind speed;polarization rotation angle;precipitable water vapor;radiances;rain rate;receiver;sea surface temperature;spacecraft attitude;spacecraft attitude data;spacecraft ephemeris;stored cross-coupling correction matrices;surface compass azimuth angle;wind retrieval algorithm;yield collocated pixels","","0","","","","","22-26 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conversational recommenders guide a user through a sequence of iterations, suggesting specific items, and using feedback from users to refine their suggestions in subsequent iterations. Different recommender systems look for different types of feedback from users. In this paper we examine the role of critiquing, a form of feedback in which the user indicates a preference over a particular feature of a recommended item. For example, when shopping for a PC a user might indicate that they like the current suggestion but they are looking for something ""cheaper""; ""cheaper"" is a critique over the price feature of the PC case. Sometimes it is useful to critique multiple features simultaneously (compound critiques). In this paper we describe how a recommender can automatically discover useful compound critiques during the recommendation session and how these critiques can be used to improve recommendation efficiency.","","POD:0-7695-2100-2","10.1109/WI.2004.10098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410796","","Adaptive filters;Computer science;Educational institutions;Feedback;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Read-write memory;Recommender systems;User centered design","","","","5","","14","","","20-24 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, image retrieval using color features often gives disappointing results because in many cases, images with similar colors do not have similar content.

In this paper, a method combining both color and texture features of image is proposed to improve the retrieval performance. Given a query, images in the database are firstly ranked using color features. Then, the top ranked images are re-ranked according to their texture features.

The key idea is that GES employs a distributed, content-based, and capacity-aware topology adaptation algorithm to organize nodes (each of which is represented by a node vector) into semantic groups. The intuition behind this design is that semantically associated nodes within a semantic group tend to be relevant to the same queries. Given a query, GES uses a capacity-aware search protocol based on semantic groups and selective one-hop node vector replication, to direct the query to the most relevant nodes which are responsible for the query, thereby achieving high recall with probing only a small faction of nodes. Moreover, GES adopts automatic query expansion techniques to improve quality of search results, and it is the first work to show that node vector size plays a very important role in system performance. The experimental results show that GES is very efficient, and even outperforms the centralized node clustering system like SETS.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:0-7695-2312-9","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.273","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419877","","Costs;Floods;Humans;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Network topology;Protocols;Routing;System performance","information retrieval systems;peer-to-peer computing;query formulation;semantic networks","GES;Gnutella-like P2P networks;IR system;VSM;automatic query expansion technique;capacity-aware topology adaptation algorithm;information retrieval algorithm;peer-to-peer systems;relevance ranking algorithm;search protocol;selective one-hop node vector replication;semantic group","","4","","25","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to saving energy by avoiding query flooding and extra data transmission for data storage elsewhere, SMRDD achieves further energy efficiency by reducing dissemination of redundant data. In SMRDD, instead of being addressed to nodes, queries are sent to pixel points, a set of carefully selected locations across the sensor field, on the support of a geographic routing protocol. The query finally reaches the home node of the pixel point, the node geographically closest to the pixel point, which reports data to sinks in response. The density of the pixel points corresponds to data resolution level. The higher the density, the higher the data resolution level. The highest density of pixel points is determined by the sensing range of sensors for the application, which allows sensing ranges of home nodes of all pixel points to cover the whole sensor field. Analysis and simulation results show that the performance of our method is much better than early flooding based methods like directed diffusion.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:0-7695-2312-9","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1420177","Data Dissemination;Energyefficient;Multi-resolution;Sensor Networks;Spatial-based","Computer science;Energy efficiency;Energy storage;Event detection;Floods;Information retrieval;Memory;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","energy conservation;image resolution;information dissemination;information retrieval;routing protocols;storage area networks;visual databases;wireless sensor networks","data resolution;data retrieval;data storage;data transmission;directed diffusion method;energy efficiency;geographic routing protocol;pixel point density;query flooding method;redundant data;spatial-based multiresolution data dissemination scheme;wireless sensor networks","","3","","20","","","4-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Support vector machines are applied to classify music into pure music and vocal music by learning from training data. For pure music and vocal music, a number of features are extracted to characterize the music content, respectively. Based on calculated features, a clustering algorithm is applied to structure the music content. Finally, a music summary is created based on the clustering results and domain knowledge related to pure and vocal music. Support vector machine learning shows a better performance in music classification than traditional Euclidean distance methods and hidden Markov model methods. Listening tests are conducted to evaluate the quality of summarization.

The proposed algorithm retrieves the image in a database having minimum distortion when the query image is encoded by a separate Gauss mixture codebook representing each image in the database. We use Gauss mixture vector quantization (GMVQ) for clustering Gauss mixtures, instead of the conventional expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Experimental comparison shows that the simpler GMVQ and the EM algorithms have close Gauss mixture parameters with similar convergence speeds. We also provide a new color-interleaving method, reducing the dimension of feature vectors and the size of covariance matrices, thereby reducing computation. This method shows a slightly better retrieval performance than the usual color-interleaving method in HSV color space.

This paper proposes a new framework such that: 1) to achieve usability, it allows users to qualitatively and intuitively express their preferences by partial orders on selected examples, from which it effectively learns a quantitative global ranking function, and (2) to achieve efficiency, it integrates the front-end machine learner with a back-end top-k query processor to evaluate the learned functions.

Indexing and retrieving images are envisaged from a symbolic point of view. The Knossos approach appears therefore as an integrated approach concerning all types of images. The main scientific objective of the project is to show in which manner the concept of textuality may be used as semiotic middle offering a renovated space of modelling to image meaning. Indeed, the text may be taken as a central (perhaps the only) semiotic e-medium in a universe where the lexical paradigm is predominant. By doing this, the Knossos project takes place in the semantic Web debate. Semiotic experts who give more or less complete panel of relevant iconic categories of the corpus create iconic genders.

We proposed a novel scheme, called Proximity Regions for Caching in Cooperative MP2P Networks (PReCinCt) to efficiently support scalable data retrieval in large-scale MP2P networks. In the PReCinCt scheme, the network topology is divided into geographical regions where each region is responsible for a set of keys representing the data. In this paper, we extend the PReCinCt scheme to facilitate consistent cooperative caching in MP2P systems. The caching scheme considers data popularity, data size and region-distance during replacement to optimize cache content of peers. PReCinCt employs a hybrid push/pull mechanism to maintain data consistency among replicas in the network. Simulation results show the cost of consistency maintenance in terms of latency and energy consumption is significantly improved in the PReCinCt scheme.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:0-7695-2312-9","10.1109/IPDPS.2005.353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419879","","Bandwidth;Batteries;Collaboration;Cooperative caching;Costs;Delay;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Network topology;Peer to peer computing","cache storage;information retrieval;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing","PReCinCt scheme;cooperative caching;data consistency;large-scale MP2P networks;mobile peer-to-peer systems;network topology;proximity regions","","11","1","18","","","04-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SMOS' single payload is the Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) sensor, an L-band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer with multiangular and polarimetric imaging capabilities. The definition of the SMOS Level 2 Processor requires the selection of the optimum operation mode (dual-polarization or full-polarimetric) for each application, the specification of the required auxiliary data, and the optimum retrieval algorithms. Using the SMOS simulator and based on the experience gained in previous works, this paper presents a study of the SM and SSS retrieval capabilities over homogeneous pixels, in the two modes of operation with different auxiliary data. It is found that SSS retrievals using the first Stokes parameter measured in the dual-polarization mode perform somewhat worse than using the vertical (T<sub>vv</sub>) and horizontal (T<sub>hh</sub>) brightness temperatures measured in the full-polarimetric mode, and the performance degrades for cold waters due to the lower sensitivity of the brightness temperature to SSS at low sea surface temperature (SST). Due to the larger angular variation of T<sub>hh</sub> and T<sub>vv</sub>, SM retrievals using T<sub>hh</sub> and T<sub>vv</sub> measured in the full-polarimetric mode exhibit a significant better performance over bare soils than over vegetation-covered soils. Over vegetation-covered soils vegetation parameters (opacity and albedo) can be inferred over a 550-km swath width in the full-polarimetric mode. However, since the first Stokes parameter is independent of both geometric and Faraday rotations, it is very robust in the presence of instrumental and geophysical errors. In the SSS retrieval problem and in the SM retrieval problem (with T<sub>hh</sub> and T<sub>vv</sub> measured in the full-polarimetric mode), the performance of the retrieval algorithms tested is not significantly altered if the model parameters are not exactly known, but are left as adjustable parameters in the optimization process.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.842096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424296","Aperture synthesis;L-band;ocean salinity;radiometry;retrieval;soil moisture","Earth;Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;L-band;Microwave imaging;Radiometers;Samarium;Sea measurements;Sea surface salinity;Soil moisture","albedo;hydrological techniques;hydrology;microwave measurement;ocean temperature;oceanographic techniques;opacity;radiometry;remote sensing;soil","AD 1999 05;Earth Explorer Opportunity Mission;European Space Agency Earth Observation Programme Board;Faraday rotations;L-band aperture synthesis interferometric radiometers;Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis sensor;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity;Stokes parameter;angular variation;bare soils;brightness temperatures;cold waters;dual-polarization mode;full-polarimetric mode;geometric rotation;geophysical error;radiometry;sea surface salinity;sea surface temperature;soil moisture retrieval;vegetation-covered soils","","22","","22","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The efficiency of top-k query evaluation relies on using scores to prune irrelevant answers as early as possible in the evaluation process. In this context, evaluating the same query plan for all answers might be too rigid because, at any time in the evaluation, answers have gone through the same number and sequence of operations, which limits the speed at which scores grow. Therefore, adaptive query processing that permits different plans for different partial matches and maximizes the best scores is more appropriate. In this paper, we propose an architecture and adaptive algorithms for efficiently computing top-k matches to XML queries. Our techniques can be used to evaluate both exact and approximate matches where approximation is defined by relaxing XPath axes. In order to compute the scores of query answers, we extend the traditional tf*idf measure to account for document structure. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of benchmark data and queries, and demonstrate the usefulness of the adaptive approach for computing top-k queries in XML.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2285-8","10.1109/ICDE.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410117","","Adaptive algorithm;Books;Computer architecture;Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Libraries;Query processing;XML","XML;query processing","XML queries;adaptive query processing;top-k queries","","22","3","25","","","05-08 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on CVPIC, we introduce a compressed domain retrieval algorithm that makes immediate use of the fact that colour and pattern information is readily available in the CVPIC domain. Colour features are exploited by building a block co-occurance matrix of colour indices while shape information is represented through pattern histograms.

Four detecting areas are chosen in this step, which probably include the photo-stamp, and then their R component and G component are margin-detected using Sobel operator to determine whether the photo time-stamp is in them; 2) The area which contains time-stamp of the photo is finely segmented to locate each character; 3) Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to do template matching and optimization recognition to complete the photo time-stamp recognition.

The drawbacks of using external knowledge bases are formatting incompatibility, domain constraint, and updating difficulty. This work proposes a keyword extraction system, which uses only the knowledge within the document, to extract the keywords. The knowledge includes the title and content of document. All candidates are determined as keywords if they have the same meaning as seed keywords. These seed keywords are previously extracted by employing the document title. We syntactically parse the document title and then use all noun phrase combinations as seed keywords. These keywords are used as the index to pick the relevant sentences in the document and then automatically convert into knowledge representation, called semantic graphs. Simultaneously, the candidates for being accepted as keywords are processed in the same steps as the seed keyword extraction. However, the candidates are altered from the whole sentences in the document instead of the document title as in seed keyword extraction. The similarity score of keyword semantic graphs and candidate semantic graphs are calculated based on conceptual graph operations. The experiments are arranged with 100 documents in domains such as business, computer and psychology. We compared the experimental results to the author-determined keywords and two practical keyword extraction systems i.e. EXTRACTOR and KEA. The experimental results show acceptable performance with 54.81%, 73.87% and 77.94% when they are compared to keywords determined by the author, EXTRACTOR and KEA, respectively.","","POD:0-7803-8593-4","10.1109/ISCIT.2004.1413905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1413905","","Art;Business;Computer languages;Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Ontologies;Psychology;Statistics","indexing;knowledge representation;natural languages;semantic networks;text analysis","conceptual graph operations;document content;document title;index;keyword extraction systems;knowledge representation;limited knowledge resources;noun phrase combinations;performance;seed keywords;semantic graphs;sentence similarity verification;syntactic parsing","","1","2","8","","","26-29 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system sends several kinds of data, including continuous video, video clips, still images, and avatars, over the communication channel. The specific data that are sent are based on the parameters set by the transmitting and receiving terminals. Bandwidth-consuming data, such as continuous video, are transmitted only occasionally at the receiving terminal. The system has been partially implemented and incorporated in avatar-enabled cellular phones. The user may then easily create different avatars combining components characterizing faces, hair, and so on, and associate them with different callers. When a call comes through, the avatar corresponding to the caller is retrieved and displayed on the screen and the corresponding information is retrieved from the personal database.","1070-986X;1070986X","","10.1109/MMUL.2005.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423940","","Avatars;Cellular phones;Communication channels;Databases;Hair;Humans;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Personal digital assistants","avatars;cellular radio;mobile computing;multimedia communication;notebook computers","PDA;avatars;bandwidth-consuming data;cellular phones;communication channel;continuous video;mobile phones;multimedia data;multimedia-enhanced communication;prior knowledge;still images;user-controlled communication;video clips","","0","","","","","April-June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To best address scaling issues, the airborne data were acquired over an intensively spaced grid of north-south and east-west oriented flight lines. A coincident ground sampling program characterized in situ snow cover for all representative land cover types found in the study area. A suite of micrometeorological data from seven sites within the study area was acquired to aid interpretation of the passive microwave brightness temperatures. The in situ data were used to determine variability in SWE, snow depth, and density within and between forest stands and land cover types within the 25×25 km SSM/I grid cell. Statistically significant subgrid scale SWE variability in this mixed forest environment was controlled by variations in snow depth, not density. Spaceborne passive microwave SWE retrievals derived using the Meteorological Service of Canada land cover sensitive algorithm suite were near the center of the normally distributed in situ measurements, providing a reasonable estimate of the mean grid cell SWE. A realistic level of SWE variability was captured by the high-resolution airborne data, showing that passive microwave retrievals are capable of capturing stand-to-stand SWE variability if the imaging footprint is sufficiently small.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.839591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1424272","Microwave radiometry;scaling;snow water equivalent (SWE)","Brightness temperature;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Microwave sensors;Poles and towers;Radiometers;Snow;Spatial resolution;Temperature sensors;Water","hydrological techniques;microwave measurement;radiometry;remote sensing;snow","AD 2003 02;Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites;Meteorological Service of Canada;Old Jack Pine tower;Saskatchewan;Special Sensor Microwave/Imager;airborne microwave radiometers;ground sampling program;heterogeneous land cover;land cover types;micrometeorological data;microwave brightness temperature;microwave radiometry;mixed forest environment;passive microwave data;snow depth;snow water equivalent distribution;snow water equivalent variability;spaceborne passive microwave SWE retrievals;spatial resolutions","","24","","37","","","May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some local LSI methods have been proposed to improve the classification by utilizing class discrimination information. However, their performance improvements over original term vectors are still very limited. In this paper, we propose a new local LSI method called ""local relevancy weighted LSI"" to improve text classification by performing a separate single value decomposition (SVD) on the transformed local region of each class.

Dept., California Univ., Riverside, CA, USA","Data Compression Conference","20050411","2005","","","468","","Summary form only given. In the emerging area of wireless sensor networks, a typical challenge is to retrieve historical information from the sensor nodes. We propose a new technique, called adaptive learning vector quantization (ALVQ), to compress this historical information. Our technique is based on the following two observations: (1) in sensor networks, the historical information exhibits similar patterns over time; and (2) different measurements are intrinsically correlated. Our algorithm works as follows: first, the codebook is obtained through a LVQ (learning vector quantization), which adjusts the codebook to be nearer to the optimal codebook. Second, ALVQ compresses the codebook update data pieces and transfers the compressed information to the base station. Using 2-level piece-wise regression, ALVQ can compress the updates with high precision while saving more bandwidth for data transmission in order to increase the quality of the approximation. In our experiments we used weather data to compare the performance of the ALVQ algorithm with the recently proposed SBR (self based regression) technique. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LVQ learning process significantly improves the quality of the codebook, thus increasing the regression precision. In addition the use of two-level regression for transmitting the codebook updates further minimizes the required bandwidth. Overall the ALVQ technique can achieve the same precision with SBR while using 75% of the bandwidth.","1068-0314;10680314","POD:0-7695-2309-9","10.1109/DCC.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402225","","Bandwidth;Base stations;Computer science;Data communication;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Power engineering and energy;Time measurement;Vector quantization;Wireless sensor networks","adaptive codes;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;table lookup;vector quantisation;wireless sensor networks","2-level piece-wise regression;ALVQ;adaptive learning vector quantization;codebook;data transmission;historical information compression;performance;regression precision;two-level regression;wireless sensor networks","","0","","","","","29-31 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We develop a fast precomputed vector quantization (FPVQ) scheme with optimal bit allocation for lossless compression of ultraspectral sounder data. The scheme consists of linear prediction, bit-depth partitioning, vector quantization, and optimal bit allocation. Linear prediction serves as a whitening tool to make the prediction residuals of each channel close to a Gaussian distribution, and then these residuals are partitioned based on bit depths. Each partition is further divided into several sub-partitions with various 2<sup>k</sup> channels for vector quantization. Only the codebooks with 2<sup>m</sup> codewords for 2<sup>k</sup>-dimensional normalized Gaussian distributions are precomputed. A new algorithm is developed for optimal bit allocation among subpartitions. Unlike previous algorithms that may yield a sub-optimal solution, the proposed algorithm guarantees to find the minimum of the cost function under the constraint of a given total bit rate.

Yet current peer-to-peer research has barely started to investigate such approaches. In this paper we discuss the benefits of best match/top-k queries in the context of distributed peer-to-peer information infrastructures and show how to extend the limited query processing in current peer-to-peer networks by allowing the distributed processing of top-k queries, while maintaining a minimum of data traffic. Relying on a super-peer backbone organized in the HyperCuP topology we show how to use local indexes for optimizing the necessary query routing and how to process intermediate results in inner network nodes at the earliest possible point in time cutting down the necessary data traffic within the network. Our algorithm is based on dynamically collected query statistics only, no continuous index update processes are necessary, allowing it to scale easily to large numbers of peers, as well as dynamic additions/deletions of peers.

Research on content-based retrieval focus on using low-level features like color and texture for image representation, and a geometric framework of distances in the feature space for similarity. However, systematic retrieval of the best matches in a large multimedia database requires exhaustive and exponential search and does not guarantee worst-case performance. In addition, it has been observed that certain image representation schemes perform better than others under certain query situations, and these schemes should be somehow integrated and adjusted on the fly to facilitate effective and efficient image retrieval. Some work has been done applying simple genetic algorithms for content-based retrieval to provide good, but not necessary optimal solutions. However, these simple genetic algorithms can find only one optimum solution in a single run. This research proposes a new content-based retrieval method based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA), which is capable of finding multiple trade-off solutions in one run and providing a natural way for integrating multiple image representation schemes. This research focuses on structural similarity framework that addresses topological, directional and distance relations of image objects.","1091-0050;10910050","POD:0-7803-8865-8","10.1109/SECON.2005.1423306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423306","","Content based retrieval;Genetic algorithms;Humans;Image representation;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Performance evaluation;Prototypes","content-based retrieval;genetic algorithms;image representation;image retrieval;multimedia databases;query formulation;visual databases","MOGA;alphanumeric data;annotation consistency;content-based retrieval;database evolution;directional relations;distance relations;exponential search;feature space;geometric distance framework;human effort;image color;image objects;image representation;image retrieval;image texture;keyword-based approaches;low-level features;manual annotation;multi-objective genetic algorithm;multimedia data;multimedia databases;multimedia objects;multiple image representation scheme integration;query situations;similarity;structural similarity framework;systematic retrieval;topological relations;trade-off solutions;worst-case performance","","1","","34","","","8-10 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional filtering methods, however, only consider the relevant values of document. These conventional methods fail to consider the efficiency of document retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to calculate an index called document similarity score based on elements of the document. Using the index, document profile is derived.

Two of the main technical issues that need to be addressed are: locating suitable components in the library (retrieval); and adapting them to solve a specific problem. Intelligent retrieval techniques, based on matching formal specifications (so-called specification matching), have been developed to overcome some of the problems associated with traditional keyword-based retrieval techniques. Also approaches to semi-automating component adaptation have been proposed. These approaches are based on using component wrappers and component architectures for defining adaptation strategies. Such strategies can be represented by generic library templates that are parameterised over higher-order variables (therefore ensuring that they are applicable in a variety of situations). We would like to use existing specification matching techniques to locate suitable library adaptation templates. However, at present these two approaches are not compatible. This is because the current specification matching methods are based on matching first-order component specifications, whereas templates are specified using higher-order logic. In this paper we extend existing specification matching methods to handle higher-order library templates, with a focus on achieving the best possible tradeoff between automatability and precision/recall.","1530-0803;15300803","POD:0-7695-2257-2","10.1109/ASWEC.2005.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402018","","Australia;Component architectures;Computer architecture;Computer science;Electronic mail;Formal specifications;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;Software engineering;Software libraries","formal specification;information retrieval;object-oriented programming;pattern matching;software architecture;software libraries;software reusability","component architectures;component wrappers;component-based software development programs;formal specifications;generic library adaptation templates;higher-order logic;intelligent retrieval techniques;keyword-based retrieval techniques;reusable library components;specification matching techniques","","0","","21","","","29 March-1 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With an increasing amount of text data being stored in compressed format, being able to access the compressed data randomly and decode it partially is highly desirable for efficient retrieval in many applications. The efficiency of these operations depends on the compression method used. We present a modified LZW algorithm that supports efficient indexing and searching on compressed files. Our method performs in a sublinear complexity, since we only decode a small portion of the file. The proposed approach not only provides the flexibility for dynamic indexing in different text granularities, but also provides the possibility for parallel processing in both encoding and decoding sides, independent of the number of processors available. It also provides good error resilience. The compression ratio is improved using the proposed modified LZW algorithm. Test results show that our public trie method has a compression ratio of 0.34 for the TREC corpus and 0.32 with text preprocessing using a star transform with an optimal static dictionary; this is very close to the efficient word Huffman and phrase based word Huffman schemes, but has a more flexible random access ability.","1068-0314;10680314","POD:0-7695-2309-9","10.1109/DCC.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402250","","Computer errors;Computer science;Decoding;Dictionaries;Encoding;Indexing;Information retrieval;Libraries;Parallel processing;Testing","Huffman codes;computational complexity;data compression;decoding;parallel processing;pattern classification;query formulation;text analysis","compressed file indexing;compressed file searching;compression ratio;data compression;flexible compressed text retrieval system;modified LZW algorithm;parallel processing;partial decoding;random access ability;star transform;static dictionary;sublinear complexity;text preprocessing;word Huffman schemes","","0","","","","","29-31 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Queries are processed by first locating approximate neighbors within the sample, and then using the pre-established connections to discover neighbors within the remainder of the data set. The SASH index relies on a pairwise distance measure, but otherwise makes no assumptions regarding the representation of the data. Experimental results are provided for query-by-example operations on protein sequence, image, and text data sets, including one consisting of more than 1 million vectors spanning more than 1.1 million terms - far in excess of what spatial search indices can handle efficiently.

Usually these decision-making processes are based on several criteria that represent various experts' knowledge. Multicriteria decision-making (MCDM), however, may not provide sharp boundaries to classify candidates as belonging to single categories. To solve problems with criteria without sharp boundaries, fuzzy logic is a good tool to deal with. Hence, fuzzy logic-based multicriteria decision-making (FMCDM) is an effective tool. A new fault location method for radial distribution systems uses the FMCDM process to determine possibility values for each line section in a distribution system. The possibility values represent the possibility of a fault being present on a particular line section. In the FMCDM process, fuzzy aggregation operators are needed to combine the multiple possibility values into an aggregated value. Often fuzzy aggregation operators are selected to solve these problems without considering information reflecting in the possibility values, and this information is related to the characteristic of the decision-making process. In this paper, the authors discuss a process for selecting aggregation operators to solve the multicriteria fault location problem taking into account the characteristics of the decision-making process.","","POD:0-7803-8718-X","10.1109/PSCE.2004.1397620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1397620","","Aggregates;Decision making;Fault detection;Fault location;Fuzzy logic;Information retrieval;Mechanical engineering;Natural languages","decision making;fault location;fuzzy logic;power distribution faults","fuzzy aggregation operator;fuzzy logic;multicriteria decision making;multicriteria fault location;radial distribution system","","2","","4","","","10-13 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, in order to represent each trajectory, a hybrid technique is proposed for representing its semantic meanings and geometrical properties. At this scheme, we use the Bezier basis functions to interpolate some lost control points of each represented trajectory. Then, the distance between any two trajectories can be measured by comparing the positions of sampling points extracted along their Bezier approximations. In addition, this hybrid method uses a novel labeling technique for converting a trajectory into a string. This string representation can give more semantic information in interpreting a trajectory and make important improvements in video classification. More importantly, the problem of partial matching will become easy and can be efficiently solved by a string matching technique.

In our algorithm, every node uses Delaunay triangulation, by using its knowledge of other nodes and cooperatively exchanging information among nodes, which generates and refines overlaid networks. On the resultant Delaunay network, nodes communicate with each other over virtual collaborative space, and employ multihopping communication among distant nodes. This algorithm structure has the following advantages: (1) utilization of only the localized nodes, omitting the use of unnecessary distant nodes for communication, (2) scalability through surveillance of nodes by refining and updating the network continuously, (3) two dimensional space organization which allows construction of super nodes that govern regional areas to process geographical range query, and (4) directional communication through a small routing table. The authors believe that this approach is applicable to large-scale virtual collaborative space and location aware system.","1556-0082;15560082","POD:0-7695-2325-0","10.1109/C5.2005.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1419791","Computational geometry;Distributive Cooperation;Incremental method;P2P;Serverless;Virtual Collaborative Space","Character generation;Collaboration;Computational geometry;Informatics;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Scalability;Surveillance","computational geometry;groupware;mesh generation;peer-to-peer computing;virtual reality","Delaunay overlaid network;Delaunay triangulation;P2P;computational geometry;incremental algorithm;multihopping communication;peer-to-peer computing;virtual collaborative space","","14","1","23","","","28-29 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus they have to deal with receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, which have to be hedged against foreign currency risk using derivative foreign exchange contracts. In the past this task has strongly relied on voice based broking. However, with Internet technology, online marketplaces for trading foreign exchange emerged offering access to the liquidity of a global market. Still companies are reluctant when deciding about the deployment of this new trading channel, knowing that it will only become valuable when seamlessly integrated into the corporate's foreign exchange trading process. In this work we present a Web service based straight through processing implementation and evaluate the users' acceptance of the integrated online marketplace.","","POD:0-7695-2274-2","10.1109/EEE.2005.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402351","","Companies;Consumer electronics;Context-aware services;Contracts;Globalization;Information management;Information retrieval;Internet telephony;Web and internet services;Web services","Internet;contracts;electronic commerce;electronic trading;foreign exchange trading;globalisation","Internet;Web Service;corporate foreign exchange trading;foreign currency;foreign exchange contract;multinational company;voice based broking","","0","","10","","","29 March-1 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current approaches order n predicates optimally (neglecting factorization) in O(nlogn). Their result may deviate significantly from the optimal solution under factorization. We formalize the problem of finding optimal orderings under factorization and prove that it is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show how to improve on the run time of the brute-force algorithm (which computes all possible orderings) by presenting different enhanced algorithms. Although in the worst case these algorithms obviously still behave exponentially, our experiments demonstrate that for real-life examples their performance is much better.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2285-8","10.1109/ICDE.2005.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410161","","Content based retrieval;Cost function;Database systems;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Runtime;Shape;Spatial databases","computational complexity;database management systems;query processing","NP-hard problem;database system query optimizer;factorization;optimal orderings;query predicates;user-defined function handling","","0","","17","","","5-8 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Decomposing the image with DT-RCWF and DT-CWT jointly gives shift invariant subbands oriented in twelve different directions. Isotropic rotationally invariant features are extracted from these subbands. The performance of image retrieval with the proposed features on rotated and nonrotated image databases is compared with the existing method.

Fourth IEEE International Conference on","20050404","2004","","","178","185","Latent semantic retrieval methods (unlike vector space methods) take the document and query vectors and map them into a topic space to cluster related terms and documents. This produces a more precise retrieval but also a long query time. We present a new method of document retrieval which allows us to process the latent semantic information into a hybrid latent semantic-vector space query mapping. This mapping automatically expands the users query based on the latent semantic information in the document set. This expanded query is processed using a fast vector space method. Since we have the latent semantic data in a mapping, we are able to store and retrieve vector information in the same fast manner that the vector space method offers. Multiple mappings are combined to produce hybrid latent semantic retrieval which provide precision results 5% greater than the vector space method and fast query times.","","POD:0-7695-2142-8","10.1109/ICDM.2004.10085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410282","","Computational complexity;Computer science;Hybrid power systems;Information retrieval;Machine intelligence;Vectors;Writing","information retrieval;text analysis","document retrieval;hybrid latent semantic;hybrid prequery term expansion;latent semantic analysis;latent semantic retrieval;query mapping;query vectors;user query;vector space method","","1","2","8","","","1-4 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Researchers and biologists interested in the sequence information for a particular organism can retrieve their data from these multiple sources. However, selecting the right sources, in consideration of speed and availability, for a particular task is often a very hard decision. Moreover, there are different platforms and organization of data in the biological realm, making it a hindrance for interchanging information from one platform to another. So, integration of these distributed sources, with the major industry standard, is an urgent necessity faced by the biological community. Proposed here is a system that retrieves sequence data from multiple sources depending on their speed at the time of issuing the query thereby avoiding fetching data from the sites that are facing technical difficulty or delay. Moreover, the proposed system utilises the power of XML based technology, like XQuery, XSL for compliance with the industry standard and system extensibility.","","POD:0-7803-8894-1","10.1109/ISSNIP.2004.1417518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1417518","","Bioinformatics;Biology computing;Databases;Delay;Genomics;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Organisms;Warehousing;XML","XML;biology computing;genetics;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;sequences","XML;XQuery;XSL;biological databases;genome sequences;genomic data retrieval;industry standard;intelligent search system;multiple source data retrieval;system extensibility","","0","","18","","","14-17 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
