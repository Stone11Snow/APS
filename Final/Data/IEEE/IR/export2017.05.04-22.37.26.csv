In the archaeological domain the vast majority of this literature contains some geo-spatial element as well as the expected temporal information and therefore its ease of discovery would be greatly enhanced were it accessible via a geo-spatially enabled search mechanism. As a result of this, geo-referencing these types of material and integrating them with other resources, such as monument inventories, is seen as a desirable enhancement for digital archives serving the archaeological research community. This paper provides an overview of a number of the approaches to the integration of such legacy literature into geospatial search mechanisms in an archaeological context. In particular efforts to achieve this via the Archaeotools e-Science project and its use of natural language processing and a geo-spatial cross-walk service are discussed as well as potential future enhancements to the process.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5947-6; POD:978-1-4244-5946-9","10.1109/ESCIW.2009.5407967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5407967","","Cities and towns;Computer science;Conferences;Data mining;Education;Local government;Natural language processing;Nuclear magnetic resonance;Potential well","archaeology;information retrieval;natural language processing","Archaeotools e-science project;archaeological literature;archaeological research community;digital archive;georeferencing;geospatial cross-walk service;geospatial search mechanism;grey literature;legacy literature;monument inventory;name authority service;natural language processing;resource discovery interface;scholarly journal","","0","","12","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presently, when a user enters a keyword in a search engine, the search results are usually presented the same result to other users who search the same keyword, which might not be related to each user's field of interest. Therefore, the researcher of this study would like to propose a new searching technique to get each user's most relevant information by using a user preference. This research will categorize user preference to build the user profile and general profile base on user's search history and category hierarchy, respectively. The search engines then use those profiles to determine the interests of each user, execute the search query to obtain a set of relevant documents, and re-ranking the documents in a manner that best reflects their relevance to the user's profile. Many algorithms have been designed, analyzed, implemented and experimented to find the most appropriate and the most effective one to create the relationship between each keyword and each category to best meet each user's preference.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-1-4244-5428-0; POD:978-1-4244-5427-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5440238","Categorization;Clickthrough data;Personalization;User preferences;Web search","Web search","Internet;information retrieval;search engines","Web search;general profile base;search engines;search query;semantic categorization;user category hierarchy;user preference retrieval;user profile;user search history","","0","","12","","","7-10 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be facilitated by an individually built journal ranking that exploits a community building perspective and by a more transparent process of use. The approach introduced here is based on an analysis of both traditional journal rankings and behavior of academic communities. As a result, we present a procedure for building and using an individual journal ranking, its tentative composition and the ranking calculation. In addition, we suggest measures for evaluating the ranking use.

Like a 19thcentury Wikipedia, it attempted nothing less than a full account of all architectural knowledge available at the time, both past and present. It covers topics from Greek temples to contemporary hospitals and universities; from the design of individual construction elements such as window sills to large-scale town planning; from physics to design; from planning to construction. It also discusses architectural history and styles and a multitude of other topics, such as building conception, statics, and interior design.Not surprisingly, this project took longer than planned. The encyclopedia's first volume was partly published in 1880, and over the next 63 years more than 100 architects worked on what would become more than 140 individual publications with over 25,000 pages. One important insight of our work is that targeted text analysis support, already available today, can easily be integrated into common desktop tools to support users for their task at hand. While NLP techniques are far from perfect or comprehensive, they can already deliver knowledge discovery support that goes significantly beyond the currently used approach of full-text search and information retrieval.","1541-1672;15411672","","10.1109/MIS.2010.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432261","Handbook on Architecture;Handbuch der Architektur;cultural heritage data management;knowledge base management;natural language processing;ontologies;ontology population;semantic Wiki;text mining","Cities and towns;Educational institutions;Encyclopedias;Hospitals;Large-scale systems;Natural language processing;Ontologies;Publishing;Wikipedia;Windows","deductive databases;encyclopaedias;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","NLP techniques;architectural knowledge;historical architecture encyclopedia;historical document;information retrieval;language processing techniques;large scale town planning;ontologies;semantic knowledge base;text analysis support","","4","","13","","","Jan.-Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the everyday increasing importance of privacy, security, and wise use of computational resources, the corresponding technologies are increasingly being faced with the problem of file type detection. True identification of computer file types is a difficult task especially when dealing with suspicious goals. An extension to the file name with the file type is stored in the disk directory, but when a file is deleted, the entry for the file in the directory may be overwritten and hence quite difficult to identify its type which is serious issue in computer forensics. But if the fragment of file has its header information containing type identifying information the mentioned problem may be solved. But it is difficult to identify the type of fragment from the middle or if the header information is deleted or unavailable the identification becomes more complex. Added to it is the content available in those files needs to be extracted which may be of more importance. Hence file type identification and managing the information is of paramount importance nowadays, especially when it comes to the diffusion, reuse and information extraction of existing vast database. This paper focuses on identifying the file types addressing the various scenarios of file type being changed by the malicious user or proprietary file types or the obsolence of hardware and software.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5052-7; POD:978-1-4244-5053-4","10.1109/NABIC.2009.5393688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5393688","Fileprints;Header and Trailer;content structure","Data mining;Databases;Explosives;Face detection;Forensics;Information management;Information security;Privacy;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;data structures;information retrieval","file format identification;file type detection;information extraction","","0","","13","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Service selection techniques often return a single value representing the rank of a service. Users of the service, however, may not always have identical needs and may be interested in ratings based on multiple categories.

However, it is difficult to extract the partial correspondences correctly and efficiently in the data sparse corpus. In this paper, we propose a new learning method that extracts the partial correspondences solely from the parallel corpus without any analytical tools. In the proposed method, the extraction rules are automatically acquired from bilingual sentences using bi-gram statistics in each language sentence and the similarity based on Dice coefficient between SL words and TL words. The acquired extraction rules possess information about the first parts(e.g., ""a"", ""the"") or the last parts in phrases. Moreover, the partial correspondences are extracted from the bilingual sentences using the extraction rules correctly and efficiently. Evaluation experiments indicated that our proposed method can improve the translation quality of the learning-type machine translation by correctly and efficiently extracting the partial correspondences in bilingual sentences.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3904-1; POD:978-1-4244-5318-4","10.1109/IALP.2009.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380752","extraction rule;learning;machine translation;parallel corpus;partial correspondence","Data mining;Dictionaries;Feedback;Frequency;Information science;Learning systems;Machine learning;Natural languages;Statistics;Surface-mount technology","information retrieval;language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","Dice coefficient;bi-gram statistics;bilingual sentences;data sparse corpus;learning-type machine translation;parallel corpus;partial correspondence extraction rule;source language;target language;translation quality","","1","1","11","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A typical example of such a work load is news article access, where the most popular is highly accessed, but which article is most popular keeps changing. The properties of dynamically changing popular content are investigated using a trace drawn from a social news web site. It is shown that a) popular content have a much larger window of interest than non-popular articles. i.e. popular articles typically have a more sustained interest rather than a brief surge of interest. b) popular content are accessed by multiple unrelated users. In contrast, articles whose accesses spread only virally, i.e. from friend to friend, are shown to have a tendency not to be popular. Using this data, we improve upon Popular Data Concentration (PDC), a technique which is used to save energy by spinning down disks that do not contain popular data. PDC requires keeping the data ordered by their popularity, which involves significant amount of data migration, when the most popular articles keep changing. In contrast, our technique, SpinThrift, detects popular data by the proportion of non-viral accesses made, and results in lesser data migration, whilst using a similar amount of energy as PDC.","2155-2487;21552487","Electronic:978-1-4244-5489-1; POD:978-1-4244-5487-7","10.1109/COMSNETS.2010.5431984","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431984","","Concrete;Cost function;Energy consumption;Energy storage;Memory;Network servers;Social network services;Spinning;Surges;User-generated content","Web sites;computer centres;information retrieval;optimisation;social networking (online)","SpinThrift;data migration;data storage;energy costs optimising;energy saving technique;popular data concentration;social news web site;viral workloads","","1","","16","","","5-9 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The number of different authors, the multitude of user-provided tags, the inherent connectivity between blogs and bloggers, the high update rate, and the time information attached to each post are some of the features that can be exploited in various information retrieval tasks. Traditional search engines perform poorly on blogs since they do not cover these aspects. In an attempt to exploit these features, this paper proposes a personalized recommendation model, which capitalizes on a collaborative rating mechanism that exploits the hyperlinks between blogs. The model assumes that the intention of a blog owner who creates a link to another blog is to provide a recommendation to the blog readers and quantifies this intention in a local score for the blog being pointed. A set of implicit and explicit links between any two blogs affect the exchanged score. The process is iterative and takes into account the opinion of a set of affiliated blogs and the freshness of links.","","Electronic:978-07695-3894-5; POD:978-1-4244-5282-8","10.1109/SMAP.2009.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381709","Blog;collaborative rating;ranking;recommendation system","Collaborative work;Conferences;Feedback;Informatics;Information services;International collaboration;Internet;Mechanical factors;Social network services;Web sites","Web sites;information filters;information retrieval","blogosphere;collaborative rating approach;collaborative rating mechanism;information retrieval;personalized blog site recommendation system;personalized recommendation model;search engines","","2","","16","","","14-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a recommender system for a social bookmarking site to generate resource recommendations rather than tag recommendations. Our system is based on two ideas: similar users are interested in similar resources and similar resources have similar tags. Our system generates recommendations by automatically taking into account what resources a user tags and the co-occurrence of tags. Our method is tested on large-scale real life datasets.

However, it is usually a case that a small number of positive documents can be obtained manually or from PPI knowledge bases with literature-based evidence and there are a large number of negative documents. In this paper, we investigate the effects of feature selection and feature weighting as well as kernel function of support vector machines (SVMs) on imbalanced two-class classification based on 1360 host-pathogen protein-protein interactions documents. The results show that the suitable feature weighting approach is the important factor for improving the classification performance.

GeoCoastPilot is intended to demonstrate what is possible with current technology and to facilitate technology transfer. We started with the question, ""What might a digital application based on the NOAA Coast Pilot look like if other marine data sources were combined with it?"" Along these lines, GeoCoastPilot introduces two new capabilities to existing marine information products: multiramas and microlinks. These capabilities are intended to help the user develop a more complete and integrated mental model of a port before encountering it for the first time. Operational benefits of GeoCoastPilot include: · decreased time in searching for relevant information; · fewer errors in interpreting the information; and · increased awareness of important navigation aids, hazards, and regulations. In order for commercial software applications to more easily adopt multiramas and microlinking, we advocate two paradigms for data collection and management. First, pertinent marine information sources should be tagged with consistent feature-level metadata. Second, simple mappings of object and attribute names between different information sources should be published and maintained without necessarily being tied to the requirements of any one information source.","0197-7385;01977385","CD:978-0-933957-38-1; Paper:978-1-4244-4960-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2009.5422138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422138","","Application software;Cognitive science;Displays;Hazards;Marine technology;Navigation;Oceans;Organizing;Sea measurements;Technology transfer","information retrieval;marine engineering;meta data","GeoCoastPilot;NOAA coast pilot;commercial software applications;data collection and management;feature level metadata;information displaying;information organization;integrated mental model;marine information products;microlinks;multiramas;navigation aids;navigation information;research software application","","0","","17","","","26-29 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

COAST will provide insightful new data visualization and analysis capabilities for the coastal researcher. COAST is built upon the NASA open source 3D geobrowser, World Wind, developed at the NASA Ames Research Center. COAST also integrated some of the value-added modifications and enhancements from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center version of World Wind, SERVIR-Viz. COAST is being developed to maximize use of open source data access, viewing, and data manipulation software tools, creating a low-cost, widely installable base for potential users. Feedback from preliminary reviewers has led to more robust understanding of the data integration and visual analytic challenges and of the potential solutions that COAST can offer to the broader user community. Improved mode of functionality for these users will lead to a more refined methodology for implementation of COAST as an effective tool for a range of potential users varying from researcher to investigator to potential decision maker. Development of the Temporal Visualization Tool (TVT) plugin for COAST was begun in the 2007 Integrated Approach to Monitoring Hypoxia in the Northern Gulf of Mexico project. The origin of this time-based animated data overlay tool is the Naval Research Laboratory Monterey Weather plugin, which is still distributed with the present World Wind 1.4 package. Modifications to the TVT tool have been targeted to provide users the capability to connect to and map/integrate disparate datasets, located locally and online, into project sessions. The TVT allows direct data listing of accessible raster datasets, subsequent multi-select, temporally animated image overlays in the COAST browser, and transparency control over the animated layer within COAST via- a slider mechanism. The development of the Recursive Online Remote Data - Data Mapper (RECORD-DM) utility was driven by the need for an ability to map and add online remote image-product datasets to the TVT plugin's list of available images as needed. The RECORD-DM tool allows a user to map the current state, structure, and location of online raster data available for viewing in TVT. It also allows geographic position information to be attached and creates an XML file map of the data for immediate use in the TVT as either static or temporally animated overlays in the current COAST session. The Import Data Tool provides the ability to quickly add image and vector datasets in a COAST session without having to be a geospatial or image processing expert. The envisioned COAST end user community can vary from seasoned research scientists wanting to integrate decision model output into their sessions all the way to coastal community managers wanting to review local, state, and federal data products in their areas of interest.","0197-7385;01977385","CD:978-0-933957-38-1; Paper:978-1-4244-4960-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2009.5422062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422062","","Animation;Data analysis;Data visualization;Feedback;NASA;Robustness;Sea measurements;Software tools;Visual analytics;Wind","XML;data visualisation;geophysics computing;information networks;information retrieval;oceanography;online front-ends;public domain software","COAST 2.0;COAST geobrowser;COAST temporal visualization tool plugin;Coastal Online Analysis and Synthesis Tool 2.0;NASA open source 3D geobrowser;RECORD-DM utility;SERVIR-Viz;TVT tool modifications;World Wind geobrowser;XML file map;accessible raster datasets;coastal datasets;common desktop client tool;direct data listing;geographic position information;import data tool;open source data access;open source data manipulation software tools;open source data viewing;recursive online remote data-data mapper;remote image product datasets;time based animated data overlay tool","","0","","2","","","26-29 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Crawlers facilitate this process by following hyperlinks in Web pages to automatically download new and updated Web pages. Freshness (recency) is one of the important maintaining factors of Web search engine crawlers that takes weeks to months. Many large Web crawlers start from seed pages, fetch every links from them, and continually repeat this process without any policies that help them to better crawling and improving performance of those. We believe that data mining techniques can help us to improve the freshness parameter by extracting knowledge from crawling data. In this paper we propose a Web crawler that uses extracted knowledge by data mining techniques as policies for crawling. For this purpose we include a component to collect additional crawling information. This crawler starts by non-preferential crawling. After a few crawling, it trained by using mining techniques on crawling data and then uses policies for preferential crawling to improve freshness time. Our research represented that crawling with determined polices has better freshness than generic general purpose Web crawlers.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5648-2; POD:978-1-4244-5647-5","10.1109/ICITST.2009.5402607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5402607","","Authentication;Availability;Communication system security;Data mining;Law enforcement;Legal factors;Privacy;Public key cryptography;Search engines;Web search","Internet;data mining;information retrieval systems;search engines","Web pages;Web search engine crawlers;data mining techniques;information retrieval systems;non-preferential crawling","","1","2","23","","","9-12 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These early warning systems are based on the principles of retrieving and extracting information available online usually in the form of news items or similar pages. The idea behind such warning systems is mainly frequency-based (i. e., the number of appearances of any entity over a particular time span). The rest of the logic revolves around that entity.

In grid environments, the task of observing the application behavior is assigned to monitoring systems. However, most of them are designed to provide general resource information and do not consider specific information for higher-level services. More specifically, in the context of data-intensive applications, a specific introspection layer is required in order to collect data about the usage of storage resources, about data access patterns, etc. This paper discusses the requirements for an introspection layer in a data-management system for large-scale distributed infrastructures. We focus on the case of BlobSeer, a large-scale distributed system for storing massive data. The paper explains why and how to enhance BlobSeer with introspective capabilities and proposes a three-layered architecture relying on the MonALISA monitoring framework. This approach has been evaluated on the Grid'5000 testbed, with experiments that prove the feasibility of generating relevant information related to the state and the behavior of the system.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5918-6; POD:978-1-4244-5917-9","10.1109/CISIS.2010.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447468","Distributed system;introspection;large-scale system;monitoring;storage management","Application software;Competitive intelligence;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Large-scale systems;Mesh generation;Software performance;Software systems;State feedback;System testing","distributed databases;grid computing;information retrieval systems;monitoring;optimisation;resource allocation","MonALISA distributed monitoring framework;blobseer data management system;distributed systems;introspection layer;massive data storage;monitoring system;resource-usage optimization","","1","","14","","","15-18 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new web search personalization approach that captures the user's interests and preferences in the form of concepts by mining search results and their clickthroughs. Due to the important role location information plays in mobile search, we separate concepts into content concepts and location concepts, and organize them into ontologies to create an ontology-based, multi-facet (OMF) profile to precisely capture the user's content and location interests and hence improve the search accuracy. Moreover, recognizing the fact that different users and queries may have different emphases on content and location information, we introduce the notion of content and location entropies to measure the amount of content and location information associated with a query, and click content and location entropies to measure how much the user is interested in the content and location information in the results. Accordingly, we propose to define personalization effectiveness based on the entropies and use it to balance the weights between the content and location facets. Finally, based on the derived ontologies and personalization effectiveness, we train an SVM to adapt a personalized ranking function for re-ranking of future search. We conduct extensive experiments to compare the precision produced by our OMF profiles and that of a baseline method. Experimental results show that OMF improves the precision significantly compared to the baseline.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-5446-4; POD:978-1-4244-5445-7; USB:978-1-4244-5444-0","10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447911","","Data models;Data privacy;Educational institutions;Protection;Publishing;Sufficient conditions;Testing;Web search","entropy;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines;support vector machines;user interfaces","SVM;Web search;content information;entropy;information retrieval;location information;mobile search;ontologies;ontology based multifacet;search engines;user preference","","16","","16","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To alleviate this manually classification problem, more researchers focus on the issue of Web pages classification technology. In this paper, we proposed Random Forest Classifier (RF) based on random forest method for multi-category Web page classification. The proposed RF classifier can classify Web pages efficiently according to their corresponding class without using other feature selection methods.

NANOOS serves the Pacific Northwest from the US/Canada border to Cape Mendocino on the northern California coast. Its mission is to coordinate and support the development, implementation, and operations of a regional coastal ocean observing system (RCOOS) for the Pacific Northwest region, as part of IOOS. A key objective for NANOOS is to provide data and user-defined products regarding the coast, estuaries and ocean to a diverse group of end users in a timely fashion, and at spatial and temporal scales appropriate for their needs. To this end, NANOOS is developing a web mapping portal, the NANOOS Visualization System (NVS), that aggregates, displays and serves near real-time coastal, estuarine, oceanographic and meteorological data, derived from buoys, gliders, tide gauges, HF Radar, meteorological stations, satellites and shore based coastal stations, as well as model forecast information in such a way that it presents end users with a rich, informative and meaningful experience. NVS makes use of a variety of services, including the Google Maps service and a data translation and visualization service known as ERDDAP (Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program), compliant Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web standards such as the Sensor Observation Service (SOS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Keyhole Markup Language (KML), as well as the Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP) as served and cataloged by the NANOOS THREDDS (Thematic Realtime Environmental Distributed Data Services) Data Server (TDS). These heterogeneous data streams are transformed on-the-fly to other formats or representations, which NVS makes available to the end user via a Google Maps interface. We will describe in detail the NVS development process and will demonstrate the ability of NVS to serve as a - ortal for one-stop access to near real-time regional data and forecast products, including NOAA's first seven ?core variables? (ocean currents, temperature, salinity, water level, waves, chlorophyll and surface winds), by describing the data flows from NANOOS funded coastal and ocean observing and forecasting assets as well as Federal assets. In addition, we will describe future development plans that include greater functionality, iteratively improving NVS based on feedback received at planned training workshops and from identified stakeholders, and updating NVS to be compliant with future IOOS and OGC standards.","0197-7385;01977385","CD:978-0-933957-38-1; Paper:978-1-4244-4960-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2009.5422325","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422325","","Aggregates;Data visualization;Displays;Hafnium;Meteorology;Ocean temperature;Portals;Real time systems;Sea measurements;Tides","Web services;Web sites;data visualisation;environmental science computing;information retrieval;oceanographic techniques;public domain software","Cape Mendocino;Google Maps;HF Radar;NANOOS visualization system;Northwest Association of Networked Ocean Observing Systems;US Integrated Ocean Observing System;Web map service;Web mapping portal;buoys;coastal data;data aggregation;data display;data service;environmental research divisions data access program;estuarine data;gliders;keyhole markup language;meteorological data;meteorological stations;network data access protocol;oceanographic data;open geospatial consortium Web standards;open source project;sensor observation service;shore based coastal stations;spatial scales;temporal scales;thematic realtime environmental distributed data services;tide gauges","","1","","6","","","26-29 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The benefits of employing FS techniques include improved data visualization and transparency, a reduction in training and utilization times and potentially, improved prediction performance. Many approaches based on rough set theory up to now, have employed the dependency function, which is based on lower approximations as an evaluation step in the FS process. However, by examining only that information which is considered to be certain and ignoring the boundary region, or region of uncertainty, much useful information is lost. This paper examines a rough set FS technique which uses the information gathered from both the lower approximation dependency value and a distance metric which considers the number of objects in the boundary region and the distance of those objects from the lower approximation. The use of this measure in rough set feature selection can result in smaller subset sizes than those obtained using the dependency function alone. This demonstrates that there is much valuable information to be extracted from the boundary region. Experimental results are presented for both crisp and real-valued data and compared with two other FS techniques in terms of subset size, runtimes, and classification accuracy.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912203","Rough sets;attribute reduction;boundary region;classification.;fuzzy sets","","approximation theory;data reduction;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;pattern classification;rough set theory","attribute reduction;classification accuracy;data transparency;data visualization;dimensionality reduction;distance measure approach;feature selection;lower approximation dependency value;rough set boundary region","","41","","38","","20090508","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Instead they try to by-pass the problem by either ignoring inconsistencies and treating data as if they were not conflicting or by requiring inconsistencies to be resolved outside the system. To address this limitation, we propose Ricolla; an online database system that, by treating inconsistencies as first-class citizens, supports a natural workflow for the management of conflicting data. The system captures inconsistencies (so that community members can easily inspect them) and remains fully functional in their presence, thus enabling inconsistency resolution in an Â¿as-you-goÂ¿ fashion.

Often times, the owner of the road network data (e.g., a transport authority) provides its database to third-party query services, which are responsible for answering shortest path queries posed by their clients. The issue arising here is that a query service might be returning sub-optimal paths either purposely (in order to serve its own purposes like computational savings or commercial reasons) or because it has been compromised by Internet attackers who falsify the results. Therefore, for the above applications to succeed, it is essential that each reported path is accompanied by a proof, which allows clients to verify the path's correctness. This is the first study on shortest path verification in outsourced network databases. We propose the concept of authenticated hints, which is used to reduce the size of the proofs. We develop several authentication techniques and quantify their tradeoffs with respect to offline construction cost and proof size.

We focus on the template ""NPOV"", which signals breaches on the fundamental policy of neutrality of Wikipedia articles, and we show how and to what extent putting such template on a page affects the editing process. We notably find that intensity of editing increases immediately after the ""NPOV"" template appears and that controversies about articles which have received the attention of a more limited group of editors before they were tagged as controversial have a lower chance to be treated quickly.","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:978-1-4244-5510-2; POD:978-1-4244-5509-6","10.1109/HICSS.2010.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428427","","Collaborative work;Data mining;Guidelines;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Problem-solving;Production systems;Roads;Signal processing;Switches;Wikipedia","Web sites;information retrieval;problem solving","Wikipedia community;labor coordination;labor division;online communities;open content communities;parsimonious coordination device;peer production;problem solving;template messages role","","0","","22","","","5-8 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are currently exist many research papers published in electronic media and new media. Recently, the improved technology makes Internet becomes the most widely used media. The research papers are published in many forms, such as in the for of a journal. Relation among journals can be traced though their citations. The number of citation to a journal paper can also be calculated to show the contribution of that particular paper. In order to know the relation among journals published on the Internet, we need a system which can automatically produce a relationship between articles from different journal, located in different websites. Therefore, in this work we created a mashup in order to extract website pages and then pick required files automatically. This system produced a database to save the extracted files and then find the relations. The data which has already processed could be seen in user interfaces. The interface has search functionalities by using key words inputted by users. As a result, the whole system forms a Mashup. We created an automatic extraction for Indonesian electronic journal system, using data from four (4) universities e-journal's site. We built the system using PHP language and MySQL database, after carefully study the algorithm in Openkapow Robomaker. The system can successfully extract information from journal provider's web pages, which include special type of PDF pages, then save them in database. The system generated finally shows the connection and the relation among the journals. The test result shows the processing time and memory usage evaluation for a random number of files. The evaluation results show that the execution time is dependent on the number of journal series, volumes, and number of articles on related e-journal sites.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5398-6; POD:978-1-4244-5397-9","10.1109/WKDD.2010.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432520","citation index;journal;web extraction","Application software;Computational modeling;Data engineering;Data mining;Databases;Electronic mail;Internet;Knowledge engineering;Mashups;Web pages","Internet;citation analysis;electronic publishing;information retrieval","Indonesian electronic citation system;Internet;MySQL database;Openkapow Robomaker algorithm;PHP language;Web extraction techniques;Web sites;e-journal;journal publishing","","1","","9","","","9-10 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visual information is highly organized along the dimensions of an image and algorithms should make use of this to enhance the performance of several visual processing tasks. In this paper, a generative model is proposed that fuses both the local information obtained from visual words and the global geometric layout given by a previous segmentation of the image. Furthermore, the model considers inter-region influences so topics can spread along the image and, thus, generate final segmentations in which regions represent semantic concepts.

Our approach aims at automatically adapting the information extraction knowledge previously learned from a source Web site to a new unseen site, at the same time, discovering previously unseen attributes. Two kinds of text-related clues from the source Web site are considered. The first kind of clue is obtained from the extraction pattern contained in the previously learned wrapper. The second kind of clue is derived from the previously extracted or collected items. A generative model for the generation of the site-independent content information and the site-dependent layout format of the text fragments related to attribute values contained in a Web page is designed to harness the uncertainty involved. Bayesian learning and expectation-maximization (EM) techniques are developed under the proposed generative model for identifying new training data for learning the new wrapper for new unseen sites. Previously unseen attributes together with their semantic labels can also be discovered via another EM-based Bayesian learning based on the generative model. We have conducted extensive experiments from more than 30 real-world Web sites in three different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906994","Web mining;Wrapper adaptation;machine learning.;text mining","","Bayes methods;Web sites;data mining;expectation-maximisation algorithm;information retrieval systems;learning (artificial intelligence)","Bayesian learning framework;EM-based Bayesian learning;Web information knowledge extraction;Web page;Web sites;expectation-maximization techniques;information extraction wrappers;pattern extraction;site-dependent layout format;site-independent content information;text fragments;text-related clues;training","","10","1","34","","20090502","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such sensor data could be erroneous and inconsistent. For example, two WASMs might detect the same target, but associate it with two different targets and tracks. Similarly, two WASMs might detect two distinct targets, but recognize them as the same target. The research challenge is how to fuse both accurate and inaccurate information broadcasted from WASMs, and reconstruct the battle space for accurate target tracking. For each of the detected target points, WASMs provide its location information, detection time, and directional velocity. We, herein, propose a target clustering approach to group target points detected by WASMs and identify the track of individual targets. Our approach differs from traditional clustering techniques as it performs clustering using the time and orientation information, in addition to the distance in the Euclidean space. Our approach employs a network modeling technique to reconstruct all target points and their feasible movement, and a new optimization technique to find the most probable target tracks. Our approach can also determine the optimal number of clusters (targets) automatically from the input data. In this study, distributed interactive simulation, a real-time simulation of a network's information exchange, is used to generate battle space test instances that are used in evaluating the proposed framework. Based on seven realistically simulated instances, the computational results show that our approach provides extremely accurate target-tracking results in a timely fashion. We also compare our results with those obtained using the k-means clustering technique. On average, our approach reconstructs the real target tracks with about 95% accuracy in less than 10 s, while the k-means clustering results yields about 80% accuracy in a similar computational time.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2035101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5357430","Clustering;military applications;optimization;target tracking","Broadcasting;Computational modeling;Data mining;Fuses;Sensor systems;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Target recognition;Target tracking;Testing;Weapons","information retrieval;military computing;pattern clustering;search problems;sensor fusion;target tracking","Euclidean space;directional velocity;distributed interactive simulation;information extraction;k-means clustering technique;multisensor data;network information exchange;network modeling technique;optimization technique;real-time simulation;spatiotemporal clustering optimisation;target clustering approach;target tracking;wide-area-search munitions","","6","","37","","20091222","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, our understanding of orality as a mode to convey information remains limited. One approach to remedying this knowledge gap lies in exploring whether oral information may be approached in a manner consistent with approaches to non-oral information, specifically information in documents. This paper explores research in document studies, information behavior, and social constructionism in an effort to increase disciplinary knowledge about information made available orally. Partial results of a study conducted to conceptualize and empirically observe oral documents are presented including: (1) a discussion on how the literature supports the concept of an oral document and (2) a presentation of empirical data that demonstrates an utterance can incorporate the properties of a document. Discussions of the implications, research design limitations, and recommendations for future research conclude this presentation.","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:978-1-4244-5510-2; POD:978-1-4244-5509-6","10.1109/HICSS.2010.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428332","","Animals;Character recognition;Education;Information science;Writing","document handling;information retrieval","disciplinary knowledge;empirical data presentation;knowledge gap;nonoral information;oral document literature;oral information behavior;social constructionism","","0","","23","","","5-8 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most state-of-the-art record matching methods are supervised, which requires the user to provide training data. These methods are not applicable for the Web database scenario, where the records to match are query results dynamically generated on-the-fly. Such records are query-dependent and a prelearned method using training examples from previous query results may fail on the results of a new query. To address the problem of record matching in the Web database scenario, we present an unsupervised, online record matching method, UDD, which, for a given query, can effectively identify duplicates from the query result records of multiple Web databases. After removal of the same-source duplicates, the ??presumed?? nonduplicate records from the same source can be used as training examples alleviating the burden of users having to manually label training examples. Starting from the nonduplicate set, we use two cooperating classifiers, a weighted component similarity summing classifier and an SVM classifier, to iteratively identify duplicates in the query results from multiple Web databases. Experimental results show that UDD works well for the Web database scenario where existing supervised methods do not apply.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4840347","Record matching;SVM.;Web database;data deduplication;data integration;duplicate detection;query result record;record linkage","","information retrieval systems;pattern classification;pattern matching;query processing;support vector machines","SVM classifier;cooperating classifiers;data integration;multiple web databases;online record matching method;query results;same-source duplicates;training data","","10","","38","","20090424","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, previous frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms give equal weightage to sequential traversal patterns while the pages in sequential traversal patterns have different importance and have different weightage. Another main problem in most of the frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms is that they produce a large number of sequential traversal patterns when a minimum support is lowered and they do not provide alternative ways to adjust the number of sequential traversal patterns other than increasing the minimum support. In this paper, we propose a frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithm with weights constraint. Our main approach is to add the weight constraints into the sequential traversal pattern while maintaining the downward closure property. A weight range is defined to maintain the downward closure property and pages are given different weights and traversal sequences assign a minimum and maximum weight. In scanning a session database, a maximum and minimum weight in the session database is used to prune infrequent sequential traversal subsequence by doing downward closure property can be maintained. Our method produces a few but important sequential traversal patterns in session databases with a low minimum support, by adjusting a weight range of pages and sequence.","2157-0477;21570477","Electronic:978-0-7695-3884-6; POD:978-1-4244-5250-7","10.1109/ICETET.2009.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5395407","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Data engineering;Data mining;Databases;Design engineering;Web mining;Web pages;Web server;Web sites","Internet;data mining;database management systems;information retrieval","Web logs;Web usage mining;downward closure property maintenance;frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms;session database;weight constraint","","0","","26","","","16-18 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper first proposes a set of generic target artefacts that defines information that may be targeted for recovery and the meaning that can be inferred from this. A controlled test was then undertaken where Skype was executed and the memory from the target machine collected. The analysis showed that it is feasible to recover the target data as applied to Skype, which would not be otherwise available.
