On one hand, text categorization models allow users to browse more easily the set of texts of their own interests, by navigating in category hierarchies. On the other hand, question/answering is a method of retrieving information from vast document collections. In spite of their shared goal, these two information retrieval techniques have been ever applied separately. In this paper we present a question/answering system that takes advantage from category information by exploiting several models of question and answer categorization. Knowing the question category has the potential of enhancing a more efficient answer extraction mechanism as the matching of the question category with the answer category allows to: (1) re-rank the answers; and (2) eliminate incorrect answers. Experimental results show the effects of question and answer categorization on the overall question answering performance.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-2038-3","10.1109/TAI.2003.1250197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250197","","Data mining;Face;Humans;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Information technology;Navigation;Ontologies;Text categorization","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;text analysis","Web-based services;World Wide Web;answer extraction;answer filtering;answer reranking;category hierarchies;document collection;information retrieval;information technology;question answering system;text categorization;textual information","","4","","14","","","3-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic solution of this problem is to find the fragment of source code that is corresponding to the implementation of each requirement. This can be viewed as a requirement-slicing problem - slicing the source code according to each individual requirement. We present an approach to find the set of functions that is corresponding to each requirement. The main idea of our method is to combine the information retrieval technology with the static analysis of source code structures. First, we retrieve the initial function sets through some information retrieval model using functional requirements as the queries and identifier information (such as function names, parameter names, variable names etc.) of functions in the source code as target documents. Then we complement each retrieved initial function set by analyzing the call graph extracted from the source code. A premise of our approach is that programmers should use meaningful names as identifiers. Furthermore, we perform an experimental study based on a GNU system. We use two basic metrics: precision and recall (which are the common practice in the information retrieval field), to evaluate our approach. We also compare the results directly acquired from information retrieval with those that are complemented through static source code structure analysis.","","POD:0-7695-2011-1","10.1109/APSEC.2003.1254359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254359","","Data mining;Documentation;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Programming profession;Software engineering;Software maintenance;Software systems;Space technology;Sun","information retrieval;program slicing;reverse engineering;software maintenance;software metrics;system documentation","GNU system;call graph;information retrieval technology;precision metrics;program comprehension;recall metrics;requirement-slicing problem;requirements implementation understanding;software maintenance;source code;static source code structure analysis","","7","","18","","","10-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each virtual tourist will be autonomous in its 3D world movements but he will receive audio/video information or other multimedia documents or 3D objects, eventually autonomous entities placed in its 3D virtual universe, from its guide. The guide is able to suggest to its group of tourists some interesting viewpoints during the tour. More, he is able to augment the database, particularly the associated behaviours to the entities. It is enough to analyse the entities in a scene and to attach them some new behaviours. For example, he can place in the environment some virtual guides, and the users will interact with them. These virtual guides recognise some keywords or intentions; i.e. if a tourist spends some time near a specific place, the virtual guide will initiate a dialog upon the place's history. The user is able to cancel the dialog with a virtual guide and return to its group. The application is based on the AReViJava (Atelier de Realite Virtuelle) platform, developed in our laboratory.","","POD:0-7695-1922-9","10.1109/CYBER.2003.1253489","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253489","","Animation;Humans;Information retrieval;Layout;Multimedia databases;Numerical models;Publishing;Videoconference;Virtual environment;Virtual reality","education;history;information resources;information retrieval;interactive systems;virtual reality","3D world movement;database;heritage management and publishing;historical site;information retrieval;interactive distributed guided tour;virtual tourist","","1","","8","","","3-5 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While there are many extant search engines that assist users in locating URLs, they often return an overwhelmingly large number of information sources for a query, and the (time-consuming but perhaps interesting) task of browsing Web sites rests heavily on users. This article presents detailed designs of Web agents that assist users in browsing and filtering information in Web sites. In engineering Web browsing agents (WBAs), the contributions of this research include: (1) devising a 3-stage information filtering approach that determines the relevance of Web pages by detecting evidence phrases (EP) constructed from WORDNET, counting the frequencies of EP and considering the nearness among keywords; and (2) devising a relevance metric to measure the relatedness of evidence phrases. Favorable experimental results show that WBAs are successful in filtering relevant information in many instances. Discussions on how different word senses affect the information filtering approach are also given.","","POD:0-7695-1922-9","10.1109/CYBER.2003.1253464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253464","","Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web page design;Web pages","Web sites;information filters;information resources;information retrieval;search engines","EP;URL;WBA;WORDNET;Web agent;Web browsing agent;Web site;browsing;evidence phase;information monitoring;information source;keywords;query;search engine;three-stage information filtering","","4","2","15","","","3-5 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a study is necessary especially to satisfy Web users who expect the ability to access all Web contents in a unified way, regardless of the structure of the available information. Given a set of distributed structured databases and a query which consists of a set of keywords connected by logical operators, the approach proposed in this paper adapts both Web text files search techniques and information retrieval techniques to rank the existing databases based on their relevance to the posed query. For each keyword, the user specifies a level of search, which may be column, record, or table. We developed an estimation method with statistical foundations to estimate the usefulness of individual relational databases. The system gives a hint of what databases might be useful for the user's query, based on word-frequency information kept for each database. Some experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in determining promising sources for a given query. As naive end-user satisfaction is a main target and motive, we developed a prototype system with a user friendly Web-based interface that accomplishes our goals in a simple and powerful way.","","POD:0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251411","","Computer science;Distributed databases;Informatics;Information retrieval;Information systems;Keyword search;Prototypes;Relational databases;Web pages","Web sites;distributed databases;online front-ends;query processing;relational databases;user interfaces","Web content access;Web text file searching;Web user satisfaction;database selection;distributed databases;distributed structured databases;end-user satisfaction;estimation method;information retrieval;keyword searching;logical operators;query processing;relational database;relational databases;user friendly Web-based interface;word-frequency information","","1","","13","","","27-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One well known approach to overcoming degradation in performance with respect to increasing dimensions is to reduce the dimensionality of the original dataset before constructing the index. However, identifying the correlation among the dimensions and effectively reducing them is a challenging task. We present an adaptive multilevel mahalanobis-based dimensionality reduction (MMDR) technique for high-dimensional indexing. Our MMDR technique has three notable features compared to existing methods. First, it discovers elliptical clusters using only the low-dimensional subspaces. Second, data points in the different axis systems are indexed using a single B<sup>+</sup>-tree. Third, our technique is highly scalable in terms of data size and dimensionality. An extensive performance study using both real and synthetic datasets was conducted, and the results show that our technique not only achieves higher precision, but also enables queries to be processed efficiently.","","POD:0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260784","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260784","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data analysis;Degradation;Euclidean distance;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Shape;Surface treatment","database indexing;principal component analysis","MMDR technique;elliptical clusters;high dimensional indexing;low-dimensional subspaces;multidimensional indexes;multilevel Mahalanobis-based dimensionality reduction","","15","","14","","","5-8 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In information retrieval, an association between two sets of keywords occurs when they cooccur in a document. Similarly, in data mining, an association occurs when one attribute set occurs together with another. As the number of such associations may be large, maximal association rules are sought, e.g., Feldman et al. (1997, 1998). Rough set theory is a successful tool for data mining. By using this theory, rules similar to maximal associations can be found. However, we show that the rough set approach to discovering knowledge is much simpler than the maximal association method.","","POD:0-7695-1978-4","10.1109/ICDM.2003.1250969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250969","","Association rules;Computer science;Data mining;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Set theory;Temperature;Thermostats;USA Councils;Vocabulary","data mining;rough set theory;transaction processing","data mining;information retrieval;knowledge discovery;maximal association rule mining;rough set theory;transaction processing","","14","","5","","","19-22 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the memorized knowledge, it then learns some hidden semantic information of images. Image retrieval is finally based on a seamless combination of low-level features, memorized semantic information, and estimated hidden semantic information. The model is easy to implement and can be efficiently applied to an image retrieval system.

A direction join is a spatial join with direction predicates as join condition. In recent years, the efficient processing of direction joins has gradually gained attention in geospatial databases applications, such as spatial data mining and GIS. Until now, the research work on processing of spatial joins has primarily focused on topological relations, such as intersection, and distance relations. There is little work on processing joins with direction relations. This paper presents an efficient method for processing direction joins using R-trees. The quad-tuples model is defined to represent direction relations between the minimum bounding rectangles of spatial objects. An algorithm of processing the filter step of joins using R-trees is given and the refinement step processing is further decomposed into three different operations. The method presented can efficiently process direction joins between objects of any data types in 2D space. Performance evaluation of the proposed method is conducted using real world datasets and the experiment results show that it performs well with respect to both, I/O and CPU-time.","","POD:0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251402","","Computational Intelligence Society;Data engineering;Data mining;Database systems;Filters;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Performance evaluation;Relational databases;Spatial databases","data mining;geographic information systems;tree data structures;visual databases","GIS;direction joins;direction predicates;direction relations;distance relation;geographic information systems;intersection relation;join condition;joins processing;performance evaluation;r-trees;spatial data mining;spatial databases;spatial joins;topological relation","","0","","","","","27-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DSS is defined as a computer-aided decision environment, positioned at higher levels of the control hierarchy, where the complexity of a task or the importance of a decision calls for human supervision. The data-centric DSS was developed when none of the traditional forecasting and optimization approaches were applicable to a municipal district heating system. The designated R&D team adopted a hybrid approach in which a multiple regression model was applied to a subset of past data points. The idea of data-centric forecasting involves viewing historical data records as points in the associated data hypercube. For any query point, defined by specific values of the predictor variables, a set of similar data points in the neighborhood are retrieved and fit with a statistical model. The model is used to calculate the forecast of the response variable and then the local model is discarded. The idea of data-centric optimization involves viewing the historical data as points in the associated data hypercube. Starting at the current state of the process, a set of actions is evaluated in a relevant neighborhood of the current state. New actions are searched for in the vicinity of the past best practices while attempting to improve the objective function. The paper continues with issues relating to the selection of a suitable technology, the transfer of knowledge from the development team to a business unit, and the practical aspects of DSS application that add to the cost of operation are discussed.","1066-033X;1066033X","","10.1109/MCS.2003.1251180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251180","","Best practices;Decision support systems;Heating;Humans;Hypercubes;Industry applications;Information retrieval;Paper technology;Predictive models;Research and development","decision making;decision support systems;optimisation;regression analysis;research and development;technology transfer","computer-aided decision environment;datacentric decision support system;datacentric forecasting;datacentric optimization;human supervision;multiple regression model;process industry;research and development;task complexity;transfer of knowledge","","4","2","20","","","Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Improving the performance of OLTP workloads on SMP computer systems by limiting modified cache lines","J. E. Black; D. F. Wright; E. M.

No.03CH37441)","20031203","2003","","","21","29","Symmetric multiprocessor (SMP) computer systems with more than four CPUs often exhibit significantly lower overall performance than would be expected from the sum of the performance of the individual CPUs. One of the causes of this degradation is the increased average memory latency due to cache to cache migration of modified cache lines. Such transfers often incur significantly longer latencies than a simple cache miss, which can be satisfied from main memory. By setting an upper bound on the number of modified cache lines that are allowed to exist in a main memory when this limit is exceeded, the average memory latency and overall system performance on an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload can be improved. This paper presents an investigation of this concept, called original limiting, on a commercial SMP system. The Original Limiting concept was implemented in the second level cache (SLC) of the Unisys NX6830 series of SMP systems, which support up to eight CPUs. An original limiting queue (OLQ) was added to limit the number of exclusive or modified lines in a 5% improvement in the number of transactions processed per minute, by reducing the average memory latency. A variety of experiments indicate that the OLQ is a simple, but effective, mechanism to enhance the performance of OLTP applications on SMP systems.","","POD:0-7803-8229-3","10.1109/WWC.2003.1249054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1249054","","Bandwidth;Degradation;Delay;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Multiprocessing systems;Protocols;Topology;Upper bound","cache storage;multiprocessing systems;performance evaluation;queueing theory;transaction processing","CPU;OLTP workloads;SMP systems;Unisys NX6830 series;average memory latency;cache-to-cache migration;modified cache lines;online transaction processing;original limiting queue;performance improvement;second level cache;symmetric multiprocessor systems;system performance","","0","","13","","","27 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A weighted-sequence is defined as a two-dimensional structure where each element in the sequence is associated with a weight. A series of network events, for instance, is a weighted-sequence in that each event has a timestamp. Querying a large sequence database by events' occurrence patterns is a first step towards understanding the temporal causal relationships among the events. The index structure proposed enables us to efficiently retrieve from the database all subsequences, possibly noncontiguous, that match a given query sequence both by events and by weights. The index method also takes into consideration the nonuniformfrequency distribution of events in the sequence data. In addition, our method finds a broad range of applications in indexing scientific data consisting of multiple numerical columns for discovery of correlations among these columns. For instance, indexing a DNA microarray that records expression levels of genes under different conditions enables us to search for genes whose responses to various experimental perturbations follow a given pattern. We demonstrate, using real-world data sets, that our method is effective and efficient.","","POD:0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260782","","Computer science;DNA;Data analysis;Data engineering;Databases;Engineering management;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Sequences","DNA;database indexing;query formulation;query processing;statistical distributions;very large databases","DNA microarray;index structure;large databases;nonuniformfrequency distribution;real-world data sets;temporal causal relationship;weighted-sequences","","7","2","20","","","5-8 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new approach we propose herein is based upon the representation of a signal by the superposition of members of a set of the orthogonal functions Walsh. We shall show how is it possible to retrieve the missing information in an image of resolution 2<sup>M</sup> from another image shifted by a subpixel shift in order to reconstruct a new image with resolution 2<sup>M+1</sup>.

Moreover, new applications can be easily integrated into this system as a new development and utilize the existing components.

A fundamental task in a data cleaning system is matching textual attributes that refer to the same entity (e.g., organization name or address). This matching is effectively performed via the cosine similarity metric from the information retrieval field. For robustness and scalability, these ""text joins"" are best done inside an RDBMS, which is where the data is likely to reside. Unfortunately, computing an exact answer to a text join can be expensive.

The physical parts on the object surface that they carve out are the same in all views, even though the extraction proceeds from a single view only. The surface patterns within the regions are then characterized by a feature vector of moment invariants. Invariance is under affine geometric deformations and scaled color bands with an offset added. This allows regions from different views to be matched efficiently. An indexing technique based on vantage point tree organizes the feature vectors in such a way that a naive sequential search can be avoided. This results in sublinear computation times to retrieve images from a database. In order to get sufficient certainty about the correctness of the retrieved images, a method to increase the number of matched regions is introduced. This way, the system is both efficient and discriminant. It is demonstrated how scenes or buildings are recognized, even in case of partial visibility and under a large variety of viewing condition changes.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1247350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247350","","Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Lighting;Shape;Vectors","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;indexing;tree data structures;visual databases","affine geometric deformations;feature vector;image content;image retrieval;invariant regions;moment invariants;scaled color bands;vantage point tree","","16","1","8","","","14-17 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our university department was selected as an example organizational unit for experimentation. We start with the real physical environment and we design a CVE to provide new collaboration features to people working in the unit and those who will visit it. The advantages of the approach are many. First, people are familiar with the basic physical environment. Second, some activities requiring physical presence can be done with virtual presence, enabling more convenient ways to work for employees.

One of the state-of-the-art indexing methods is vector approximation file (VA-file), which indexes high-dimensional data by filtering feature vectors so that only a small fraction of them are visited in the search process. The VA-file uses a partition strategy that divides the data space on every dimension to make each partition equally full and assigns a same number of bits to each dimension. However, the strategy is not efficient to image datasets where the number of different vector components (granularity) in each dimension is largely diverse. The first two partition strategies are implemented in a practical way according to the description from the original VA-file method. The other two nonuniform partition strategies are proposed to resolve the problems of reduplicate coordinates and uniform bits assignment for each dimension, which assign more bits to represent dimensions with more vector components. Experimental results have shown that these strategies largely improve the performance of the VA-file for nonuniform datasets in terms of query time and filtering efficiency.","","POD:0-7695-2031-6","10.1109/MMSE.2003.1254417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254417","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Degradation;Delay;Filtering;Gallium nitride;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms","database indexing;image retrieval;very large databases;visual databases","dimension granularity;feature vector filtering efficiency;high-dimensional data indexing algorithm;image dataset;image retrieval;nonuniform partition strategy;query time;uniform bit assignment;vector approximation file","","0","","19","","","10-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose XR-tree, namely, XML region tree, which is a dynamic external memory index structure specially designed for strictly nested XML data. The unique feature of XR-tree is that, for a given element, all its ancestors (or descendants) in an element set indexed by an XR-tree can be identified with optimal worst case I/O cost. We then propose a new structural join algorithm that can evaluate the structural relationship between two XR-tree indexed element sets by effectively skipping ancestors and descendants that do not participate in the join.

Since similar feature vectors in one cluster can come from several different semantic classes, SVM is applied to represent conditioned feature vector distributions within each cluster, and a Markov random field is used to model the spatial distributions of the semantic labels. A semantic layout representation is proposed to describe the semantics of the images.

However, given an information need users are faced with a daunting task of trying to formulate queries over these multiple disparate data sources in order to retrieve the desired video content. In this paper, we explore a novel approach based on search fusion in which the user interactively builds a query by sequentially choosing among the descriptors and data sources and by selecting from various combining and score aggregation functions to fuse results of individual searches. For example, the system allows building of queries such as ""retrieve video clips that have color of beach scenes, the detection of sky, and detection of water"".

Such kind of ambiguity can be gracefully dealt with by multi-instance learning techniques, and previous research shows that bag generators can significantly influence the performance of a CBIR system. In this paper, a novel bag generator named ImaBag is presented, where the pixels of each image are first clustered based on their color and spatial features and then the clustered blocks are merged and converted into a specific number of instances.

The states are built on an attribute based referential and the capacity of the source to answer the request under formalization. The actions allow to ask questions to the user or to probe the information source. The rewards reflect the satisfaction of the user, the length of the mediation and the quantity of results.

Simple meta-data search mechanism will be sufficient to support searching and retrieving shared files over P2P networks.

In this paper, we propose an intelligent P2P content-based document retrieval system known as iSearch-P2P. In iSearch-P2P, we have incorporated an intelligent technique based on the Fuzzy Adaptive Resonance Theory (Fuzzy ART) neural network to perform document clustering in order to support content-based publishing and retrieval over P2P networks. With intelligent content-based search, the iSearch-P2P system supports scalability and avoids indexing and query flooding problems of most existing P2P systems.

This paper provides an efficient and fault tolerant algorithm for implementing the Hopfield ANN on a torus parallel architecture. The main advantage of this algorithm is fault tolerance, high performance, and cost effectiveness. The developed algorithm is much faster than other known algorithms of its class and comparable in speed to more complex architectures such as the hypercube without the added cost. It requires O(1) multiplications and O(log N) additions, whereas most others require O(N) multiplications and O(N) additions. Moreover, the developed algorithm has an added advantage over other known algorithms due to its fault tolerance feature, which is based on ABFT techniques. The main advantage of our ABFT (algorithm-based fault tolerance) method over other existing ABFT methods is its ability to detect and correct several faults without any additional hardware overhead (i.e. no extra row or column is needed).","1550-5774;15505774","POD:0-7695-2042-1","10.1109/DFTVS.2003.1250133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250133","","Artificial neural networks;Associative memory;Costs;Fault detection;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Hypercubes;Information retrieval;Parallel architectures;Pattern recognition","Hopfield neural nets;content-addressable storage;digital arithmetic;fault tolerance;parallel architectures","ABFT techniques;Hopfield associative memory;addition;algorithm-based fault tolerance;artificial neural network;fault correction;fault detection;fault tolerance;fault tolerant ANN;hypercube;multiplication;torus parallel architecture","","1","","16","","","3-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though there exist algorithms that can achieve optimal search performance to identify isosurface cells, they prove impractical for large datasets due to a high storage overhead. With the dual goals of achieving fast isosurface extraction and simultaneously reducing the space requirement, we introduce an algorithm based on transform coding to compress the interval information of the cells in a dataset. Compression is achieved by first transforming the cell intervals (minima, maxima) into a form which allows more efficient compaction. It is followed by a dataset optimized non-uniform quantization stage. The compressed data is stored in a data structure that allows fast searches in the compression domain, thus eliminating the need to retrieve the original representation of the intervals at run-time. The space requirement of our search data structure is the mandatory cost of storing every cell ID once, plus an overhead for quantization information. The overhead is typically in the order of a few hundredths of the dataset size.","","POD:0-7803-8120-3","10.1109/VISUAL.2003.1250373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250373","","Compaction;Data mining;Data structures;Information retrieval;Information science;Isosurfaces;Quantization;Runtime;Transform coding;Visualization","data compression;data structures;data visualisation;feature extraction;transform coding","data compression;data retrieval;data structure;dataset cells;interval information compression;isosurface cells;isosurface extraction;nonuniform quantization;optimal search performance;space efficiency;space efficient algorithm;storage overhead;transform coding","","3","","15","","","24-24 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaborative recommender systems utilize correlation between customer preference ratings to identify ""like-minded"" customers and predict their product preference. One factor determining the success of the recommender systems is the prediction accuracy, which in many cases is limited by lacking adequate ratings (the sparsity problem). Recently, the use of latent class model (LCM) has been proposed to alleviate this problem. In this paper, we first study how the LCM can be extended to handle customers and products outside the training set. In addition, we propose the use of a pair of LCMs (called dual latent class model-DLCM), instead of a single LCM, to model customers' likes and dislikes separately for enhancing the prediction accuracy. Experimental results based on the EachMovie dataset show that DLCM outperforms both LCM and the conventional correlation-based method when the available ratings are sparse.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2003.818877","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259442","","Accuracy;Collaboration;Collaborative work;Costs;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Recommender systems;Web sites","Web sites;correlation methods;customer relationship management;groupware;information filters;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","EachMovie dataset;World Wide Web;collaborative recommender systems;correlation-based methods;customer preference modeling;dual latent class models;prediction accuracy;product recommendation;statistical cluster model;training set","","26","","21","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The BN-based framework was previously used for natural language understanding, where BNs infer the informational goal of the user's query based on its parsed semantic concepts. We extended this framework with the technique of backward inference that can automatically detect missing or spurious concepts based on the inferred goal. This is, in turn, used to drive the mixed-initiative dialog model that prompts for missing concepts and clarifies for spurious concepts. Applicability is demonstrated for a simple foreign exchange domain, and our framework's mixed-initiative interactions were shown to be superior to the system-initiative and user-initiative interactions. We also investigate the scalability and portability of the BN-based framework to the more complex air travel (ATIS) domain. Backward inference detected an increased number of missing and spurious concepts, which led to redundancies in the dialog model. We experimented with several remedial measures that showed promise in reducing the redundancies. We also present a set of principles for hand-assigning ""degrees of belief"" to the BN to reduce the demand for massive training data when porting to a new domain. Experimentation with the ATIS data also gave promising results.","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/TSA.2003.814380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1255463","","Aerospace electronics;Automobiles;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Research and development management;Scalability;Systems engineering and theory;Training data","belief networks;foreign exchange trading;inference mechanisms;interactive systems;natural languages;travel industry","air travel information system;backward inference;belief networks;dialog model redundancies;foreign exchange domain;hand-assigning degrees of belief;missing concepts;mixed-initiative dialog modeling;portability;scalability;system-user initiative interactions","","26","5","29","","","Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To support designers, a system must provide access to previous valid designs that satisfy or nearly satisfy requirements, functions, or characteristics, and allow the integration and transformation of the retrieved designs into a new design the meets the new design specifications. Many approaches have been developed in the past to support designers in accessing designs for their new design needs. Most of the existing approaches typically store design documents as files and provide an additional structure to access the documents through the indexing of the entire file and do not offer designers the ability to express more complex retrieval queries or simply queries different from the ones pre-computed in the index. No existing approach appears to offer a real query language to retrieve cases for engineering design in various contexts represented by the geometry and topology of a finished design. In these systems, retrieval queries usually are Boolean expressions of terms consisting of valued attributes as represented through the indices (or pre-computed annotations). In addition, these approaches usually do not provide a framework for design integration (when components extracted from several designs must be integrated to meet the new requirements) as needed to support mechanical engineering design reuse. In this paper, we present an approach to support mechanical design data reuse that exploits constraint databases. This approach provides a real query language that expresses complex queries that retrieve, integrate and transform design data. It relies on the data model through constraints compatible with the standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP), standard for mechanical design data representation.","","POD:0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251429","","Data mining;Data models;Database languages;Design engineering;Engineering drawings;Geometry;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mechanical engineering;Topology","CAD;constraint handling;data models;engineering information systems;mechanical engineering computing;query processing;relational databases;technical drawing","Boolean expressions;Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data;computer-aided design;data model;design geometry;design integration;design retrieval;design specifications;design topology;geometric data;integrated design repositories;mechanical design data representation;mechanical engineering design reuse;query language;requirement satisfaction;retrieval queries","","1","","31","","","27-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each video shot is then represented by a hierarchical structure known as the shot tree. The shots are then classified into pseudo-semantic classes that describe the shot content. Finally, the results are presented to the user in an active browsing environment using a similarity pyramid data structure. The similarity pyramid allows the user to view the video database at various levels of detail.

Directly supporting these structured accesses is an important step in providing high-performance I/O solutions for these applications. High-level interfaces such as HDF5 and Parallel netCDF provide convenient APIs for accessing structured datasets, and the MPI-IO interface also supports efficient access to structured data. However, parallel file systems do not traditionally support such access. In this work we present an implementation of structured data access support in the context of the parallel virtual file system (PVFS). We call this support ""datatype I/O"" because of its similarity to MPI datatypes. This support is built by using a reusable datatype-processing component from the MPICH2 MPI implementation. We describe how this component is leveraged to efficiently process structured data representations resulting from MPI-IO operations. We quantitatively assess the solution using three test applications.

We propose an automatic method for word sense induction, i.e. for the discovery of a set of sense descriptors to a given ambiguous word. The approach is based on the statistics of word co-occurrence as derived from Web pages. The underlying assumption is that the senses of an ambiguous word are best described by terms that, although bearing a strong association to this word, are mutually exclusive, i.e. whose association strength within the retrieved Web pages is as weak as possible. Measuring association strength is based upon a novel confidence gain approach that relates the observed co-occurrence frequency for two sense descriptor candidates to an average co-occurrence frequency for pairs of arbitrary words. The proposed approach is fully unsupervised and takes into account the contemporary meanings of words, as reflected in texts from the Internet. Our results are evaluated using a list of ambiguous words commonly referred to in the literature.","","POD:0-7695-1978-4","10.1109/ICDM.2003.1250998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250998","","Databases;Dictionaries;Frequency;Gain measurement;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Particle measurements;Statistics;Text mining;Web pages","Internet;computational linguistics;data mining;information retrieval;natural languages;text analysis","Internet;Web pages;ambiguous word meanings;computational linguistics;confidence gain approach;contemporary word meanings;information retrieval;natural languages;text mining;word co-occurrence;word sense induction","","2","1","10","","","19-22 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We note that random objects (particularly random matrices) have ""predictable"" structures in the spectral domain and it develops a random matrix-based spectral filtering technique to retrieve original data from the dataset distorted by adding random values. We present the theoretical foundation of this filtering method and extensive experimental results to demonstrate that in many cases random data distortion preserve very little data privacy. We also point out possible avenues for the development of new privacy-preserving data mining techniques like exploiting multiplicative and colored noise for preserving privacy in data mining applications.","","POD:0-7695-1978-4","10.1109/ICDM.2003.1250908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250908","","Additive noise;Application software;Colored noise;Computer science;Data mining;Data privacy;Filtering;Information retrieval;Perturbation methods;Telecommunication traffic","data mining;data privacy;perturbation techniques;random noise","colored noise;data perturbation technique;data privacy;matrix-based spectral filtering technique;multiplicative noise;privacy-preserving data mining technique;random noise;random objects;randomized data distortion technique","","120","5","20","","","19-22 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We focus on the classification of unlabelled documents into two classes: relevant and irrelevant, given a topic of interest. By dividing the set of documents into buckets (for instance, answers returned by different search engines), and using association rule mining to find common sets of words among the buckets, we can efficiently obtain a sample of documents that has a large percentage of relevant ones.

The XML wrapper assumes hierarchical XML documents modeled as families of virtual relational tables in a federated schema, which can then be queried to extract information from the XML and combine it with data from other sources. Due to the nature of the problem, using the XML wrapper is complex and several difficult steps must be undertaken: (i) The hierarchical schema of the source must be flattened to a relational form, (ii) Each relation of the flattened schema must be registered in DB2 as a NICKNAME - a complex virtual table definition containing several XPaths as specialized options. (iii) Each NICKNAME must be accompanied by a VIEW - again a complex structure involving join conditions. Chocolate is a tool that alleviates all three tasks: Chocolate provides several flattening strategies and an interface allowing users to modify the automatically generated target schema. Once the user is satisfied with the schema, Chocolate automatically generates the corresponding NICKNAME and VIEW definitions.","","POD:0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260858","","Data mining;Information retrieval;Middleware;Production;Query processing;Relational databases;Simple object access protocol;Spatial databases;Web services;XML","SQL;XML;distributed databases","Chocolate tool demonstration;DB2;SQL queries;Web services;XML documents;XML wrapper generation;federated database;view definition;virtual relational tables","","3","1","4","","","5-8 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel mechanism of similarity retrieval is proposed. Similarity measure between video sequences considering the spatio-temporal variation through consecutive frames is presented. For bridging the semantic gap between low-level features and the rich meaning that users desire to capture, video shots are analyzed and characterized by the high-level feature of motion activity in compressed domain. The extracted features of motion activity are further described by the 2D-histogram that is sensitive to the spatio-temporal variation of moving objects. In order to reduce the dimensions of feature vector space in sequence matching, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) is exploited to map semantic features of consecutive frames to the frequency domain while retains the discriminatory information and preserves the Euclidean distance between feature vectors. Experiments are performed on MPEG-7 testing video streams, and the results of sequence matching show that a few DCT transformed coefficients are adequate and thus reveal the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism of video retrieval.","","POD:0-7695-2031-6","10.1109/MMSE.2003.1254439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254439","","Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Frequency domain analysis;Gunshot detection systems;Information retrieval;Motion analysis;Object detection;Spatial databases;Video compression;Video sequences","discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;image sequences;motion estimation;object detection;video databases;video signal processing","Euclidean distance;MPEG-7 testing video streams;anchorperson shot detection;discrete cosine transform;discriminatory information;feature vector space;news video;object based video similarity retrieval;semantic feature extraction;spatio-temporal variation;video sequence matching;video shots","","2","","13","","","10-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, DBAs typically rely on fully striping objects across all available disk drives as the basic mechanism for optimizing I/O performance. While full striping maximizes I/O parallelism, when query execution involves coaccess of two or more large objects, e.g., a merge join of two tables, the above strategy may be suboptimal due to the increased number of random I/O accesses on each disk drive. Here, we propose a framework for automating the choice of database layout for a given database that also takes into account the effects of coaccessed objects in the workload faced by the system. We formulate the above as an optimization problem and present an efficient solution to the problem that judiciously takes into account the trade-off between I/O parallelism and random I/O accesses. Our experiments on Microsoft SQL server show the superior I/O performance of our techniques compared to the traditional approach of fully striping each database object across all disk drives.","","POD:0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260825","","Decision support systems;Disk drives;Indexes;Information retrieval;Relational databases;Time measurement","SQL;disc drives;query processing;relational databases","DBA;I/O parallelism;I/O performance optimization;Microsoft SQL server;database index;database layout;database table;disk drive;query execution;random I/O access;relational database","","1","1","18","","","5-8 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiments show that the lower bound is easier to implement and more efficient than the M-tree.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1247293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247293","","Content based retrieval;Earth;Filtering;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Spatial coherence;Variable speed drives","image retrieval;image texture;indexing;tree data structures","MPEG-7 descriptors;MPEG-7 reference software;dominant color descriptor;earth movers distance;edge histogram descriptor;image retrieval;query image;texture information","","2","","7","","","14-17 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed methods, which result in more effective and robust techniques for searching 3D models by similarity, support two essential query modes, namely, query by 3D model and query by 2D image. Our feature extraction scheme is inspired by observation of human behavior in recognizing 3D objects in practice. The process of extracting spatial arrangement from a 3D object surface and 2D shape features from projection images are achieved by adopting curvature distribution of the model surfaces and Fourier descriptors of the projection images.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-2038-3","10.1109/TAI.2003.1250251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250251","","Computer graphics;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Object recognition;Robustness;Shape;Solid modeling;Spatial databases","Fourier transforms;feature extraction;image retrieval;solid modelling;visual databases","2D shape features;3D object model;3D object surface;Fourier descriptors;curvature distribution;feature extraction;model surfaces;projection images;query processing;shape similarity based retrieval;shape-based 3D model retrieval;spatial arrangement extraction","","2","","11","","","3-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second method uses shingles concept to obtain the similarity measure for every document pairs, and each shingle from the original document is inserted in a hash table, where shingles of each candidate document are searched. Given an original document and some candidates, two methods find documents that have some similarity relationship with the original document. Experimental results were obtained by using a plagiarized documents generator system, from 900 documents collected from the Web. Considering the arithmetic average of the absolute differences between the expected and obtained similarity, the algorithm that uses shingles obtained a performance of 4.13% and the algorithm that uses Patricia tree a performance of 7.50%.","","POD:0-7695-2058-8","10.1109/LAWEB.2003.1250297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1250297","","Arithmetic;Computer science;Fingerprint recognition;Indexing;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Plagiarism;Search engines;World Wide Web","Internet;computational complexity;document handling;search engines;tree data structures;tree searching","Patricia tree;Web document syntactic similarity evaluation;candidate document;hash table;plagiarized documents generator system;shingles concept;tree searching","","1","","16","","","10-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although disk throughput has been enjoying a 40% annual increase, slower improvements in disk access times necessitate the use of large DRAM buffers to improve the overall streaming throughput. MEMS-based storage is an exciting new technology that promises to bridge the widening performance gap between DRAM and disk-drives in the memory hierarchy. We explore the impact of integrating these devices into the memory hierarchy on the class of streaming media applications. We evaluate the use of MEMS-based storage for buffering and caching streaming data. We also show how a bank of k MEMS devices can be managed in either configuration and that they can provide a k-fold improvement in both throughput and access latency. An extensive analytical study shows that using MEMS storage can reduce the buffering cost and improve the throughput of streaming servers significantly.","","POD:0-7803-7665-X","10.1109/ICDE.2003.1260826","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260826","","Bridge circuits;Buffer storage;Cache storage;Disk drives;Information retrieval;Microelectromechanical devices;Micromechanical devices;Random access memory;Streaming media;Throughput","DRAM chips;cache storage;magnetic disc storage;micromechanical devices;multimedia servers","DRAM buffer;MEMS-based disk buffer;cache storage;disk access latency;disk throughput;magnetic disc storage;media servers streaming;memory hierarchy;micromechanical devices","","6","","25","","","5-8 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method is based on the assumption that the level of accuracy of the algorithm output depends on the representativeness of inputs in the training dataset. The effectiveness of the novelty detection method is assessed using two datasets: one representative of the northern Adriatic Sea coastal waters and the other representative of open sea waters. The two datasets are independently used to develop neural network algorithms for the retrieval of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a). The range of applicability of the individual algorithms is presented using remote sensing data derived from the Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) for three selected regions: the central Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. An extension of the novelty detection technique is also proposed to blend the individual algorithms and to avoid discontinuities in the resulting Chl-a maps.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.818020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260621","","Algorithm design and analysis;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Oceans;Optical devices;Optical sensors;Remote sensing;Sea measurements;Training data;Water","geochemistry;neural nets;oceanographic techniques;organic compounds;remote sensing","Baltic Sea;Chl-a;Mediterranean Sea;North Sea;Sea-viewing Wide-Field-of-view Sensor data;SeaWiFS data;chlorophyll-a concentration;empirical ocean color algorithms;neural network algorithms;northern Adriatic Sea coastal waters;novelty detection technique;open sea waters;remote sensing data","","32","","46","","","Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different from the common methods in content-based image retrieval, our stochastic mechanism not only takes into consideration the low-level image content features, but also learns high-level concepts from a set of training data, such as access frequencies and access patterns of the images. The advantage of our proposed mechanism is that it exploits the structured description of visual contents as well as the relative affinity measurements among the images. Consequently, it provides the capability to bridge the gap between the low-level features and high-level concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate that the MMM mechanism can effectively assist in retrieving more accurate results for user queries.","","POD:0-7695-2031-6","10.1109/MMSE.2003.1254441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1254441","","Content based retrieval;Digital images;Distributed computing;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Spatial databases;Stochastic processes","Markov processes;content-based retrieval;image retrieval;visual databases","Markov model mediator;content-based image retrieval;image database queries;stochastic mechanism","","5","","23","","","10-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much of desired intelligent e-learning functionality needs further research and technical developments with semantic context-awareness. Proposed framework in this paper is expected to improve the current isolated learning management status, by making the most use of related learning information, and enabling flexible knowledge retrieval, communication and transfer between instructors and learners. To work with related existing e-learning content description standards and enable a semantic-based interactive learning environment, this paper explores a set of novel contextual knowledge discovery and reuse techniques. Based on knowledge communication model analysis in university e-learning, a contextual knowledge representation model is presented. Corresponding knowledge retrieval and semantic knowledge interpretation techniques are presented afterwards towards supporting pedagogical learning approaches such as scenario-based learning.","","POD:0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251422","","Context modeling;Electronic learning;Information management;Information retrieval;Internet;Isolation technology;Knowledge management;Knowledge representation;Multimedia computing;Multimedia systems","information retrieval;intelligent tutoring systems;knowledge management;knowledge representation;multimedia computing","contextual knowledge discovery;contextual knowledge representation;e-learning content description;intelligent e-learning functionality;knowledge communication;knowledge interpretation;knowledge retrieval;multimedia e-learning;pedagogical learning;reuse techniques;scenario-based learning;semantic context awareness;semantic-based interactive learning environment;semantic-based knowledge management;university e-learning","","2","","30","","","27-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
