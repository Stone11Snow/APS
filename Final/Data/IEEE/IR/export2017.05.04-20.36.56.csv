"Practical considerations on the use of preference learning for ranking emotional speech","R. Lotfian; C.

Preference learning represents an appealing framework to rank speech samples in terms of continuous attributes such as arousal and valence. The training of ranking classifiers usually requires pairwise samples where one is preferred over the other according to a specific criterion. For emotional databases, these relative labels are not available and are very difficult to collect. As an alternative, they can be derived from existing absolute emotional labels. For continuous attributes, we can create relative rankings by forming pairs with high and low values of a specific attribute which are separated by a predefined margin. This approach raises questions about efficient approaches for building such a training set, which is important to improve the performance of the emotional retrieval system. This paper analyzes practical considerations in training ranking classifiers including optimum number of pairs used during training, and the margin used to define the relative labels. We compare the preference learning approach to binary classifier and regression models. The experimental results on a spontaneous emotional database indicate that a rank-based classifier with fine-tuned parameters outperforms the other two approaches in both arousal and valence dimensions.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9988-0; POD:978-1-4799-9989-7; USB:978-1-4799-9987-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7472670","Rank SVM;emotion recognition;information retrieval;preference learning","Databases;Reliability;Speech;Speech processing;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;signal classification;speech recognition","binary classifier;emotional database;preference learning;rank based classifier;regression models;speech emotion retrieval system;speech samples;training ranking classifiers","","1","","28","","","20-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A technique called the ACTwg employs genre-adaptive semantic computing of mood-related social tags, whereas ACTwg-SLPwg combines semantic computing and audio-based modelling, both in a genre-adaptive manner. The proposed techniques are experimentally evaluated at predicting listener ratings related to a set of 600 popular music tracks spanning multiple genres. The results show that ACTwg outperforms a semantic computing technique that does not exploit genre information, and ACTwg-SLPwg outperforms conventional techniques and other genre-adaptive alternatives. In particular, improvements in the prediction rates are obtained for the valence dimension which is typically the most challenging core affect dimension for audio-based annotation. The specificity of genre categories is not crucial for the performance of ACTwg-SLPwg.

In this paper, we evaluated the performances of eight popular similarity measures on four levels (degree) of textual similarity using a corpus of plagiarised texts. The evaluation was carried out in the context of candidate selection for plagiarism detection. Performance was measured in terms of recall, and the best performed similarity measure(s) for each degree of textual similarity was identified. Results from our Experiments show that the performances of most of the measures were equal on highly similar texts, with the exception of Euclidean distance and Jensen-Shannon divergence which had poorer performances. Cosine similarity and Bhattacharryan coefficient performed best on lightly reviewed text, and on heavily reviewed texts, Cosine similarity and Pearson Correlation performed best and next best respectively. Pearson Correlation had the best performance on highly dissimilar texts. The results also show term weighing methods and n-gram document representations that best optimises the performance of each of the similarity measures on a particular level of intertextual similarity.","","Electronic:978-9-8975-8164-9; POD:978-1-5090-1967-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7526978","Candidate Selection;Information Retrieval;Similarity Measures;Textual Similarity","Correlation;Euclidean distance;Length measurement;Natural language processing;Plagiarism;Semantics;Weight measurement","","","","","","","","","12-14 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a personalized travel sequence recommendation from both travelogues and community contributed photos and the heterogeneous metadata (e.g., tags, geo-location, and date taken) associated with these photos. Unlike most existing travel recommendation approaches, our approach is not only personalized to user's travel interest but also able to recommend a travel sequence rather than individual Points of Interest (POIs). Topical package space including representative tags, the distributions of cost, visiting time and visiting season of each topic, is mined to bridge the vocabulary gap between user travel preference and travel routes. We take advantage of the complementary of two kinds of social media: travelogue and community contributed photos. We map both user's and routes' textual descriptions to the topical package space to get user topical package model and route topical package model (i.e., topical interest, cost, time and season). To recommend personalized POI sequence, first, famous routes are ranked according to the similarity between user package and route package. Then top ranked routes are further optimized by social similar users' travel records. Representative images with viewpoint and seasonal diversity of POIs are shown to offer a more comprehensive impression. We evaluate our recommendation system on a collection of 7 million Flickr images uploaded by 7,387 users and 24,008 travelogues covering 864 travel POIs in nine famous cities, and show its effectiveness.

In this study, we explore the limitations of existing state of the art transcription systems for the case of flamenco singing and propose a specific solution for this genre: We first extract the predominant melody and apply a novel contour filtering process to eliminate segments of the pitch contour which originate from the guitar accompaniment. We formulate a set of onset detection functions based on volume and pitch characteristics to segment the resulting vocal pitch contour into discrete note events. A quantised pitch label is assigned to each note event by combining global pitch class probabilities with local pitch contour statistics.

Traditional rating-oriented methods predict user ratings on items, but they fail to capture user preference among different items. This paper regards recommendation problem as a ranking task and proposes a new ranking-oriented collaborative filtering framework based on ranking aggregation methods. In this framework, recommendation lists are generated according to item rankings given by users who are similar to the target user. Then, a two-step method called BordaRank is proposed to further explain the framework. The method first uses item collaborative filtering to predict unknown ratings and then uses Borda count method to aggregate item rankings of neighbors. Finally, BordaRank is modified as a pure ranking-oriented method, which could be directly applied on the sparse rating matrix without rating prediction as an intermediate step. The methods are evaluated on real world movie rating data. Experimental results show that BordaRank improves the precision and recall of original rating-oriented methods and modified BordaRank also outperforms traditional methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0806-3; POD:978-1-5090-0807-0","10.1109/ICIS.2016.7550761","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7550761","Collaborative Filtering;Information Retrieval;Ranking Aggregation;Recommender System","Aggregates;Collaboration;Data mining;Feature extraction;Filtering;Prediction algorithms;Sparse matrices","Internet;collaborative filtering;recommender systems;sparse matrices","Borda count method;BordaRank;movie rating data;online applications;ranking aggregation based approach;ranking aggregation methods;ranking-oriented collaborative filtering framework;ranking-oriented method;recommender systems;sparse rating matrix;traditional rating-oriented methods;unknown ratings prediction;user ratings prediction","","","","","","","26-29 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is unavoidable that some buggy entities are ranked low in the result list using these automatic techniques. We assume a bug localization process to address this challenge. Each time a source code entity in the ranked list is examined, the developers will have the option as to whether to continue examining the automatic bug localization result, or simply switch to using a conventional localization approach. We propose a new evaluation metric called ETC (Expected Time Cost) in the localization process, which includes the time cost of using the conventional approach. Under our assumptions, we derived simple criteria to minimize ETC. We compared the time cost of a state-of-art automatic localization method, BugLocator, with and without using our strategy in two projects. The result shows that using our proposed strategy combining both automatic localization technique together with conventional approach performs better than using only either the automatic localization technique or the conventional approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8845-0; POD:978-1-4673-8846-7","10.1109/COMPSAC.2016.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7552006","bug localization;bug reports;evaluation metric;fault localization;feature location;information retrieval","Computer bugs;Computer science;Information retrieval;Measurement;Probability;Software;Switches","information retrieval;program debugging;source code (software)","BugLocator;ETC;automatic bug localization;expected time cost;information retrieval;source code entity","","","","","","","10-14 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a basic solution and a generic solution for the mobile user to preserve his location and query privacy in approximate kNN queries. The proposed solutions are mainly built on the Paillier public-key cryptosystem and can provide both location and query privacy. To preserve query privacy, our basic solution allows the mobile user to retrieve one type of POIs, for example, approximate k nearest car parks, without revealing to the LBS provider what type of points is retrieved. Our generic solution can be applied to multiple discrete type attributes of private location-based queries. Compared with existing solutions for kNN queries with location privacy, our solution is more efficient.

To analyze the statistics of meals in food recording data, we need to normalize meal names; in other words, make representative names for food recording data. In this paper, we present our approach to obtaining representative names by using both food recording data and web search results.

Finally, we obtained the most frequent words under the condition that they were included in a candidate list of representative names. We created a dataset and evaluated our proposed method.

The Mobile Audio Ontology allows producers and distributors to specify a great variety of ways of playing back music in controlled indeterministic as well as adaptive and interactive ways. Users can map mobile sensor data, user interface controls, or autonomous control units hidden from the listener to any musical parameter exposed in the definition of a Dynamic Music Object.

By automating the task of bug localization efficiently, the cost of software can also be reduced. For performing bug localization, many Information Retrieval models have been used in past. In this paper, bug localization has been performed using Pachinko Allocation Model (PAM). PAM is also an IR model, which falls under the category of topic models and has not been used for locating bugs yet. This paper describes the proposed PAM based approach for bug localization at file level. The PAM based approach is compared with LDA based approach and it has been shown that PAM based bug localization performs better as compared to LDA based bug localization. For evaluating the performance of PAM and LDA based approaches, the datasets downloaded from two open source projects, i.e. Rhino and ModeShape, have been used.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724934","Bug localization;Information Retrieval;Pachinko Allocation Mode;Topic model","Computer bugs;Correlation;Engines;Large scale integration;Measurement;Resource management;Software","directed graphs;information retrieval;program debugging;software maintenance;source code (software)","DAG;IR model;PAM;Pachinko allocation model;directed acyclic graph;information retrieval model;software bug localization;software maintenance;source code;topic model","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose an approach to detect named entities (NEs) directly from offline handwritten unstructured document images without explicit character/word recognition, and with very little aid from natural language and script rules. At the preprocessing stage, the document image is binarized, and then the text is segmented into words. The slant/skew/baseline corrections of the words are also performed. After preprocessing, the words are sent for NE recognition. We analyze the structural and positional characteristics of NEs and extract some relevant features from the word image. Then the BLSTM neural network is used for NE recognition. Our system also contains a post-processing stage to reduce the true NE rejection rate. The proposed approach produces encouraging results on both historical and modern document images, including those from an Australian archive, which are reported here for the very first time.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1792-8; POD:978-1-5090-1793-5","10.1109/DAS.2016.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490147","BLSTM neural network;Document image analysis;Dual layer bagging;Information retrieval;Named entity recognition","Character recognition;Engines;Image recognition;Image segmentation;Natural language processing;Optical character recognition software;Pragmatics","document image processing;handwritten character recognition;natural language processing;neural nets","BLSTM neural network;named entity recognition;natural language processing;offline handwritten unstructured document image;slant-skew-baseline correction;unstructured handwritten document image","","1","","19","","","11-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, being able to evaluate their effectiveness and performance is constantly gaining importance because these evaluations are useful for both developers and users of search engines. Developers can use the evaluation results for improving their strategies and paradigms in the development of search engines. Users, on the other hand, can identify the best performing search engines and in a better, quicker and more accurate way, gratify their information needs. Evaluation of search engines can be done in two different ways; either manually using human arbitrators or automatically using automatic machinery approaches which do not use human arbitrators and their judgments. In the case of manual evaluation methods, by now numerous and standard activities had been carried out by organizers and participants of conferences like TREC or CLEF. In the case of automatic evaluation methods, unlike variety of efforts which had been done by different researchers, no categorization and organization of such methods exists so far. As a result, anyone that wants to use one of the automatic evaluation methods must read all the relevant literature of these methods which is very time consuming and confusing activity. In this paper, we have reviewed almost all the important reported automatic methods for evaluation of search engines. Analyzing the results of this review, we have stated the requirements and prerequisites of using any of these methods.

Meanwhile, various stakeholders need to grasp novel trends and innovations in order to make sound policy decisions in real time. Modern data mining techniques can be leveraged to ease the burden of manually combing through thousands of documents. In this paper we present a data product for exploration and filtration of a large corpus of citations from several distinct commercial databases. The end goal is a highly interactive user interface for intuitive corpus exploration on the front end, supported by data ingestion, merging, inference, and novelty detection capabilities on the back end. Due to the high dimensionality of textual data, dimensionality reduction and summarization are major requirements for effective exploratory analysis. Toward these ends we apply a topic model, specifically the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model. The resulting dimensionality reduction improves the comprehensibility of the corpus for the end user, while also allowing a speedup of document-document comparison. Document similarity is computed using Hellinger distance, which is a Euclidean distance in a transformed topic-weight space, and thus nearest document queries can be implemented efficiently using a kd-tree data structure. Further information reduction is achieved through the use of a supervised nonparametric trend detection algorithm originally developed in the context of social media (Twitter), in order to suggest terms of potential interest to the user based on their likelihood of embodying significant trends. To our knowledge the application of this technique in the scientometric domain is novel.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0970-1; POD:978-1-5090-0971-8","10.1109/SIEDS.2016.7489317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489317","Data visualization;Information retrieval;LDA;Topic models;Trend detection","Computational modeling;Conferences;Databases;Detection algorithms;Market research;Real-time systems;Stakeholders","citation analysis;data mining;data reduction;information retrieval;merging;nonparametric statistics;scientific information systems;social networking (online);text analysis;tree data structures","Euclidean distance;Hellinger distance;LDA model;Latent Dirichlet allocation model;Twitter;commercial databases;data inference;data ingestion;data merging;data mining techniques;data product;data summarization;dimensionality reduction;document similarity;document-document comparison;information reduction;interactive user interface;intuitive corpus exploration;kd-tree data structure;large corpus exploration;large corpus filtration;nearest document queries;novelty detection capabilities;scientific corpus;scientometric domain;social media;supervised nonparametric trend detection algorithm;textual data;transformed topic-weight space","","","","30","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems have to complete the user needs with related terms in order to disambiguate the user query and better meet the user's needs. This paper presents a new method to define semantic relationships between terms of the relevant returned documents for a given query in order to improve the description of the user's needs, by expanding automatically the original query with related terms, and to improve the search results.

Currently, consulting firms strive to use data to support client's business decisions with evidence. To be effective at this, consultants must consider the applicability of both internal and external data libraries to their clients' requirements. Frequently, evaluating the applicability of data sets is a manual process, which can be costly to the firm and the client. This paper describes a technical approach to automate this process. Specifically, it details the structure of a software application, named UVa Open Miner, capable of assessing the applicability of data sources to client projects. This UVa Open Miner aims to maximize the scale and diversity of candidate data sets, increase the relevance of data found, and maintain manageable computational complexity. UVa Open Miner consists of two segments: mapping and matching. The mapping component text mines web pages to identify an ontology of keywords describing the business requirement. This enables users to handle diverse business requirements from various industry verticals. The matching component scores data sets based on a relevance factor obtained from the ontology map. To validate the application, subject matter experts provided business requirements for a problem in their domain, and validated the application's results. Professionals in environment science, political science and policy-making fields found the application to be useful. Therefore, the application, along with the framework used, can be refactored into a reusable solution for consulting firms to use for their clients.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0970-1; POD:978-1-5090-0971-8","10.1109/SIEDS.2016.7489304","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489304","Information Retrieval;Meta Data;Ontology;Text Mining","Business;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Ontologies","Internet;business data processing;computational complexity;data mining;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","UVa Open Miner;Web page mining;business requirement;candidate data sets;client business decision support;client projects;client requirements;computational complexity;consulting firms;data matching;data retrieval;data sources;environment science;external data libraries;internal data libraries;mapping component text;ontology map;policy-making fields;political science;relevance assessment;relevance factor;software application;subject matter experts","","1","","22","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In proposed approach, concepts of words by using BabelNet knowledge base are extracted and concept graphs are produced and sentences, according to concepts and resulting graph are rated. Therefore, these rating concepts are utilized in final summarization. Also, a replication control approach is proposed in a way that selected concepts in each state are punished and this causes to produce summaries with less redundancy.

Ontology is the concept, a rigorous and exhaustive organization of any knowledge domain and is usually hierarchical and contains all the relevant entities along with relations between them. The proposed usage of hierarchical concept i.e. the ontologies have been used here as a Meta layer over the traditional searching system. The technique would facilitate the system with an understanding to know what the user is willing to look over the web while querying. The proposed system would thus become capable in refining the requests that vary with users and also helps in refining meaning of a term corresponding to a user.

In this paper, we propose to reduce the dimensionality of objects' feature vectors by discovering their contrast sets. Contrast set mining aims at finding a set of rules that best distinguish the instances of different user-defined groups. Thus, contrast sets are conjunctions of attribute-value pairs that are significantly more frequent in one group than the other. Existing techniques extract contrast sets from categorical data or discretized numerical data. Furthermore, existing rule-based contrast sets methods require some user-defined thresholds to select the contrast sets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a greedy algorithm, called DisCoSet, to incrementally find a minimum set of local features that best distinguishes a class from other classes without resorting to discretization. We show that the proposed algorithm reduces the dimensionality between 40%-97% of the original length and yet improves the classification accuracy by 10%-24% on different datasets.","","","10.1109/OBD.2016.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7573688","Big Data;Contrast sets;classification;data mining;dimensionality reduction;information retrieval","Big data;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Feature extraction;Greedy algorithms;Lenses","Big Data;data mining;pattern classification","Big Data classification;DisCoSet algorithm;attribute-value pairs;contrast set mining;dimensionality reduction;greedy algorithm;object feature vector dimensionality;user-defined thresholds","","","","","","","22-24 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they also pose a significant risk to the privacy of the clients, since a data warehouse operator may follow the client's queries and infer what the client is interested in. Private information retrieval (PIR) techniques allow the client to retrieve a cell from a data warehouse without revealing to the operator which cell is retrieved and, therefore, protects the privacy of the client's queries. However, PIR cannot be used to hide online analytical processing (OLAP) operations performed by the client, which may disclose the client's interest. This paper presents a solution for private cell retrieval from a data warehouse on the basis of the Paillier cryptosystem. By our solution, the client can privately perform OLAP operations on the data warehouse and retrieve one (or more) cell without revealing any information about which cell is selected. In addition, we propose a solution for private block download on the basis of the Paillier cryptosystem. Our private block download allows the client to download an encrypted block from a data warehouse without revealing which block in a cloaking region is downloaded and improves the feasibility of our private cell retrieval. Our solutions ensure both the server's privacy and the client's privacy.

State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issues. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via non-negative matrix factorization. Experiments conducted on real CQA data sets show that our proposed approach is promising.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2544661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7437414","Community Question Answering;Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Question Retrieval;Text Mining","Computers;Context modeling;IEEE transactions;Knowledge discovery;Semantics;Speech;Speech processing","language translation;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;question answering (information retrieval);statistical analysis","CQA;CQA data sets;community question answering;monolingual translation models;multilingual translation representation learning;nonnegative matrix factorization;parallel monolingual corpora quality;question representation;question retrieval problem;statistical machine translation;word ambiguity;word mismatch problems","","","","39","","20160321","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Following the evolution and wide adoption of Semantic Web technology, a number of approaches to overcome the limitations of traditional keyword-based search techniques have been proposed. However, most of the research concentrates on English and other well-known, linguistic resource-rich languages. Hence, this paper presents an attempt to semantic search over domain-specific Lithuanian web documents. We introduce an ontology-based semantic search framework capable of answering structured natural Lithuanian language questions and discuss its language-dependent design decisions. The findings from a recent case study showed that our proposed framework can be applied to approach meaning-based IR with significant results, even when the underlying language is morphologically rich and has limited linguistic resources.","","Electronic:978-9-8975-8164-9; POD:978-1-5090-1967-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7526903","Information Retrieval;Lithuanian Language;Ontology;SBVR;SPARQL;Semantic Annotation;Semantic Search","Business;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Standards","","","","","","","","","12-14 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It works well with conventional X-ray tubes and multiple information, that is the attenuation image, the phase-contrast image and the dark-field image, can be obtained in a single scanning. Phase-stepping approach is the gold standard for information retrieval. One of the gratings moves relatively in the along the transverse direction. In this paper, an inter-period phase-stepping approach is proposed, which enables larger phase-stepping distance of the gratings. This approach can be realized by adopting multiple x-ray sources, e.g. the distributed x-ray source. In this case, the mechanical movement of the gratings can be replaced by the successive exposure of the multiple x-ray source, overcoming the time-consuming difficulty and eliminating the dependence of the high-resolution linear stage. Experimental results can verify the feasibility of the method.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6097-2; POD:978-1-4799-6098-9","10.1109/NSSMIC.2014.7430854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7430854","grating interferometry;grating-based imaging;information retrieval;phase stepping","Attenuation;Electron tubes;Gold;Gratings;Imaging;Information retrieval;X-ray imaging","X-ray imaging;nondestructive testing","X-ray grating-based imaging;attenuation image;conventional X-ray tubes;dark-field image;distributed X-ray source;high-resolution linear stage;interperiod phase-stepping;mechanical movement;multiple X-ray source;multiple X-ray sources;nondestructive tool;phase-contrast image;phase-stepping distance","","","","25","","","8-15 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although many links are thus recovered, the effectiveness of individual features is not fully evaluated, and it is rather difficult to combine different features to produce better results. In this paper, we implement a tool, called R2C, that combines various features to recover requirement-to-code links. With the support of R2C, we conduct an empirical study to understand the effectiveness of these features in recovering requirement-to-code links.

However, previous studies showed that inadequate instantiation of an IR technique and underlying process could significantly affect the performance of such approaches in terms of precision and recall. This paper proposes the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to automatically configure and assemble an IR process for software engineering tasks. The approach (named GA-IR) determines the (near) optimal solution to be used for each stage of the IR process, i.e., term extraction, stop word removal, stemming, indexing and an IR algebraic method calibration. We applied GA-IR on two different software engineering tasks, namely traceability link recovery and identification of duplicate bug reports. The results of the study indicate that GA-IR outperforms approaches previously published in the literature, and that it does not significantly differ from an ideal upper bound that could be achieved by a supervised and combinatorial approach.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1855-0; POD:978-1-5090-1856-7","10.1109/SANER.2016.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476653","Information Retrieval;Parametrization;Search-Based Software Engineering;Text-Based Software Engineering","Frequency measurement;Genetic algorithms;Indexing;Large scale integration;Software;Software engineering;Time division multiplexing","genetic algorithms;indexing;information retrieval;program debugging;program diagnostics;software engineering","GA-IR;IR algebraic method;IR process;IR technique;IR-based solution assembling;IR-based solution parameterization;SE tasks;calibration;combinatorial approach;duplicate bug report identification;genetic algorithms;indexing;precision;recall;software engineering tasks;stemming;stop word removal;supervised approach;term extraction;traceability link recovery","","1","","54","","","14-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The term spectral rhythm features emanates from the origin of the extracted features, which is the periodicity function (PF), a spectral representation that encapsulates the salience of the rhythm frequencies. Two dimensionality reduction techniques applied on the PF to extract expressive and compact features are compared, namely, a linear transformation resulting from Principal Component Analysis and a nonlinear mapping derived from a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. Subsequently, the derived features were used as input to an SVM classifier for each task. Moreover, an additional method is proposed that reformulates the well-studied tempo estimation task as a combination of multiple binary classification sub-problems. Evaluation was performed on a large number of datasets demonstrating that the same set of features learned from the PF provide a robust rhythmic representation that achieved comparable results to the current state-of-the-art methods for the aforementioned tasks.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2554283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453133","Dance style classification;meter estimation;music information retrieval;periodicity analysis;periodicity function (PF);principal component analysis;restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM);rhythm analysis;rhythm classification;tempo estimation","Context;Estimation;Feature extraction;Rhythm;Speech;Speech processing","Boltzmann machines;audio signal processing;estimation theory;feature extraction;music;principal component analysis;signal classification;signal representation;support vector machines","SVM classifier;binary classification subproblems;dance style classification;linear transformation;meter estimation;multipurpose spectral rhythm features;nonlinear mapping;periodicity function;principal component analysis;restricted Boltzmann machine;rhythm analysis tasks;rhythm frequencies;robust rhythmic representation;support vector machines;tempo estimation","","","","","","20160415","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The search operation is performed to access its current up-to-date version from anywhere and at anytime. In earlier search schemes the generated index was static in nature which used to support only searching. To handle the dynamic updates along with searching, the generated index is made dynamic instead of static. The proposed search scheme posses all the security requirements as proposed in the existing approaches in literature but provides searching and dynamic updates results efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic search scheme as it efficiently retrieves the documents with the updated version.

To reduce the number of trie nodes, an Minimal-Prefix (MP) trie and a double-trie have been proposed, and the double-array can represent these data structures efficiently. On the other hand, the data structures include many nodes that can be reduced by giving a string label to each edge. However, the double-array with string labels has not been proposed.

Studies have shown that individuals work much more effortlessly after listening to a piece of music that is in accordance to their mood at that instance. This paper discusses a technique based on extraction of features from an audio file and using those features to determine the mood associated with the audio file. Mood of an audio file can be classified using various methods. This classification is done either based on content or based on context. Either way requires retrieval of information from an audio file. The context based features comprise of genre, artist, producer, etc. The content based features comprise of various features such as - beat, tempo, spectral roll-off, compactness, root mean square, etc. This paper presents a unique approach for determination of mood associated with an audio file based on the content based feature analysis.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724692","Audio features;Feature extraction;Mood detection;Music information retrieval;jAudio","Conferences;Decision support systems;Handheld computers","audio signal processing;emotion recognition;music;signal classification","audio file;classification;content based feature analysis;context based features;emotion detection;feature extraction;music","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Name entity recognition (NER) is the process of determining and classifying the names of people, organizations, locations and other entities within text. Classification of entity is essential to identify correct co-referent. Hence, NER is one of the key components in co-reference resolution. A novel approach to Co-reference resolution and NER is proposed in this paper. Many systems are restricted to produce labels from to a small set of entity classes, e.g., person, organization, location or miscellaneous. In order to intelligently understand text and extract a fine range of information, it is useful to more precisely determine the conceptual classes of entities mentioned in unstructured text. This paper presents 20 fine grain classes using concept hierarchy for classification of 5 classes. Wikipedia is used to recognise fine grain entity. Huffman encoding mechanism is used to encode according to classes in the annotated text file. The process of quotation attribute handling, the mention detection model and pronoun resolution is proposed which makes use of Web scale N-Grams corpus and precise syntactic features set.

Some methods which model the emotions as a distribution lack the classification [1] (Recognition in this case) accuracy. In this paper, a novel method has been proposed which models the affective content as a Gaussian probability distribution model called AEG (Acoustic Emotion Gaussian) which is generative, flexible, interpretable and transparent. AEG model incorporates two GMM's: Affective GMM used for model emotion and Acoustic GMM for modeling the audio data. In addition to the acoustic feature (MFCC) and annotations from the listeners (Valence and Arousal), additional acoustic features, Raagas (melodic modes used in Indian Classical music) and emotions obtained from the sentiment analysis of lyrics helps to optimize and increase the classification accuracy and robustness of the AEG model.","","","10.1109/ICRTIT.2016.7569588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569588","Acoustic Emotion Gaussian;Music Information Retrieval;Raagas;Sentiment Analysis","Brain modeling;Data models;Information technology;Mathematical model;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Training","Gaussian distribution;Gaussian processes;emotion recognition;information retrieval;mixture models;music;sentiment analysis","AEG;GMM;Gaussian probability distribution model;MFCC;MIR;Raagas;acoustic emotion Gaussian;acoustic features;music emotion recognition;music information retrieval;sentiment analysis","","","","","","","8-9 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel human-computer interaction system called IMISOUND that listens to a vocal imitation and retrieves similar sounds from a sound library. This system allows users to search sounds even if they do not remember their semantic labels or the sounds do not have these labels (e.g., synthesized sound effects). IMISOUND employs a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) to extract features from both the vocal imitation (query) and sounds in the library (candidates). The SAE is pre-trained using training vocal imitations of sounds not in the library to automatically learn more suitable feature representations than human-engineered features such as MFCC's. It then measures the similarity between the query and each sound candidate, using the K-L divergence and Dynamic Time Warping distance between their feature representations, and finally retrieves the closest sounds. IMISOUND is an unsupervised system in the sense that no training is performed for the target sound, nonetheless, experiments show that it achieves comparable performance to a previously proposed supervised system which requires pre-training on sounds to be retrieved. Experiments also show that IMISOUND significantly outperforms an unsupervised MFCC-based baseline system, validating the advantage of the SAE feature representation.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9988-0; POD:978-1-4799-9989-7; USB:978-1-4799-9987-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2016.7472081","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7472081","Vocal imitation;automatic feature learning;information retrieval;stacked auto-encoder","Feature extraction;Instruments;Libraries;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Spectrogram;Training","audio signal processing;feature extraction;human computer interaction;query processing","SAE;feature extraction;feature representations;human computer interaction system;human engineered features;semantic labels;sound library;sound query;stacked auto-encoder;unsupervised system;vocal imitation","","1","","20","","","20-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QECK identifies software-specific expansion words from the high quality pseudo relevance feedback question and answer pairs on Stack Overflow to automatically generate the expansion queries. Furthermore, we incorporate QECK in the classic Rocchio's model, and propose QECK based code search method QECKRocchio. We conduct three experiments to evaluate our QECK technique and investigate QECKRocchio in a large-scale corpus containing real-world code snippets and a question and answer pair collection.

However, their usefulness is often compromised by the coarse granularity of files and the lack of contextual information. To address this, we propose to locate bugs using software changes, which offer finer granularity than files and provide important contextual clues for bug-fixing. We observe that bug inducing changes can facilitate the bug fixing process. For example, it helps triage the bug fixing task to the developers who committed the bug inducing changes or enables developers to fix bugs by reverting these changes. Our study further identifies that change logs and the naturally small granularity of changes can help boost the performance of IR-based bug localization. Motivated by these observations, we propose an IR-based approach Locus to locate bugs from software changes, and evaluate it on six large open source projects. The results show that Locus outperforms existing techniques at the source file level localization significantly. MAP and MRR in particular have been improved, on average, by 20.1% and 20.5%, respectively. Locus is also capable of locating the inducing changes within top 5 for 41.0% of the bugs. The results show that Locus can significantly reduce the number of lines needing to be scanned to locate the bug compared with existing techniques.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582764","bug localization;information retrieval;software analytics;software changes","Computer bugs;Debugging;History;Information retrieval;Manuals;Natural languages;Software","information retrieval;program debugging","IR-based bug localization;Locus;MAP;MRR;bug inducing changes;bug-fixing;information retrieval;software changes;source file level localization","","","","","","","3-7 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
