In a single site environment, a local video server retrieves video data from its local storage device. However, in distributed VoD systems, when a customer requests a movie from the local server, the server may need to interact with other servers located across the network. In this paper, we present different types of presentation plans that a local server can construct in order to satisfy a customer request. Informally speaking, a presentation plan is a temporally synchronized sequence of steps that the local server must perform in order to present the requested movie to the customer. This involves obtaining commitments from other video servers, obtaining commitments from the network service provider, as well as making commitments of local resources, while keeping within the limitations of available bandwidth, available buffer, and customer data consumption rates. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the quality of a presentation plan, we introduce two measures of optimality for presentation plans: minimizing wait time for a customer and minimizing access bandwidth which, informally speaking, specifies how much network/disk bandwidth is used. We develop algorithms to compute three different optimal presentation plans that work at a block level, or at a segment level, or with a hybrid mix of the two, and compare their performance through simulation experiments. We have also mathematically proven effects of increased buffer or bandwidth and data replications for presentation plans which had previously been verified experimentally in the literature.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1033774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033774","","Bandwidth;Communication channels;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Displays;Hardware;Information retrieval;Motion pictures;Network servers;Time measurement","distributed databases;multimedia computing;video on demand;video servers","computer network;distributed VoD;distributed video-on-demand;local server;optimal presentation;presentation plan;presentation plans;video server","","0","","29","","","Sep/Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective of the TFMC Project is to develop and demonstrate the superconducting magnet technology to a level that will allow the ITER TF coils to be built with confidence. The TFMC has been installed in the TOSKA facility (Forschunszentrum Karlsruhe, Germany) after assembling the TFMC into a 27 tons stainless steel Intercoil Structure which interfaces the TFMC to the TOSKA facility. Due to the complexity of the assembly operations, and in order to avoid any trial-and-error assembly process with the associated loss of time and waste of resources, computer simulations have been extensively used. Additionally, starting from 3D CATIA models, a laser tracking technique has been utilized to retrieve as built geometry data of each sub assembly. The raw data have been analyzed and combined to verify the assembly procedure and to identify corrective actions before the real installation. The whole survey has been accomplished by ENEA during three different survey campaigns carried out at Alstom (Belfort, France) and at Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK, Karlsruhe, Germany) sites. The implementation of the data resulted in the TFMC being installed with no loss of time due to modifications to components previously measured and analyzed by the method reported here. This paper illustrates the geometry survey, the method and the instrumentation adopted and the results obtained. Moreover, it gives guidelines to the designer to be taken into account in the assembly planning of large and heavy components.","","POD:0-7803-7073-2","10.1109/FUSION.2002.1027678","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1027678","","Assembly;Computer simulation;Geometry;Information retrieval;Laser modes;Solid modeling;Steel;Superconducting coils;Superconducting magnets;Virtual manufacturing","Tokamak devices;fusion reactor design;nuclear engineering computing;plasma simulation;plasma toroidal confinement;stainless steel;superconducting magnets","27 ton;3 m;36 ton;3D CATIA models;4 m;TFMC;TOSKA facility;Toroidal Field Model Coil;computer simulations;full-size ITER TF coils;laser tracking technique;stainless steel intercoil structure;superconducting magnet technology;toroidal field model coil geometry","","1","","3","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, it is sensitive to noisy interference such as illumination changes and quantization errors. Furthermore, CCHs large dimension or histogram bins requires large computation on histogram comparison. To address these concerns, this paper presents a new color histogram representation, called fuzzy color histogram (FCH), by considering the color similarity of each pixel's color associated to all the histogram bins through fuzzy-set membership function. A novel and fast approach for computing the membership values based on fuzzy c-means algorithm is introduced. The proposed FCH is further exploited in the application of image indexing and retrieval. Experimental results clearly show that FCH yields better retrieval results than CCH. Such computing methodology is fairly desirable for image retrieval over large image databases.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2002.801585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025168","","Color;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Interference;Lighting;Quantization;Software libraries","database indexing;fuzzy set theory;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;visual databases","color histogram representation;color image retrieval;color similarity;conventional color histogram;fuzzy c-means algorithm;fuzzy color histogram;fuzzy-set membership function;histogram bins;illumination changes;image databases;image indexing;noisy interference;quantization errors","","110","","26","","","Aug 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this way, the characteristic of the distribution of all samples is taken into account to improve the performance. The density estimation is conducted with non-parametric density estimation, and the densities of all samples can be predetermined before any query.

The perceptron, which has weights obtained by learning when adapting the original signal, suppresses the difference between the reconstructed signal and the original signal even when the Nyquist condition does not stand. Although the proposed method needs weight data, the total data size is much smaller than the ordinary sampling method, as the most suitable reconstruction filter is exclusively adapted to the given sampling data.","","POD:0-7803-7616-1","10.1109/NNSP.2002.1030082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1030082","","Adaptive filters;Finite impulse response filter;Frequency;Image reconstruction;Image sampling;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Physics;Sampling methods;Signal reconstruction","FIR filters;Nyquist criterion;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","FIR filter;Nyquist condition;Shannon sampling theorem;linear perceptron;multilayer perceptron;neural network;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","","0","","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The passive nature of the telemetry removes the need for electronics, power supplies, or contacts to withstand the high-temperature environment. The sensor contains a passive LC resonator comprised of a movable diaphragm capacitor and a fixed inductor, thereby causing the sensor resonant frequency to be pressure-dependent. Data is retrieved with an external loop antenna. The sensor has been fabricated and characterized and was compared with an electromechanical model.

IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","20021107","2002","2","","257","260 vol.2","This paper describes a computationally efficient method for estimating the predominant pitch in audio recordings. The proposed method is intended for building a content-based indexing and retrieval system that can search in a audio database using the melody line of a complex input audio sample. Available pitch estimation methods are effective primarily when dealing with recordings of human voice that is either unaccompanied or accompanied with one or two musical instruments. These methods perform poorly when applied to pitch estimation in complex music signals due to their reliance on directly estimating the fundamental frequency (F<sub>0</sub>), a task that is affected by the overlapping presence in frequency of instrumental sounds such as those of guitar, piano, etc. In our method we exploit the higher harmonic structure of the human voice to develop a low-complexity system for estimating predominant pitch. Experimental results show that this computationally efficient method provides a robust estimate of predominant pitch in real-world audio signals with 85% success rate.","","POD:0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035568","","Audio databases;Audio recording;Content based retrieval;Frequency estimation;Human voice;Indexing;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Robustness","audio databases;audio recording;audio signal processing;feature extraction;frequency estimation;music;query processing","audio database;audio recordings;computationally efficient method;content-based indexing system;content-based retrieval system;fundamental frequency estimation;guitar;harmonic structure;human voice;input audio sample;instrumental sounds;low-complexity system;melody line;music signals;musical instruments;piano;predominant pitch contour extraction;predominant pitch estimation;real-world audio signals","","4","1","12","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the metadatabase, the relevance feedback module admits a noticeable improvement on its performance for category-based search, especially when the relevant images form multiple classes in the feature space.

Within a conversation, all the complexities and ambiguities of natural language exist and each speaker will have his/her own speech characteristics and moods. Examining these characteristics through text dialog can be a demanding cognitive task. One reason is because the whole conversation cannot be viewed at one time. This task can be made more convenient if there is a way of visualising all this information at once through graphical patterns. Graphical patterns can revolve around the conversation, creating an abstract piece of artwork. From these patterns, one can guess at the speaker's emotion and how he/she is connected to another speaker during a conversation.

The user can then provide a query sketch that will be compared with those extracted sketches from the database trademark images in order to retrieve similar trademarks. Query by sketch is useful in the trademark retrieval application since the user can search for similar trademarks by providing a rough sketch instead of keywords.

Fast stereo-matching algorithms have been developed to perform this image matching automatically on an operational basis. Preliminary results are shown of the operational retrievals together with comparisons against other data.

Mobile agent planning is one of the most important techniques for completing a given task efficiently. The static planning technique may not be the best approach in real network environments. For better performance, it is necessary that mobile agents be more sensitive to the network conditions. We propose a dynamic planning algorithm, named n-ary agent chaining, which is based on static mobile agent planning. Mobile agents can change their itinerary dynamically according to current network status using the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm also takes into account the locality of target nodes on the network. Thus, with a properly chosen locality factor it can adapt to realistic network situations. Agents reproduced from the original one, named cloned agents, process the unprocessed nodes in the proposed algorithm. Since the turn-around time can be calculated mathematically with known network statistics before launching the agents, the proposed algorithm is suitable for agent problem domains with deadline constraints.","1063-6927;10636927","POD:0-7695-1585-1","10.1109/ICDCS.2002.1022308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1022308","","Computer science;Distributed computing;Distributed databases;Fluctuations;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;distributed databases;mobile computing;multi-agent systems;planning (artificial intelligence);software agents","Internet distributed computing;agent reproduction technique;cloned agents;deadline constraints;distributed agent concept;dynamic mobile agent planning;locality factor;n-ary agent chaining;realistic network situations;static planning technique;turn-around time","","8","","24","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simple linear mixture model was applied to estimate the component surface temperatures of foliage and soil temperatures. The potential of directional observations in the thermal infrared region for land surface studies is a largely uncharted area of research. The availability of the dual-view Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) observations led to explore new opportunities in this direction. In the context of studies on heat transfer at heterogeneous land surfaces, multiangular thermal infrared (TIR) observations offer the opportunity of overcoming fundamental difficulties in modeling sparse canopies. Three case studies were performed on the estimation of the component temperatures of foliage and soil. The first one included the use of multi-angular field measurements at view angles of 0°, 23° and 52°. The second and third one were done with directional ATSR observations at view angles of 0° and 53° only. Different models have been proposed in literature to interpret observations of directional exitance: (1) simple geometric (deterministic) models of the system, (2) radiative transfer within a complete canopy, and (3) radiative transfer in an inhomogeneous thick layer of vegetation. Our approach is based on the third modeling concept. A target comprising a mixture of foliage and soil is characterized by the gap fraction, and observed radiance is described as a weighted sum of foliage radiance and soil radiance, with the weights being the gap fraction and its complement, respectively.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1024932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024932","","Availability;Heat transfer;Information retrieval;Infrared heating;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Radiometry;Soil;Solid modeling;Temperature dependence","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;geophysical techniques;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","ATSR;IR radiometry;angular observation;atmosphere;bi-angular method;biangular method;boundary layer;canopy;directional exitance;dual-view;foliage;heterogeneous surface;infrared radiometry;land surface;linear mixture model;measurement technique;radiometric temperature;remote sensing;satellite remote sensing;soil;surface layer;temperature;thermal infrared;vegetation;view direction","","0","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also implement an MPEG-2-to-MPEG-4 video transcoder which can not only change the bitstreams' syntax and bitrate but can also encode each semantic video segment as a group of pictures (GOPs), by using the techniques of frame type conversion and video shot boundary detection. Moreover, the proposed transcoder can intelligently select a motion mode for each macroblock of B-VOPs in an MPEG-4 video to avoid some unpredictable artifacts due to mis-selection of the motion mode.

In the onboard version of AMBRALS, the LiSparseR Geometrical-Optical (GO) kernel was used. But a new derived kernel - LiTransit kernel is also good at transition from LiSparse kernel to LiDense kernel when zenith angle is large, and accords more to the basic principle of GO model than LiSparseR kernel. Results of validation show: RossThick-LiTransit kernels combination has more stability when extrapolated to large sun zenith angles with LiSparseR kernel. Therefore, we will use the LiTransit kernel instead of LiSparseR kernel in the new version of AMBRALS. The speed requirement of tremendous data processing can't be meet easily, such as MODIS data. Although we can calculate the integration of the kernel beforehand, store up and acquire through look-up table method during retrieving albedo, it's inconvenient for an integrated data processing system. Thus we need to get a simple form of the integration of the kernels. Because the integrations of the kernels are approximately independent on directions than BRDF, it's sufficient to use a polynome dependent on the solar zenith angle to regress the integration of kernel. In this paper, we study the polynome regression of LiTransit kernel to instead LiSparseR, but not affect the systematic of the algorithm at the same time.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026526","","Bidirectional control;Data processing;Information retrieval;Kernel;Land surface;MODIS;Reflectivity;Stability;Sun;Table lookup","remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","AMBRALS;BRDF;GO kernel;GO model;IR;LiSparseR Gometrical Optical kernel;LiTransit kernel;MODIS;albedo;algorithm;bi-directional reflectance distribution function;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;geophysical measurement technique;infrared;land surface;light scattering;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping;visible","","0","","8","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, since the features in texture, color, and shape are generated using different computation methods and thus may require different similarity measurements, the integration of the retrievals on heterogeneous features is a nontrivial task. We present a semantics-based clustering and indexing approach, termed SemQuery, to support visual queries on heterogeneous features of images. Using this approach, the database images are classified based on their heterogeneous features. Each semantic image cluster contains a set of subclusters that are represented by the heterogeneous features that the images contain. An image is included in a semantic cluster if it falls within the scope of all the heterogeneous clusters of the semantic cluster. We also design a neural network model to merge the results of basic queries on individual features. A query processing strategy is then presented to support visual queries on heterogeneous features. An experimental analysis is conducted and presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1033769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1033769","","Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Shape measurement;Spatial databases;Vectors;Visual databases","content-based retrieval;database indexing;image classification;image retrieval;neural nets;pattern clustering;visual databases","SemQuery;content-based image retrieval;experimental analysis;heterogeneous features;image classification;image color;image database;image shape;image texture;indexing;neural network model;query processing;semantic clustering;similarity measurements;visual data;visual queries","","46","1","60","","","Sep/Oct 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The impact due to two-level clouds is quantitatively assessed in two ways using simulated radiances from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS), the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS). First, cloud characterization (cloud flagging) techniques were developed to identify cloud-contaminated pixels. Second, a neural network was trained to estimate clear-column infrared radiances from cloud-contaminated 3×3 pixel clusters of infrared and microwave radiances (cloud clearing). This algorithm reduced the a priori radiance error due to clouds by at least a factor of three for those 4- and 15-micron sounding channels with weighting function peaks located from 0-10 km. Radiance cloud-clearing errors (RMS) for infrared channels with weighting functions peaking from 10 to 0 km ranged from 0.1 to 0.7 K for the 4-micron channels and from 0.1 to 1.2 K for the 15-micron channels. Combining microwave and infrared data at the pixel level always yielded results superior to infrared alone.

The study aims at establishing a content creation tool that can provide practical functions such as content-based retrieval and summarization, and content that can be shared by teachers and students over the network. The study also aims at clarifying how effectively such tools assist education in an actual classroom. First, the system records the scenes of vaulting actions in the class using a camera fixed beside the vaulting horse. Then it automatically extracts each jumping behavior, puts indices on key actions, and registers them into the database. Indexing on key actions is done by analyzing spatial relations and their temporal transitions between featured points of the student's circumscribed rectangle and those of a vaulting horse model. The system creates MPEG-7 based metadata for possible data exchange over the network. Experimental results show that the database registration of student ID according to the predefined recording of action sequence enables easy access and display of a student's actions, and of specific vaulting actions for comparison.

We investigated which combination is the most suitable for delineating and mapping specific vegetation types. The mission we employed had three main stages, (1) Making digital processed vegetation maps by manual interpretation of mosaicking aerial balloon photos with high resolution (15 cm/pixel) and discussing about the efficiency for the classification of wetland vegetation including extensive ground truth in the summer of 1998 and 2001. (2) Classification of vegetation using airborne CNIR video images with high resolution (30 cm/pixel) based on the vegetation maps composed by balloon photos as the training data. (3) SPOT (XS and PAN) images were evaluated for mapping the whole wetland vegetation using these tools. We obtained twenty-seven categories of individual vegetation and ten typical types of vegetation community with higher accuracy classification. In addition, we could extract conservation wetland plants, twenty-two genuses and thirty-nine species and they were mapped. Each cover type was delineated from aerial balloon photos and airborne CNIR images using manual interpretation techniques. It was obviously effective to classify temperate wetland vegetation into genus and species level, especially small shrub mixed with herbaceous plants, moss bog with pools and dwarf shrubs with sedge, moss and alpine plants with the information of the status of the leaves with environmental conditions of vitality and phenology in Carex. spp. and Phragmites communis. This result is important because this level of detail types could not be retrieved without these utilizations from any of the satellite image data sets directly. We concluded that availability of high resolution training data such as balloon mosaic photos and CNIR images were obviously powerful tools to classify typical wetland vegetation into genus and species level. It was apparently suitable for delineating and mapping the specific vegetation types precisely. These high resolution training data were useful to apply to the whole wetland vegetation of SPOT images to classify typical wetland vegetation types. This paper provides the capa- bilities for monitoring the typical type of temperate wetland vegetation.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1027227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1027227","","Adders;Data mining;Image resolution;Information retrieval;Infrared imaging;Manuals;Pixel;Spatial resolution;Training data;Vegetation mapping","geophysical signal processing;image classification;image resolution;vegetation mapping;video signal processing","CNIR images;Japan;Kushiro wetland;Northeast Hokkaido;SPOT images;aerial balloon photographs;airborne color near infrared images;mosaicking;vegetation mapping;vegetation maps;vegetation types;video images;wetland vegetation","","0","","7","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such environments are plagued with changing information because ISs tend to continuously evolve by modifying not only their content but also their query capabilities and interface and by joining or leaving the environment at any time. We are the first to introduce and address the problem of schema changes of ISs, while previous work in this area, such as incremental view maintenance, has mainly dealt with data changes at ISs. We outline our solution approach to this challenging new problem of how to adapt views in such evolving environments. We identify a new view adaptation problem for view evolution in the context of ISs schema changes, which we call view synchronization. We also outline the Evolvable View Environment (EVE) approach that we propose as framework for solving the view synchronization problem, along with our decisions concerning the key design issues surrounding EVE. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) we provide an E-SQL view definition language with which the view definer can direct the view evolution process, 2) we introduce a model for information source description which allows a large class of ISs to participate in our system dynamically, 3) we formally define what constitutes a legal view rewriting, 4) we develop replacement strategies for affected view components which are designed to meet the preferences expressed by E-SQL, 5) we prove the correctness of the replacement strategies, and 6) we provide a set of view synchronization algorithms based on those strategies.

IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","20021107","2002","2","","221","224 vol.2","This paper presents a hierarchical image representation that preserves spatial relationships, and an image segmentation algorithm that efficiently constructs this representation. The overall structure of the hierarchical representation assumes a tree-like organization, in which a node at a higher level represents of a group of nodes from the next lower level. The root node of the representation is the full image, and the leaf nodes are K × K blocks of pixels (usually 4 × 4 or 8 × 8), called blobs. The segmentation algorithm builds this hierarchical representation using an efficient clustering algorithm for grouping nodes progressively into larger objects. While performing the union of nodes at one level into a single parent node at the next higher level of the tree, nodes are grouped together according to similarities between their feature vectors, which include such features as color information, orientation, texture, size, energy, and neighbor information. The computation complexity of the hierarchical image segmentation algorithm is O(MN + MN/K<sup>2</sup> log(MN/K<sup>2</sup>)), where M, N are the height and width of the original image. Experimental results show that this algorithm can segment images and extract objects effectively.","","POD:0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035554","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image representation;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;MPEG 4 Standard;Motion estimation","computational complexity;feature extraction;image representation;image segmentation;pattern clustering;tree data structures","clustering algorithm;color information;computation complexity;energy;feature vectors;hierarchical image representation;hierarchical image segmentation algorithm;hierarchical representation;leaf nodes;neighbor information;orientation;root node;size;spatial relationships;texture;tree-like organization","","3","","13","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increasing use of Extended Markup Language (XML) suggests that the required external data will most often be available in XML format. We present a theoretically well-founded approach to the logical federation of OLAP and XML data sources. The approach allows external XML data to be presented along with dimensional data in OLAP query results and enables the use of external XML data for selection and grouping. Special care is taken to ensure that semantic problems do not occur in the integration process. This opens up many new application areas for OLAP. A number of effective optimization techniques for OLAP-XML federations are presented.

This is a non-trivial problem, especially for users with limited expertise in image retrieval and when complex features are used for the image description and comparison. Therefore, this paper presents a mosaic-based technique for sketch feedback, which combines the best sections of the database into a single image. An analysis of individual sections and the linked target images shows, which areas of the sketch lead to poor results and should be modified.

The albedo-meter based field measurement is over a small area. On the contrary, the spatial resolution of the MODIS albedo production is about 1 km. Another problem is the different wavebands or albedo-meter and MODIS sensor. As a solution, we suggest to use the field multiangular measurements data that is captured in a small field of view (FOV) to retrieve the albedo by Ambrals model inversion. As a result, the retrieved albedo is comparable with that measured by albedo-meter since they have the same scale. At the same time, the effect of wavebands difference is also corrected. In the second step, we extend this method to the airborne MARS observations of the same target. Scaling-up can be considered based on the two inverted albedos. The retrieved albedo from airborne data can be validated using field measurement too. Finally, the airborne retrieved albedo can be used to validate the MODIS albedo production. In this framework, the field measured data sets come from a large satellite-airborne-ground synchronous experiment that was taken in Shunyi, which is in the north of Beijing, in April of 2001.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1027133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1027133","","Cities and towns;Geographic Information Systems;Geography;Information retrieval;Land surface;MODIS;Mars;Production;Reflectivity;Remote sensing","albedo;terrain mapping","Ambrals model inversion;Beijing;China;MODIS albedo production;Shunyi;airborne MARS observations;airborne data;field of view;land surface albedo retrieval;multiangular remote sensing observations;scaling-up","","0","","5","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Survey of Norway, Trondheim, Norway","IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium","20021107","2002","1","","203","207 vol.1","Although Norway is situated along a passive continental margin, it is not devoid of tectonic activity. Several studies have documented significant movements along faults within the last 10-12 ka. Most of such movements probably occurred shortly after deglaciation, when rates of crustal rebound were very high. Nonetheless, current seismicity along the Norwegian coast suggests that crustal deformation is still taking place. Ranafjord, in northern Norway, is a region with higher than average seismic activity. A six-station seismic network installed by NORSAR detected numerous earthquake swarms in the area. In order to retrieve further crustal deformation data relative to Ranafjord it was decided to use differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR). The application of conventional DInSAR is extremely challenging because the expected deformation rates are low (a few mm/yr) and over long time spans phase coherence is not preserved on large portions of the area to be investigated. The Permanent Scatterers (PS) technique overcomes these drawbacks by exploiting long series of ERS data. At Permanent Scatterers, i.e. individual phase stable point-wise radar targets, displacement data can be retrieved with millimetric: accuracy. The PS grid can be seen as a high spatial density natural geodetic network. Thirty-seven ERS scenes covering the time span 1992-2000 were involved in a Permanent Scatterers (PS) analysis.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1024988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1024988","","Earthquakes;Information retrieval;Interferometry;Layout;Monitoring;Radar scattering;Stress;Surface topography;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing","faulting;geodesy;geophysical techniques;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;tectonics","DInSAR;InSAR;NORSAR;Norway;Ranafjord;SAR;crustal deformation;differential SAR interferometry;faulting;geodesy;geophysical measurement technique;ground deformation monitoring;permanent scatterers method;radar remote sensing;synthetic aperture radar;tectonics","","5","","13","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assume that the input is too large to fit in internal memory and hence focus on data structures and algorithms that minimize the I/O bounds. A new data structure, called a tree-of-regions (ToR), is introduced and involves a combination of an R-tree and efficient representation of regions. It is shown that such a data structure enables the handling of range queries in an optimal I/O time, under certain reasonable assumptions. We also show that updates to the ToR can be handled efficiently. Experimental results for a variety of multi-valued earth science data illustrate the fast execution times of a wide range of queries, as predicted by our theoretical analysis.","1099-3371;10993371","POD:0-7695-1632-7","10.1109/SSDM.2002.1029714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1029714","","Computational modeling;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Data structures;Educational institutions;Geoscience;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Organizing;Tree data structures","data mining;natural sciences computing;query processing;temporal databases;tree data structures;visual databases","content based retrieval;data mining tasks;data structures;earth science data;large scale raster data;range queries;range search queries;spatial factors;tree-of-regions","","0","","25","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The compression algorithm tested in this paper is called successive approximation multi-stage vector quantization (SAMVQ). The hyperspectral data used were acquired by CASI over corn fields at L' Acadie experimental farm (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada) during the summer of 2000. Nine zones in the corn fields with different fertilization levels (no fertilization, intermediate fertilization, and over-fertilization) were used to evaluate the difference between the leaf chlorophyll contents obtained from original and reconstructed reflectance data cubes. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) and the correlations between the chlorophyll content derived from the original data cube and that derived from the reconstructed data cubes were calculated in the nine zones. The spatial variability of chlorophyll content in the nine zones was also examined for the images of chlorophyll content created from the original and reconstructed reflectance data cubes. The results show that the chlorophyll content image created from the reconstructed reflectance data cube corresponding to SAMVQ with a compression ratio of 20 maintains good agreement with that derived from the original reflectance data cube in the nine zones in terms of estimated pigment mean and spatial variability. As a result, SAMVQ with a compression ratio of 20 is considered acceptable for the retrieval of crop chlorophyll content from CASI hyperspectral data for agriculture corn crops.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026211","","Agriculture;Compression algorithms;Content based retrieval;Crops;Hyperspectral imaging;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Reflectivity;Vector quantization","agriculture;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image processing;multidimensional signal processing;vector quantisation;vegetation mapping","CASI;IR;chlorophyll content;compression algorithm;corn;crops;data compression;geophysical measurement technique;hyperspectral remote sensing;image compression;image processing;infrared;land surface;leaf chlorophyll;multispectral remote sensing;precision agriculture;successive approximation multi-stage vector quantization;terrain mapping;vector quantization;vegetation mapping;visible","","0","","7","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Image interpretation is achieved using Subcellular Location Features that have been shown to be capable of recognizing all major subcellular structures and of resolving patterns that cannot be distinguished by eye. Results of queries can be ranked by image typicality and statistical tests can be performed on sets of images (e.g., to determine whether a drug alters the distribution of a tagged protein). We anticipate that PSLID will serve as a common repository for microscopy images documenting the subcellular location of proteins.","","POD:0-7803-7584-X","10.1109/ISBI.2002.1029259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1029259","","Content based retrieval;Fluorescence;Image databases;Image recognition;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Microscopy;Pattern recognition;Proteins","biological techniques;biology computing;cellular biophysics;fluorescence;optical microscopy;proteins;visual databases","biophysical research technique;cell biology;common repository;drug effects;fluorescent probe chemistry;image annotations;image interpretations;image sets;image typicality;major subcellular structures;microscopy images;molecular biology;proteins subcellular location;sample preparation;statistical tests;subcellular location features;tagged protein distribution","","3","2","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this task, we must consider similarities among polyphonic signals of the music, and achieve quick retrieval. Therefore, we first introduce the polyphonic binary feature vector to represent the presence of multiple notes. This feature is suitable for the search based on the similarities among polyphonic audio signals. Then, we propose a new search method, which is quicker than the exhaustive use of DP matching. The search is accelerated using a ""similarity matrix"" to limit the search space. Experiments using a test database containing 216 music pieces show that the search accuracy of the proposed feature is 89%, which is approximately 26% higher than that of the conventional spectrum feature. It is also shown that the new search method retrieves similar music without significant accuracy degradation as well as the exhaustive search does and the computational complexity of the new search method is about 1/4 that of exhaustive search.","","POD:0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035728","","Acceleration;Audio databases;Degradation;Instruments;Laboratories;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Search methods;Spatial databases;Testing","audio coding;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;multimedia databases;music","computational complexity;fast music retrieval;multiple note representation;polyphonic audio signal;polyphonic binary feature vector;polyphonic binary feature vectors;polyphonic-music audio database;search accuracy;similar music;similarity matrix","","9","1","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Res., Holmdel, NJ, USA","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","20021107","2002","10","4","455","465","Popular content is frequently replicated in multiple servers or caches in the Internet to offload origin servers and improve end-user experience. However, choosing the best server is a nontrivial task and a bad choice may provide poor end user experience. In contrast to retrieving a file from a single server, we propose a parallel-access scheme where end users access multiple servers at the same time, fetching different portions of that file from different servers and reassembling them locally. The amount of data retrieved from a particular server depends on the resources available at that server or along the path from the user to the server. Faster servers deliver bigger portions of a file while slower servers deliver smaller portions. If the available resources at a server or along the path change during the download of a file, a dynamic parallel access automatically shifts the load from congested locations to less loaded parts (server and links) of the Internet. The end result is that users experience significant speedups and very consistent response times. Moreover, there is no need for complicated server selection algorithms and load is dynamically shared among all servers. The dynamic parallel-access scheme presented does not require any modifications to servers or content and can be easily included in browsers, peer-to-peer applications or content distribution networks to speed up delivery of popular content.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2002.801413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026003","","Communication industry;Delay;File servers;Information retrieval;Internet;Mirrors;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunications;Web server","Internet;file servers;transport protocols","Internet replicated content;browsers;congested locations;content distribution networks;dynamic TCP;dynamic parallel access;history-based TCP;mirror site replication;multiple servers;peer-to-peer applications","","111","17","22","","","Aug 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the contrary to intensity oriented conventional object detection methods, the proposed method refers to color rarity and local edge property, and integrally evaluates them by a fuzzy function to achieve better detection quality. These image features were chosen considering the characteristics of soccer video images, that most non-object regions are roughly single colored (green) and most objects tend to have locally strong edges. We also propose a simple object tracking method, that could track objects with occlusion with other objects using a color based template matching. The result of an evaluation experiment applied to actual soccer video showed very high detection rate in detecting player regions without occlusion, and promising ability for regions with occlusion.","","POD:0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035714","","Broadcasting;Cameras;Games;Image edge detection;Indexing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Information science;Multimedia communication;Object detection","edge detection;feature extraction;fuzzy logic;image colour analysis;object detection;target tracking;video signal processing","color rarity;fuzzy function;image features;local edge property;object detection;object tracking;occlusion;player regions;soccer games;video indexing;video retrieval","","24","3","8","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a new image representation that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions that are coherent in color and texture. This ""Blobworld"" representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2002.1023800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1023800","","Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Image databases;Image recognition;Image representation;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Pixel;Web sites","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture;optimisation;pattern clustering;relevance feedback","Blobworld;color histograms;colour coherence;expectation maximization;fully automatic algorithm;grouping;image collections;image content;image querying;image regions;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;image texture coherence;joint color-texture-position feature space;knobs;object-level querying;pixel clustering;precision;raw pixel data;similarity metrics adjustment;texture histograms","","654","57","47","","","Aug 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","20021107","2002","1","","185","188 vol.1","The paper presents a TREE (templates and their relationship extraction and estimation) algorithm for indexing images from picture libraries with more semantics-sensitive meanings. In this approach, each image is represented by a set of templates and their spatial relationships as keys to capture the essence of the image. Each template is characterized by a set of dominant regions, which reflect different appearances of an object at different conditions and can be obtained by the proposed TEA (template extraction and analysis) algorithm through region matching. The STREAM (spatial template relationship extraction and measurement) algorithm is then proposed for obtaining the spatial relations between these extracted templates. Due to the nature of a template, which can represent various appearances of an object at different conditions, the proposed approach can provide better capabilities and flexibilities to capture image contents than other traditional region-based methods. Besides, through maintaining the spatial layout of images, the semantic meanings hidden in the query images can be extracted and lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of image retrieval.","","POD:0-7803-7304-9","10.1109/ICME.2002.1035749","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035749","","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;Explosions;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Libraries;Streaming media","feature extraction;image classification;image matching;image retrieval;image segmentation;parameter estimation","image indexing;image retrieval;image segmentation;image templates;picture libraries;region matching;semantic description;spatial relationships;spatial template measurement;spatial template relationship extraction;template extraction","","0","","7","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
