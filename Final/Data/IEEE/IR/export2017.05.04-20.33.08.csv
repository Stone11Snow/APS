We have proposed another approach for the logical model of IR, for the evaluation of the IR implication d /spl iexcl/! RQ in a fuzzy context. We transform the initial implication into a fuzzy implication and the matching process is modelled by the extension of the fuzzy Galois connection while considering a fuzzy quantifier. We want to implement a retrieval engine only based on the computation of this fuzzy Galois connection. Another research area we want to explore is a combination of the direct and reverse implication, as suggested by the initial general logic framework proposed by Nie. As work in progress, we propose to use the proposed extension of the fuzzy Galois connection in text mining to extract fuzzy association rules between terms and perform query expansion using these fuzzy associations between terms.","","POD:0-7803-7983-7","10.1109/AICCSA.2003.1227516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227516","","Computer science;Data mining;Engines;Information retrieval;Logic;Optical computing","data mining;fuzzy logic;information retrieval;search engines","IR implication;IR logical model;direct-reverse implication combination;fuzzy Galois connection extension;fuzzy association rules;fuzzy context;fuzzy implication;fuzzy quantifier;information retrieval;query expansion;retrieval engine implementation;text mining","","1","","","","","14-18 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WISE 2002.","20030225","2002","","","83","92","In recent years, several information retrieval methods using information about Web-links have been developed, such as HITS and trawling. In order to analyze Web-links dividing into links inside each Web site (local-links) and links between Web sites (global-links)for information retrieval, a proper model of the Web site is required. In existing research, a Web server is used as a model of the Web site. This idea works relatively well when a Web site corresponds to a server, as is the case for public Web sites, but works poorly when multiple Web sites correspond to a server, as is the case for private Web sites on rental Web servers. We propose a new model of the Web site, ""directory-based site"", to handle typical private sites, and a method to identify them using information about the URL and Web-links. We verify the method can approximately identify, at a rate of 66% of over 110,000 servers, whether each server has multiple directory-based sites or not, and extract over 500,000 directory-based sites and 4 million global-links by computational experiments using jp-domain URLs and Web-link data contains over 23 million URLs and 100 million Web-links, collected from July to August 2000, by Toyoda and Kitsuregawa. We also propose a new framework of Web-link based information retrieval that uses directory-based sites and global-links instead of Web pages and whole Web-links respectively, and examine the effectiveness of our framework by comparing a result of trawling on our framework to one on the existing framework.","","POD:0-7695-1766-8","10.1109/WISE.2002.1181646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181646","","Gold;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information science;Search engines;Search methods;Toy industry;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web sites","Web sites;information retrieval","HITS;URL;Web links;Web server;Web sites;directory based site;global links;information retrieval methods;jp-domain URLs;local links;private sites;trawling","","1","","13","","","12-14 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20030611","2003","","","466","471","The migration problem (MP) of mobile agents is an important, NP-hard problem in distributed information retrieval systems built upon mobile agent technology. MP aims at optimizing the migration paths of agents for minimizing total communication cost within a user-specified limit of task completion time. In this paper we first show MP is equivalent to searching for an optimal migration tree. We then employ genetic algorithms to address MP, proposing a new encoding scheme to represent the migration trees, which is compose of two parts: one is the pre-ordered traversal sequence of tree vertices, the other the children number sequence of corresponding tree vertices. Our encoding scheme has the advantages of simplicity for encoding and decoding, ease for GA operations, an better equilibrium between exploration and exploitation. This encoding scheme, with few restrictions on the length of code, can be freely lengthened or shortened according to the characteristics of problem space. We can benefit much from such an adaptive property. The simulation results reveal the efficiency and higher performance of our algorithm, and fast convergence to the optima or sub-optima on various problem sizes. Our algorithm runs nearly 4 times faster than the binary string encoding of vertices when the problem size becomes large and the search capability is comparative or slightly better of our algorithm than the benchmark.","","POD:0-7695-1921-0","10.1109/ICDCSW.2003.1203596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203596","","Cost function;Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Mobile agents;Network servers;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","communication complexity;distributed processing;genetic algorithms;information retrieval systems;minimisation;mobile agents;tree searching","GA-based solution;binary string encoding;communication cost;distributed information retrieval system;genetic algorithm;migration problem;mobile agent;optimal migration tree;preordered traversal sequence;user-specified limit","","0","","19","","","19-22 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that our design manages the randomness of node mobility. Although nodes contact only direct neighbors (who change frequently) and do not use any ad hoc routing, the system maintains good IR performance. This makes our design applicable to mobility situations where routing partitions are common.

This paper identifies eight types of terms that affect retrieval effectiveness in CLIR applications through their coverage by general-purpose bilingual term lists, and reports results from an experimental evaluation of the coverage of 35 bilingual term lists in news retrieval application. Retrieval effectiveness was found to be strongly influenced by term list size for lists that contain between 3,000 and 30,000 unique terms per language. Supplemental techniques for named entity translation were found to be useful with even the largest lexicons. The contribution of named-entity translation was evaluated in a cross-language experiment involving English and Chinese.

Our scheme neither relies on any unproven cryptographic assumptions nor the availability of tamper-proof hardware. A probabilistic verification function is introduced into the scheme to detect corrupted results. Unlike previous PIR research that attempted mainly to demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of PIR, we have actually implemented both a PIR scheme and our FT-PIR scheme in a distributed database environment. The experimental and analytical results show that only modest performance overhead is introduced by FT-PIR while comparing with PIR in the fault-free cases. The FT-PIR scheme tolerates a variety of server faults effectively. In certain fail-stop fault scenarios, FT-PIR performs even better than PIR. It was observed that 35.82% less processing time was actually needed for FT-PIR to tolerate one server fault.","1060-9857;10609857","POD:0-7695-1659-9","10.1109/RELDIS.2002.1180169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1180169","","Computer science;Data privacy;Data security;Distributed databases;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Information retrieval;Information security;Management information systems;Protection","client-server systems;data privacy;distributed databases;file servers;query processing;security of data;software fault tolerance","corrupted results detection;database servers;distributed database environment;fail-stop fault scenarios;fault-tolerant private information retrieval scheme;malicious server faults;performance overhead;probabilistic verification function;processing time;secure information retrieval;sensitive information;service availability;user privacy protection","","6","","23","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A recent approach that has shown considerable promise uses generative models of text (language models) to describe the IR processes. We briefly review the major variations of the language model approach and how they have been used to develop a range of retrieval-related language technologies, including cross-lingual IR and distributed search.

VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) is used to model the 3D object of the Web page, and become as a standard for 3D information. Most content-based retrieval (CBR) techniques such as shape and color comparison among objects are for image and video. The mechanisms are designed based on 2D information. In this paper, we propose a new similarity method, based on 3D information extracted from a VRML object database. The system includes multiple subsystems, which are conducted in two main parts. The first part includes the VRML object parser system and the normalization system. The second part includes the comparison system, database management system and a friendly graphical user interface. The method is the first step of our project, which aims to incorporate feature extraction of virtual reality objects, such as chairs, car, and others in 3D space.

The paper is concerned with applying a linear hidden Markov model (HMM) with three kinds of states, S, C and D, as the matching mechanism for a query by a humming system. Note segmentation, pitch tracking and the database of the system are briefly introduced. The paper analyzes six probable errors in humming and proposes the SCD HMM to model each song. Each of the states, S, C and D, represents two of the six errors. The SCD HMM describes all kinds of possibilities of errors in a hummed query. Each query can find a most probable state sequence in a SCD HMM and get a probability score that determines the similarity between the query and the candidate songs. The retrieval system contains about 1000 Chinese folk songs. Experimental results show that the model is robust to the six errors and generally a 90% matching accuracy (listed on top 5) can be achieved.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-7663-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2003.1200024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1200024","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Databases;Dynamic programming;Error analysis;Hidden Markov models;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Statistical analysis","audio databases;audio signal processing;hidden Markov models;music;query processing","Chinese folk songs;humming;linear hidden Markov model;music database;music information retrieval;note segmentation;pitch tracking;state sequence;statistical analysis","","2","","13","","","6-10 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a color histogram only records an image's overall color compositions and no any spatial information is included, and also retrieval precision is limited. In this paper, a color-spatial histogram, which incorporates spatial information with color compositions without sacrificing the robustness of color histograms, is proposed. The purpose is considering the representation role of color compositions and spatial information in the meantime. Each entry in a color-spatial histogram is the color frequency and corresponding position information of the virtual boundary. Experimental evidence suggests that this new color-spatial histogram outperform not only the traditional color histogram method but also the other color-spatial histogram methods for image retrieval.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175405","","Colored noise;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Robustness;Videos","content-based retrieval;image representation;image retrieval;visual databases","color histogram;content-based image retrieval;image annotation;image retrieval;large image database;representation","","0","","10","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new query operator, called the 'in' operator, is used to specify context inclusion between two terms.

This spatial model allows efficient access of relational linkages for a Bayesian network, and thus improves support for complex and vague queries. The Bayesian network assigns causal probabilities to these relational linkages in order to define expert knowledge of related datasets in the GIS. In addition, the framework will learn which datasets are best suited for particular query input through feedback supplied by the user. This contribution will increase the performance and efficiency of knowledge extraction from GIS by allowing users to focus on interpreting data, instead of focusing on finding which data is relevant to their analysis. The initial user query can be vague and the framework will still be capable of retrieving relevant datasets via the linkages discovered in the Bayesian network.","","POD:0-7695-2084-7","10.1109/MULMM.2004.1264978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264978","","Bayesian methods;Couplings;Data analysis;Data mining;Data visualization;Feedback;Geographic Information Systems;Information retrieval;Machine intelligence;Web server","belief networks;data models;geographic information systems;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;query processing","Bayesian framework;Bayesian network;automated dataset retrieval;causal probabilities;expert knowledge;geographic information systems;knowledge extraction;machine intelligence;nonspatial data;query processing;relational data;spatial data","","1","","19","","","5-7 Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach consists of maximizing the interaction/collaboration rate, and hence the rate of information exchange between the mobile agents in the presence of destructive interference. The proposed approach takes into account the spatial distribution of the agents, which is a function of the agents' movement pattern in the environment. We illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of local interaction between the teammates and its effect on information retrieval, first by presenting a collaborative, sensing task consisting of using a team of autonomous agents with limited sensing capabilities to count some objects scattered throughout an enclosed region. Then we introduce a general mathematical methodology for maximizing the collaboration rate, and hence the rate of information spread in similar networks of multiple, cooperating mobile agents.

When developing the system, firstly a priority was placed on the automatic processing, and prosodic focus was controlled by rather simple rules (original rules). Based on the listening test for the reply speech generated using original rules, new rules were then developed. Through the further listening test, the rules were revised and called the revised rules. The validity of the revised rules was verified through an evaluation experiment.

In our CLIR experiments using an external source language collection, we show that context-sensitive translation of pre-translation expansion terms outperforms word-by-word (or context-free) translation on average. Moreover, we show that the combination of context-sensitive translation with pseudo-relevance feedback significantly outperforms the corresponding context-free combination and the pseudo-relevance feedback component.

In conventional content-based retrieval, target events are identified by analyzing information about the position of objects such as loci, relative positions, their transitions, etc. from video. However, methods using indices obtained only from video essentially fail to detect some important time points and positions due to tracking errors as a result of occlusion, leading to recognition failures and oversights of target events. Our approach combines the use of audio information with conventional video methods, to develop an integrated reasoning module that can recognize some events that cannot be identified by conventional ones. Based on the proposed method, we implemented a content-based retrieval system that can identify several actions in a real tennis video. The basic actions of a player such as a forehand swing, an overhead swing, etc. are identified by using information about the court and net lines, the players' positions, the ball positions, and the moments when the players hit the ball, which are called ""impact points"". Simulation results show that the rate of detecting impact points affects the rate of recognition of player's basic actions. They also show that by using audio information, we can avoid some recognition problems.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-1695-X","10.1109/ICPR.2002.1048430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1048430","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Event detection;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Shape;Target recognition;Target tracking","audio signal processing;content-based retrieval;image recognition;image retrieval;sport;video signal processing","accuracy;audio information;ball positions;behaviour identification;content-based retrieval;court;forehand swing;human behaviours;impact points;integrated reasoning module;net lines;overhead swing;player positions;real tennis video;simulation results;video information","","2","1","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among different query methods content-based media retrieval analyzing intrinsic characteristics of the source seems to form the most intuitive access. The key-melody in a song can be regarded as the major characteristic in music and leads to a query by humming or singing. In this paper we turn our attention to both, the features and the algorithm of matching in audio music retrieval. Nowadays approaches propagate the use of dynamic time warping for the matching process. As reference mostly midi-data or humming itself is used. However, first attempts matching humming to polyphonic audio exist. In this contribution we introduce hidden Markov models as an alternative for humming queries matching humming itself, mobile phone ring tones and polyphonic audio. The second object of our research is the introduction of a new way of melody enhancement prior to a latter feature extraction by use of stereophonic information. Further an adaptation throughout the extraction process of the frame length to the tempo of a musical piece helps improving similarity matching performance. The paper addresses the design of a working recognition engine and results achieved with respect to the alluded methods. A test database consisting of polyphonic audio clips, ring tones, and sung user data is described in detail.","","POD:0-7803-7965-9","10.1109/ICME.2003.1221716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1221716","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Mobile handsets;Music information retrieval;Search engines;Spatial databases;Testing","audio databases;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;music","audio music retrieval;content-based media retrieval;dynamic time warping;feature extraction;framelength adaptation;hidden Markov models;humming;music databases;polyphonic audio;similarity matching;singing;stereophonic feature information","","1","","6","","","6-9 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is, if the only concern is to find information that completely or partially matches users' queries. However, the retrieval task is unsatisfactory if the definite forms are not easily or possibly represent the semantic contents of the queries. Thus, we propose a fuzzy information retrieval model that can ""understand"" users' queries especially when the users cannot clearly describe the part or the whole features of their query specifications. User query which is viewed as a semantic entry, could belong to the multiple semantic categories and by introducing two fuzzy measure degrees, centrality and intensity, our model is capable of dealing with the ambiguity in user query. The matching policy is based on the combining centrality distance and the intensity distance between the query and the targets in database. The total distance is taking into account the confidence values of all the considered features. Since the model is qualitative approach, the system can capture what the users' can hardly express. The system can ""see"" what users' interest are, even if the user cannot or don't know how to explicitly express what they have remembered in the form of queries.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7952-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244392","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244392","","Birds;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information systems;Search engines;Spatial databases","fuzzy systems;information retrieval;programming language semantics","fuzzy centrality;fuzzy information retrieval model;fuzzy intensity concepts;fuzzy semantic;semantic entry;user query","","1","","9","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We concentrate on music retrieval by detecting mood. Mood detection is implemented on the viewpoint of computational media aesthetics, that is, by analyzing two music dimensions, tempo and articulation, in the procedure of making music, we derive four categories of mood, happiness, anger, sadness and fear. Concretely, with regard to music in the format of raw audio, after tempo is detected using a multiple agent approach, a feature called relative tempo is calculated, and after the mean and standard deviation of the feature called average silence ratio in the presented computational articulation model are calculated, a simple BP neural network classifier is trained to detect mood. Users retrieval music by browsing the 3D visualization of feature space associated with specific mood.

In Ellis' holistic model of information seeking behaviors, the information seeking activities include: selection of sources, browsing and differentiating, monitoring as well as extraction. Through the use of a query processing agent (QPA), information filtering agents (IFAs) and information monitoring agents (IMAs), these activities can be automated. By establishing subclass relations among (key)words the query processing agent (QPA) expands a query with a list of subqueries to select appropriate URLs. Using three relevance metrics: word relations, frequency and nearness of keywords, the IFA is used to determine the relevance of a page. Additionally, IMAs can be used to track changes in the content of selected pages, paragraphs or tables in Web sites. Empirical results demonstrated that the QPA can find appropriate number of Web sites, and IFAs are effective in filtering relevant information.

A popular technique is that a mobile agent injects a replica into stable storage upon its arrival at each agent server. However, a server crash leaves the replica unavailable, for an unknown time period, until the agent server is back online. This paper uses exception handling to maintain the availability, of mobile agents in the presence of agent server crash failures. Two exception handler designs are proposed. The first exists at the agent server that created the mobile agent. The second operates at the previous agent server visited by the mobile agent. Initial performance results demonstrate that although the second design is slower it offers the smaller trip time increase in the presence of agent server crashes.","","POD:0-7695-1876-1","10.1109/ISADS.2003.1193939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193939","","Application software;Availability;Computer crashes;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile agents;Web server","exception handling;fault tolerant computing;information retrieval;mobile agents","agent server crashes;exception handling approach;information retrieval applications;mobile agent availability maintenance;mobile agent fault tolerance;remote agent servers","","16","","25","","","9-11 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since then several methods were developed in an attempt to beat this bound, but all these methods yielded the same asymptotic bound. In this paper, this barrier is finally broken and the complexity of information-theoretic k-server PIR is improved to n<sup>O(log log k</sup>k log k)/. The new PIR protocols can also be used to construct k-query binary locally decodable codes of length exp(n<sup>O(log log k</sup>k log k)/), compared to exp(n<sup>1</sup>k-1/) in previous constructions. The improvements presented in this paper apply even for small values of k: the PIR protocols are more efficient than previous ones for every k≥3, and the locally decodable codes are shorter for every k≥4.","0272-5428;02725428","POD:0-7695-1822-2","10.1109/SFCS.2002.1181949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1181949","","Access protocols;Complexity theory;Databases;Decoding;Information retrieval;Scholarships;Upper bound","communication complexity;information retrieval;polynomials;protocols","communication complexity;data item;database;information-theoretic private information retrieval;k-server PIR protocols;protocols","","26","2","32","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on","20030605","2002","5","","2200","2203 vol.5","Natural language information processing remains a challenge in linguistics. Existing methods for retrieval of text often use stemming to retain common roots and base recall on these root words. This requires the removal of stop words, e.g., numbers, symbols, high frequency bid low semantic weight words, thereby precluding phrases using these words. In addition stemming is a morphologic approach that cannot readily process homonyms, synonyms and certain inflectional and derived forms. Machine learning approaches assign words to categories, but application to a large corpus remains in debate. For this study, we describe the application of the Cortronic theory and methods developed by Robert Hecht-Nielsen (2002) to information retrieval of text word pairs. Hecht-Nielsen's theories build on associative memory artificial neural networks (AMNNs) introduced by Steinbuch (1961) and extended by Willshaw et al. (1969) especially in regards sparseness. The AMNNs are used to process a large corpus without excluding stop words, and retain the joint probability of mutual occurrences that allows rapid retrieval of word pairs. This AMNN approach includes three key components: representation of arbitrary objects (words), learning and knowledge accumulation based on measurement of co-occurrence and use of all the learned knowledge to produce (predict) the missing word in a phrase.","","POD:981-04-7524-1","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1201883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1201883","","Artificial neural networks;Associative memory;Frequency;Information processing;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Natural languages;Neural networks;Neurons;Sparse matrices","content-addressable storage;information retrieval;linguistics;natural languages;neural nets;text analysis","AMNNs;Cortronic theory;arbitrary object representation;associative memory neural networks;information retrieval;knowledge accumulation;large corpus;linguistics;mutual occurrences;natural language information processing;rapid word pair retrieval;text word pairs","","0","","11","","","18-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This type of information can usually be delivered to users within the required time. Therefore, a retrieval service needs to be able to supply the required information to users within a specified time given by the user, and at the same time, it needs to have minimum system overheads from network traffic when performing the retrieval task for an anticipated increasing number of users. In this paper, we propose a new agent-planning algorithm, called d-Agent, for distributed information retrieval. This planning algorithm has two goals: (1) to guarantee a given turn-around time; (2) to schedule mobile agents (the number of agents and each agent's itinerary) optimally while maintaining low system overheads. Although the algorithm tends to slightly increase the planning cost because of these two requirements, a simulation study shows that our algorithm is practical and realistic, and can be directly applied to distributed information retrieval with deadline constraints.","0098-3063;00983063","","10.1109/TCE.2003.1205463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1205463","","Bandwidth;Computer science;Delay;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Technology planning;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;information retrieval;mobile agents;mobile computing;scheduling","agent-planning algorithm;d-Agent;distributed information retrieval;minimum system overheads;mobile agent planning;network traffic;planning cost;schedule;turn-around time","","5","","34","","","Feb. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a new method for content-based image retrieval, which can be divided into two main parts: 1) automatic segmentation and extraction of shapes from image sub-regions; 2) ontological descriptions of shapes contained in the images. Our method allows users to perform sketch queries; these are simple drawings which represent the main idea of something the user is expecting to retrieve from the results. Once the user introduces a sketch, it is simplified using discrete curve evolution; then it is turned into a tangent space representation. Similarity measures based on turning functions are used to recover similar images. Ontology reduces the proportion of nonsensical results since it permits the recovery of images related semantically, even if they do not have similar shapes.","","POD:0-7695-2074-X","10.1109/ICECC.2004.1269588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1269588","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Image analysis;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Ontologies;SQUIDs;Shape","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation","automatic shape extraction;automatic shape segmentation;content-based image retrieval;content-based retrieval;discrete curve evolution;image features;ontological shape-description;similarity measures;sketch queries;tangent space representation;turning functions;visual information retrieval","","1","","12","","","16-18 Feb. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of different ranking algorithms and parameter values at different sites is examined.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2004.1264782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264782","","Analytical models;Data analysis;Distributed databases;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Search engines;Software libraries","digital libraries;distributed databases;information retrieval system evaluation;search engines","analytical performance model;collection fusion;digital libraries;distributed databases;distributed information retrieval system;metasearch engine","","4","","55","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advances in technology have made it possible to have extremely small, low powered sensor devices equipped with programmable computing, multiple parameter sensing, and wireless communication capability. Because of their inherent limitations, the protocols designed for such sensor networks must efficiently use both limited bandwidth and battery energy. We develop an M/G/1 model to analytically determine the delay incurred in handling various types of queries using our enhanced APTEEN (Adaptive Periodic Threshold-sensitive Energy Efficient sensor Network protocol) protocol. Our protocol uses an enhanced TDMA schedule to efficiently incorporate query handling, with a queuing mechanism for heavy loads. It also provides the additional flexibility of querying the network through any node in the network. To verify our analytical results, we have simulated a temperature sensing application with a Poisson arrival rate for queries on the network simulator ns-2. As the simulation and analytical results match perfectly well, this can be said to be the first step towards analytically determining the delay characteristics of a wireless sensor network.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2002.1158266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158266","","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Bandwidth;Batteries;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Telecommunication network reliability;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;distributed databases;distributed sensors;mobile computing;protocols;query processing;queueing theory","M/G/1 model;Poisson arrival rate;TDMA;ad hoc networks;delay;enhanced APTEEN protocol;information retrieval;limited bandwidth;low powered sensor devices;monitoring;multiple parameter sensing;network simulator;programmable computing;query handling;queuing mechanism;temperature sensing application;wireless sensor networks","","45","","18","","","Dec 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
