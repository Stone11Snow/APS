However, search engines like Google, Baidu, can't satisfy the demands of buyer because the information about the product that the users want can't be obtain quickly, easily and correctly. So buyer has to spend lots of time in removing the unnecessary information. Many e-commerce website often request buyers to review products that they have already purchased. As the popularity of e-commerce is increasing day by day, the reviews from customers about the product receives also increasing heavily. As a result of this it is difficult for a buyer to read all the reviews to make a decision about the product purchase. In this paper, we extracted, summarize and categorize all the customer reviews of a book. This paper proposes a book recommendation technique based on opinion mining and Naïve Bayes classifier to recommend top ranking books to buyers.

LBS are an Information Service, which is accessible from mobile devices through the mobile network and provides information based on the geographical position of the device. LBS include services to identify a location of a person or an object or a service such as discovering the nearest facilities as per the user's preferences. The information on health care services is essential and vital. There is a significant requirement of efficient and user friendly location based services which provide health care related information like location and details of hospitals for a user on the move. The proposed methodology for finding the nearest Healthcare Facilities in a city is based on the network analysis which is used to determine the closeness and the shortest path to the healthcare facilities using the ArcGIS software.

The private cloud is one of the deployment models and it offers resources in an on-demand manner. Resource Management is the challenging task between different private cloud because of the interoperability issues since the private clouds are managed by different type of cloud middleware's and each of them has their own mechanism and protocols. To manage the resource efficiently and to increase the resource availability it is essential to overcome the interoperability issues between the private clouds. In this paper a common mechanism called Semantic Cloud Resource Broker (SCRB) is introduced between the Eucalyptus and Open Nebula based private clouds. It also includes the semantic technology to achieve meaningful search. Hence an OWL-based ontology indexing and retrieval algorithms is implemented to improve precision and recall and thereby improves the success rate of cloud resources.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3913-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-3914-5; POD:978-1-4799-3915-2","10.1109/ICACCCT.2014.7019373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019373","Availability;Interoperability;Ontology;Resource management;Semantic search","Authentication;Handheld computers;Indexes;Ontologies;Scalability;Semantics","cloud computing;data privacy;indexing;information retrieval;knowledge representation languages;middleware;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic Web","Eucalyptus;OWL-based ontology indexing;Open Nebula;SCRB;blending technology;cloud middleware;deployment models;distributing computing;everything as a service;interoperability issues;parallel computing;private cloud;resource management;retrieval algorithms;semantic cloud resource broker;semantic technology","","0","","19","","","8-10 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, in traditional caching approaches, files are retrieved from evolved packet core (EPC) of the network, and without coordination among SBSs, which introduces new challenges of content duplication and unbalanced traffic load on the backhaul. In this paper, we propose a collaborative framework in which the SBSs can access files from the caches of other SBSs within the same network domain (i.e., connected to the same service gateway). We design a cost model for the content retrieval of contents across SBSs and from the EPC, and we propose a cost-aware decentralized algorithm, based on which the SBSs devise individual caching strategies (i.e., which files to cache, and from where). Simulation results show that the proposed cooperative caching scheme yields significant gains in terms of in-network content availability, reaching up to 21% improvement compared to a traditional approaches based on geographical distribution of the UEs.","","Electronic:978-1-6319-0055-6; POD:978-1-4799-6029-3; USB:978-1-6319-0054-9","10.4108/icst.5gu.2014.258230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7041042","","Bismuth;Frequency modulation;Logic gates;Scattering","cache storage;cellular radio;cooperative communication;information retrieval;internetworking;multimedia communication;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","QoS;SBS;cellular user equipments;collaborative framework;content duplication;content placement;content retrieval;cooperative small cell networks;cost model;cost-aware decentralized algorithm;evolved packet core;file retrieval;in-network caching;in-network content availability;multimedia file requests;network domain;quality-of-service enhancement;service gateway;small cell base stations;unbalanced traffic load","","7","","12","","","26-28 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the cache hit-ratio is generally considered in the literature as the dominant performance metric for such type of systems, in this paper we argue that a critical missing piece has so far been neglected. Adopting a radically different perspective, in this paper we explicitly account for the cost of content retrieval, i.e. the cost associated to the external bandwidth needed by an ISP to retrieve the contents requested by its customers. Interestingly, we discover that classical cache provisioning techniques that maximize cache efficiency (i.e., the hit-ratio), lead to suboptimal solutions with higher overall cost. To show this mismatch, we propose two optimization models that either minimize the overall costs or maximize the hit-ratio, jointly providing cache sizing, object placement and path selection. We formulate a polynomial-time greedy algorithm to solve the two problems and analytically prove its optimality. We provide numerical results and show that significant cost savings are attainable via a cost-aware design.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3512-3; POD:978-1-4799-3513-0; USB:978-1-4799-3511-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036957","","Biological system modeling;Economics;Greedy algorithms;Numerical models;Optimization;Quality of service;Reliability","Internet;cache storage;computational complexity;content management;greedy algorithms;information retrieval;minimax techniques;telecommunication traffic","ICN;ISP;Internet service providers;cache efficiency maximization;cache hit ratio maximisation;cache sizing;classical cache provisioning technique optimisation;content retrieval;cost aware caching;cost minimization;cost savings;dominant performance metric;information centric networks;jointly off loading network traffic;object placement;path selection;polynomial-time greedy algorithm","","5","","24","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While several community repositories and tools are available to help with climate data, these problems still persist and the community is actively looking for better solutions. In this project we apply NDN to support climate modeling applications. The information-centric nature of NDN, where content becomes a first class entity, simplifies many of the problems in this domain. NDN offers lightweight data publication, discovery and retrieval compared to IP-based solutions. However, introducing a new network architecture to a mature domain that routinely produces petabytes of datasets and a plethora of assorted tools to manipulate them, is a risky proposition. The advantages of NDN alone may not be sufficient to overcome the natural inertia. Our approach is to introduce NDN while carefully avoiding undue disruption to existing workflows.

Existing techniques either do not consider the heterogeneity of the disks or handle the requests in a discrete manner assuming the storage system is idle. In this paper, we focus on continuous retrieval techniques in heterogeneous storage architectures to minimize the response time of disk requests considering waiting time and service time of the requests as well as the execution time of the retrieval algorithm. We investigate multiple trade-offs between these three factors affecting the response time of a disk request and propose a maximum flow based adaptive retrieval strategy.

This communication is constantly evolving towards the goal of making it as human and real as possible. One way of humanizing such interaction is to provide a framework that can recognize the emotions present in the communication or the emotions of the involved users in order to enrich user experience. For example, by providing insights to users for personal preferences and automated recommendations based on their emotional state. In this work, we propose a framework for emotion classification in English sentences where emotions are treated as generalized concepts extracted from the sentences. We start by generating an intermediate emotional data representation of a given input sentence based on its syntactic and semantic structure. We then generalize this representation using various ontologies such as Word Net and Concept Net, which results in an emotion seed that we call an emotion recognition rule (ERR). Finally, we use a suite of classifiers to compare the generated ERR with a set of reference ERRs extracted from a training set in a similar fashion. The used classifiers are k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with handcrafted similarity measure, Point Mutual Information (PMI), and PMI with Information Retrieval (PMI-IR). When applied on different datasets, the proposed approach significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the art machine learning and rule-based classifiers with an average F-Score of 84%.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-4274-9; POD:978-1-4799-4273-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2014.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7022622","Data Mining;Emotion Recognition from Text;Natural Language Processing","Accuracy;Brain modeling;Emotion recognition;Semantics;Sensors;Syntactics;Training","data mining;emotion recognition;information retrieval;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Concept Net ontologies;ERR;English sentences;Internet;KNN classifier;PMI classifier;PMI-IR;Word Net ontologies;emotion classification;emotion recognition rule;information retrieval;intermediate emotional data representation;k-nearest neighbor classifier;point mutual information classifier;textual data","","7","","31","","","14-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, worker unreliability prevents taking a worker's responses at “face value”. Thus, responses from multiple workers are typically aggregated to more reliably infer ground-truth answers. We study two approaches for crowd aggregation on multicategory answer spaces: stochastic modeling-based and deterministic objective function-based. Our stochastic model for answer generation plausibly captures the interplay between worker skills, intentions, and task difficulties and captures a broad range of worker types. Our deterministic objective-based approach aims to maximize the average aggregate confidence of weighted plurality crowd decision making. In both approaches, we explicitly model the skill and intention of individual workers, which is exploited for improved crowd aggregation. Our methods are applicable in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings, and also when the batch of tasks is heterogeneous, i.e., from multiple domains, with task-dependent answer spaces. As observed experimentally, the proposed methods can defeat “tyranny of the masses”, i.e., they are especially advantageous when there is an (a priori unknown) minority of skilled workers amongst a large crowd of unskilled (and malicious) workers.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2014.2327026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823710","Crowdsourcing;ensemble classification;expectation-maximization;inference;multicategory","Accuracy;Aggregates;Computational modeling;Data models;Probes;Stochastic processes","Internet;database management systems;decision making;document handling;information retrieval;outsourcing;recruitment;unsupervised learning","Webpage annotation;answer generation;average aggregate confidence maximization;crowd aggregation;deterministic objective function-based multicategory answer space;deterministic objective-based approach;document database annotation;face value;ground-truth answers;image annotation;instant worker recruitment;multicategory crowdsourcing accounting;semi supervised settings;stochastic modeling-based multicategory answer space;task-dependent answer spaces;tyranny-of-the-masses;unsupervised settings;variable task difficulty;weighted plurality crowd decision making;worker intention;worker skill","","4","","28","","20140530","March 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is to understand the information needs and search behaviour of online users seeking for this particular type of information. Thirty one interviews were given to various groups of online users regarding their reasons for searching on the Web and their search processes when acquiring Islamic, particularly those of Quranic-related, information on the Web. Interview data were transcribed and then analysed inductively to identify emergent themes using inductive content analysis. The data analysis focused on extracting common themes, patterns and concepts from the transcripts that were coded by categories that emerged as the process continued. The participants interviewed believe that the Web offers quick, free and easy access to their Islamic and Quranic information needs, as additional resource and/or alternative to printed resources, access to latest updates and publications, and to correct information on the Web. The main use of the information found on the Web was mainly for personal use, study/work use, and for sharing with others. The main search medium used was using favourite links, Google and other search engines, and also forums. The languages used to search are combinations of English, Arabic and other languages although English results were more common than other languages. There were easy and hard to find topics with Hadith as one of the common topics to search when it comes to Quranic search. The findings provide important insights on user's search experiences when seeking for Islamic and Quranic information.

Even though biomédical entities in biological text are found successfully, classifying them into relevant biomédical classes such as genes, proteins, diseases, drug names, etc. is still another challenge and an open question. This paper presents a new method to classify biomédical named entities into protein and non-protein classes. Our approach employs Random Forest, a machine learning algorithm, with a new combination of features. They are orthographic, keyword and morphological, as well as a probabilistic feature called Proteinhood and a Protein-Score feature based on the Medline abstracts cited on the Pubmed, which are the main contributions in the paper. A series of experiments is conducted to compare the proposed approach with other state of the art approaches.

In this paper we address this important problem, and propose an approach for improved estimation of ad click or conversion probability based on a sequence of user's online actions, modeled using Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRF) model. In addition, in order to address the sparsity issue at the input side of the HCRF model, we propose to learn distributed, low-dimensional representations of user actions through a directed skip-gram, a neural architecture suitable for sequential data.

In this approach, the fine-grained traffic information is stored at each monitoring point, and the network manager receive only the traffic information with the required granularity. The required granularity of information depends on time, but none of existing data structure enables immediate retrieval of time series of traffic with the required granularity that changes in time.

As a result, Security Information and Management (SIEM) systems have become an indispensable part of modern networks. One of the main challenges facing SIEM systems is the ability to parse and extract relevant information from the processed events in near real-time. The more diverse the processed events are, the more complicated it becomes to extract the necessary information. Deep event correlation tasks perform very differently over structured data than they do over unstructured data. As an example, a text search for an IP address can take very long, but can return instantly if the IP address is extracted and stored in an appropriate field of its own. Dealing with dozens of different formats using the same event parsing module quickly becomes infeasible. As a result, the parsing of events has largely been outsourced to regular expressions. Although very affective at extracting information from events, they lack sophisticated logic operations. This paper presents a novel method of event processing using an embedded ECMAScript engine to effectively outsource the logic operations needed for deeper event processing.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6541-0; POD:978-1-4799-6542-7","10.1109/ICITCS.2014.7021808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021808","","Data mining;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Engines;Internet;Standards","IP networks;computer network management;computer network security;embedded systems;grammars;information retrieval;text analysis","IP address;IT systems;SIEM systems;computer network maintenance;computer network management;deep event correlation tasks;dynamic event processing;embedded ECMAScript engines;logic operations;regular expressions;relevant information extraction;relevant information parsing;runtime updatable event processing;security information-and-management systems;text search","","0","","13","","","28-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wine was considered as a luxury in old days; however, it is popular and enjoyed by a wide variety of people today. Professional wine reviews provide insights on tens of thousands wines available each year. However, currently, there is no systematic way to utilize those large number reviews to benefit wine makers, distributers and consumers. This project proposes a brand new data science area named Wineinformatics. In order to automatically retrieve wines' flavors and characteristics from reviews, which are stored in the human language format, we propose a novel “Computational Wine Wheel” to extract key words. Two different public-available datasets are produced based on our new method in this paper. Hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied on the first dataset and retrieved meaningful clustering results. Association rules algorithm is performed on the second dataset to predict whether a wine is scored above 90 point or not based on the wine savory reviews. 5-fold cross validation experiments are executed based on different parameters and results with a range of 73%~82% accuracy are generated.

Nowadays, most corners of the sentiment analysis research have been investigated while the core and hard parts are not yet intensively explored, among which polarity disambiguation is one. In this research, we propose the integration between two SentiWordNet-based resources on phrase-level polarity disambiguation: (1) its score for the best word sense identified by a word sense disambiguation algorithm and (2) its examples having the non-zero scores of the prior polarities for the related subjectivity lexicon words. The integration of subjectivity lexicon word prior polarities together with Senti-WordNet scores and examples of word contexts were presented as classifier features to reduce the classification disambiguation. Our empirical evaluation is twofold. First, an experimental analysis was intrinsically conducted using various lexical resource settings coupled with feature selection algorithms to improve the classifier contextual subjective and sentiment polarity recognition. Second, the integration was extrinsically applied to improve the opinion question answering ranking task. These evaluations prove the superiority of the proposed integration in comparison with the state-of-the-art seminal work and baselines.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6594-6; POD:978-1-4799-6595-3","10.1109/ICCES.2014.7030934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030934","","Blogs;Filtering","feature selection;natural language processing;pattern classification;question answering (information retrieval)","SentiWordNet-based resources;classification disambiguation reduction;classifier contextual subjective recognition;disambiguation lexical resources;feature selection algorithms;lexical resource settings;opinion question answering ranking task;phrase-level contextual polarity recognition;phrase-level polarity disambiguation;sentiment analysis;sentiment polarity recognition;subjectivity lexicon word prior polarities;word contexts;word sense disambiguation algorithm","","0","","39","","","22-23 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to improve performance, we often increase the number of features. However, the more features are used, the more redundancy and cost are involved correspondingly. Therefore, the number of features we selected for a specified application is a tradeoffs between the accuracy and the cost. In this paper, we model such tradeoffs between accuracy and cost as an optimization problem. Moreover, for investigating this problem, we propose to model the sensing with multiple features under a hypercube structure. In our scheme, each feature of uncertain objects is represented as a component of the vertex's coordinate in hypercube. At the same time, we prefer to define the edges between vertices with relative entropy rather than Euclidean distance. Because the former one could accurately measures the difference between two probability distributions of data. We evaluate our proposed schemes with real data of a crowd sensing recognition case, which are collected by smartphones with sensors.","2155-6806;21556806","Electronic:978-1-4799-6036-1; POD:978-1-4799-6037-8","10.1109/MASS.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7035689","crowdsensing;multiple features;relative entropy;uncertain object","Accelerometers;Accuracy;Compass;Hypercubes;Optimization;Sensors;Vectors","entropy;information retrieval;optimisation;smart phones;statistical distributions","Euclidean distance;crowd sensing recognition;hypercube;mobile crowdsensing application;optimization problem;probability distribution;relative entropy;smart phones","","0","","8","","","28-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, analytics and big data have become key enablers for business and research. However, analytics and archiving happens on separate storage silos. This generates additional costs and inefficiencies when part of archived data needs to be analyzed using batch analytics platforms like Hadoop because a) We need additional storage for data transferred from archive to analytics tier and b) Transfer time costs are incurred due to data migration to analytics tier. Moreover, accessing archived data has high times to first byte, as much of the data is stored in offline media like tapes or spun down disks. We introduce Nakshatra, a data processing framework to run analytics directly on an archive based on offline media. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of its kind available in literature.

To protect data privacy, users have to encrypt the data before outsourcing to the cloud, which makes the data utilization, such as data retrieval, a challenging task. It is thus desirable to enable the search service over encrypted cloud data for supporting effective and efficient data retrieval over a large number of data users and documents in the cloud. Existing approaches on encrypted cloud data search either focus on single keyword search or become inefficient when a large amount of documents are present, and thus have little support for the efficient multi-keyword search. In this paper, we propose a light-weight search approach that supports efficient multi-keyword ranked search in cloud computing system. Specifically, we first propose a basic scheme using polynomial function to hide the encrypted keyword and search patterns for efficient multi-keyword ranked search. To enhance the search privacy, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme which utilizes the secure inner product method for protecting the privacy of the searched multi-keywords. We analyze the privacy guarantee of our proposed scheme and conduct extensive experiments based on the real-world dataset. The experiment results demonstrate that our scheme can enable the encrypted multi-keyword ranked search service with high efficiency in cloud computing.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3512-3; POD:978-1-4799-3513-0; USB:978-1-4799-3511-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036872","","Cloud computing;Cryptography;Indexes;Keyword search;Polynomials;Privacy;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data protection;information retrieval;outsourcing","cloud computing deployment;data outsourcing;data privacy protection;data retrieval;data utilization;encrypted cloud data;encrypted keyword hiding;encrypted multikeyword ranked search service;light-weight search approach;pattern search;privacy guarantee analysis;privacy-preserving ranked multikeyword search leveraging polynomial function;public cloud;real-world dataset;search privacy enhancement;search service;searched multikeyword privacy protection;secure inner product method","","1","","20","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cope with this demand and increasing complexity, diverse ways have been investigated to support the development of robotic systems, i.e., The software systems that control robots. In particular, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a promising solution to organize elements that compose robotic systems and can be used to overcome inherent problems of development in robotics, such as integration of heterogeneous hardware devices and reuse of complex software modules. In this scenario, companies and research institutes have released tools and environments specially focused on the development of robotic systems based on SOA. However, none of these environments provide a mechanism that makes it possible to efficiently catalog and discover the various services available for composing such systems, thus reducing the potential of reuse provided by SOA. This paper presents Robo SeT, a mechanism that supports cataloging and discovery of services for the development of robotic systems. It is based on semantic search and uses a taxonomy of the robotics domain to classify services.

This problem is particularly challenging in the context of networks, which contain different aspects such as the topological structure, content, and user supervision. These different aspects need to be combined effectively, in order to create a holistic similarity function. In particular, while most similarity learning methods in networks such as Sim Rank utilize the topological structure, the user supervision and content are rarely considered. In this paper, a Factorized Similarity Learning (FSL) is proposed to integrate the link, node content, and user supervision into an uniform framework. This is learned by using matrix factorization, and the final similarities are approximated by the span of low rank matrices. The proposed framework is further extended to a noise-tolerant version by adopting a hinge-loss alternatively. To facilitate efficient computation on large scale data, a parallel extension is developed. Experiments are conducted on the DBLP and CoRA datasets. The results show that FSL is robust, efficient, and outperforms the state-of-the-art.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-1-4799-4302-9; POD:978-1-4799-4301-2","10.1109/ICDM.2014.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023323","Content;Link;Network similarity;Supervised matrix factorization;Supervision","Equations;Linear programming;Noise measurement;Optimization;Silicon;Sparse matrices","data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix decomposition;pattern classification;recommender systems","CoRA dataset;DBLP dataset;FSL;data mining application;factorized similarity learning;holistic similarity function;low rank matrices;matrix factorization;parallel extension;sim rank;similarity learning method","","7","","44","","","14-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a broad-topic and ambiguous query it is difficult. Here we Propose a novel approach to infer user search goals by analyzing search engine query logs. A major deficiency of generic search engines is that they follow the “one size fits all” model and are not adaptable to individual users. This is typically shown in cases such as these: Different users have different backgrounds and interests. However, effective personalization cannot be achieved without accurate user profiles. We address the problem of learning the user profile within the user's ongoing behaviors by using the user search. We propose a framework that enables large-scale evaluation of personalized search. User interest is employed in the clustering process to achieve personalization effect. The goal of personalized IR (information retrieval) is to return search results that better match the user intent. First, we propose a framework to discover different user search goals for a query by clustering the proposed feedback sessions. Feedback sessions are get constructed from user click-through logs and can efficiently reflect the information needs of users. Second, we propose an approach to generate pseudo-documents to better represent the feedback sessions for clustering. Most document-based methods focus on analyzing users' clicking and browsing behaviors recorded at the users' clickthrough data. In the Web search engines, clickthrough data are important implicit feedback mechanism from users. An example of clickthrough data for the query ""apple,"" which contains a list of ranked search results presented to the user, which contains identification on the results that was previously clicked by the user. The bolded documents that have been clicked by the user have been ranked.

Information retrieval (IR) is a branch of artificial intelligence that tackles the problem of accessing and retrieving relevant information. The aim of IR is to enable the available data source to be queried for relevant information efficiently and effectively. However, in retrieving relevant information, several methods have been proposed to measure the similarity between the posted query and the articles retrieved.

In such applications, an effective visualization design is one that helps users complete tasks accurately and efficiently, and supports hypothesis generation during open-ended exploration. To evaluate both of these aims in a single study, we developed an approach called layered insight- and task-based evaluation (LITE) that interposes several prompts for observations about the data model between sequences of predefined search tasks. We demonstrate the evaluation method in a user study of four network visualizations for spatiotemporal data in a visual analytics application. Results include findings that might have been difficult to obtain in a single experiment using a different methodology. For example, with one dataset we studied, we found that on average participants were faster on search tasks using a force-directed layout than using our other designs; at the same time, participants found this design least helpful in understanding the data.

Information processing has been the primary goal - whether it was being done manually or using sophisticated devices. Sometimes one gets the feeling that although we are drowning, we are not able to extract useful knowledge. What computing and computers have allowed us to do, over several decades, is to handle large volumes of raw data, in real-time as needed, to infer meaningful knowledge and facilitate decision making through actionable knowledge. This has come about due to various technological advances (both hardware and software) which have tremendously increased our ability to generate, collect, store, and process very large amounts of data. This is true whether it is data on the web, personal data, or data collected by enterprises. In this talk, we first identify the causes (or drivers) that have helped us generate and accumulate large amounts of raw data. Then we overview the earlier approaches for managing data and obtaining information. Finally, we explore potential current approaches for dealing with very large amounts of data that will allow us to filter/fuse/reduce it to obtain actionable knowledge. We present database technology, stream and complex event processing (CEP), mining, and information retrieval & ranking as examples of potential approach that need to be synergistically mixed and matched to achieve the desired outcome.

Liu","Harbin Institute of Technology","IEEE Intelligent Systems","20150204","2015","30","1","36","43","Writing comments on products or news has become a popular activity in social media. The amount of opinionated text available online has been growing rapidly, increasing the need for techniques that can analyze opinions expressed in such text so that reviews can be easily absorbed by users. To date, most techniques depend on annotated corpora. However, existing corpora are almost sentence-level works that ignore important global sentiment information in other sentences. Given the rise of advanced applications, more fine-grained corpora are needed, even at the sentence level. The authors aim to create a fine-grained corpus for Chinese sentiment analysis, and more importantly, explore new sentiment analysis tasks by analyzing the annotated corpus. The proposed fine-grained annotation scheme not only introduces cross-sentence and global sentiment information (such as ""target entity""') but also includes new sentence-level elements (such as ""implicit aspect""). Based on this scheme, this corpus can provide a more fine-grained platform for researchers to study algorithms for advanced applications. In addition, an in-depth analysis on the annotated corpus is made and several important but ignored tasks, such as the target-aspect pair extraction task, are explored, which can give useful hints about future directions.","1541-1672;15411672","","10.1109/MIS.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824679","Chinese;corpus for sentiment analysis;fine-grained;intelligent systems;social media","Mobile handsets;Motion pictures;Performance evaluation;Product design;Sentiment analysis;Social network services;Target recognition;Writing;XML","information retrieval;natural language processing;social networking (online);text analysis","Chinese sentiment analysis;annotated corpora;comment writing;cross-sentence information;fine-grained corpus creation;global sentiment information;implicit aspect;opinion analysis;sentence-level elements;social media;target entity;target-aspect pair extraction task","","2","","23","","20140603","Jan.-Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we generate several Norwegian sentiment lexicons by extracting sentiment information from two different types of Norwegian text corpus, namely, news corpus and discussions forums. The methodology is based on the Point wise Mutual Information (PMI). We introduce a modification of the PMI that considers small ""blocks"" of the text instead of the text as a whole. The rational of this modification is to counter the detrimental effect of the length of the text on the PMI and on the quality of the lexicon. The high computational cost due to the huge amount of textual information to be processed in addition to our modified PMI formula is tackled efficiently by relying heavily on parallelization using Map-Reduce and Mongo DB shards. Movie and product reviews are used to evaluate the generated sentiment lexicons to correctly classify review ratings. The lexicon exhibits a satisfactory performance when evaluated, in particular when considering the context change in the corpuses. In fact, surprisingly enough, sentiment lexicon generated from large News corpus exhibits a satisfactory performance when tested on annotated product and movie reviews despite that the later two have different contexts, bearing similarity to the notion of Transfer Learning [1] reported in the literature. Some suggestions on how to increase the performance are proposed.

For the latter, we adopted the algorithm [18] by Furuya et al., which fuses, for more accurate similarity computation, three kinds of similarities, i.e., Those among sketches, those among 3D models, and those between sketches and 3D models. While the algorithm by Furuya et al. [18] does improve accuracy, it does not scale. We accelerate, without loss of accuracy, retrieval result ranking stage of [18] by embedding its cross-modal similarity graph into Hamming space.

We demonstrate, through numerical experiments, that iterative hard thresholding (IHT) is a practical and effective algorithm for keyword-extraction from large text corpora. In fact, our implementation of IHT can quickly analyze more than 800,000 documents, returning keywords comparable to algorithms solving a Lasso problem-formulation, with significantly less computation time.

In order to help users to get the big picture, an efficient and effective topic detection method is urgent in demand. Considering the sheer scale and rapid evolution of the microblog messages, we investigate a novel method for topic detection in Chinese Microblogs in a given time period. It is composed of two major steps. First, hot terms are extracted by a suffix array structure and a TF*SDF term weighting scheme. Second, based on the extracted hot terms, we calculate their co-occurrence information and then group the terms into clusters that represent topics using an adaptive spectral clustering. Extensive experimental results on real world data demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and efficient for topic detection in Chinese microblogs than existing approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4171-1; POD:978-1-4799-7872-4","10.1109/3PGCIC.2014.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7024566","adaptive spectral clustering;hot term discovery;microblog;topic detection","Adaptation models;Arrays;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Educational institutions;Real-time systems;Time-frequency analysis","Web sites;electronic messaging;information networks;information retrieval;natural language processing;pattern clustering","Chinese microblogging service;TF*SDF term weighting scheme;Weibo;adaptive spectral clustering;co-occurrence information;hot term discovery;information network;microblog messages;suffix array structure;text message;topic detection","","1","","21","","","8-10 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Along with this comes the ""Sparsity Problem"" which also exposes the problem of recommendation systems which are being provided with too little information of user feedback such as likes and views. As a consequent collaborative and knowledge-based filtering algorithms are unable of precise prediction which is causing a decline of the customer satisfaction. If beyond that there also is a lack of metadata, the calculation of similarities through content-based filtering algorithms is likely to fail as well. This paper introduces preference ontologies and how they help to reduce these issues by analyzing external data, in terms of texts from social networks and other web sources. Thereby we introduce a self-designed semantic engine, performing sentiment analysis and semantic keyword extraction.

However, these techniques just expresses the ""Yes or No"" problem, that is, whether the user has permissions to access the corresponding data. In this paper, we investigate the issue of how to provide different granular information views for different users. Our mechanism first constructs the relationship between the keywords and data files based on a Galois connection. And then we exploit data retrieval indexes with variable threshold, where granular data retrieval service can be supported by adjusting the threshold for different users.

We solve the problem by developing novel features that gauge the amount of social interaction, attention disrupting fast-paced content, incorporate music information retrieval features and combine these features with other video content analysis features. This information is then used to determine what content has a positive impact on a child's development. It was found that the low-level features can be used for classification and do have correlation with expertly assigned predefined impact categories. To ensure the validation results are not based on similarities between content, a new model validation technique is developed to ensure that the videos are classified with respect to their impact on development. In addition, we developed a data set of videos that has been classified as having a positive or negative impact on children, based on expert experimental results in the psychological literature. This data set can be used as a benchmark for future research.

"Sponge: A searchable P2P mobile app store using DHTs","M. K. Rahman; M. Y. S. Uddin; N. Shahriar; M. Rahman","","2015 International Conference on Networking Systems and Security (NSysS)","20150219","2015","","","1","6","In this paper we propose a novel searchable P2P content storage for storing mobile apps. In the growing need of storing and distributing huge number mobile apps across large number of users, it has been deemed necessary to think of a storage that leverages enormous amount of content space that common people can share these days. In our proposal, we leverage popular P2P stores, such as standard DHTs, for storing apps. One problem with DTHs is that they support flat names (denoted as keys) for content objects, which do not make content objects searchable by their different attributes. When users look for a certain app in an app store, they do not necessarily look by their unique names, instead by a set of attribute-value pairs (multi-attribute queries). We devise a technique, called predicate hashing, by which we hash these attribute-value pairs into hashed keys that are in turn used to locate corresponding apps from the underlying DHT. By doing this we effectively instrument flat named DHTs into reverse ifndexable content store. To this end, we build Sponge, a Kademlia based P2P app store, and do simulation based experiments to show that Sponge can retrieve content against multi-attribute queries.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8125-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8126-7; POD:978-1-4799-8127-4","10.1109/NSysS.2015.7043531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043531","","Androids;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Payloads;Peer-to-peer computing;Search problems;Standards","content management;file organisation;information retrieval;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing","DHT;Kademlia based P2P app store;Sponge;attribute value pairs;content objects;content retrieval;hashed keys;predicate hashing;reverse ifndexable content storage;searchable P2P content storage;searchable P2P mobile app store;simulation based experiments","","0","","27","","","5-7 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A major problem in such scenarios is the limited labeled knowledge available for learning the user intentions. Furthermore, distances are inherently local, where a single global distance function may not capture the distance structure well. A challenge here is that local distance learning is even harder when the labeled information available is limited, because the distance function varies with data locality. To address these issues, we propose a local metric learning algorithm termed Local Semantic Sensing (LSS), which augments the small amount of labeled data with unlabeled data in order to learn the semantic information in the manifold structure, and then integrated with supervised intentional knowledge in a local way. We present results in a retrieval application, which show that the approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the literature.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-1-4799-4302-9; POD:978-1-4799-4301-2","10.1109/ICDM.2014.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023324","Instance based;Metric learning;Semantic Aware;Semi-supervised;Similarity learning","Context;Data mining;Manifolds;Measurement;Semantics;Symmetric matrices;Vectors","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);search engines","LSS;Web search;data locality;data mining;distance function learning;distance metric;local metric learning algorithm;local semantic distance learning;local semantic sensing;manifold structure;retrieval application;single global distance function;supervised intentional knowledge;user intentions","","2","","36","","","14-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an exclusive-or (XOR) homomorphism encryption scheme to support secure keyword searching on encrypted data. First, this scheme specifies a new data protection method by encrypting the data and randomizing it by performing XOR operation with a random bit-string. Second, this scheme can effectively protect data-in-transit against passive attack such as cipher text analysis due to the randomization. Third, this scheme is lightweight and only requires a symmetric encryption scheme and bitwise operations, which requires processing time in the order of milliseconds.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4093-6; POD:978-1-4799-4092-9; USB:978-1-4799-4094-3","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037795","Cloud storage;Secure searching;XOR-homomorphism encryption","Ciphers;Cloud computing;Electronic mail;Encryption;Servers;Silicon","cloud computing;cryptography;data protection;information retrieval;outsourcing;storage management","XOR homomorphism encryption scheme;bitwise operations;cloud services;computation solution;data access functions;data privacy;data retrieval;data security;data-in-transit protection;enterprise cloud tenants;homomorphic exclusive-or operation enhance secure searching;outsourced cloud data storage;passive attack;random bit-string;secure keyword searching;symmetric encryption scheme","","2","","11","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the high retrieval cost of data used in prediction is a big challenge due to the large amount of users and contents involved. We propose a notion that higher popularity user-generated contents can be predicted by concentrating on fewer but informative users, as we notice the fact that contents generated by those users tend to become popular while that which are generated by the rest users do not. We develop a cost-effective popularity prediction framework to fulfil online prediction. It contains 3 modules: (a) online data retrieving, (b) informative users selection and (c) popularity prediction. A hybrid user selection algorithm and several popularity prediction algorithms/improvements are presented, and their performance are evaluated and compared using (a) the selected users' generated data and (b) all users' generated data, retrieved from Sina Weibo Micro blogger. The best prediction algorithm reaches a 78% accuracy at the time of 24 hours after publishing time when level width Nl equals 500.

This dynamic nature tends to limit the performance of traditional static learning models and dynamic learning strategies must be put forward. In this paper we present a learning strategy to learn with drift in the occurrence of concepts in Twitter. We propose three different models: a time-window model, an ensemble-based model and an incremental model. Since little is known about the types of drift that can occur in Twitter, we simulate different types of drift by artificially time stamping real Twitter messages in order to evaluate and validate our strategy.

While cooperative caching in the Internet has been studied extensively, cooperative caching in MOSNs is a considerably different and challenging problem due to the probabilistic nature of contact among the mobile users in MOSNs. In order to reduce the total access delay, we let the mobile users cooperatively cache these data items in their limited buffer space. We balance between selfishness (caching the data items according to its own preference) and unselfishness (helping other nodes to cache). The friends with higher contact frequency may share similar interests, hence, caching the data items for friend users can lead to some benefit. In this paper, we present a hierarchical cooperative caching scheme, which divides the buffer space into three components: self, friends, and strangers.

Base on previous researches testing result, it could be inferred that each of the methods could be a complement for another method in order to increase system performance. This QA was purposed to gather information from Indonesian Quran Translation. The new architecture was designed to gather relevant documents toward the keywords and be used subsequentially to gather answer candidates by using rule-based method. The initial results indicate that system still restricted with retrieved relevant documents, and caused delivering only 60% correct answers. This achievement is not better than the previous one that used rule-based method only.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7975-2; POD:978-1-4799-7976-9","10.1109/CITSM.2014.7042185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042185","","Educational institutions;Knowledge discovery;Natural languages;Search engines;Semantics;Testing","document handling;knowledge based systems;language translation;question answering (information retrieval)","Indonesian Quran translation;QA system;answer extraction;relevant documents;rule-based question answering system","","1","","18","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since viewers do not have access to the same background metadata as the content owner, they are often frustrated in their own searches. Linked Television is a concept for interlinked TV and Web content within a shared digital ecosystem under the control of the content owner. In this paper, we describe how we implement a prototype for Linked Television using a HbbTV device as main screen communicating with a second screen such as a tablet used by the viewer to easily access and browse information related to what is seen in the TV program.","2166-6814;21666814","Electronic:978-1-4799-6165-8; POD:978-1-4799-6166-5","10.1109/ICCE-Berlin.2014.7034272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034272","HbbTV;TV enrichment;hypervideo;interactive television;second screen","","Internet;digital television;information retrieval;meta data;screens (display)","HbbTV device;Linked Television;TV content owners;TV programs;Web content;background metadata;information access;information browsing;interlinked TV;second screen;shared digital ecosystem","","1","","6","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evolution of the Web, from Web 1.0, where we were consumers of information, to a Web 2.0 where now we are producers and consumers of information, has allowed the Web becomes a huge database and in constant expansion. In these days much of the information published on the Web is published on social media, represented through social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, to name only the most prominent. Each of the media and social networks has its own scheme of operation and different working characteristics, ranging from the length of text that can be used, the use of different forms to identify topics until reaching the reciprocity of relationship between the participants. For example Twitter is a social network where millions of daily messages called Tweets are exchanged, within the message can be used labels, called hashtags, to identify the subject of the message, the message also may include links to other resources that expand the original content or showing interesting information and the relationships between users are represented as non reciprocal relationships named ""Following"". The extraction of information posted on social networks is solved in this research through the use of linked data, that allow retrieving resources and link with other external sources, graphs databases that help represent the working scheme of a social network, and with social network analysis (SNA), technique to discover relevant information that goes beyond the individual properties. The scope of this paper is to use information that is published on Twitter to extract and recommend Open Educational Resources in order to help with the learning process. The results obtained are a set of recommendations on users (identified as experts) and virtual communities (lists of Twitter users) and related events, according to the learning needs described as tags.","0190-5848;01905848","Electronic:978-1-4799-3922-0; POD:978-1-4799-3923-7; USB:978-1-4799-3921-3","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044454","Discovery;Metrics;OER;Recommender;SNA;Twitter;URLs","Data mining;MATLAB;Measurement;Media;Twitter;Uniform resource locators","Internet;computer aided instruction;database management systems;graph theory;information retrieval;recommender systems;social networking (online)","OER recommendation;Open Educational Resources;SNA;Twitter;Web 2.0;graph databases;information discovery;information extraction;learning process;link retrieval;linked data;resource retrieval;social media;social network analysis approach;virtual communities","","2","","28","","","22-25 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our proposed platform, CrowdLabel, a web-based open-source annotation system, was developed for crowdsourcing medical labels from multiple expert and/or non-expert annotators. We describe the platform and an example of use; to improve FQT estimation by creating reference labels against which automated algorithms can be benchmarked. A total of 501, 30s segments were extracted from 15 foetal ECG (FECG) recordings from a private database. 23 volunteers participated in the study and provided a total of 7,307 FQT annotations, which were aggregated using a probabilistic label aggregator (PLA). The best annotator identified by the PLA had a standard deviation in the change of FQT annotations of 13.35 ms and 35.52 ms when labelling FECG with `very good' and `poor' signal quality respectively. The PLA does not require any ground truth to identify the best annotator or annotations. Annotator accuracy was also shown to be a function of objective signal quality measures. The feasibility of the CrowdLabel annotation system for ECG crowdsourcing with an unknown ground truth, as well as the results of the first experiment conducted using such a platform have been demonstrated.","0276-6574;02766574","Electronic:978-1-4799-4347-0; POD:978-1-4799-4372-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7043161","","Abstracts;Biology;Browsers;Electrocardiography","bioelectric phenomena;data mining;database indexing;electrocardiography;information retrieval systems;medical signal processing;outsourcing;paediatrics;patient monitoring","CrowdLabel annotation system;ECG crowdsourcing;FECG recording;FQT annotations;FQT assessment;FQT estimation;PLA-identified annotator;annotator accuracy;automated algorithms;electrocardiogram crowdsourcing;electrophysiology crowdsourcing platform;expertly-labeled public databases;fetal ECG recording;fetal QT assessment;fetal electrocardiogram recording;fetal electrocardiographic monitoring;fetal hypoxia identification;foetal ECG recording;foetal QT assessment;foetal electrocardiographic monitoring;foetal hypoxia identification;medical label crowdsourcing;multiple expert annotators;nonexpert annotators;objective signal quality measures;open-source annotation system;poor signal quality;probabilistic label aggregator;reference labels;segment extraction;time 13.35 ms;time 35.52 ms;web-based annotation system","","0","","8","","","7-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the lack of descriptive metadata extraction makes these proliferated resources underused in the querying process. To overcome these difficulties, the extraction of the semantic metadata of the content and the different structures of an audiovisual document is required. In this paper, we present a method that enables an automatic description of audiovisual documents. This automatic process is mainly based on the use of a multitude of modalities for the description and modeling of audiovisual documents, the standardization of these descriptions in the MPEG-7 standard through its description definition language (DDL) and on the use of semantic web language to link between the audiovisual resources.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4312-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-4311-1; POD:978-1-4799-4310-4","10.1109/ISM.2014.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033031","MPEG 7;Semantic Web;audiovisual document;description;metadata","Context;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia communication;Object oriented modeling;Resource description framework;Semantics;XML","audio-visual systems;information retrieval;meta data;multimedia systems;semantic Web","DDL;MPEG-7 standard;audiovisual document;automatic audiovisual document description;description definition language;descriptive metadata extraction;multimedia retrieval;semantic Web language;semantic multimodalities","","1","","17","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve the performance of hash table based indexing for audio fingerprints, this paper designs and evaluates a hybrid data structure which combines linked list with vector to store the values in the hash table to balance the searching performance and the memory usage. To extend the hash table to cluster environment, three distribution patterns are designed and implemented, and experiments show that the content-oriented distribution pattern is better than the keyoriented distribution pattern. The proposed serialized data layout of the hash table can further improve the searching performance with less memory usage. All the experiments are executed on practical massive data sets including up to 1,000,000 songs, and the results certificate the improvement of the methods proposed.","0098-3063;00983063","","10.1109/TCE.2014.7027344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7027344","Audio fingerprint;hash table;high performance indexing;serialized data layout","Data structures;Fingerprint recognition;Indexing;Layout;Libraries;Servers;Vectors","audio databases;data structures;indexing;information retrieval;pattern clustering","cluster environment;content-oriented distribution pattern;distribution patterns;hash table based indexing;high performance indexing architecture;hybrid data structure;key-oriented distribution pattern;massive audio fingerprint data;memory usage;real-time online audio searching systems;searching performance;serialized data layout","","1","","14","","","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These networks are constantly evolving and it is a good source of information, both explicitly and implicitly. The analysis of Social Network mainly focuses on the aspect of social networking with an emphasis on mapping relationships, patterns of interaction between user and content information. One of the common research topics focuses on the centrality measures where useful information of the connected people in the social network is represented in a graph. In this paper, we employed two link-based ranking algorithms to analyze the ranking of the users: HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search) and PageRank. We constructed Twitter user retweet-relationship graph using 21 days worth of data. Lastly, we compared the ranking sequence of the users in addition to their followers count against the average and also whether they are verified Twitter accounts. From the results obtained, both HITS and PageRank showed a similar trend, and more importantly highlighted the importance of the direction of the edges in this work.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3241-2; POD:978-1-4799-3242-9","10.1109/ICCST.2014.7045007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045007","Big Data;Graph;HITS;PageRank;Social Network;Twitter","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Internet;Search engines;Twitter;Web pages","information retrieval;search engines;social networking (online);user interfaces","Facebook;Google+;HITS;Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search;LinkedIn;PageRank algorithms;Twitter accounts;Twitter users analysis;link-based ranking algorithms;social networking;social networks","","0","","22","","","27-28 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cloud computing is used as a platform where large amount of data or information can be stored (as it has more storage options) easily as a pay per use model. Hence the storage will not deal only with structured document; possibility of unstructured document storage will also be there. In order to compensate that there is a need to move on to unstructured database system which is mongodb. MongoDB (from ""humongous"") is an open source, scalable, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database. Technologies like cloud computing and SaaS(Software as a Service) in cloud are growing rapidly which replaces the exisiting traditional applications. The disadvantage in maintaining, integrating and acquiring traditional softwares are overcome by cloud applications. In this paper initially a static application is deployed into the private cloud environment as an image and its performance is evaluated. In the proposed system a weblog will be created with the features of locating exact source which is retrieved dynamically from web. The dynamic software application is bundled in to image and then deployed in the private cloud environment. In existing system the search was done only based on annotated word but in proposed system the search will be done concept wise meaningfully using Machine Learning techniques. The dynamic retrieval will be done using meta heuristic techniques and performance will be evaluated under private cloud environment. Then comparison will be done between static and dynamic application as the future work.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3834-6; POD:978-1-4799-3698-4","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033788","Automatic Metadata Extraction;Content Search;Locate Source Content;Machine Learning Algorithm;Metaheuristic Technique","Cloud computing;Educational institutions;Electronic publishing;Information services;Semantic Web;Semantics","Web sites;cloud computing;data privacy;database management systems;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","MongoDB;SaaS;Weblog;World Wide Web;cloud computing;database system;document-oriented database;dynamic retrieval;dynamic tracking;machine learning;metaheuristic technique;open source database;private cloud;schema-free database;software as a service;static images","","0","","12","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
