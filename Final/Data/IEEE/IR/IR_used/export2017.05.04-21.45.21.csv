Of it, the first important thing is to effectively represent a text to characterize it as belonging to a specified category based on its content and thus make the following phase of classifier training and using more effective and efficient regarding to the final classification performance. In this paper, an effective and efficient new method called variance-mean based feature filtering method of feature selection to do feature reduction in the representation phase for text classification is proposed. It keeps the best features, and thus improves the final performance, e.g. macro-f1 to 0.92 and simultaneously decreases the computing time for representing the incoming text waiting to be classified dramatically, which is important because it occurs on line and is time-critical. The effectiveness and efficiency are especially obvious when applied to Chinese language text.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527604","Feature filtering;feature reduction;feature selection;text classification;text representation","Computer applications;Electronic mail;Indexing;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Natural languages;Pattern recognition;Text categorization","classification;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","Chinese language text;classifier training;feature selection;information retrieval;text classification;variance-mean based feature filtering method","","7","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To present these references to the designer we choose images as a media support to transmit the relevant information. More precisely we have chosen photographic images to illustrate these references because an image illustrates the graphic part of an architectural concept. For this, in this paper we present a method to organise these references to make them more easily accessible to the designer.

Individuals working in these environments are increasingly permanently connected to rich information resources. An appealing opportunity of these environments is the potential to deliver useful information to individuals either from their previous information experiences or external sources. This information should enrich their life experiences or make them more effective in their endeavours. Information access in ubiquitous computing environments can be made ""context-aware"" by exploiting the wide range context data available describing the environment, the searcher and the information itself. Realizing such a vision of reliable, timely and appropriate identification and delivery of information in this way poses numerous challenges. A central theme in achieving context-aware information access is the combination of information retrieval with multiple dimensions of available context data. Potential context data sources, include the user's current task, inputs from environmental and biometric sensors, associated with the user's current context, previous contexts, and document context, which can be exploited using a variety of technologies to create new and exciting possibilities for information access.","","POD:0-7695-2411-7","10.1109/UDM.2005.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521237","","Biosensors;Image storage;Information resources;Information retrieval;Mood;Pervasive computing;Search engines;Temperature sensors;Ubiquitous computing;Web pages","information retrieval;ubiquitous computing","context data sources;context-aware information access;information delivery;information resources;information retrieval;pervasive computing technology;ubiquitous computing environment","","7","1","19","","","4 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondary structure formation causes a DNA codeword to become less active chemically, thus rendering it useless for the purpose of DNA computing. It also defeats the read-back mechanism in a DNA storage system, so that information stored in such a folded DNA codeword cannot be retrieved. Based on some simple properties of a dynamic-programming algorithm, known as Nussinov's method, which is an effective predictor of secondary structure given the sequence of bases in a DNA codeword, we identify some design criteria that reduce the possibility of secondary structure formation in a codeword. These design criteria can be formulated in terms of the requirement that the Watson-Crick distance between a DNA codeword and a number of its shifts be larger than a given threshold.

Because relational database is widely used for storing data and OWL is the latest standard recommended by W3C, this paper proposes an approach of learning OWL ontology from data in relational database. Compared with existing methods, the approach can acquire ontology from relational database automatically by using a group of learning rules instead of using a middle model.

According to the strong relationship between colors and human emotions, an emotional semantic query model based on image color semantic description is proposed in this study. First, images are segmented into regions through a new color image segmentation algorithm. Then, term sets are generated through a fuzzy clustering algorithm so that colors can be interpreted in semantic terms.

ICM '05.","20051114","2005","","","214","219","This paper presents a method to efficiently recognize 3D objects from 2D images based on feature-based indexing. Object recognition is the identification of correspondences between parts of a current scene and stored views of known objects, using chains of segments or indexing vectors. To create indexed object models, the characteristic model image features are extracted during preprocessing. Feature vectors representing model object contours from several points of view around each object are acquired and stored. At recognition time, the indexing vectors with the highest match probability are retrieved from the model image database, using a search strategy that employs knowledge-based (KB) search criteria. The knowledge-based simplifies the recognition process and minimizes the number of iterations and memory usage. Candidate objects in camera images are matched with the stored set of reference views by probabilistic viewing interpolation. The experimental results indicate that feature-based indexing in combination with a knowledge-based system will be a useful methodology for automatic target recognition (ATR).","","POD:0-7803-8998-0","10.1109/ICMECH.2005.1529255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529255","","Feature extraction;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Object recognition;Pattern recognition;Telerobotics","feature extraction;identification;image matching;interpolation;knowledge based systems;object recognition;probability;robot vision;telerobotics;visual databases","automatic target recognition;camera images;feature-based indexing;image features extraction;image matching;indexed object models;indexing vectors;knowledge-based search criteria;knowledge-based system;model image database;model object contours;object identification;object recognition;pattern recognition;probabilistic viewing interpolation;search strategy;telerobotics","","0","","34","","","10-12 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A pre-emptive cell search mechanism is introduced in order to prevent the corruption of large multimedia item collections due to the limited discrimination obtained from the visual and aural descriptors. In addition to this, the similar items are focused within appropriate cellular structures, which will be the subject to mitosis operations when the dissimilarity emerges as a result of irrelevant item insertions. Mitosis operations ensure to keep the cells in a focused and compact form and yet the cells can grow into any dimension as long as the compactness prevails. The proposed indexing scheme is then optimized for a novel query method, the progressive query, in order to maximize the retrieval efficiency for the user point of view.

An efficient learning approach is proposed using a fuzzy radial basis function network (FRBFN). Conventional binary labeling schemes require a crisp decision to be made on the relevance of the retrieved images. However, user interpretation varies with respect to different information needs and perceptual subjectivity. In addition, users tend to learn from the retrieval results to further refine their information priority. Therefore, fuzzy relevance feedback is introduced in this paper to integrate the users' fuzzy interpretation of visual content into the notion of relevance feedback. Based on the users' feedbacks, an FRBFN is constructed, and the underlying parameters and network structure are optimized using a gradient-descent training strategy. Experimental results using a database of 10,000 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:0-7803-9331-7","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521389","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Fuzzy systems;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Labeling;Radial basis function networks;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;fuzzy neural nets;gradient methods;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;relevance feedback;visual databases;visual perception","CBIR system;FRBFN;content-based image retrieval;fuzzy radial basis function network;fuzzy relevance feedback;gradient-descent training strategy;image database;learning approach;perceptual subjectivity;soft-decision method","","3","","11","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new class of binary maximum distance separable (MDS) array codes which are based on circular permutation matrices are introduced in this paper. These array codes are used for tolerating multiple (≥ 4) disk failures in redundant arrays of inexpensive disks (RAID) architecture. The size of the information part is m × n, where n is the number of information disks and (m + 1) is a prime integer; the size of the parity-check part is m × r, the minimum distance is r + 1, and the number of parity-check disks is r. In practical applications, m can be very large and n ranges from 20 to 50. The code rate is R = n/(n+r). These codes can be used for tolerating up to r disk failures, with very fast encoding and decoding. The complexities of encoding and decoding algorithms are O(rmn) and O(m<sup>3</sup>r<sup>4</sup>), respectively. When r = 4, there need to be 9mn XOR operations for encoding and (9n + 95)(m + 1) XOR operations for decoding.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2005.200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524930","Index Terms- Rabin codes;MDS array codes;RAID;multiple disk failures.","Costs;Decoding;Educational institutions;Galois fields;Government;Information retrieval;Linear code;Parity check codes;Protection;Reed-Solomon codes","RAID;fault tolerance;matrix algebra;parity check codes","MDS array codes;RAID;Rabin codes;XOR operations;binary maximum distance separable array codes;circular permutation matrices;decoding;encoding;information disks;multiple disk failure tolerance;parity-check disks;redundant arrays of inexpensive disks architecture","","24","3","17","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In conventional CBIR systems, it is often observed that visually dissimilar images to the query image are located at high ranking. To remedy this problem, similarity relationship of retrieved results are utilized via dynamic clustering. In the first step of this method, images are retrieved using visual feature such as color histogram, etc. Next, the retrieved images are analyzed using a HACM (hierarchical agglomerative clustering method) and the ranking of results are adjusted according to distance from a cluster representative to a query. This paper shows the experimental results based on MPEG-7 color test images.

ISIT 2005.","20051031","2005","","","1468","1472","Maximum transition run (MTR(j)) constrained systems are used to improve detection performance in storage channels. Recently there has been a growing interest in time-varying MTR (TMTR) systems, after such codes were observed to provide high coding gain for E<sup>n</sup>PR4 channels for n = 2, 3. We investigate TMTR constraints parameterized by a vector, introduce the notion of tightness to classify such constraints and simplify their minimal graph presentations.

We show that for MTR constrained systems with unconstrained positions, the set of sequences restricted to the constrained positions yields a natural TMTR constraint.

A concept lattice is constructed based on the set. From the hasse diagram of concept lattice, an algorithm retrieving rules between user query key words and nonuser query key words is proposed.

They enable scalable wide-area storage and retrieval of information, and will support the rapid development of a wide variety of Internet-scale applications ranging from naming systems and file systems to application-layer multicast. DHT systems essentially build an overlay network, but a path on the overlay between any two nodes can be significantly different from the unicast path between those two nodes on the underlying network. As such, the lookup latency in these systems can be quite high and can adversely impact the performance of applications built on top of such systems. In this paper, we discuss a random sampling technique that incrementally improves lookup latency in DHT systems. Our sampling can be implemented using information gleaned from lookups traversing the overlay network. For this reason, we call our approach lookup-parasitic random sampling (LPRS). LPRS converges quickly, and requires relatively few modifications to existing DHT systems. For idealized versions of DHT systems like Chord, Tapestry, and Pastry, we analytically prove that LPRS can result in lookup latencies proportional to the average unicast latency of the network, provided the underlying physical topology has a power-law latency expansion. We then validate this analysis by implementing LPRS in the Chord simulator. Our simulations reveal that LPRS-Chord exhibits a qualitatively better latency scaling behavior relative to unmodified Chord. The overhead of LPRS is one sample per lookup hop in the worst case. Finally, we provide evidence which suggests that the Internet router-level topology resembles power-law latency expansion. This finding implies that LPRS has significant practical applicability as a general latency reduction technique for many DHT systems. This finding is also of independent interest since it might inform the design of latency-sensitive topology models for the Internet.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2005.857106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1528499","Distributed hash table (DHT);Internet topology;latency expansion;latency stretch;peer-to-peer;random sampling;randomized algorithm","Analytical models;Delay;File systems;Information retrieval;Internet;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Routing;Sampling methods;Unicast","Internet;computer network reliability;file organisation;information retrieval systems;peer-to-peer computing;random processes;sampling methods;table lookup;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;wide area networks","Chord simulator;DHT;Internet;LPRS;application-layer multicast;distributed hash table system;information retrieval;lookup-parasitic random sampling;overlay network;peer-to-peer routing infrastructure;router-level topology;scalability;wide-area storage","","27","","41","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Ontology for the museum domain, based on the CIDOC concept reference model, is being developed as a semantic layer of the architecture. The challenges of developing such a global ontology model and a mapping mechanism between the global schema and data sources of local museums are discussed. Web services technology is employed to integrate heterogeneous and distributed data sources of local museums. An ontology and view based approach is adopted to the design and implementation of a user interface.

This data acquisition rate is a major challenge to the existing data exploitation and dissemination approaches. The lack of content- and semantic-based interactive information searching and retrieval capabilities from the image archives is an impediment to the use of the data. In this paper, we describe a framework we have developed [Intelligent Interactive Image Knowledge Retrieval (I<sup>3</sup>KR)] that is built around a concept-based model using domain-dependant ontologies. In this framework, the basic concepts of the domain are identified first and generalized later, depending upon the level of reasoning required for executing a particular query. We employ an unsupervised segmentation algorithm to extract homogeneous regions and calculate primitive descriptors for each region based on color, texture, and shape. We initially perform an unsupervised classification by means of a kernel principal components analysis method, which extracts components of features that are nonlinearly related to the input variables, followed by a support vector machine classification to generate models for the object classes. The assignment of concepts in the ontology to the objects is achieved automatically by the integration of a description logics-based inference mechanism, which processes the interrelationships between the properties held in the specific concepts of the domain ontology. The framework is exercised in a coastal zone domain.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.847908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522617","Coastal zone;middleware;ontology;support vector machines (SVMs)","Content based retrieval;Data acquisition;Earth;Image retrieval;Impedance;Information retrieval;Kernel;Ontologies;Satellite ground stations;Shape","data acquisition;data mining;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;support vector machines","Earth observation data archives;Intelligent Interactive Image Knowledge Retrieval;artificial satellites;coastal zone;data acquisition;data dissemination;data exploitation;information retrieval;information searching;kernel principal components analysis;knowledge discovery;logics-based inference mechanism;ontology;support vector machines;unsupervised classification;unsupervised segmentation algorithm","","37","","34","","","Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years, kernel-based approach has been a popular choice for the implementation of the relevance feedback based CBIR system. This is largely due to its ability to classify patterns with limited sample data. Since most of the kernel approaches reported have been treating the input as a long flat vector, such arrangement may increase the chances of “polluting” the feature element that uniquely identifies the selected image group. This paper proposes a two layer kernel configuration with an objective to improve the retrieval accuracy. While the performance of the two configurations is similar in certain conditions, the proposed configuration has shown to superior when dominant feature element exists that is capable to uniquely identify the selected image group.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526981","Content-Based Image Retrieval System (CBIR);Kernel Bias Discriminant Analysis (KBDA);Kernel Method;Relevance Feedback","Application software;Content based retrieval;Face recognition;Feedback;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information technology;Kernel;Machine learning","","Content-Based Image Retrieval System (CBIR);Kernel Bias Discriminant Analysis (KBDA);Kernel Method;Relevance Feedback","","1","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Remote sensing applications are used as metrics to evaluate the impact. Double blind test approach was adopted in the evaluation.

Many retrieval systems operated in either uncompressed or compressed domains have been proposed. However, retrieving in multiple domains typically involves full decompression for feature analysis in spatial domain. Common features in different domains are thus worth of investigation for direct image indexing. By employing a common subband filtering model, outputs from JPEG and JPEG2000 can be compared directly without having a full decompression. Despite of high compression, similar translation and rotation invariant features can be extracted from these two domains. Simulation results reveal that JPEG and JPEG2000 compressed images can be searched from one another irrespective of the compression ratio.

In this paper, we proposed a novel framework for image semantic annotation and retrieval. It employs a semantic network as the semantic representation model, and uses the combination of semantic keywords, linguistic ontology and low-level features as the semantic retrieval technique. Through several times of users' relevance feedback, semantic information building is completed constantly and automatically.

The resulting proliferation of 3D models demands for tools supporting their effective and efficient management, including archival and retrieval. In order to support effective retrieval by content of 3D objects and enable retrieval by object parts, information about local object structure should be combined with spatial information on object surface. In this paper, as a solution to this requirement, we present a method relying on curvature correlograms to perform description and retrieval by content of 3D objects. Experimental results are presented both to show results of sample queries by content and to compare-in terms of precision/recall figures-the proposed solution to alternative techniques.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:0-7803-9331-7","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521528","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521528","","Content based retrieval;Costs;Cultural differences;Hardware;Image databases;Information retrieval;Software standards;Software tools;Solid modeling;Videos","authoring systems;electronic data interchange;image sampling;video retrieval","3D authoring tool;3D object retrieval;content sample query;curvature correlogram;data interchange;hardware-software technologies;image model;open standard;spatial information;video retrieval","","7","","15","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The TLQ scheme mainly aims at decreasing retrieval processing time and run-time memory consumption without degrading retrieval results semantically. The scheme contains abstract layers in indexing and retrieval phases, where each indexing layer corresponds to a retrieval layer. The layers are constructed based on transformations for reducing visual frame and feature data dimensions. The proposed TLQ scheme also involves an unsupervised method for eliminating irrelevant media items between the retrieval layers. A two-layer TLQ system is implemented and integrated into MUVIS content-based multimedia indexing and retrieval framework, and its theoretical advantages are verified with dedicated experiments on image and video databases. The experiments reveal that 75% retrieval performance improvement in terms of process time can be achieved depending on transformation parameters.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1529802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529802","content-based indexing and retrieval;query system;retrieval optimization","Content based retrieval;Degradation;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Runtime;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;multimedia communication;transforms","content-based multimedia indexing;transform-based layered query scheme;unsupervised method;visual media retrieval","","1","","9","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web pre-fetching, which can be considered as ""active"" caching, builds on regular Web caching, minimizing further a Web user's access delay. To be effective, however, the pre-fetching techniques must be able to predict subsequent Web access with minimum computational overheads. This paper presents a similarity-based mechanism to support similarity-aware Web document pre-fetching between proxy caches and browsing clients. We first define a set of measures to assess similarities between Web documents, and then propose a multi-cache architecture to cache Web documents based on those similarities. A predictor is developed to support the similarity-aware document pre-fetching algorithm.

The algorithm is implemented in two stages. First, a projected principal components (PPC) transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of and optimally extract geophysical profile information from the cloud-cleared infrared radiance data. Second, a multilayer feedforward neural network (NN) is used to estimate the desired geophysical parameters from the PPCs. For the first time, NN temperature and moisture retrievals are presented using actual microwave and hyperspectral infrared observations of cloudy atmospheres, over both ocean and land (with variable terrain elevation), and at all sensor scan angles. The performance of the NN retrieval method (henceforth referred to as the PPC/NN method) was evaluated using global Earth Observing System Aqua orbits colocated with European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting fields for seven days throughout 2002 and 2003. Over 350,000 partially cloudy footprints were used in the study, and retrieval performance was compared with the AIRS Science Team Level-2 retrieval algorithm (version 3). Performance compares favorably with that obtained with simulated clear-air observations from the NOAA88b radiosonde set of approximately 7500 profiles. The PPC/NN method requires significantly less computation than traditional variational retrieval methods, while achieving comparable performance.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.855071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522614","Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU);Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS);Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS);Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS);Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI);canonical correlations;humidity;hyperspectral;infrared;inversion;microwave;moisture;neural networks (NNs);principal components;retrieval;sounding;temperature","Hyperspectral sensors;Information retrieval;Infrared sensors;Moisture;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Ocean temperature;Statistical analysis;Temperature sensors;Terrestrial atmosphere","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;feedforward neural nets;microwave measurement;moisture measurement;remote sensing","AD 2002 to 2003;AIRS;AMSU;Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit;Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder;Aqua;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder;Crosstrack Infrared Sounder;Earth Observing System;European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting;Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer;atmospheric temperature;canonical correlations;cloudy atmospheres;feedforward neural network;humidity;hyperspectral infrared observation;microwave observation;moisture profiles;projected principal components transform;sounding data","","42","","25","","","Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most traditional PNs recognition systems use lexical resources such as name list, as new names are constantly coming into existence, these are necessarily incomplete. Therefore machine learning methods are used to identify PNs automatically. In the framework of MaxEnt model, semantic and lexical information of surrounding words and word itself acting as atomic features comprises feature templates and forms feature without requiring extra expert knowledge. The test on WSJ of Penn Treebank II shows that this method guarantees high precision and recall, and at the same time it can reduce the quantity of features dramatically, downsize system space consumption, and decrease the time of training and testing, so as to improve the efficiency considerably. The method in this paper can be transformed to identify other specific noun easily because the principle of methods is universal.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527597","Generalized Iterative Scaling;MaxEnt Model;PNs Recognition;machine learning;parameter estimation","Computer science;Electronic mail;Entropy;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Sun;System testing;Training data","computational linguistics;learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;maximum entropy methods","MaxEnt model;PN recognition systems;automatic English proper noun recognition;generalized iterative scaling;machine learning methods;maximum entropy model;parameter estimation","","0","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Methods that work very well for continuous data are often hardly usable with categorical dimensions. Only few methods deal properly with such data, mostly because of the discrete nature of categorical data, which does not translate well into the continuous domains of space and color. Parallel sets is a new visualization method that adopts the layout of parallel coordinates, but substitutes the individual data points by a frequency based representation. This abstracted view, combined with a set of carefully designed interactions, supports visual data analysis of large and complex data sets. The technique allows efficient work with meta data, which is particularly important when dealing with categorical datasets. By creating new dimensions from existing ones, for example, the user can filter the data according to his or her current needs. We also present the results from an interactive analysis of CRM data using parallel sets. We demonstrate how the flexible layout eases the process of knowledge crystallization, especially when combined with a sophisticated interaction scheme.","1522-404X;1522404X","POD:0-7803-9464-X","10.1109/INFVIS.2005.1532139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532139","","Chromium;Computer graphics;Crystallization;Data analysis;Data visualization;Filters;Frequency;Histograms;Information retrieval;Layout","data analysis;data visualisation","categorical dataset;categorical dimension;complex data set;continuous data;customer relationship management;data visualization;discrete categorical data;individual data points;interactive analysis;knowledge crystallization;meta data information;parallel coordinates;parallel sets;visual data analysis","","20","","24","","","23-25 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a novel knowledge based initiative topic search engine called Information Assistant is designed and realized. It breaks through the traditional passive service style of the search engine, and solves the problem of topic information collection and downloading from the Internet. Its design based on the knowledge base raises the precision and the recall of the information retrieval. It also probes into the works of the structure and content mining of Web pages. Experiments prove the efficiency of the search engine.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527339","Authoritative website;Knowledge base;Search engine;Web mining","Databases;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Probes;Search engines;User interfaces;Videos;Web and internet services;Web mining;Web pages","Internet;data mining;information retrieval;search engines","Information Assistant;Internet;Web page mining;information overloading problem;information retrieval;search engine","","1","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new method for the automatic construction of a color palette, which adjusts dynamically its number of colors according to the visual content of the image. The method is based on appropriately segmenting the HSI color space, which is achieved by individually partitioning the histograms associated to each color component. As a result we obtain a hierarchical color palette, which represents the color image with a reduced number of colors.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530153","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1530153","","Histograms;Humans;Image analysis;Image coding;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Quantization;Visual system","image colour analysis;image segmentation","automatic color palette;automatic construction;color image analysis;histogram segmentation;image visual content","","3","4","8","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Using complex linguistic features in context-sensitive text classification techniques","A. K. S. Wong; J. W. T. Lee; D. S. Yeung","Dept. of Comput., Hong Kong Polytech.

Many popular TC models use simple occurrence of words in a document as features. They also commonly assume word occurrences to be statistically independent in their design. Although it is obvious that such assumption does not hold in general, these TC models have been robust and efficient in their task. Some recent studies have shown context-sensitive TC approaches, which take into consideration contexts in the form of word co-occurrences, have been able to perform better in general. On the other hand, there have been many studies in the use of complex linguistic or semantic features instead of simple word occurrences as features for information retrieval and classification tasks. While these complex features may intuitively have more relevance to the tasks concerned, results of these studies on their effectiveness have been mixed and not been conclusive. In this paper we present our investigation on the use of some complex linguistic features with context-sensitive TC method. Our experiment results show some potential advantages of such approach.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527491","Text classification;complex linguistics feature;context-sensitive;semantics","Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Robustness;Text categorization;Text processing","classification;computational linguistics;context-sensitive languages;text analysis","automatic document classification;complex linguistic feature;context-sensitive text classification;learned document feature;semantic feature;word occurrence","","1","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
