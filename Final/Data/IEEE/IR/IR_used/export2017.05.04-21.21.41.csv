The eight papers selected for the special session target convergence of these fields by integrating, for a purpose, what can be disparate disciplines. The integration covers image processing, knowledge representation, information retrieval and semantic analysis. The targeted application scenario involves the processing of input data captured by video-cameras where security is of interest. The work presented in this special session has originated in two large international cooperative projects funded by the European commission under the sixth framework programme of the Information Society Technology (1ST). The mandate and scope of these two projects is very generic embracing several applications that rely on technology for bridging the gap between low-level content descriptions that can be computed automatically by a machine and the richness and subjectivity of semantics in high-level human interpretations of audiovisual media (i.e. the semantic gap).

The database of an automated mapping/facility management (AM/FM) system is used to retrieve the component attributes and the topology process is executed to determine the electrical network configuration and the customers served by each distribution transformer. By using the monthly energy consumption of customers in customer information system (CIS) and the typical daily load patterns of customer classes, the hourly loading profiles of distribution transformers and service zones can be derived to solve the loadings of each primary feeder and lateral. The sensitivity analysis of load demand with respect to the temperature change for each customer class is performed by statistic regression according to the actual customer power consumption and temperature data. The load contribution by each customer class is updated by the corresponding temperature sensitivity and integrated together to form the new load profile of a service district with temperature change. To investigate the temperature effect to the distribution feeder, two of the Taipower distribution feeders are selected for computer simulation. The power demand at each load bus of the distribution feeder is calculated by applying the temperature sensitivity and the three- phase load flow analysis is then executed to find the new feeder loading and power loss with the temperature change.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0111-9; POD:1-4244-0110-0","10.1109/ICPST.2006.321962","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4116253","","Computational Intelligence Society;Databases;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Network topology;Sensitivity analysis;Statistical analysis;Temperature distribution;Temperature sensors","distributed power generation;losses;power consumption;power system management;power transformers;sensitivity analysis","Taipower distribution feeders;automated mapping;customer classes;customer information system;distribution feeder load profiles;distribution transformer;electrical network configuration;facility management;load demand;power consumption;power loss;sensitivity analysis;statistic regression;temperature effect;temperature sensitivity;three-phase load flow analysis","","0","","19","","","22-26 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, image similarities are obtained through a weighted combination of overall similarity fusing global, semi-global and local region-based image level similarities. This fusing approach decreases the impact of inaccurate segmentation and increases retrieval effectiveness as constituent features are of a complementary nature.

Applied to the kidney, the observation of the signal evolution in the cortex of a MR-series gives access to the renal perfusion and filtration. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is in particular the most useful quantitative index of renal function. Since the rapid bolus passage hampers the use of gated sequences, fast sequences have to be employed to enable a data acquisition while free-breathing. As a result, the acquired data contains motion artifacts caused by the respiratory cycle, spontaneous movements and drifts which limit quantitative analysis of the data. Although these problems can in principle be addressed with motion correction algorithms applied in a post processing step, additional challenges arise from the fact that image amplitude changes not only due to motion but also due to the contrast change during bolus passage. This study proposes a 2D region tracking method for retrospective motion correction without sacrificing temporal resolution which addresses the latter point by a preparative learning phase.","1522-4880;15224880","CD-ROM:1-4244-0481-9; POD:1-4244-0480-0","10.1109/ICIP.2006.312999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107160","Image motion analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging","Data acquisition;Data analysis;Filtration;Humans;Image motion analysis;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Motion analysis","biomedical MRI;biorheology;image resolution;image sequences;kidney;medical image processing;motion estimation;tracking","MR glomerular filtration rate analysis;automatic 2D region tracking method;bolus passage;contrast-enhanced dynamic magnetic resonance imaging;data acquisition;functional information retrieval;image sequences;kidney;motion correction;renal function;renal perfusion;respiratory cycle;temporal resolution","","1","","8","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Activity and Attenuation Reconstruction for Positron Emission Tomography Using Emission Data Only Via Maximum Likelihood and Iterative Data Refinement","F. Crepaldi; A. R. De Pierro","Dept. of Appl. Math., Univ. of Campinas","IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","20070212","2007","54","1","100","106","Emission computed tomography reconstruction requires compensation for photon attenuation. The usual way to do this is by performing a transmission scan to reconstruct the attenuation map. An important improvement could be achieved if it is possible to retrieve the attenuation map directly from the activity data. Several approaches have been suggested before to do this by using iterative methods for solving Maximum Likelihood (ML) problems (or Penalized Maximum Likelihood, MAP) that take into account the Poisson nature of the noise. One of the main drawbacks has been that these methods tend to retrieve solutions that generate an undesired `crosstalk' between the attenuation and the activity maps. In this paper, we present a new approach that consists of a combination of a minorizing function algorithm applied to the likelihood function plus the application of an appropriate decreasing multiplicative factor and iterative data refinement.

These pages are often referred to as the hidden Web or the deep Web. Since there are no static links to the hidden Web pages, search engines cannot discover and index such pages and thus do not return them in the results. However, according to recent studies, the content provided by many hidden Web sites is often of very high quality and can be extremely valuable to many users. In this paper, we study how we can build an effective hidden Web crawler that can autonomously discover and download pages from the hidden Web. Since the only ""entry point"" to a hidden Web site is a query interface, the main challenge that a hidden Web crawler has to face is how to automatically generate meaningful queries to issue to the site. We provide a theoretical framework to investigate the query generation problem for the hidden Web and we propose effective policies for generating queries automatically. Our policies proceed iteratively, issuing a different query in every iteration. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of these policies on 4 real hidden Web sites and our results are very promising. For instance, in one experiment, one of our policies downloaded more than 90% of a hidden Web site (that contains 14 million documents) after issuing fewer than 100 queries","","POD:1-58113-876-8","10.1145/1065385.1065407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118522","adaptive algorithm;deep web crawler;hidden web crawling;keyword queries;query selection","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Crawlers;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information systems;Search engines;Software libraries;Web pages","Internet;query formulation;search engines","automatic query generation;digital libraries;hidden Web crawler;hidden Web site;keyword queries;query interface;textual hidden Web content downloading","","33","1","30","","","7-11 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sheer size of these massive-scale semantic graphs prohibits storing the entire graph in memory even on medium- to large-scale parallel architectures. We therefore propose a new graph database, grDB, for the efficient storage and retrieval of large scale-free semantic graphs on secondary storage. This new database supports the efficient and scalable execution of parallel out-of-core graph algorithms which are essential for analyzing semantic graphs of massive size. We have also developed a parallel out-of-core breadth-first search algorithm for performance study. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first of such algorithms reported in the literature.

This means improving decisions and outcomes by making US and coalition forces better informed, more coordinated, faster and more adaptive. Our research focuses on how to architect communications so these goals are reached. We find that the ""smart pull"" approach described in global information grid (GIG) technical guidance can't meet these goals. The principal weaknesses stem from the stateless approach that can't make good use of the operator's context and dynamic information requirements. A better approach must exploit dynamic context and operator requirements to assure that high-value information flows quickly where it's needed (VIRT) and is processed promptly by recipients. Initial studies have shown that this approach reduces the volume of bits by several orders of magnitude. It also raises the productivity of every operator enormously by assuring each can give immediate attention to truly valued information. Because the GIG, NCES, FORCEnet and related initiatives promise to cost billions of dollars and span a decade or more, we believe a change in direction is required to attain the goals of information superiority.

Domain-Specific Search Engine (DSSE) is one of solutions to alleviate such inefficient situation. This paper proposes a new method for building DSSE based on Meta-Search Engine (MSE) on Internet. First, Odds Ratio method is used to refine the domain-specific keywords, which are weighted by means of TF-IDF method. Second, domain query expression is constructed with the keywords by Decision Tree method to reflect the features of domain documents. Combining user's plain query with the domain query expression, the MSE constructs a domain-specific query expression and submits it to General-purpose Search Engines (GSE). The Extended Boolean Model is employed to rank the search results back from the GSE. Finally, the ranked results are returned to the query user. The experiment results show that the proposed domain-specific search method is effective in searching domain documents. The designed DSSE is more simple and efficient than the dedicated domain-specific search engines.","","CD-ROM:7-900718-14-1; POD:7-302-13922-9","10.1109/CESA.2006.313656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4105722","decision tree;domain-specific search engine;extended boolean model;meta-search engine;odds ratio","Decision support systems;Decision trees;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Internet;Metasearch;Search engines;Search methods;Systems engineering and theory;Web pages","","","","0","","","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Services Center, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20070220","2007","45","3","730","745","We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to estimate how much information about atmospheric aerosols could be retrieved from solar-reflected radiances observed over oceans by a satellite sensor as a function of the number of wavelength bands, viewing angles, and Stokes parameters. It is assumed that our virtual satellite sensor can simultaneously perform multispectral, multiangle, and linear polarization measurements of the radiances, and the following quantities are used to vary: aerosol optical thickness, single-scattering albedo (SSA) of aerosol particles, height of the aerosol layer, aerosol model (includes size distribution parameters and optical properties), and wind speed. The real refractive index was kept constant and, therefore, is not part of the analysis. To calculate the number of significant principal components (SPCs), the cumulative percent variance rule is used, which takes into account anticipated errors of measurements. The reported results predict how much additional information can be retrieved from observations by adding more wavelength, angle, and polarization channels. For example, for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments (lambda>0.5 mum), the number of SPCs is two to three; for Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer, three to five; for Polarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectances, five to ten; while for the future Glory/Aerosol Polarization Sensor instrument, it is 6-11 (when using eight out of its > 100 view angles). The ranges reflect view conditions and analysis method. Our calculations show that the observations should be most sensitive to the aerosol model followed in decreasing order by optical thickness, SSA, and aerosol height. We found that there is no systematic increase in the information about aerosol starting from 10-15 view angles for unpolarized observations and 30 view angles for those with linear polarization. It is achievable with modern detectors to retrieve up to 10 and 16 SP- Cs from unpolarized and polarized observations, respectively. The methodology and results of our PCA can be useful for estimating the reliability of aerosol parameters retrieved from existing and future satellite observations","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2006.888138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106074","Aerosols;remote sensing;satellite applications","Aerosols;Information retrieval;Oceans;Optical polarization;Optical refraction;Optical sensors;Optical variables control;Principal component analysis;Remote sensing;Satellites","aerosols;albedo;artificial satellites;atmospheric radiation;light polarisation;principal component analysis;refractive index;remote sensing","Glory/Aerosol Polarization Sensor instrument;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer instruments;Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer;PCA;Polarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectances;Stokes parameters;aerosol model;aerosol optical thickness;aerosol remote sensing;cumulative percent variance rule;oceans;principal component analysis;radiance linear polarization measurements;refractive index;satellite applications;single-scattering albedo;solar-reflected radiances;viewing angles;virtual satellite sensor;wavelength bands;wind speed","","17","","41","","","March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In-depth analysis of findings from interviews, focus groups and observations of 150 users have identified three stages to this journey: information initiation, facilitation (or gathering) and interpretation. The study shows that, although digital libraries are supporting aspects of users' information facilitation, there are still requirements for them to better support users' overall information work in context. Users are poorly supported in the initiation phase, as they recognize their information needs, especially with regard to resource awareness; in this context, interactive press-alerts are discussed.

The new challenge is to establish the basis for semantic web services that are able to be organized into a chain which satisfies the desired user functionality.

The annotation process uses a multi-modal thesaurus that is built from a large collection of training images by learning associations between low-level visual features and keywords. We assume that a collection of images is available and that each image is globally annotated. The objective is to extract representative visual profiles that correspond to frequent homogeneous regions, and to associate them with keywords. These labeled profiles would be used to build a multi-modal thesaurus that could serve as a foundation for region based annotation. Our approach has two main steps. First, each image is coarsely segmented into regions, and visual features are extracted from each region. Second, the regions are categorized using a novel algorithm that performs clustering and feature weighting simultaneously. As a result, we obtain clusters of regions that share subsets of relevant features. Representatives from each cluster and their relevant visual and textual features would be used to build a thesaurus. The proposed approach is trained with a collection of 2695 images and tested with several different images.","1522-4880;15224880","CD-ROM:1-4244-0481-9; POD:1-4244-0480-0","10.1109/ICIP.2006.312633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4106689","Clustering;Image Annotation;Visual Dictionary;feature weighting","Clustering algorithms;Color;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Prototypes;Shape;Testing;Thesauri","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image representation;image segmentation;image texture;thesauri;unsupervised learning;visual databases","color image segmentation;feature weighting;image clustering;multimodal thesaurus;region based image annotation;textual feature;training image;unsupervised approach;visual feature extraction;visual profile representative","","2","","13","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is based on matching teeth contours using hierarchical Chamfer distance. The proposed technique has two main stages: feature extraction, and teeth matching. During retrieval, according to a matching distance between the AM and PM teeth, AM radiographs that are most similar to a given PM image, are found and presented to the user.

This paper is aimed at resolving the unencoded character problem with a practical and composite approach for Chinese digital libraries. The proposed approach consists of the glyph expression model, glyph structure database, and supporting tools. With this approach, the following problems can be resolved. First, the extensibility of Chinese characters can be preserved. Second, it would be as easy to generate, input, display, and search unencoded characters as existing ones. Third, it is compatible with existing encoding schemes that most computers use. This approach has been utilized by organizations and projects in various application domains including archeology, linguistics, ancient texts, calligraphy and paintings, and stone and bronze rubbings. For example, in Academia Sinica, a very large full-text database of ancient texts called Scripta Sinica has been created using this approach. The Union Catalog of National Digital Archives Project (NDAP) dealt with the unencoded characters encountered when merging the metadata of 12 different thematic domains from various organizations.

Moreover the peer-to-peer (P2P) approach circumvents many problems of the client-server approach and offers an attractive alternative to exchange services over networked nodes. In this paper we first examine issues related to service provisioning systems. Then we present the design and the implementation of a platform allowing users to share contents like services in a P2P network. The platform is composed of a set of modules that provide means to advertise contents and discover others available on the network.

In the method, polygons are represented by a sequence of distance vectors ordered in a predefined cyclic way. Each vector is composed of two primitives which are radial distance from the centroid to a vertex and the following edge distance in a specified direction.

This fosters the adoption of grid computing platforms by not only scientific research society, but also commercial enterprises. However, despite the existing technical catalysts and commercial needs, up till now, almost all research efforts are focused on using grids within academic community and the adoption of grid technology by commercial companies is still slow. We proposed a grid market framework to build commercial grid market and support the commercialization of grid, for organizations to share resources for profit. Such a framework is essential if the grid is going to evolve from its current experimental status into professional or commercial use. In such a grid market environment, the monitoring of the grid services is an important part for service status retrieval and information feedback, but it remains challenging in that the metrics for grid services are not well defined yet and existing metrics need to be revised or new metrics need to be introduced. Performance is still one of the major concerns in grid service market, and a lot of non-performance related issues are still open to be explored and few works has been done on them. In this paper, we mainly present a grid service monitoring architecture for the grid market environment.

Large digital libraries containing citation information can reduce maintenance costs and provide new services through efficient online processing of citation data, resolving document citation relationships as new records become available. Additionally, information found in citations can be used to supplement document metadata, requiring the generation of a canonical citation record from merging variant citation subfields into a unified ""best guess"" from which to draw information. Citation information must be merged with other information sources in order to provide a complete document record.

With the growing importance of mapping land, regions, and their related features, geographic information systems (GIS) has become an ever important standard in fields where such detailed study of land features is required. Here, we draw on the Space aspect of the 5S meta-model for digital libraries and demonstrate a methodology used to integrate archaeological GIS data with the wealth of information within ETANA-DL. ETANA GIS connects the digital library's textual records with a spatial representation of their original locations, enhancing users' understanding of the finds. Using a dataset of the University of Toronto's Tell Madaba excavation project we developed an interactive, Web-based representation of the original ArcGIS document. For dynamic generation of maps from geospatial data, we use the MapServer project, a mature, project which boasts a rich toolset of features for cartographic related image generation. MapServer can directly utilize ArcGIS layer resources but some translation and additional authoring must occur for proper image generation. Then, using PHP, the MapScript MapServer API, and navigation tools, the map was ported to an interactive, Web-accessible format. Based on a study of alternatives, the technology we chose for our technique seemed to be the best suited for digital library integration and is also completely open source.

To realize the efficient rendering of terrain, this paper presents an out-of-core terrain visualization method based on multi-resolution storage techniques. In external memory, the terrain data set is subdivided from top to bottom to build a multi-resolution hierarchical structure based on a quad-tree. The hierarchical structure can decimate the elevation data that must be loaded into internal memory. Thus it can improve the efficiency of I/O access greatly. Moreover, in order to implement rapid data retrieval of the real time terrain flyover, an efficient indexing algorithm is proposed, in which those nodes in the hierarchical structure will be divided into several clusters in terms of the similarities of static error and the closed space constraint. In addition, a method for crack-free is also proposed here. The comprehensive experiment conducted on the GTOP30 data set shows that this approach outperforms the Block and the Hierarchy algorithms in the both ways of efficiency and simplification ratio.","","POD:0-7695-2754-X","10.1109/ICAT.2006.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4089207","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Costs;Data structures;Data visualization;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Partitioning algorithms","data visualisation;information retrieval;pattern clustering;quadtrees;rendering (computer graphics);terrain mapping","clustering algorithm;internal/external memory;large scale out-of-core terrain visualization;multiresolution hierarchical structure;multiresolution storage technique;quad tree hierarchical structure;terrain rendering","","2","","18","","","Nov. 29 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the context of middleware systems, new algorithms to answer top-k queries have been recently proposed. Among these, the threshold algorithm (TA) is the most well-known instance due to its simplicity and memory requirements. TA is based on an early-termination condition and can evaluate top-k queries without examining all the tuples. This top-k query model is prevalent not only over middleware systems, but also over plain relational data. In this work, we analyze the challenges that must be addressed to adapt TA to a relational database system. We show that, depending on the available indices, many alternative TA strategies can be used to answer a given query. Choosing the best alternative requires a cost model that can be seamlessly integrated with that of current optimizers.

Bibliometric indicators have been extensively studied, mostly in the context of journals. However, journal-based metrics poorly capture topical distinctions in fast-moving fields, and are increasingly problematic with the rise of open-access publishing. Recent developments in latent topic models have produced promising results for automatic sub-field discovery. The fine-grained, faceted topics produced by such models provide a clearer view of the topical divisions of a body of research literature and the interactions between those divisions. We demonstrate the usefulness of topic models in measuring impact by applying a new phrase-based topic discovery model to a collection of 300,000 computer science publications, collected by the Rexa automatic citation indexing system","","POD:1-59593-354-9","10.1145/1141753.1141765","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4119099","data curation;harvesting;meta-search;search and retrieval protocols;subject portals;web services","Bibliometrics;Computer science;Context awareness;History;Indexing;Information retrieval;Permission;Publishing;Software libraries;Text processing","digital libraries;information analysis","Rexa automatic citation indexing system;automatic subfield discovery;bibliometric indicators;computer science publications;journal-based metrics;open-access publishing;phrase-based topic discovery model;scientific digital library collections;topic analysis","","4","","27","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CBR has a hierarchical structure, cases in abstract level present the general characters of black-start, cases in the detail level include the restoration operations of the plants and substation in the subsystem. Conventional CBR system have had limited in revising ability. We developed ""path finding"" and ""generation ability dispatch"" algorithms for detail level case revising, and used qualitative process theory (QPT) to revise the abstract cases, the qualitative process model of black-start also can act as an explaining tool.

Some key techniques are proposed in this paper, such as identifying whether or not the style of document is dialogue, identifying all of questions and their corresponding answers and linking them to form question-answer pairs. Due to the interactive nature of dialogue documents, local regions of coherence often stretch across different speakers. An approach to automatically identify those regions of local coherence is presented. Firstly, we identify all question paragraphs in a given document. Secondly, we detect the answer paragraphs of each question paragraph and exploit text segmentation to form question-answer pairs. Lastly, we extract some sentences from the generic content and the question-answer pairs to generate a complete summary. Experimental results show that our approach is high efficient and improves significantly the coherency of the summary while not compromising informativeness","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0529-7; POD:1-4244-0528-9","10.1109/ICIA.2006.306009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4097942","Automatic text summarization;Coherency;Dialogue style;Question-answer pairs;Text segmentation","Biomimetics;Computer science;Content addressable storage;Data mining;Information retrieval;Internet;Joining processes;Logic programming;Machine intelligence;Natural languages","information retrieval systems;interactive systems;text analysis","automatic text summarization;dialogue style documents;question-answer pairs;text segmentation","","0","","10","","","20-23 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the question remains on whether the same techniques that are used on the Web can be applied to collections of documents containing citations between scientific papers. In this work we present a comparative study of digital library citations and Web links, in the context of automatic text classification. We show that there are in fact differences between citations and links in this context. For the comparison, we run a series of experiments using a digital library of computer science papers and a Web directory. In our reference collections, measures based on co-citation tend to perform better for pages in the Web directory, with gains up to 37% over text based classifiers, while measures based on bibliographic coupling perform better in a digital library. We also propose a simple and effective way of combining a traditional text based classifier with a citation-link based classifier. This combination is based on the notion of classifier reliability and presented gains of up to 14% in micro-averaged F1 in the Web collection. However, no significant gain was obtained in the digital library. Finally, a user study was performed to further investigate the causes for these results. We discovered that misclassifications by the citation-link based classifiers are in fact difficult cases, hard to classify even for humans","","POD:1-59593-354-9","10.1145/1141753.1141766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4119100","digital libraries;links;text classification;web directories","Computer science;Gain measurement;Humans;Information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Performance gain;Permission;Software libraries;Text categorization;Web pages","Internet;citation analysis;classification;digital libraries;text analysis","Web collection;citation analysis;digital library;document classification;text classification","","3","","29","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the recovery purpose, there are already some motion capture systems commercially available. They are, however, still not very convenient for common use because of camera calibration and the use of artificial markers attached on a human whose 3D positions are tracked. Unlike these existent systems, the proposed technique employs neither camera calibration nor markers. Instead it employs a database that describes human actions and, once an unknown action is captured, the technique performs 3D recovery by retrieving a similar action in the database. The database is created employing an eigenspace method, since the method reduces image information effectively as well as it assumes less amount of image preprocessing. The proposed technique was examined its performance by the experiment for recovering some basic human actions and the result was satisfactory","","CD-ROM:89-950038-5-5; POD:89-950038-4-7","10.1109/SICE.2006.315116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4108102","3-D recovery;Avatars;Eigenspace;Human actions;Motion capture","Avatars;Biological system modeling;Calibration;Cameras;Computer vision;Control engineering;Humans;Image databases;Image sequences;Information retrieval","computer vision;image sequences;solid modelling","3D human action;camera calibration;computer vision system;database;eigenspace method;image preprocessing;motion capture system;video image","","0","","9","","","18-21 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
