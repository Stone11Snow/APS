It deals with retrieval of information in a specified language that is different from the language of user's query. In this paper, an improved English-Hindi based CLIR is proposed. There are various un-noticed domains in this broad research area that are required to be worked upon in order to improve the performance of an English-Hindi based CLIR. Not much research effort has been put up to improve the searching and ranking aspects of CLIR systems, especially in case of English-Hindi based CLIR. This paper focuses on applying algorithms like Naïve Bayes and particle swarm optimization in order to improve ranking and searching aspects of a CLIR system. We matched terms contained in documents to the query terms in same sequence as present in the search query to make our system more efficient. Along with this our approach also makes use of bilingual English-Hindi translator for query conversion in Hindi language. Further, we use Hindi query extension and synonym generation which helps in retrieving more relevant results in an English-Hindi based CLIR as compared to existing one. Both of these techniques applied to this improved approach gives user a change to choose more appropriate Hindi query than just by using the single translated query and hence improving overall performance.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7946-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7948-9; POD:978-1-4673-7949-6","10.1109/IC3.2015.7346706","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346706","Cross Language Information Retrieval;document ranking;multilingual;n-gram;searching","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Dictionaries;Indexing;Particle swarm optimization;Web sites","language translation;natural language processing;particle swarm optimisation;query processing","CLIR;English-Hindi based cross language information retrieval system;Hindi query extension;bilingual English-Hindi translator;naïve Bayes;particle swarm optimization;query conversion;query terms;ranking aspects;searching aspects;synonym generation;unnoticed domains","","","","15","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is also growing interest in using them during and after natural or artificial disasters. As they are easily accessible and easy to use, such platforms can deliver efficient information that can provide better conditional awareness for emergency response. On the other hand, different types of media agencies including newspapers, TV channels and FM radios share information in social media. Sometimes, such media agencies post in online social network (OSN) (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and ask users' feedback through comments. They also declare some lucrative facilities for a user who give maximum comments to that post or contact directly to the users who give qualitative comments. In case of a live reality shows in TV channels, they ask votes from viewers for a fixed set of candidates within very limited times. As a result, in a few minutes, more than 1,000 comments are found in such posts which is really difficult to stream and retrieve some information at the same time. In this paper, we show data pattern of social media during and after disasters as well as live programs. We also discuss two new problems of media agencies, analyze some scenarios and propose novel solution for each of the problem.

Experiments were performed from which relevance feedback and user queries were captured from 35 users on 20 predefined simulated enterprise search tasks. The captured data set was used to develop the three types of profiles and train the fuzzy system. The system shows 86% performance accuracy in correctly classifying document relevance.

A lot of search results that corresponding to a user's query are not relevant to the user need. Most of the page ranking algorithms use Link-based ranking (web structure) or Content-based ranking to calculate the relevancy of the information to the user's need, but those ranking algorithms might be not enough to provide a good ranked list. So, in this paper we proposed an Efficient Hybrid Usage-based Ranking Algorithm called EHURA. EHURA was applied to 1033 English Corpus to measure its performance.

This is even more drastic for small-sized companies which are suffering from a lack of hardware resources and limited budgets. In such a circumstance, reducing index size is of paramount importance as it is to maintain the accuracy of retrieval. One of the primary ways to reduce the index size in text processing systems is to remove stop-words, frequently occurring terms which do not contribute to the information content of documents. Even though there are manually built stop-word lists almost for all languages in the world, stop-word lists are domain-specific; in other words, a term which is a stop-word in a specific domain may play an indispensable role in another one. This paper proposes an aggregated method for automatically building stop-word lists for Persian information retrieval systems. Using part of speech tagging and analyzing statistical features of terms, the proposed method tries to enhance the accuracy of retrieval and minimize potential side effects of removing informative terms. The experiment results show that the proposed approach enhances the average precision, decreases the index storage size, and improves the overall response time.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6506-2; POD:978-1-4673-6507-9","10.1109/KBEI.2015.7436031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436031","Index Size Reduction;Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;Part of Speech Tagging;Stop-words","Decision support systems;Indexes;Natural language processing;Speech;Speech processing;Tagging","information resources;information retrieval;natural language processing;search engines;text analysis","POS information;PSWG;Persian information retrieval systems;automatic stop-word list generator;document information content;hardware resources;part of speech tagging;search engines;similarity function;small-sized companies;statistical features analyzing;text materials;text processing systems","","","","19","","","5-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MapReduce, has recently emerged as a popular framework for extensive data analytics. Use of powerful indexing techniques would allow users to significantly speed up query processing among MapReduce jobs. Currently, there are a number of indexing techniques like Hadoop++, HAIL, LIAH, Adaptive Indexing etc., but none of them provide an optimized technique for text based selection operations. This paper proposes two indexing approaches in HDFS, namely LIndex and HIndex. These indexing approaches are found to carefully perform selection operation better compared to existing Lucene index approach. A fast retrieval technique is suggested in the MapReduce framework with the new LIndex and HIndex approaches. LIndex provides a complete-text index and it informs the Hadoop implementation engine to scan only those data blocks which contain the terms of interest. LIndex also enhances the throughput (minimizes response time) and overcome some of the drawbacks like upfront cost and long idle time for index creation. This gave a better performance than Lucene but lacked in response and computation time. Hence a new index named HIndex is suggested. This scheme is found to perform better than LIndex in response and computation time.","2161-5322;21615322","Electronic:978-1-4799-7100-8; POD:978-1-4799-7101-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2014.7073217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073217","Complete-text indexing;HIndex;Hadoop;LIndex;Lucene;MapReduce","Ecosystems;Engines;Indexing;Time factors;Trojan horses","Big Data;indexing;parallel processing;query processing;text analysis","Big Data analysis;HAIL;HDFS;HIndex;Hadoop implementation engine;Hadoop++;LIAH;LIndex;Lucene index approach;MapReduce framework;Web-based application;adaptive indexing;biological network;cloud database community;computation time;data analytics;data block;geographical information;indexing technique;information retrieval;query processing;retrieval technique;social media;text based selection operation;unstructured data processing","","1","","13","","","10-13 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information retrieval technologies can help to obtain the users' needed information automatically. However, it is a great challenge to apply these technologies to biomedicine domain directly because of some domain specific characteristics, such as the abundance of terminologies. To enhance the effectiveness of the biomedical information retrieval, we propose a novel framework based on the state-of-the-art information retrieval methods, called learning to rank, which has been proved effective to rank documents based on their relevance degree. In the framework, we attempt to tackle the problem of the abundance of terminologies by constructing ranking models, which focus on not only retrieving the most relevant documents but also diversifying the searching results to increase the completeness of the resulting list for a given query. In the model training, we propose two novel document labeling strategies, and combine several traditional retrieval models as learning features. Besides, we also investigate the usefulness of different learning to rank approaches in our framework. Experimental results on TREC Genomics datasets demonstrate our proposed framework is effective in improving the performance of biomedical information retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6799-8; POD:978-1-4673-6800-1","10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359729","biomedical information retrieval;diversity;learning to rank","Bioinformatics;Diversity methods;Genomics;Resource management;Smoothing methods;Terminology","bioinformatics;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing","TREC genomics datasets;biomedical information retrieval;biomedicine;document labeling strategies;documents ranking;information retrieval technologies;learning features;learning to rank;query;ranking models;relevance degree;relevant document retrieval","","","","29","","","9-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, running large regression suites can be costly. Researchers have developed several techniques for prioritizing tests such that the higher-priority tests have a higher likelihood of finding bugs. A vast majority of these techniques are based on dynamic analysis, which can be precise but can also have significant overhead (e.g., for program instrumentation and test-coverage collection). We introduce a new approach, REPiR, to address the problem of regression test prioritization by reducing it to a standard Information Retrieval problem such that the differences between two program versions form the query and the tests constitute the document collection. REPiR does not require any dynamic profiling or static program analysis. As an enabling technology we leverage the open-source IR toolkit Indri. An empirical evaluation using eight open-source Java projects shows that REPiR is computationally efficient and performs better than existing (dynamic or static) techniques for the majority of subject systems.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4799-1934-5; POD:978-1-4799-1935-2","10.1109/ICSE.2015.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7194580","Information Retrieval;Regression Testing;Test Prioritization","Information retrieval;Natural languages;Open source software;Software engineering;Standards;Testing","information retrieval;program debugging;program testing;public domain software;system monitoring","REPiR;bugs;dynamic analysis;information retrieval approach;open-source IR toolkit Indri;open-source Java projects;program changes;regression suites;regression test prioritization;regression testing","","3","","67","","","16-24 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The information retrieval techniques commonly used are based on keywords, wherein provided keyword list doesn't consider the semantic relationship between keywords nor it consider the meaning of words and phrases. With such system, users frequently have problems expressing their information needs and translation those needs into requests. To overcome the limitations of keyword-based information retrieval, one must think of introducing conceptual knowledge to information retrieval which will help users to formulate their request. The semantic knowledge attached to information is united by means of ontologies. The mapping of concepts in information into conceptual models i.e. ontology appears to be useful method for moving from keyword based to concept based information retrieval.

While the first approach has had limited success due to problems in concept identification, there is a serious loss in precision with the second approach. In this paper, we propose a flexible matching approach by considering a concept expression as a phrase, which can be matched strictly, or in some variant forms by allowing some flexibility in position and order. Such flexibility is naturally indicated by the great variations to express concepts in this area. In addition, we also incorporate synonym expressions in the matching process.

Private information retrieval (PIR) tackles this potential privacy violation by allowing users to retrieve the wth record of a database without revealing w to the server. However, most known PIR schemes are either very inefficient (and therefore unlikely to gain traction in a practical sense) or reliant on some restrictive assumptions. In this paper, we consider an efficient class of schemes called multi-server PIR. Multi-server PIR assumes that the client communicates with multiple, non-colluding servers, each possessing an identical copy of the database. Significant prior work has gone towards relaxing the anti-collusion assumption, but the literature does not address the assumption that servers store perfectly-synchronized databases. This seems implausible, especially if servers are not meant to collude. We propose the first multi-server PIR scheme to return the desired record even when servers' databases are not perfectly synchronized. Our scheme asymptotically has the same computational and communication complexity as state-of-the-art PIR schemes for synchronized databases; this comes at the expense of probabilistic success and two rounds of communication (most existing schemes require only one).

Most of the search engines are ranking their search results in response to users queries to make their search navigation easier. This paper also explores agent based weighted page ranking algorithms for web content mining to retrieve more relevant information. The proposed extended Page Rank algorithm is Agent based Weighted Page Rank Algorithm. The Agent assigns larger rank values to more important pages instead of dividing the rank value of a page evenly among its content.

Today, we have the technology to deploy data collection and retrieval systems all the way from mission headquarters down to the lowest levels of echelon. Due to the lower echelons proximity to the adversary, protecting the information is one of the most important issues in designing such systems. In this paper, we describe a secure distributed storage scheme to be used especially at and near the tactical edge. The scheme does so through a peer-to-peer overlay and storage protocol designed to run on existing networked systems. We utilize a structured overlay that is dynamically organized in a layered, hierarchical manner based on the existing military command structure (e.g. fire-team, squad, battalion, etc.). These layers are used as storage sites for pieces of data near the layer at which that data is needed. The data is generated and distributed via an information dispersal algorithm (IDA) utilizing an erasure code such as the common Cauchy Reed-Solomon (RS). Through the use of this IDA, the data pieces are organized across neighboring layers to maximize locality. This organization also prevents a compromise within one layer from compromising data in that layer. Multiple layers would have to be compromised for a single datum to become compromised. As a result, both security and survivability of the data is improved compared to the typical remote server-client model. We present an overview of this approach along with our experimental results on hardware performance of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) mobile devices. The recorded overhead (encoding/ decoding times and associated data sizes) show that such a scheme can be utilized with little increase in overall latency.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0073-9; POD:978-1-5090-0074-6","10.1109/MILCOM.2015.7357419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357419","distributed storage;erasure codes;information dispersal algorithms;peer-to-peer overlay;tactical networks","Cryptography;Generators;Logic gates;Peer-to-peer computing","information retrieval;military communication;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","Cauchy Reed-Solomon;commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices;data collection;echelons proximity;erasure code;information dispersal algorithm;information dissemination;information retrieval;layered hierarchical manner;military command structure;mission headquarters;networked systems;peer-to-peer overlay;remote server-client model;secure distributed storage;storage protocol;storage sites;structured overlay;tactical assets;tactical edge","","","","13","","","26-28 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DASyR is our solution to annotating published papers for the purpose of ontology population. For domains where dictionaries are not existing or inadequate, DASyR relies on a semi-automatic annotation bootstrapping method based on positional Random Indexing, followed by traditional Machine Learning algorithms to extend the annotation set. We provide an example of the method application to a subdomain of Computer Science, the Information Retrieval evaluation domain. The reliance of this domain on large scale experimental studies makes it a perfect domain to test on.

The rationale behind this is based on the assumption that not all portions of a generic audio signal contribute toward deriving specific descriptive categories (semantic words and onomatopoeias in this work). Detecting the non-salient regions in the audio can hence lead to more robust mapping of signal to categorical descriptions. Using the latent perceptual indexing (LPI) based framework, we propose to remove the proposed acoustic stopwords from the extracted acoustic features, which may include little information on descriptive categories. The acoustic stopwords are selected based on data-driven frequency-related measurements such as document frequency (DF) and inverse document frequency (IDF). The empirical results with BBC sound effect library show that removing acoustic stopwords based on the IDF measurement improves the audio classification performance especially for onomatopoeic labels.","2219-5491;22195491","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096671","acoustic stopwords;audio information retrieval;unstructured audio","Acoustic measurements;Acoustics;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;Semantics;Text processing","audio signal processing;information retrieval","acoustic stopwords;audio classification;inverse document frequency;latent perceptual indexing;robust signal mapping;unstructured audio information retrieval","","0","","13","","","23-27 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Incomprehensible documents are of little utility to readers even if they are relevant. However, for many difficult queries such as technical ones, the topically relevant documents tend to be characterized by poor comprehensibility. This makes it difficult for users to satisfy their information needs when searching for documents about difficult topics. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to search for documents that explain query topics and are easy to understand for average users. In particular, we measure the comprehensibility and the relevance of documents based on the concept of Query Domain Graph constructed from Wikipedia articles related to the query. For estimating document comprehensibility we use the frequency and density of difficult terms within documents as well as we utilize graph-based document representation. We then propose retrieval techniques that balance the relevance and comprehensibility based on the concept of difficult word substitution, in which difficult words are replaced by the sets of easy and related words.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9618-9; POD:978-1-4673-9619-6","10.1109/WI-IAT.2015.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396771","","Data mining;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Search engines;Web pages","Web sites;document handling;graph theory;query processing","Wikipedia articles;comprehensibility-relevance trade-off;difficult word substitution;document comprehensibility estimation;document searching;graph-based document representation;incomprehensible documents;information needs;information retrieval;query domain graph;query topics","","","","13","","","6-9 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method is interesting for several reasons. Personalized information related to the users' profiles to enrich the query should be considered since it is entirely appropriate and justified to improve traditional IR systems. Moreover, this idea has been little exploited for IR systems in Arabic. In addition, the coupling between information from the user's profiles and that contained in the ontologies is also an original and interesting track to develop.

To help developers focus their attention to those files is crucial. Several existing automated approaches for bug localization from a bug report face a key challenge, called lexical mismatch, in which the terms used in bug reports to describe a bug are different from the terms and code tokens used in source files. This paper presents a novel approach that uses deep neural network (DNN) in combination with rVSM, an information retrieval (IR) technique. rVSM collects the feature on the textual similarity between bug reports and source files. DNN is used to learn to relate the terms in bug reports to potentially different code tokens and terms in source files and documentation if they appear frequently enough in the pairs of reports and buggy files. Our empirical evaluation on real-world projects shows that DNN and IR complement well to each other to achieve higher bug localization accuracy than individual models. Importantly, our new model, HyLoc, with a combination of the features built from DNN, rVSM, and project's bug-fixing history, achieves higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art IR and machine learning techniques. In half of the cases, it is correct with just a single suggested file.

This limitation may be overcome by a new web architecture known as semantic web which overcome the limitation of keyword based search technique called conceptual or semantic search technique. Natural language processing technique is mostly implemented in QA system for asking user's question and several steps are also followed for conversion of questions to query form for getting an exact answer. In conceptual search, search engine interprets the meaning of user's query and the relation among the concepts that documents contains with respect to a particular domain that produces specific answers instead of giving list of answers. In this paper, we proposed ontology based semantic information retrieval system and Jena semantic web framework in which, user enters an input query which is parsed by Standford Parser then triplet extraction algorithm is used.

It is necessary to understand a concept by not reading one data but summarizing large data. Therefore, the features in the vector space model should be generate from data set corresponding to represent a certain thing.

It becomes a challenge to build an effective QBH system despite all of the query imperfection. Many approaches have been proposed to develop QBH systems, such as contour approach, hidden Markov model, and dynamic time warping. One of a simple yet promising method for building a QBH system is the Dynamic Time Warping. In this paper, we describe our works on building a QBH system using the Dynamic Time Warping to search for Indonesian songs stored in the MIDI format. To evaluate the system, we use accuracy rate for humming transcription evaluation and mean reciprocal rank for retrieval evaluation.

Farmers, producers, supply-chain managers, extension workers, researchers and academicians are some of the important stakeholders in the field of agriculture. Web has now become an important medium for dissemination of information required by all of these. But, the retrieval of desired information from Web is a difficult task as it requires sifting through all the search results and identifying correct Web pages. A solution to this problem is personalization of search results according to user interests and preferences. Further, semantic Web and multi-agent technology is playing an important role in adding the meaning to the Web contents. At present, very little efforts have seen in applying personalization using semantic Web and agent technology in the area of agriculture. This research proposes a framework based on semantic Web and agent technology for the retrieval of personalized information from Web in agriculture domain.

Harvesting these qualities of IT and merging it for easier, better and structured learning of holy Quran is the main objective of this paper. Arabic language in general and dialectal of holy Quran in particular is under the focus of many researchers in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Arabic has morphology that differs from English in very basic level but it does follow systematic pattern when inflectional or derivational morphology is discussed. The challenges in the structuring of such a vast variety of data and their successful accomplishment are also added in brief but strengthen with examples to provide the depth of work carried out in this domain. Initially 23 attributes per word are applied to Quranic words (70% of words are covered till to date) based on Arabic parts of speech. These attributes are defined in such manner that language hierarchy is conserved to its maximum. The said application can be further enhanced to micro level data structuring. This effort did lead to implementation of information retrieval system that provides the proper tagging to each step. This approach can be further utilised in the field of Quranic education and research.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2823-1; POD:978-1-4799-2824-8","10.1109/NOORIC.2013.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7277250","Quran;arabic;attributes;data structure;information retrieval system","Color;Electronic learning;Morphology;Tagging","computer aided instruction;data structures;humanities;information retrieval;natural language processing","Arabic language;Arabic part-of-speech;IT qualities;NLP;Quranic education field;Quranic research field;advanced learning;data communication;data manipulation;data set generation;derivational morphology;e-learning;holy Quran word attributes;inflectional morphology;information retrieval system;language hierarchy;microlevel data structuring;natural language processing;structured learning;systematic pattern","","","","3","","","22-25 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to provide efficient access to this knowledge, analysis though digitizing the existing work is the need of hour. In addition to digitization, efficient search mechanisms also need to be implemented to provide users a rapid access to the queried information. In most cases, the digitized documents are complemented by manually assigned tags which not only is a time consuming task but also provides a very limited search facility. Automating the transcription of these documents using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems is also challenging due to the very complex cursive nature of Urdu text. To overcome these limitations, a keyword spotting based information retrieval system for document images is introduced in this study. The proposed technique relies on two major modules, document indexing and retrieval. Images of documents are segmented into partial words (ligatures) and identical partial words (PWs) are grouped into clusters. We introduce the concept of considering each (partial) word as a unique shape and a set of shape descriptors is extracted to characterize the PWs. The clusters of PWs are used to index a given set of documents. During retrieval, the query word presented to the system is matched with the clusters in the database and all documents containing instances of the query word are retrieved and presented to the user. The system evaluated on a set of printed Urdu documents in Nastaliq font realized promising precision and recall rates.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9721-6; POD:978-1-4673-9722-3","10.1109/SITIS.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7400541","Clustering;Indexing;Information Retrieval;Partial words;Word Spotting","Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Shape","document image processing;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;pattern clustering","Nastaliq font;PW characterization;Urdu document images;clustering;document image segmentation;document indexing;keyword based information retrieval system;partial word segmentation;query word;shape descriptor extraction","","","","28","","","23-27 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technical integration of these two frameworks is the subject of our investigation, and is relevant for data scientists pursuing two types of use cases: (1) analysis of numerous (1000x) un-partitioned small to medium sized Tika parse-able files, and (2) analysis of very large partition-able Tika parse-able files. Given Tika's niche specialization of file extraction and Spark's specialization of parallelized computing, there is a need to explore the benefits of integration.

Moreover, certain issues related to fault tolerance and security may arise in the migration of mobile agents. In the proposed approach we present fault tolerance for mobile agent based systems. The novelty of this approach is updating the home server about the information of the system. This approach makes use of clone of the original agent for the updating home server. Checkpoints are used periodically after fixed number of servers for the updating of the retrieved results. Experiments evaluated show that the round trip time of the proposed approach is less than the earlier approaches and comparison of time is done for checkpoints after different number of servers and it shows that the more are the number of servers after which checkpointing is done, lesser is the round trip time for the retrieval of information. Hence, this approach concerns not only with reliability due to some extended features but also assures a robust fault tolerance mechanism by reducing overheads.","","Electronic:978-9-3805-4416-8; POD:978-1-4799-6832-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100332","Checkpoint;clone agent;fault tolerance;itinerary;mobile agent;overhead;rollback recovery;round trip time","Checkpointing;Cloning;Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Mobile agents;Servers","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;information retrieval;mobile agents","bandwidth requirements;distributed computing;distributed systems;fault tolerance;home server;information retrieval applications;mobile agent based systems;mobile agent technology;network domains;robust fault tolerance mechanism;round trip time","","0","","19","","","11-13 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, data in computer systems is stored in coded format; however, certain data, like user comments, cannot be coded. Hence, it is stored in the form of free text. Based on the results of the performed literature review, it was identified that the free text contains invaluable information; however, extracting such information is a challenging task due to the complexity of the stored data.

In this trend, the need for effective Information Retrieval (IR) technique has been increased. Although document data contain much more abundant information, users can retrieve necessary information only from the title and description in conventional web services. In order to meet the demands for fast and accurate retrieval of valuable information, we propose a fast and effective content-based document information retrieval system that retrieves the information from the actual content of a document. The proposed method is based on a topic model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation that is used to extract major keywords for a given document. The main contributions of our system are the increased flexibility, effectiveness, and fast retrieval of information. Our system can easily communicate with existing web service through the standard JSON format. In addition, we increase the speed of information retrieval by using NoSQL based database system with inverted indexing and B-tree based indexing.

The traditional information-theoretic PIR schemes utilize multiple servers to download single data block, thus incur high communication overhead and high computation burden. In this paper, we develop an Information- theoretic multi-block PIR scheme that significantly reduce the client communication and computation overheads by downloading multiple data blocks at a time. The design of k-safe binary matrices insures the information will not be revealed even if up to k servers collude. Our scheme has much lower overhead than the classic PIR schemes. The implementation of fast XOR operations benefits both servers and clients in reducing coding and decoding time. Our work demonstrates that multi-block PIR scheme can be optimized to simultaneously achieve low communication and computation overhead, comparable to even non-PIR systems, while maintaining a high level of privacy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5952-5; POD:978-1-4799-5953-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2015.7417246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7417246","","Databases;Decoding;Encoding;Information retrieval;Mirrors;Privacy;Servers","information retrieval;matrix algebra;protocols","computation overhead;fast XOR operations;information-theoretic PIR schemes;k-safe binary matrices;multiblock private information retrieval protocol;multiple data blocks;multiserver protocol;non-PIR systems;private information retrieval","","","","21","","","6-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the computational-intensive nature of these solutions results in significant performance overhead, preventing their adoption in practice. In this paper, we employ graphical processing units (GPUs) to speed up the cryptographic operations required by PIR. We identify the challenges that arise when using GPUs for PIR and we propose solutions to address them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use GPUs for efficient private information retrieval, and an important first step towards GPU-based acceleration of a broader range of secure data operations.

Indeed, a significant number of relevant documents on the web are not returned by an IRS (specifically a search engine), because of the richness of natural language Arabics. For this purpose the search engine does not reach high performance and does not meet the needs of users. To remedy this problem, we propose a method of enrichment of the query. This method relies on many steps. First, identification of significant terms (simple and composed) present in the query. Then, generation of a descriptive list and its assignment to each term that has been identified as significant in the query. A descriptive list is a set of linguistic knowledge of different types (morphological, syntactic and semantic). In this paper we are interested in the statistical treatment, based on the similarity method. This method exploits the weighting functions of Salton TF-IDF and TF-IEF on the list generated in the previous step. TF-IDF function identifies relevant documents, while the TF-IEF's role is to identify the relevant sentence. The terms of high weight (which are terms which may be correlated to the context of the response) are incorporated into the original query. The application of this method is based on a corpus of documents belonging to a closed domain.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8749-1; POD:978-1-4673-8750-7","10.1109/ICTA.2015.7426926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426926","Arabic NLP;Informationretrieval;Query enrichment;evaluations metrics;weighting function","Air pollution;Labeling;Pragmatics;Search engines;Semantics;Statistical analysis","document handling;information retrieval systems;natural language processing;query processing;statistical analysis","Arabics;IRS;Salton TF-IDF weighting function;Salton TF-IEF weighting function;descriptive list generation;document corpus;information retrieval system;query enrichment method;significant terms identification;similarity method;statistical treatment","","","","","","","21-23 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the individual processing and analyzing each type of multimedia data may make the system more tedious and complex. Also, the correlations between the contents of multimedia document are not considered in the knowledge extraction process. When the multimodal objects are represented in the unimodal domain, similar processing and knowledge discovery methods can be used. In this paper, a domain converting method is proposed with the aim to represent the multimedia document of multimodal objects as multimedia document of signal objects. In order to find the similarity between the multimedia documents, an information theory based similarity measure is proposed. Evaluation of the proposed framework has been performed by experimenting the system for the retrieval of multimedia documents.

Cluster heads (CHs) are elected for each energy zone according to type of vehicle, and act as information center. Apart from CHs, the dissemination of data and access of information in efficient and correct manner is made possible with the help of vehicles having high processing capability. The broadcast storm problem that consumes high energy in terms of bandwidth, is solved using proposed game theoretic decision model. The proposed model gives suggestion to vehicles whether to disseminate the information or not based on the current energy situation of the network.

To search and retrieve useful information from these linked data, users often enter queries into information retrieval (IR) systems. Among the information retrieved by these systems, some information is relevant to the user queries (i.e., Interested to the users), but some is not. Moreover, some relevant information may not be retrieved by the systems. The effectiveness of these IR systems is often measured by metrics such as precision and recall. Most of the conventional IR systems (e.g., For web searches) aim to achieve high precision (i.e., High percentage of the retrieved information is relevant) at the price of low recall (i.e., Low percentage of the relevant information is retrieved). However, there are real-life situations (e.g., Patent searches) in which having high recall is desirable. In this paper, we present two high-recall IR systems.

Among the different types of social signals, particular attention has been paid to facial expression of emotions and its automated analysis from image sequences. Automated facial expression analysis is a very challenging task due to the complex three-dimensional deformation and motion of the face associated to the facial expressions and the loss of 3D information during the image formation process. As a consequence, retrieving 3D spatio-temporal facial information from image sequences is essential for automated facial expression analysis. In this paper, we propose a framework for retrieving three-dimensional facial structure, motion and spatio-temporal features from monocular image sequences. First, we estimate monocular 3D scene flow by retrieving the facial structure using shape-from-shading (SFS) and combine it with 2D optical flow. Secondly, based on the retrieved structure and motion of the face, we extract spatio-temporal features for automated facial expression analysis. Experimental results illustrate the potential of the proposed 3D facial information retrieval framework for facial expression analysis, i.e. facial expression recognition and facial action-unit recognition on a benchmark dataset. This paves the way for future research on monocular 3D facial expression analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9953-8; POD:978-1-4799-9954-5; USB:978-1-4799-9952-1","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344634","","Deformable models;Face;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Shape;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","face recognition;feature extraction;image retrieval;image sequences","3D facial information retrieval;SFS;facial expression analysis;feature extraction;image formation process;image sequence;shape-from-shading;social signal","","","","39","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our main contribution is the proposal of a set of strategies for involving the user in the retrieval process, so that by presenting to her meaningful posts to be labeled, the method achieves a noticeably higher accuracy. The correct retrieval or labeling could be provided by an external information source such as a domain expert, or simulated with an oracle. A key aspect of active retrieval methods is to request the labels of the instances that help improve the retrieval accuracy the most, while keeping the number of labeling requests to a minimum. The proposed strategies for selecting labeling requests make use of the textual content of tweets and their structural information. The experimental results show the advantages of the proposed methods and the effectiveness of the selection strategies for involving the user in the retrieval process.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424315","active learning;feature extraction;information retrieval;text similarity","Feature extraction;Joining processes;Labeling;Media;Tagging;Twitter","information retrieval;politics;social networking (online)","active information retrieval;linking Twitter posts;microblogging social networks;political debates;short messages;textual content","","","","17","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, we consider a Bloom filter, a simple randomized data structure that answers membership queries with no false negative and customizable false positive probability. Mainly, we focus on the speed-up of the algorithm by using a Graphics Processing Units (GPU) based implementation. Starting from a regular CPU implementation of the Bloom filter algorithm, we employ different optimization techniques on the two basic Bloom filter operations: mapping and querying. An important speed-up is achieved for both operations: over 300x for mapping, and over 20x for querying. Furthermore, we show that the number of hash functions used during the mapping operation, the number of files, and the number of query words have a significant effect on the execution time and the speed-up.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8481-7; POD:978-1-4799-8482-4; USB:978-1-4799-8480-0","10.1109/ICSTCC.2015.7321404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7321404","Bloom filter;GPU;information retrieval;speed-up","Arrays;Filtering algorithms;Filtering theory;Graphics processing units;Information retrieval;Instruction sets;Kernel","data structures;graphics processing units;information retrieval;optimisation","Bloom filters;GPU accelerated information retrieval;graphics processing units;optimization techniques;search engines;simple randomized data structure","","1","","21","","","14-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed LSTM-RNN model sequentially takes each word in a sentence, extracts its information, and embeds it into a semantic vector. Due to its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model is found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and detect the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords are found to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many different applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document retrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform several existing state of the art methods. We emphasize that the proposed model generates sentence embedding vectors that are specially useful for web document retrieval tasks. A comparison with a well known general sentence embedding method, the Paragraph Vector, is performed. The results show that the proposed method in this paper significantl- outperforms Paragraph Vector method for web document retrieval task.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2520371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389336","Deep Learning;Deep learning;Long Short-Term Memory;Sentence Embedding;long short-term memory;sentence embedding","Data visualization;IEEE transactions;Recurrent neural networks;Semantics;Speech;Speech processing;Web search","document handling;information retrieval;natural language processing;recurrent neural nets;search engines","LSTM-RNN model;Web document retrieval tasks;automatic keyword detection;commercial Web search engine;deep sentence embedding;information retrieval;long short-term memory networks;natural language processing research;recurrent neural networks;semantic representation;weakly supervised manner","","6","","47","","20160121","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Double-ruling-based schemes support efficient in-network data-centric information storage and retrieval, especially for aggregated data, since all data with different types generated in a network can be conveniently retrieved along any single retrieval curve. Previous double-ruling-based research focuses on two-dimensional (2-D) wireless sensor networks where a 2-D planar setting is assumed. With increasing interests in deploying wireless sensors in three-dimensional (3-D) space for various applications, it is urgent yet fundamentally challenging to design double-ruling-based approach in general 3-D sensor networks because double-ruling-based schemes in general have much harder geometric constraints than other distributed in-network data-centric processing schemes. In this research, we propose a geographic location-free double-ruling-based approach for general 3-D sensor networks with possibly complicated topology and geometric shapes. Without the knowledge of the geographic location and the distance bound, a query simply travels along a simple curve with the guaranteed success to retrieve aggregated data through time and space with one or different types across the network.

The trends of development of many e-Government services for many countries in the world, indicate the necessity of application natural language processing - NLP and in e-Government services Republic of Serbia. When performing many of the natural language processing tasks it is needed that all forms of a word with the same meaning has the same form. In general, many documents that are available e-Government services are not structured, so from them is very difficult to isolate some forms (knowledge) that exist in them. The process of finding useful information from such documents in Serbian language, which normally represents highly inflectional language, is one of the key elements of the modern information society in the Republic of Serbia.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8520-6; POD:978-1-4673-8521-3; USB:978-1-4673-8519-0","10.1109/CINTI.2015.7382934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7382934","Apach Lucene;Information Retrieval;Natural Language Processing;unstructured documents","Data mining;Electronic government;Indexing;Information retrieval;Libraries;Natural language processing","criminal law;government data processing;information retrieval;natural language processing;public administration;text analysis","ICT;NLP;Serbian language;crime domain;e-government services;information retrieval;information society;information-communication technologies;natural language processing;public sector;unstructured text documents","","","","19","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The user is not an integral part of the translation and retrieval processes. In this paper, we investigate the problem of personalized cross-language information retrieval by exploiting query expansion techniques. The original query is augmented with terms mined from the user's historical usage information in one language, with the aim of retrieving more relevant results in another language. Experiments semi-automatically constructed by using bilingual Wikipedia documents showed that in general personalized approaches work better than non-personalized approaches. We also found that an individual user model generated from one language can be used to enhance the personalized cross-language information retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8395-0; POD:978-1-4673-8396-7","10.1109/SMAP.2015.7370085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7370085","Personalized cross-language information retrieval;evaluation;query expansion;user model","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Information retrieval;Internet;Mathematical model;Semantics","data mining;document handling;natural language processing;query processing","bilingual Wikipedia documents;personalized cross-language information retrieval research;query augmentation;query expansion techniques;retrieval process;system-centered approaches;term mining;translation process;user historical usage information","","","","12","","","5-6 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed technique involves hierarchical merging in which software, responsible for solving the entire problem, is enhanced with highly parallel networks in hardware accelerators. Additional improvements are achieved with the aid of support methods that are sort and verification of object intersections that may also be autonomously used for other types of information processing and database management. It is shown and experimentally proved that the proposed solutions are efficient. They can be used in such areas as health care, statistical data manipulation and so on.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8966-9; POD:978-1-4799-8967-6; USB:978-1-4799-8965-2","10.1109/ICTRC.2015.7156457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7156457","FPGA;data mining;hardware accelerator;information retrieval;parallel processing","Acceleration;Data mining;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Merging;Software;Sorting","data mining;information retrieval;merging","data mining;database management;hardware accelerators;hierarchical merging;informatics;information processing;information retrieval;parallel networks","","0","","25","","","17-19 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
