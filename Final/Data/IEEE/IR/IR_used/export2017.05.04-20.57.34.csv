The definition of mechanisms through which adaptivity may be evaluated would be very useful both for the maintainability, reusability, and evolution of adaptive systems, and for the relations which may be established among adaptive systems (e.g., interaction, integration). In this paper we propose examples of metrics for dynamic adaptivity which may be considered a starting point for future research on (1) the feasibility related to the definition of measurable evaluation mechanisms for adaptive systems, and (2) the usability of these metrics as design hints in the development process of new adaptive systems and as formal approaches for the evaluation of existing adaptive systems.","","POD:978-1-4244-4984-2","10.1109/WICSA.2009.5290667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5290667","adaptivity;evaluation mechanisms;software metrics","Adaptive systems;Computer architecture;Information retrieval;Information systems;Maintenance engineering;Monitoring;Software metrics;Software systems;Systems engineering and theory;Usability","software maintenance;software metrics;software performance evaluation;software reusability","adaptive system evaluation;dynamic adaptivity;information system;software metrics","","6","","14","","","14-17 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using just one kind of feature information may cause inaccuracy compared with using more than two kinds of feature information. Aiming at shape-based image retrieval, in this paper we proposed an image retrieval method using the global and local shape features. Firstly, an image is segmented, and then the compactness and Fourier descriptor as local features are extracted. In order to remedy the effect of image segmentation on feature description and improve retrieval performance, global feature is extracted by Krawtchouk moment invariants. Finally, this approach uses the combined local and global shape features as feature vectors to achieve image retrieval. Experiments have been conducted on a database consisting of 500 images, compared with the method of using local shape features, experiments results show that this approach is more effective in image retrieval and improves the accuracy.","","POD:978-1-4244-4129-7","10.1109/CISP.2009.5304693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5304693","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Information science;Shape;Space technology","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation","Krawtchouk moment invariants;content-based image retrieval;global feature extraction;global shape feature vector;image database;image segmentation;local shape feature vector;shape-based image retrieval","","8","","15","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, a major challenge in analyzing such data is how to efficiently retrieve genes showing certain spatial expression patterns and/or genes showing similar expression patterns as the query gene. The development of a fast image segmentation algorithm and an effective statistical scoring method is useful to address the above question.

One of the strongest limitation to the capturing of rationale information during development concerns its time-consuming and disruptive nature that cause many organizations to consider rationale management costs excessive. A possible solution is to extract and capture rationale information when it is needed. This can be done by analyzing documents shared or exchanged among software engineers during the development process.

A limitation of previous color based methods is their unsuitability for retrieving similar scenes under varying lighting conditions as color is sensitive to illuminations. Besides image descriptors of some existing methods are with large dimensionality and thus computational expensive. As betterment, an adaptive method is proposed in this paper, which integrates the color invariant with some spatial information of images. Different from previous work, the number of states during the quantization of the color space is not manually determined. Instead, it depends on the context of the image itself, using an adaptive clustering technique: Firstly, feature map consisting of color invariants is established for images. Secondly, the Markov chain model is employed to capture the image both color and spatial information. Thirdly, an image descriptor is computed for each image, not under the frame of the entire fixed color space. To practice our method, similar images are retrieved with a similarity measure based on a two-stage weighted distance. Experiments show that, this method has improved simplicity and compactness without the lost of efficiency and robustness.","","POD:978-0-7695-3789-4","10.1109/CGIV.2009.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5298817","","Color;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Lighting;Quantization;Robustness","Markov processes;content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval","Markov chain model;adaptive clustering technique;color invariant;content based image retrieval;discriminative descriptor;image descriptor;statistical image retrieval method","","0","","26","","","11-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on multi-scale Harris Laplace detector, a robust image retrieval scheme using the color histogram of local feature regions is proposed in this paper.

A problem in this approach is, however, the large imbalance ratio between relevant and non-relevant documents in the collection. In standard test collection as used in academic evaluation frameworks such as TREC, non-relevant documents outnumber relevant documents by far. In this work, we address this imbalance problem in the multimedia domain. We focus on the logs of two multimedia user studies which are highly imbalanced.

The individual audio file is modeled on the normalized distribution of the numbers of cluster bins corresponding to the frames of this file. Each audio file is described by one vector. The audio data are represented as feature-file matrix similar to term-document representation in latent semantic indexing (LSI). The LSI is applied to the feature-file matrix to represent the data in latent semantic space. Then the primary file description is converted to the vectors of similarity to anchor reference data. For anchor reference the training data are used. Each component of this vector is a probabilistic similarity between target file and anchor reference file corresponding to the considered component. The LSI is applied once more to the new feature-file matrix, mapping the data to the latent semantic space in the anchor reference space.

Since metadata plays crucial role both in storage and content management, integrating various metadata and providing an efficient mechanism can greatly improve content search and simplify management of digital objects. Therefore, a kind of integrated metadata model based on object storage is proposed to implement the full fusion of CAS and content management. A kind of distributed CAS appliance system based on the integrated metadata is established and demonstrated in this paper. As a result, CAS appliance system can provide strong content search and navigation services, and it is more efficiently to store and retrieve data.","","POD:978-1-4244-4638-4","10.1109/ICMSS.2009.5305475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305475","","Content addressable storage;Content based retrieval;Content management;Data security;Distributed computing;Home appliances;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Navigation;Sun","content management;content-addressable storage;large-scale systems;meta data;storage management","content addressable storage;content management;content search;distributed CAS appliance system;integrated metadata model;large-scale storage system;object-based storage device;storage management","","0","","3","","","20-22 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is obtained by modelling the scattering surface as composed by slightly rough randomly tilted facets. The facet random tilt causes a random variation of the local incidence angle and a random rotation of the local incidence plane around the line of sight, which in turn causes a random rotation of the facet scattering matrix. In, the random incident angle variation Deltathetav is ignored, and the incidence plane angle of rotation b is assumed to be uniformly distributed in an interval (-beta<sub>1</sub>, beta<sub>1</sub>). In this paper, we remove both these simplifying assumptions, in order to assess their validity and to improve them. In particular, we derive more realistic distributions of beta and Deltathetav by assuming that the facet slope (i.e., the slope of the large-scale surface roughness) is a Gaussian random variable, in agreement with both classical and fractal surface models. Finally, we show that, if the X-SPM is used, the same information about a bare soil surface that can be retrieved from the coherency matrix entropy and scattering angle (H, alpha) can be also retrieved from the co-pol and cross-pol ratios.","","POD:978-1-4244-4747-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306987","","Fractals;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Perturbation methods;Random variables;Rough surfaces;Scanning probe microscopy;Scattering;Soil;Surface roughness","electromagnetic wave polarisation;electromagnetic wave scattering;surface roughness","Gaussian random variable;coherency matrix entropy;cross-polarisation effects;depolarisation effects;extended Bragg method;extended small perturbation method;facet scattering matrix;natural surface parameters;random incident angle variation;rough randomly tilted facets;small perturbation method;surface roughness","","1","","4","","","Sept. 30 2009-Oct. 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sentence rank is computed using a score function that uses its feature values and the weights of the features. The best feature weights are learned using machine learning techniques with the help of human constructed summaries.

GIS based applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries, analyze and show the spatial information on maps. On the other hand, wireless sensor network (WSN) is widely used. There are huge amount of data retrieved by sensors sent to the server for query by users. The raw data are usually hard to be understood by users. If the raw data can be transferred into add-on valued data and shown on the Web pages, the user can obtain more useful and realizable information. This paper proposed an innovated sensor observation service with Web based and GIS based architecture, which is named WSN application service platform (WASP). WASP is a data management center, which designed with the concept of services oriented application (SOA) as a cloud service. WASP is the combination of Internet/Web based services and components, database systems, users, and WSN communities. The main goal of WASP is providing an easy and straightforward mechanism of data presentation for users. Users can query and obtain the valuable information and realize the meanings of these data through Web based interfaces, which is defined in sensor web enablement (SWE) by open geospatial consortium (OGC). In WASP, all sensors provide their location information to data center and form a community. WASP provides remote control functions for WSN to increase the data retrieval efficiency based on OGC SWE sensor observation service (SOS), sensor planning service (SPS), and sensor alert service (SAS). We demonstrated two applications using WASP in Taiwan.

Using these object detectors trained on separate public data sets, object-based features are generated by assembling detection results to object sequences. A shot-based confidence score as well as further features, such as position, frame coverage and movement, are computed for each object class.

To discover the biological characteristics of genomic sequences of a marine species, an efficient and effective method for detecting distantly related proteins based on experimentally known functions from model species becomes an important strategy. In this study, Ensembl and NCBI genetic databases were employed to build a primitive database of selected marine species. The system contained an abundance of useful DNA, RNA and Protein information, and was named as the Marine Species Genome Database (MSGD). To identify remote proteins, we have proposed a novel LESS (length encoded secondary structure) profile to improve the information retrieval applications, especially for identifying protein sequences without resolved structures and within low sequence identity. The matching algorithms applied several existing secondary structure prediction techniques and a feasible encoding mechanism with respect to the length distribution of secondary structures. Due to the conservation of secondary structures of proteins in evolution, the proposed system demonstrated its suitability for similarity comparison of distantly related proteins, and several important protein sequences can be retrieved by MSGD while those well-known residue-based matching methods missed the identification.","1948-2914;19482914","POD:978-1-4244-4132-7","10.1109/BMEI.2009.5305675","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5305675","","Aquaculture;Bioinformatics;Biological techniques;Databases;Environmental factors;Evolution (biology);Genomics;Information retrieval;Proteins;Sequences","biology computing;genomics;information retrieval;proteins","DNA;Ensembl genetic database;Marine Species Genome Database;NCBI genetic database;RNA;biological techniques;genomic sequences;length encoded secondary structure profile;protein information;selected marine genomics database","","1","","20","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the careful study of multimedia materials retrieval behaviors, we proposed a method of catalog information retrieval with relevant feedback. By constructing P2P overlay network, physical neighboring nodes are partitioned in one region. According to properties of the node, such as usage of CPU, free memory, available bandwidth and online time, those nodes with good capacity and high reputation are selected to be supernodes. Supernode is responsible for regional management and consistency maintenance of catalog file.

The rapid growth of the Web has produced an explosion of the digital media availability, combining the media reproduction of the last decades, with easy and fast distribution. Therefore, an extensive use of metadata (the fundamental building block of the semantic Web) for digital media is required. An approach to multimedia metadata processing is proposed, using rule reasoning based on RDF model theory, so that users can issue semantic based query by interaction interface and achieve information sharing. RDF is widely used for data exchange and to publish data from database systems to the Web by providing input to content generators for Web pages.

When an image is explored, its optimal set of feature weights is automatically determined using all images contained within the relevant regions, based on the evidential support for the relevance of each single feature.

This congested network is not allowed for the community network in a disaster zone since network links must be connectable as possible. Although push-based methods must be fault-tolerable to apply to community networks and increase the sender load to deliver files, utilizing push-based content delivery methods to disseminate content can reduce the usage of the connections of a file sender.

Concretely, in each round of RF, one virtual positive example is generated using QPM. Meanwhile, a random subset of unlabeled examples is selected as the candidate negative examples, and then QPM is used to it for data editing purpose. Finally, the virtual positive example and the edited unlabeled examples are exploited in conjunction with the labeled examples to train a SVM for image retrieval.

Because sizes of these test suites can be extremely large, researchers have developed techniques, such as reduction and minimization, to obtain test suites that are ldquosimilarrdquo to the original test suite, but smaller. Existing similarity metrics mostly use code coverage; they do not consider the contextual relationships between events. Consequently, reduction based on such metrics may eliminate desirable test cases. In this paper, we present a new parameterized metric, CONTeSSi(n) which uses the context of n preceding events in test cases to develop a new context-aware notion of test suite similarity for EDS. This metric is defined and evaluated by comparing four test suites for each of four open source applications. Our results show that CONT eSSi(n) is a better indicator of the similarity of EDS test suites than existing metrics.","1063-6773;10636773","POD:978-1-4244-4897-5","10.1109/ICSM.2009.5306305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306305","","Application software;Automatic testing;Computer science;Educational institutions;Fault detection;Graphical user interfaces;Information retrieval;Software systems;Software testing;System testing","program testing;public domain software;software metrics","event driven software systems;event sequence-based test cases;open source systems;software testing;test suite similarity metric","","4","","21","","","20-26 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system also uses metadata, which helps to extract some semantic aspects which could not be inferred from the SQL. Our system analyzes database tuples to capture these metadata.

Several motion detection approaches exist which segment moving foreground regions quite reliably, nevertheless, correct estimation of a class label for the segmented objects still represents a challenge. Certain object classes such as pedestrian groups and vehicles are difficult to discriminate from each other based on the geometric properties of foreground segments only. While appearance-based detection approaches enable class-specific detectors, pose and view-point variations, small-sized objects adversely affect the detection performance. In this paper we combine a (i) motion-based detector - having the generic ability of detecting and outlining arbitrary moving objects-, and (ii) an appearance-based detector exhibiting class specificity. Scale-adaptive mean shift clustering is used to delineate regions of moving foreground. Within the delineated clusters the appearance-based pedestrian detector is used to estimate the label of the object class. For the pedestrian class, such as a group of pedestrians, a simple model-based verification is used to estimate the location of humans. The proposed use of spatial context shows to improve the performance of the overall pedestrian detection system in terms of significantly lower false alarm rates while maintaining about the same detection rate, as evaluated in the paper quantitatively. Real-time performance is achieved.","1845-5921;18455921","POD:978-953-184-135-1","10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5297747","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Motion detection;Nearest neighbor searches;Space exploration;Spatial databases;User interfaces","image classification;image motion analysis;image segmentation;object detection;pattern clustering","appearance-based detection;motion detection;pedestrian detection system;scale-adaptive mean shift clustering;spatial classification;spatial grouping","","0","","16","","","16-18 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, implicit tagging allows that a data item gets tagged each time a user interacts with it based on the reactions of the user to the data (e.g., laughter when seeing a funny video), in contrast to explicit tagging paradigm in which a data item gets tagged only if a user is requested (or chooses) to associate tags with it. As nonverbal reactions to observed multimedia are displayed naturally and spontaneously, no purposeful explicit action (effort) is required from the user; hence, the resulting tagging process is said to be ""implicit"" and ""human centered"" (in contrast to being dictated by computer and being ""computer-centered"").","1053-5888;10535888","","10.1109/MSP.2009.934186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5230816","","Collaboration;Computer displays;Computer networks;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Robustness;Tagging;Time sharing computer systems","human computer interaction;information analysis;information retrieval;multimedia computing","IHCT;data retrieval;implicit human-centered tagging;information exploitation;multimedia data annotation;user interaction;user nonverbal reaction;user specified keyword","","34","1","10","","","November 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The key technique involves the extraction of ROI, the description of image feature and the characteristic matching algorithm. To effectively extract ROI, the color domains were combined with the HSV space, which fits the human visual perception characteristic, and then the image was transformed by DWT to tune the sensitivity to its edge and texture. The ROI was obtained by clustering the mean value and standard deviations of different frequency components of the images. An accurate and fast image retrieval process was realized by weighted color correlograms which effectively combined information from color and space. The experimental results have shown that the retrieval accuracy and efficiency of the method is greatly enhanced, as compared to conventional methods.","","POD:978-1-4244-4129-7","10.1109/CISP.2009.5302355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5302355","","Color;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Gray-scale;Humans;Image converters;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Visual perception","discrete wavelet transforms;edge detection;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;image texture;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;visual perception","DWT transform;HSV space;ROI extraction;color histogram;color image retrieval scheme;discrete wavelet transform;edge detection;frequency component;human visual perception;image feature matching algorithm;image texture;mean value;pattern clustering;region-of-interest;standard deviation;weighted color correlogram","","0","","8","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Following the segmentation on these 2D section images in Photoshop software, the main anatomical structures of the intestine were reconstructed and visualized on a workstation by means of surface rendering in Amira software. The established model can display the duodenum, jejunum and ileum, large intestine individually or jointly to reveal their features and anatomical details. Moreover, it can be zoomed, rotated and sectioned in any direction to facilitate the observation of the morphology and tendency of the intestinal tract. Such a model provides the useful digital resource for anatomy teaching and many clinical applications, such as surgical planning of intestine.","","POD:978-1-4244-4129-7","10.1109/CISP.2009.5301260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5301260","","Anatomical structure;Humans;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Intestines;Surface morphology;Visualization;Workstations","biological organs;data visualisation;image reconstruction;image segmentation;medical image processing;rendering (computer graphics)","3D digitized visible model;Amira software;Chinese digitized intestinal tract;Chinese woman;Photoshop software;Visible Human Project;anatomical structures;anatomy teaching;cross-section images;duodenum;ileum;jejunum;large intestine;surface rendering;surgical planning;visualization","","0","","10","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper provides an overview of techniques and trends in semantic speech retrieval, which is taken to encompass all approaches offering meaning-based access to spoken word collections. We present descriptions, examples and insights for current techniques, including facing real-world heterogenity, aligning parallel resources and exploiting collateral collections. We also discuss ways in which speech recognition technology can be used to create multimedia connections that make new modes of access available to users. We conclude with an overview of the challenges for semantic speech retrieval in the workflow of a real-world archive and perspectives on future tasks in which speech retrieval integrates information related to affect and appeal, dimensions that transcend topic.","","POD:978-1-4244-4962-0","10.1109/ICSC.2009.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5298611","multimedia retrieval and access;semantics;speech recognition;speech retrieval;spoken content","Acoustic materials;Automatic speech recognition;Automation;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Humans;Information retrieval;Multimedia computing;Speech enhancement;Speech recognition","information retrieval;multimedia computing;speech recognition","automatic spoken content annotation;collateral collections;enhanced multimedia content access;meaning-based access;multimedia connections;semantic speech retrieval;speech recognition;spoken word collections;undisclosed multimedia material","","4","","21","","","14-16 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper concludes with recommendations which descriptors are most suitable for content-based retrieval of X-ray images. The local features invariant to scale, translation and rotation give best results. The features were integrated in content-based retrieval system for X-ray images. The system supports querying by image to find visually similar images to presented query. To employ multiple visual features to characterize image content we developed simple feature aggregation scheme.","","POD:978-1-4244-4129-7","10.1109/CISP.2009.5304151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5304151","","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Content based retrieval;Image retrieval;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;X-ray imaging","X-ray imaging;content-based retrieval;feature extraction","Gabor features;Tamura features;X-ray images;content-based retrieval system;feature aggregation scheme;image content;image descriptors;image query;visual features","","2","","33","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several semi-automatic and automatic systems have already been proposed to identify the make and model of the shoe that left the mark on the crime scene, however these systems have been tested on simulated shoe marks, i.e. not coming from real crimes scene but artificially synthesized with different noise adding techniques. In this paper, we propose descriptors based on appropriate information of shoeprint pattern in the frequency domain, to retrieve the footwear that produced the shoe mark. Suitable operators, as for example the Mahalanobis distance map, are then selected and involved in the calculation of these descriptors, in order to reduce noise and enhance shoeprint textures found in real cases. In fact and differently from others, the performance test of this algorithm is done on shoe marks coming from real crime scenes, and the results are promising.","1845-5921;18455921","POD:978-953-184-135-1","10.1109/ISPA.2009.5297667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5297667","","Automatic testing;Footwear;Frequency domain analysis;Image analysis;Image matching;Information retrieval;Layout;Noise reduction;Signal processing algorithms;System testing","criminal law;footwear;image matching;image retrieval;information retrieval system evaluation;information retrieval systems;law administration","Mahalanobis distance map;automatic footwear retrieval system;noise adding techniques;real crime scenes;shoe marks;shoeprint image matching","","2","","13","","","16-18 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
