The cosine normalization (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), the maximum if normalization (Allan et al., 1997) and the byte length normalization (Robertson et al., 1992) are the most commonly used normalization techniques. In (Singhal et al., 1996), authors studied the retrieval probability of documents w.r.t. their size, using different similarity measures. They have shown that none of existing measures retrieve the documents of different lengths with the same probability. We first show here that the document and query sizes are indeed very influent on the similarity score expectation. Therefore, we propose to realize a statistical regression of the similarity scores distribution w. r. t. document and query sizes in order to normalize them. Experimental results appear to indicate that our approach, as well in the field of classical Information Retrieval as when applied to a document clustering process, allows to judge similarities really more fairly.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-3015-X","10.1109/ICTAI.2007.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410350","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Length measurement;Probability;Publishing;Registers;Size measurement","document handling;information retrieval;regression analysis","byte length normalization;cosine normalization;document length normalization;information retrieval;maximum if normalization;statistical regression","","0","","19","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The crawled data is stored on centralized servers, where it is parsed and indexed. The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the reader's interests, knowledge and attitudes. Search engines use a ranking algorithm to determine the order in which matching web pages are returned on the results page [12]. They build indices mostly based on keyword occurrence, link popularity and frequency for query negotiation using these indices. Using these connectivity based algorithms, they measure the quality of each individual page so that users will receive a ranked page list for their queries. These search engines perform search with respect to the query fired by the user without considering the perspective of the user. Thus giving results based on a generalized perspective. This paper presents a system architecture that would work as a subordinate to a normal search engine by taking its results, calculating the relevance of these results with respect to the user's perspective (profile) and then displaying the results along with its relevance to the user.","","POD:0-7695-3068-0","10.1109/ICIT.2007.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4418311","","Computer languages;Frequency;Humans;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Metasearch;Search engines;Web pages;Web sites","Internet;query processing;search engines","Internet;Web page crawler;centralized server;query negotiation;ranking algorithm;search engine;user profile relevant result","","0","","11","","","17-20 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, multilayer feed-forward (MLF) neural network (NN) was employed with Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation (LM-BP) and early stopping method to avoid the over-fitting. The number of hidden nodes was determined by using trial and error method since too complicated network was apt to be over-fitting, while a too simple network structure will have difficult training the network. The validation of the estimated SSI using NN-based cloud factor was performed with pyranometer measurement data obtained from 22 meteorological stations over Korea peninsula.

AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) sensor could provide radiance measurements of two channels at two observation angles. So it is possible to retrieve the atmosphere parameters and SST (Sea Surface temperature) synchronously. In order to make the system of equations determined, the two atmosphere parameters that could express whole atmosphere profiles must be confirmed. As the retrieval accuracy is requested, the surface reflected atmospheric downward radiance effect couldn't be ignored. A climatologically data set of 1761 different radio soundings, the SATIGR database, have been used to develop a new atmospheric correction method, the two atmosphere parameters have been proved that could represent the transmittance, atmospheric upward radiance and downward radiance of different wave band and different view angle, they are the transmittance and atmospheric upward radiance of 11 mum at the nadir view angle. Introducing the appropriate sea surface BRDF model, the emissivity and the reflected downward radiance can be calculated precisely. So the SST, wind speed, and two atmosphere parameters are retrieved by Broyden iteration method, when the initial values are found using LUT (look up table) method.

The objective of the simulation is to generate split-window (SW) and dual-angle (DA) algorithms for the retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Envisat/advanced along track scanning radiometer (AATSR) data. The database contains 382 radiosonde profiles acquired over land, with nearly-uniform distribution of precipitable water between 0 and 5.5 cm. Radiative transfer calculations were performed with the MODTRAN 4 code. Different viewing angles were considered in the simulation, taking into account the features of each sensor. The viewing capability of AATSR, with near simultaneous observations first at a forward angle (55deg from nadir) and then close to nadir, allows the implementation of DA algorithms. Using the simulation database, SW algorithms adapted for MODIS and AATSR data, and DA algorithms for AATSR data were developed. Both types of algorithms are quadratic in the brightness temperature difference, and depend explicitly on the land surface emissivity. A sensitivity analysis of all algorithms was made to obtain estimation of the algorithm errors. Furthermore the SW and DA algorithms developed from the simulation database were validated with actual ground measurements of LST collected, concurrently to MODIS and AATSR observations, in a site located close to the city of Valencia, Spain, in a large, flat and thermally homogeneous area of rice crops, where field campaigns were held during the summers of 2002-2006.

In this paper, we compare and evaluate four soil moisture retrieval algorithms developed by Jackson [1], Liou et al. [2], Macelloni et al. [3] and Paloscia et al. [4]. Data used to analyze the performance of these retrieval algorithms includes TRMM-TMI data acquired in 1998 and 2001, and AMSR-E data taken in July 2006. The result indicates that the soil moisture retrieval algorithm developed by Liou et al. [2] has better correlation and less bias as compared with the <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> measurement. The Liou model is further applied to study the spatial variability of the soil moisture in the Tibetan Plateau and has achieved a promising result.

The MOD server stores the data for the moving objects in a given cell, processes the continuous queries pertaining to that cell, and is connected to the MOD servers in the neighboring cells. We demonstrate that, when a range query that spans over more than one cell needs to have its answer computed for a user located in a particular cell, by intelligently combining the transmission and the aggregation of the partial results, substantial improvements can be achieved at the global level.

Because of the wave-length dependence of diffraction, the spectral channels do not sample the same volume of air, as in general assumed by retrieval algorithms for LEO IR (Infrared) sounder data. This additional error introduced in the retrieval by diffraction limited instruments is called 'pseudo noise' throughout the paper. One such diffraction-limited geostationary system is the candidate Infrared Sounding (IRS) mission on EUMETSAT Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) satellites with a planned need date in 2015, due to the expected lifetime of the current Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellites. A simplified Point Spread Function (PSF) is applied. To represent the channels within natural conditions, measured spectra from the low-earth orbit Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) at DeltaX = 15 km, as well as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at DeltaX = 4 km are used as an underlying scene when integrating over the PSF. The results show that the pseudo noise is highly depending on wavelength, and highest in the window and CO2 regions (within the broader 700-1200 cm-1, or 8.3-14.3 mum, region). The worst case pseudo noise values are approximately 1 K for these regions. The broad-band AIRS results are confirmed by a direct comparison to MODIS data at 4 km resolution, where the worst case pseudo noise is appx. 0.5 K, while the best case pseudo noise is comparable to AIRS data.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423686","","Acoustic diffraction;Acoustic noise;Atmospheric measurements;Atmospheric waves;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Infrared spectra;Instruments;Low earth orbit satellites;MODIS","electromagnetic wave diffraction;geophysical techniques;optical transfer function","AD 2015;AIRS data;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder;EUMETSAT;MODIS data;MTG IRS;Meteosat third generation infrared sounder;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;diffraction effects;geostationary infrared sounding;point spread function;pseudo noise;retrieval algorithms;wave number 700 cm<sup>-1</sup> to 1200 cm<sup>-1</sup>;wavelength 8.3 mum to 14.3 mum","","0","","6","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, a set of electronic and optical cross-talk coefficients are postulated. These coefficients are sender-receiver influence coefficients and represent a system signal contamination on any detector on a focal plane when another detector on that focal plane is stimulated with a geophysical signal. This approach involves using the postulated cross-talk coefficients on an actual set of MODIS data granules. The original MODIS data granules and the cross-talk impacted granules can be used with validated geophysical algorithms to create the derived products. Comparison of the products affected by cross-talk with those without cross-talk will identify potential problems and their occurrences over various climatic and surface regions.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423439","Electronic cross-talk;MODIS;Vis/NIR;characterization;optical cross-talk;performanc;products","Detectors;Electric variables measurement;Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;MODIS;Optical crosstalk;Optical design;Optical sensors;Pollution measurement;Stimulated emission","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;optical crosstalk","MODIS Level 1 data sets;climatic region;cross-talk impacted granules;cross-talk radiance contamination;data granules;electric cross-talk;environmental sensors;focal planes;geophysical algorithms;optical cross-talk;signal contamination;spectral measurements;surface region","","0","","4","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent approaches to data storage rely on Geographic Hash Tables for efficient data storage and retrieval. These approaches however do not support different QoS levels for different classes of data as the programmer has no control on the level of redundancy of data. They result in a great unbalance in the storage usage in each sensor, even when sensors are uniformly distributed. This may cause serious data losses, waste energy and shorten the overall lifetime of the sensornet. In this paper, we propose a novel protocol, Q- NiGHT, which (1) provides a direct control on the level of QoS in the data dependability, and (2) uses a strategy similar to the rejection method to build a hash function which scatters data approximately with the same distribution of sensors. The benefits of Q-NiGHT are assessed through a detailed simulation experiment, also discussed in the paper.

The retrieval from AMSU-B data only works for dry polar atmosphere but independent of daylight, while retrieval from GOME/SCIAMACHY works globally but depends on daylight. The correlation between the two data sets is moderate to high (0.5 to 0.9) with the exception of late summer and autumn, when it is below 0.4. The most likely reason for the low correlation is that the microwave algorithm is least reliable in autumn because the frequency dependence of the sea ice emissivity (which enters into the algorithm) is modified by the summer surface melt and refreeze in a yet unknown way. The TWV data retrieved from GOME/SCIAMACHY have a slight dry bias with respect to TWV data from AMSU-B, as fully cloudy footprints are excluded from the retrieval with GOME/SCIAMACHY. As the two retrieval methods have different strengths and weaknesses but have only little mutual bias, TWV data from both methods can complement each other.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423145","","Acoustic imaging;Electromagnetic wave absorption;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Microwave imaging;Microwave measurements;Monitoring;Optical imaging;Satellites;Sea measurements","atmospheric composition;atmospheric humidity;remote sensing","AMSU-B satellite data;Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit B;GOME-SCIAMACHY satellite data;Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment;Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY;microwave algorithm;microwave radiances;polar atmosphere;sea ice emissivity;total water vapor columns;visible spectra","","0","","8","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, many studies have sought to extract information from biomolecular text using natural language processing technology. Previous studies have asserted that linguistic information is useful for information extraction from text. In particular, syntactic relations among linguistic information are good for detection of protein interactions, protein subcellular localization, and so on. However, previous systems in detecting protein subcellular localization use only shallow syntactic parsers, and they did not show good performance. To improve performance in detecting protein subcellular localization, this paper proposes a three-step method based on a full syntactic dependency parser. In the first step, we construct syntactic dependency paths from each protein to its location candidate. In the second step, we retrieve root information of the syntactic paths. In the last step, we extract syntactic patterns of protein sub-trees and those of location sub-trees. According to the root information and syntactic patterns of sub-trees, we extract correct (protein, localization) pairs. Even without biomolecular knowledge, our method shows reasonable performance. In the experimental results using Medline abstracts data, our proposed method gave an F-measure of 76% for training data and 60% for test data, significantly outperforming previous methods. We also describe the contributions of root information and syntactic patterns of sub-trees to the performance.","","POD:0-7695-3038-9","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420400","","Abstracts;Biology computing;Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Information technology;Natural language processing;Protein engineering;Testing;Training data","biology computing;molecular biophysics;proteins","biomolecular text;linguistic information;natural language processing;protein subcellular localization detection;protein subtrees;syntactic dependency paths","","0","","16","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents FragDB, a storage concept based on localized access control, where data storage and retrieval are bound to a specific place, rather than the knowledge of a particular password or certificate.

This has driven many researchers to investigate into how people navigate within Web applications, and how the Web applications should be modeled and designed. In the work, a novel approach is proposed to modeling Web navigation for its formal representation using FSM (Finite State Machine) and Z language. It models user behavior in page navigation by FSM and specifies Web pages, hyperlinks, page-scoped variables and frames using Z. Such provides the users with two different views, one of which concerns behavioral navigability and another concerns page linkage, of a Web application.

A major advantage of the distance histogram is its invariance to the transforms of scaling, translation and rotation. Based on the premise that two similar images should have high mutual information, or equivalently, the querying image should convey high information about those similar to it, this paper proposed a mutual information distance measure to perform the similarity comparison.

In order to settle this defect, a three-layer perceptron neural network has been introduced into the simultaneous inversion of temperature and emissivity from hyperspectral FTIR data. The soil emissivity spectra from the ASTER spectral library have been used to produce the training dataset, and the soil emissivity spectra from the MODIS spectral library have been used to produce the test dataset, the result of network test shows the MLP is robust. Meanwhile, ISSTES algorithm has also been used to retrieve the temperature and emissivity from the test dataset. By Comparison the result of MLP and ISSTES, we find MLP can overcome the disadvantage of conventional temperature and emissivity separation algorithms, although the RMSE of derived emissivity using MLP is lower than ISSTES as a whole.

In this work called EstuaryDB, we propose a notion of emergent optimization, where globally optimal configurations emerge as a result of a number of local autonomous decisions carried out in self-interest. Grid nodes act as self-interested autonomous agents that continuously seek to maximize their ""wealth."" The agents are unaware of system-wide issues such as when do queries arrive, what are they asking for, or when are they revoked. Every query brings with it a certain amount of wealth, and each agent continuously tries to save as much of the wealth as possible.

Hence, intensive field campaigns were organized during the growing seasons of 2000, 2004, and 2005 in order to collect ground spectra and corresponding leaf chlorophyll content values as well as crop growth measures. The relationships between leaf chlorophyll content and combined optical indices have shown similar trends for both PROSPECT- SAILH simulated data and ground measured datasets, indicating that both spectral measurements and radiative transfer models hold comparable potential for quantitative retrieval of crop foliar pigments. The dataset used showed that crop type had a clear influence on the establishment of predictive equations as well as on their validation. Moreover, corn and wheat data have led to contrasting agreement between estimated and measured chlorophyll contents even for the same predictive algorithm.

We present an architecture that provides this property and show that the architecture is powerful enough to support existing location- based services. Our architecture exploits trusted computing and private information retrieval. With the help of trusted computing, we ensure that a location-based service operates as expected by a customer and that information about the customer's location becomes inaccessible to a location-based service upon a compromise of the service.

Each music has a particular and unique beat pattern called main beat. This representative feature from the noise-free signal is extracted which is followed by one matching method at the retrieval stage. Similar types of features are extracted from the music database or training music as well as the test music. For feature extraction, a music signal is primarily segmented into small windows in the time domain.

However, its accuracy decreases significantly as the distance from the optical radiation source increases, hence the need to characterize the method by means of wind field profile simulations and validate it by comparing the retrieval of real wind velocities with that of cooperative instruments such as radiosoundings.

Evapotranspiration in Keriya Oasis of the Tarim Basin was calculated and spatially exhibited in this study by integrating remote sensing data into the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model, which was modified and improved by COST atmospheric correction model and mono-window land surface temperature (LST) retrieval algorithm. The Landsat ETM+ imagery, in combination of the meteorological data collected in ground stations, was employed in SEBAL model for estimating oasis surface parameters and vegetation structure parameters in Keriya Oasis. Based on the instantaneous ET estimated by SEBAL, the average and maximum daily ET was calculated to map the spatial differentiation of oasis vegetation ET. Thereafter, the relationship between spatial difference of actual ET and land cover types was analyzed in detail. With the decreasing of mean surface ET, the land use type transferred from wetland, water body, cropland, high densely populated grassland to low densely populated grassland (ecotone) and desert. The actual ET had a certain correlation relationship with NDVI which indicated the features of land cover, thus different land cover type and surface water condition in Keriya Oasis were characterized and distinguished by the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) and obviously exhibited in NDVI-LST feature space. Land cover type and vegetation density, as well as soil moisture distribution, were identified as the most important biophysical and hydrological parameters influencing the spatial and temporal variation of oasis vegetation ET.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423534","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423534","Keriya Oasis;NDVI-LST Feature Space;Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration;SEBAL;TVDI","Atmospheric modeling;Costs;Ecosystems;Feedback;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Remote sensing;Temperature sensors;Vegetation mapping","hydrological techniques;hydrology;soil;vegetation;vegetation mapping","COST atmospheric correction model;China;Keriya Oasis;Landsat ETM+ imagery;NDVI;SEBAL model;Tarim Basin;arid land surface water-heat exchange;climate change;cropland;desert;high densely populated grassland;land cover change;land use type;low densely populated grassland ecotone;monowindow land surface temperature retrieval algorithm;oasis surface parameters;oasis vegetation evapotranspiration;remote sensing;soil moisture distribution;surface energy balance algorithm for land model;temperature vegetation dryness index;terrestrial ecosystem;vegetation density;vegetation structure parameters;water body;wetland","","0","","16","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present paper, we propose a technique that extracts the shape of moving objects by combining snakes and watershed algorithm. The proposed method comprises two steps. In the first step, snakes extract contours of moving objects as a result of the minimization of an energy function. In the second step, the conditional watershed algorithm extracts contours from a topographical surface including a new function term. This function term is introduced to improve the estimated contours considering boundaries of moving objects obtained by snakes.

But our previous studies show that in addition to this, the cross spectra of mixed waves consist of an extra term (see the companion paper submited to this symposium). Just this term leads to an inherent error of this algorithm which has not been considered yet. This paper presents an error analysis of Envisat ASAR level 2 algorithm for ocean wave spectra retrieval in different significant wave height, wavelength, wave direction and wave component conditions based on simulation technique. It shows that the inherent errors (1) change with above parameters, and are always positive which mean the retrieved ocean wave height are overestimated; (2) increase for larger significant wave height; (3) increase for smaller wavelength; (4) increases for smaller propagation angle respect to azimuth direction. (5) increase for more wind wave component. Therefore, Envisat ASAR level 2 algorithm only works in small wave height, or large wavelength, or large propagation angle, or few wind wave component conditions.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423070","Envisat ASAR algorithm;SAR;error analysis;simulation","Analytical models;Azimuth;Error analysis;Flowcharts;Helium;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Ocean waves;Polarization;Synthetic aperture radar","error analysis;ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","ESA Envisat ASAR level 2 algorithm;SAR image cross spectra;error analysis;ocean wave spectra retrieval;synthetic aperture radar;wave component conditions;wave direction;wave height;wave propagation;wind wave","","0","","7","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its objective is to provide global and frequent soil moisture (SM) and sea surface salinity (SSS) maps. SMOS' single payload is the Microwave Imaging Radiometer by Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) sensor, an L-band two-dimensional aperture synthesis interferometric radiometer. To help in the retrieval process, auxiliary data will be used in combination with the brightness temperatures measured by MIRAS. In the salinity retrieval case, the main data sources are the sea state, the sea surface temperature, and the salinity values (even at low density sampling), which would allow a more accurate retrieval and a better quality product. One of the obvious candidates of auxiliary data is the ARGO buoy array. In this study, two different algorithms are proposed to use the ARGO salinity measurements in the retrieval procedure and provide coherent SSS maps with these measurements: The first algorithm is referred to as the ""external brightness temperature calibration"" [1] and aims at eliminating the bias introduced by the instrument errors and the image reconstruction process at the brightness temperature level; The second algorithm is referred to as the ""external salinity calibration"", and aims at correcting the biases introduced by the retrieval algorithm [2] as well, due to an imperfect dielectric constant model and an imperfect sea state parameterization in the emissivity model. Using the SMOS End-to-end Performance Simulator (SEPS) [3] as a source of SMOS-like brightness temperatures and the ARGO data as the source of auxiliary parameters, a series of simulations have been performed both in open ocean, and in coastal regions using a SMOS Level 2 Processor Simulator (L2PS) developed by the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC).

Environmental and economic impacts of red tides have increased in the recent years. Thus, considerable efforts have been spent on red tides research. Ocean color remote sensing is one of the useful techniques, and the research of retrieving the concentrations of the water components has been applied in the areas. Because of the complex of the water properties, the pigment concentrations are hard to retrieve. Some algorithms, including of experiment algorithms and semi-analytic algorithms, have been developed or used to retrieve pigment concentrations. However, no suitable algorithm can be used directly to retrieve pigment concentrations in the red tides areas of the ECS now. In this paper we present a semi-analytic algorithm to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentrations in the red tides areas of the ECS. Based on the measurements of the red-tide cruises in the ECS during 2002-2005, we have developed a spectral simulation model. Then the semi-analytic algorithm with MODIS wavelengths has been developed based on the simulation data. Different bands combinations have been trained to make the algorithm the best performance. The in situ measurements have been applied to validate the algorithm. When the concentrations of the total suspended matters are lower than 7 gm-3, the relative mean error of the algorithm is 38.34% and the correlative coefficient between the retrieved chlorophyll-a concentrations and in situ data is 0.8. The results show that the retrieved data agree well with the in situ ones. The algorithm can be used to retrieve the chlorophyll-a concentrations in the red tides areas of the ECS.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4422955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4422955","","Environmental economics;Information retrieval;MODIS;Oceans;Pigmentation;Remote sensing;Sea measurements;Tides;Water;Wavelength measurement","oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;seawater","AD 2002to 2005;East China Sea;MODIS wavelength;chlorophyll-a concentration;correlative coefficient;economic impact;environmental impact;ocean color remote sensing;pigment concentration retrieval;red tides area;spectral simulation model;total suspended matter;water properties","","0","","11","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead the 16-day Collection 4 MODIS BRDFs at 0.05deg resolution (derived using either full inversions or magnitude inversions from the MOD43 values) were employed in a magnitude inversion scheme for the 4 common MERIS (490plusmn5 [b3], 560plusmn5 [b5], 665plusmn5 [b7], 865plusmn10 [bl3]) bands with MODIS (459-479 {b3}, 545-565 {b4}, 620-670 {bl}, 841-8766 {b2}). The impact of applying Terra-only compared to Terra+Aqua-combined are here compared and presented. In keeping with previously reported results, there are larger numbers of full MODIS inversions (and consequently better MERIS albedos) for the combined BRDF but the total number of MODIS BRDF retrievals remains stubbornly similar. Spectral interpolation to the remaining 9 MERIS bands and to 3 broadband regions (0.4-0.7 mum, 0.7-3 mum, 0.4-3 mum) is then performed using polynomial look-up tables derived by Dr Shunlin Liang (University of Maryland). As spectral albedo data is required on monthly time-steps for most applications, a simple- minded weighting function based on the fractional time-period of ea- h 16-day time period within a month was adopted for creating monthly products from 16-day products at 10km and 0.1deg. Global products on a 16-day time-step are being generated for the whole time period using both Terra-only and, where available, Terra+Aqua-combined Collection 4 MODlS-BRDFs. These EO products have been compared against contemporaneous MODIS spectral albedos (over 16-days) which have been gap-filled (Moody et al., 2005) as well as Collection 5 products, where available. Satellite intercomparisons have also been performed for monthly products of the monthly MERIS spectral albedo products for common bands against M1SR level-3 and POLDER level-3 products as well as for a subset of M1SR level-2 instantaneous products and the results will be shown here. Finally, inter-comparisons are shown of these EO products against ground-based albedometer measurements for a site in Finland will be presented as representative of one of several worldwide sites available through the CA VE taking into account, where necessary, issues associated with land cover heterogeneity.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423326","MERIS;albedo;data fusion;intercomparisons with MODIS and MISR","Aerosols;Clouds;Earth;Information retrieval;Instruments;Interpolation;Land surface;MODIS;Polynomials;Snow","aerosols;albedo;clouds;remote sensing;sensor fusion;snow","AD 2002 06 to 2006 12;ALBEDOMAP;ENVISAT-MERIS instrument;EO products;MERIS land surface albedo retrieval;MODIS BRDF;aerosol correction;cloud detection;data fusion;ground-based albedometer;land cover heterogeneity;snow detection;spectral surface directional reflectances","","2","","9","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Potamianos","","Web Intelligence, IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on","20080107","2007","","","381","387","In this paper, we propose two novel web-based metrics for semantic similarity computation between words. Both metrics use a web search engine in order to exploit the retrieved information for the words of interest. The first metric considers only the page counts returned by a search engine, based on the work of [1]. The second downloads a number of the top ranked documents and applies ""widecontext"" and ""narrow-context"" metrics. The proposed metrics work automatically, without consulting any human annotated knowledge resource. The metrics are compared with WordNet-based methods. The metrics' performance is evaluated in terms of correlation with respect to the pairs of the commonly used Charles - Miller dataset. The proposed ""wide-context"" metric achieves 71% correlation, which is the highest score achieved among the fully unsupervised metrics in the literature up to date.","","POD:0-7695-3026-5","10.1109/WI.2007.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427120","","Data mining;Humans;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Ontologies;Search engines;Semantic Web;Social network services;Web pages;Web search","","","","4","1","25","","","2-5 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researchers believe that the extension with semantic knowledge could improve the results and various methods (most of them are heuristic) have been proposed to account for concept hierarchy, synonymy, and other semantic relationships. However, the results with such semantic extension have been mixed, ranging from slight improvements to decreases in effectiveness, mostly likely due to the lack of a formal framework. Instead, we propose a novel method to address the semantic extension within the framework of language modeling. Our method extracts explicit topic signatures from documents and then statistically maps them into single- word features. The incorporation of semantic knowledge then reduces to the smoothing of unigram language models using semantic knowledge. The dragon toolkit reflects our method and its effectiveness is demonstrated by three tasks, text retrieval, text classification, and text clustering.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:0-7695-3015-X","10.1109/ICTAI.2007.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410380","","Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Information science;Large-scale systems;Ontologies;Smoothing methods;Text categorization;Unified modeling language","classification;data mining;information retrieval;pattern clustering;semantic networks;specification languages;text analysis","auto-learned semantic knowledge;dragon toolkit;feature matching;language modeling;large-scale text retrieval;text classification;text clustering;text mining;text semantics;topic signatures;unigram language models","","11","2","25","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objects of interest generally occupy only one small part of images, so the image segmentation with different object regions must be conducted for the region-based image retrieval schemes. However, accurate object segmentation is still beyond current computer vision technique. Here, we proposed one feasible image retrieval scheme based the hierarchical uniform segmentations, which avoid the complexity of image segmentations. Firstly, the querying image is segmented into equal blocks at different hierarchical levels, and the more blocks with larger hierarchical levels. Then, according to the similar metrics of these different size blocks to the expectation image into segmentations, the images containing querying objects can be retrieved with information about scales and locations of query objects in retrieved images. Finally, the proposed image retrieval schemes are tested by experiments via database with 500 images, and the retrieval accuracy can achieve 78% for the optimal similar metric threshold, and is comparable to that of region-based schemes.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3072-7; POD:0-7695-3072-9","10.1109/CIS.2007.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4415386","","Computational intelligence;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Histograms;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Object segmentation","","","","0","","13","","","15-19 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Texture feature extraction and description using gabor wavelet in content-based medical image retrieval","Gang Zhang; Zong-Min Ma","School of Software Engineering, Shenyang University of Technology, China","2007 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","20080107","2007","1","","169","173","Gabor wavelet is one of the important methods for texture feature extraction and description in content-based medical image retrieval. Usually Gabor wavelet is used for a special scale set and a special direction set. However, this usually cannot extract the most discriminative texture features. In this paper, a new method for texture feature extraction and description is proposed. The method starts from whole scale space and whole direction space, and extracts time-frequency coefficients from each scale and each direction using Gabor wavelet. The energy is computed according to the coefficients, and dominant multi-scale and multi-direction fuzzy set is computed based on all energy computed. The standardized energy is used to measure the dominance of each element. Texture feature vector is computed according to the fuzzy set. The similarity measure is carried out between the fuzzy sets. When two images are of the same kind, their similarity measure is carried out between the texture feature vectors of two images. The experiments show that the method prosed in the paper has good retrieval performances for normal medical images.","2158-5695;21585695","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1066-8; POD:978-1-4244-1065-1","10.1109/ICWAPR.2007.4420657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420657","Gabor wavelet;content-based medical image retrieval;multi-scale and multi-direction fuzzy set;texture feature extraction and description","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Fuzzy sets;Image retrieval;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Time frequency analysis;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;image texture;medical computing;time-frequency analysis;wavelet transforms","Gabor wavelet;content-based medical image retrieval;multi-direction fuzzy set;standardized energy;texture feature extraction;texture feature vectors;time-frequency coefficients","","14","","11","","","2-4 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many authors have demonstrated the role of remote sensing in the assessment of the equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the weight of liquid water per unit of leaf surface. However, forest fire danger models rely on fuel moisture content (FMC) as a measure of vegetation moisture. FMC is defined as the ratio of the leaf liquid water weight over the leaf dry weight. In a previous research it has been shown the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) ground reflectance data in retrieving both EWT and FMC at leaf level.
