However, the performance of the AIA approaches is not satisfactory. The interaction of user is needed to solve this problem. The annotation is refined during the interaction by using semantic-based relevance feedback. This approach has a limit as only the annotations of found images during the interaction are updated. In this paper we introduce a novel method of semi-automatic annotation. The method is using visual feature representations of keywords which are improved during the region-based relevance feedback.

It is possible to retrieve images from database using a unique identification defined by a human operator as an index to images, but it is more reasonable to index images based on their contents. The principle of Content-Based Image Retrieval system is to retrieve images based on the content of the images. One of the important components in the system is to extract the visual features of the images for performing more abstract analysis. However, some of these features are computationally expensive. To solve this issue, a flexible Distributed parallel architecture has been proposed to improve the extraction time for the system.

Nowadays city management, as one of the aspects of management, is becoming more important and critical and in order to have a successful city management, reliable and update urban services data accessibility is one of the main issues. To be able to grant more efficient services to citizens it is necessary to utilize new methods of publishing and management of urban services data. This issue becomes more complicated where there are lots of users with distinct computing platforms and preferences. In this regards, using interoperable solutions to publish urban services data must be considered. . There are plenty of solutions to provide interoperability and the most widely used technologies in GI community are OGC services framework. In IT community, Service Oriented Architecture through Web services technologies provide the full potential of interoperability among heterogeneous computing platforms. In this regard, OGC services and Web services technologies are not directly compatible. Integrating OGC services and Web services enables us to provide fully interoperable solution. The underlying issue in integrating OGC services and Web Services is the predefined functionality inherent to the OGC services and the lack of any predefined functionality in the Web Services technologies. In order to publish urban services data, efficient data management and retrieval mechanisms, to provide highest possible performance and scalability, are needed. This paper is focused on evaluating two distinct data storage and retrieval approaches to compare performance and scalability. Afterwards this paper identifies the implementation issues of developing interoperable services and then proposes standard-based approaches to overcome these issues.

Proposals in the literature either present new indices without discussing how to cluster data, potentially resulting in many disk seeks for lookups of densely packed objects, or use static quadtrees or other partitioning structures, which become rapidly suboptimal as the data or queries evolve. As a result of these performance limitations, we built TrajStore, a dynamic storage system optimized for efficiently retrieving all data in a particular spatiotemporal region. TrajStore maintains an optimal index on the data and dynamically co-locates and compresses spatially and temporally adjacent segments on disk. By letting the storage layer evolve with the index, the system adapts to incoming queries and data and is able to answer most queries via a very limited number of I/Os, even when the queries target regions containing hundreds or thousands of different trajectories.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-5446-4; POD:978-1-4244-5445-7; USB:978-1-4244-5444-0","10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447829","","Adaptive systems;Aggregates;Databases;Drives;Global Positioning System;Information retrieval;Manipulator dynamics;Phase change materials;Proposals;Spatiotemporal phenomena","pattern clustering;query processing;temporal databases;tree data structures","GPS;TrajStore;adaptive storage system;broadband speed wireless devices;data clustering;database storage systems;location based services;spatio temporal data sets;static quadtrees","","29","","22","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering is the classification of a data set into subsets (clusters), so that the data in each subset (ideally) share some common trait - often proximity according to some defined distance measure. It can enable users to find the relevant documents more easily and also help users to form an understanding of the different facets of the query that have been provided for web search engine. A popular technique for clustering is based on K-means such that the data is partitioned into K clusters. In this method, the groups are identified by a set of points that are called the cluster centers. The data points belong to the cluster whose center is closest. Existing algorithms for k-means clustering are slow and do not scale to large number of data points and converge to different local minima based on the initializations. A fast greedy k-means algorithm can attack both these drawbacks, but it is a limitation when the algorithm is used for large number of data points, So we introduce an efficient method to compute the distortion for this algorithm. The experiment results show that the fast greedy algorithm is superior to other method and can help users to find the relevant documents more easily than by relevance ranking.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5681-9; POD:978-1-4244-5680-2","10.1109/IC4E.2010.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432478","Document clustering;Search engine;fast greedy k-means","Clustering algorithms;Databases;Electronic learning;Greedy algorithms;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Search engines;Software algorithms;Web pages;Web search","Web sites;document handling;greedy algorithms;pattern clustering;query processing;relevance feedback;search engines","Web page;Web search engine retrieval system;cluster center;data set classification;document clustering;fast greedy k-means algorithm;k-means clustering;query;relevance ranking","","3","","8","","","22-24 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The annoying problem with XML documents is that they have a very high ratio of redundancy, which makes these documents storage demanding and require a large network band-width for transmission. To remedy this problem, a lot of approaches had been conducted in order to compress XML documents. Some of these approaches supply querying the compressed documents, while others compress the XML documents for archival purposes. In this paper we propose a new XML compression technique that obeys the structure of the XML documents and provides the ability to querying the compressed document with both content and structure (CAS) queries type. XML elements and attributes names are encoded by using fixed-point dictionary-based technique. Other XML data are organized into special containers according to their path from the root attribute, and the containers are compressed using the same fixed-point technique. Using different types of XML documents and different styles of user queries, the XQPoint has been experimented to test its effectiveness in both the compression ratio and the querying performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5700-7; POD:978-1-4244-5698-7","10.1109/IIT.2009.5413789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5413789","XML;compression","Arithmetic;Containers;Content addressable storage;Encoding;Huffman coding;Information retrieval;Testing;Text analysis;Web sites;XML","Internet;XML;content-based retrieval;data compression;data structures;information retrieval systems","World Wide Web;XML compression;XQPoint;archival purpose;content and structure queries;data representation;data transformation;documents storage;fixed-point dictionary;queriable homomorphic XML compressor","","0","","16","","","15-17 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In XML keyword search, query semantics is based on the concept of Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA). However, naive LCA-based semantics leads to exponential computation and result size. In the literature, LCA-based semantic variants (e.g., ELCA and SLCA) were proposed, which define a subset of all the LCAs as the results. While most existing work focuses on algorithmic efficiency, top-K processing for XML keyword search is an important issue that has received very little attention. Existing algorithms focusing on efficiency are designed to optimize the semantic pruning and are incapable of supporting top-K processing. On the other hand, straightforward applications of top-K techniques from other areas (e.g., relational databases) generate LCAs that may not be the results and unnecessarily expand efforts in the semantic pruning. In this paper, we propose a series of join-based algorithms that combine the semantic pruning and the top-K processing to support top-K keyword search in XML databases. The algorithms essentially reduce the keyword query evaluation to relational joins, and incorporate the idea of the top-K join from relational databases. Extensive experimental evaluations show the performance advantages of our algorithms.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-5446-4; POD:978-1-4244-5445-7; USB:978-1-4244-5444-0","10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447818","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Data engineering;Database languages;Design optimization;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Query processing;Relational databases;XML","XML;data mining;query formulation;relational databases","LCA based semantic variant;Lowest Common Ancestor;Top-K keyword search;XML databases;information discovery method;join based algorithm;keyword query evaluation;query semantics;relational databases;semantic pruning","","20","","31","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because the network can be modeled using graphs, the partitioning of the trajectory data is based on graph partitioning theory and can be tuned for a given query load. The data in each partition is indexed on the time component using B<sup>+</sup>-trees. We study different types of queries, and provide an optimal configuration for several scenarios. PARINET can easily be integrated into any RDBMS, which is an essential asset particularly for industrial or commercial applications.

A typical CBIR system captures image features that represent image properties such as color, texture, or shape of objects in the query image and try to retrieve images from the database with similar features. Recent advances in CBIR systems include relevance feedback based interactive systems. The main advantage of CBIR systems with relevance feedback is that these systems take into account the gap between the high-level concepts and low-level features and subjectivity of human perception of visual content. In this paper, we propose a new approach for image storage and retrieval called association-based image retrieval (ABIR). We try to mimic human memory.

"LU: A Best First Search to Process Single-Origin Multiple-Destination Route Query in a Graph","Q. Lu","MacroSys, LLC, WA, USA","2010 Second International Conference on Advanced Geographic Information Systems, Applications, and Services","20100325","2010","","","137","142","A single-origin multiple-destination route (SOMDR)query is to retrieve the minimum-cost routes, each of which starts from the same origin and ends at one of a set of destinations. The query is typically used for route assignment in transportation networks in GEOProcessing. In this paper,LU, a fundamental best first search algorithm and framework,is proposed to process SOMDR queries in a graph. It uses a heuristic, h_LU, estimated based on destinations yet-to-be reached to expedite the search process following a best first way. It is a framework that can adopt different heuristics to provide optimal and sub-optimal solutions. The paper discusses how to incorporate heuristic information obtained from the problem domain into a formal mathematical theory of graph searching and how a family of search strategies can demonstrate an optimality property in a sub graph. As an example, the Euclidean distance between two vertices is used as the basis to provide a consistent heuristic, h_LU, for LU to process SOMDR queries in network distance in a transportation network and a set of experiments is performed accordingly. The result demonstrates that LU is much more efficient than Dijkstra's algorithm when the number of destinations is relatively smaller than the total number of vertices in a graph. On average, Dijkstra's algorithm expands0.2~4.7 times more vertices and is 0.2~20.6 times slower than LU to retrieve optimal solutions when the number of destinations is up to 100. As a best first search, LU extends the capability of existing best first searches from single-destination query processing to multi-destination query processing. For SOMDR query processing, Dijkstra's algorithm is a special case of LU when no heuristic is adopted during the search process, and A* is a special case of LU when the number of destinations is one.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5810-3; POD:978-1-4244-5809-7","10.1109/GEOProcessing.2010.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437660","Best First Search;LU;Single-Source Multiple-Destination","Costs;Euclidean distance;Geographic Information Systems;Information retrieval;Query processing;Routing;Transportation","heuristic programming;network routing;network theory (graphs);optimisation;query processing;telecommunication network management;transportation","Dijkstra algorithm;GEOProcessing;SOMDR;best first search;first search algorithm;graph searching;heuristic information;mathematical theory;minimum cost routes;multi destination query processing;optimal solutions;route assignment;single destination query processing;single origin multiple destination route query;suboptimal solutions;transportation networks","","0","","10","","","10-16 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a 7T-SRAM cell to increase the read/write stability under large variations. The proposed design uses a low overhead read/write assist circuitry to increase the noise immunity. Use of an additional transistor and a floating ground allows read disturb free operation. While the write assist circuitry provides a floating ground during a write operation that weakens cell storage by turning off the supply voltage to ground path of the cross-coupled inverter pair.

However, in this process, it also brings some non-relevance terms in the relevant documents in the new query. The number of non-relevance terms will increase according to the repeat of feedback process; it will damage the retrieval performance finally. This paper introduces a SVM Based method for relevance feedback. We train a classifier on the feedback documents and classify the rest of the documents. Thus, in the result list, the relevant documents are in front of the non-relevant documents. The new approach avoids modifying the query via text classification algorithm in the relevance feedback process, and it is a new direction for the relevance feedback techniques.

For the first part, a successful fusion strategy is proposed for effectively combining information from color and texture features. The experiment indicates that the retrieval accuracy based on this fusion method is better than only using either of color feature or texture feature. In another part of key frame sets matching, this paper tries to solve the problem from the view of the subspace method. The latest and novel subspace method of Discriminative Canonical Correlations (DCC) is adopted.

The presence of these long delays between the updates, along with the need for the intermediate results to be instantly available, makes supporting real-world activities in the database engine a challenging task. In this paper, we address these challenges through a system that enables users to reflect their updates immediately into the database while keeping track of the dependent and potentially invalid data items until they are re-validated. The proposed system includes: (1) semantics and syntax for interfaces through which users can express the dependencies among data items, (2) new operators to alert users when the returned query results contain potentially invalid or out-of-date data, and to enable evaluating queries on either valid data only, or both valid and potentially invalid data, and (3) mechanisms for data invalidation and revalidation.

For the purpose of assigning the fusion weights of multi-feature similarity scores reasonably, the genetic algorithm is applied. For comparison, other three methods are implemented.

Subjects of postings can be partly retrieved by state of the art text mining techniques. A much more challenging task is to detect factors influencing the evolvement of opinions within the social network. For such a kind of trend scouting you have to take into account the relationships among the community members. Social network analysis helps to explain social behavior of linked persons by providing quantitative measures of social interactions. A new approach based on social network analysis is presented, which allows detecting opinion leaders and opinion trends. This leads a better understanding of opinion formation.

The PDV is used to measure the similarity measurement by computing sum of square distance between query and data base images.

To this end, we analyze the area, delay, and power overhead for designing the S-Box, which is one of the main complex blocks in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), with error detection and correction capability. We use multiple Parity Predictions (PPs), based on various error correcting codes, to detect and correct errors. Various coding techniques are presented, which include simple parity prediction, split parity codes, Hamming, Hsiao, and LDPC codes.

Given a query Q and a quantile Â¿ Â¿ (0, 1), we firstly study the problem of efficiently computing K nearest objects based on a Â¿-quantile distance e.g. median distance from each object to Q. The second problem is to retrieve the K nearest objects to Q based on overall distances in the Â¿best populationÂ¿ with a given size specified by Â¿-quantile for each object. While the first problem can be solved in polynomial time, we show that the 2nd problem is NP-hard.

In this paper, we propose an approach, which we refer to as BioConvolving, that is able to guarantee security and renewability to biometric templates. Specifically, we introduce a set of noninvertible transformations, which can be applied to any biometrics whose template can be represented by a set of sequences, in order to generate multiple transformed versions of the template. Once the transformation is performed, retrieving the original data from the transformed template is computationally as hard as random guessing. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach is applied to an on-line signature recognition system, where a hidden Markov model-based matching strategy is employed. The performance of a protected on-line signature recognition system employing the proposed BioConvolving approach is evaluated, both in terms of authentication rates and renewability capacity, using the MCYT signature database. The reported extensive set of experiments shows that protected and renewable biometric templates can be properly generated and used for recognition, at the expense of a slight degradation in authentication performance.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2041653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437195","Biometrics;cancelable biometrics;hidden Markov model (HMM);security;signature verification;template protection","Authentication;Biometrics;Data security;Databases;Handwriting recognition;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Privacy;Protection;Speech analysis","biometrics (access control);digital signatures;hidden Markov models;image matching","BioConvolving;MCYT signature database;authentication rates;automatic people recognition;biometric technology;biometric-based authentication systems;cancelable templates;hidden Markov model-based matching strategy;protected online signature recognition system;random guessing;renewability capacity;renewable biometric templates;sequence-based biometrics","","31","","57","","20100322","May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Instability of Relevance-Ranked Results Using Latent Semantic Indexing for Web Search","H. Kettani; G. B. Newby","ECECS Dept., Polytech. Univ. of Puerto Rico, San Juan, PR, USA","2010 43rd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","20100311","2010","","","1","6","The latent semantic indexing (LSI) methodology for information retrieval applies the singular value decomposition to identify an eigensystem for a large matrix, in which cells represent the occurrence of terms (words) within documents. This methodology is used to rank text documents, such as Web pages or abstracts, based on their relevance to a topic. The LSI was introduced to address the issues of synonymy (different words with the same meaning) and polysemy (the same words with multiple meanings), thus addressing the ambiguity in human language by utilizing the statistical context of words. Rather than keeping all k possible eigenvectors and eigenvalues from the singular value decomposition which approximates the original term by document matrix, a smaller number is used - essentially allowing a fuzzy match of a topic to the original term by document matrix. In this paper, we show that the choice k impacts the resultant ranking and there is no value of k that results in stability of ranked results for similarity of the topic to documents. This is a surprising result, because prior literature indicates that eigensystems based on successively large values of k should approximate the complete (max k) eigensystems. The finding that document-query similarity rankings with larger values of k do not, in fact, maintain consistency, makes it difficult to assert that any particular value of k is optimal. This in turn renders LSI potentially untrustworthy for use in ranking text documents, even for values that differ by only 10% of the max k.","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:978-1-4244-5510-2; POD:978-1-4244-5509-6","10.1109/HICSS.2010.235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428326","","Abstracts;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Singular value decomposition;Web pages;Web search","Internet;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;fuzzy set theory;indexing;information retrieval;matrix algebra;search engines;singular value decomposition","Web abstracts;Web pages;Web search;document matrix;document-query similarity rankings;eigensystem;eigenvectors and eigenvalues;fuzzy match;human language;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;relevance-ranked results;singular value decomposition","","1","","14","","","5-8 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such an unfavorable circumstance the legwork mechanism assists the suggesting module by handing over the relevant information after finding one or more webpages, containing at least one clue keyword.

The performance of C*-P and C*-Dijkstra are analyzed with a set of experiments in a large urban dense transportation network, and the results show that on average, C*-Dijkstra is 5.9~8.8 times slower and expands 4.3~5.0 times more states than C*-P, with number of categories up to 7 and number of objects in each category up to 3800.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5810-3; POD:978-1-4244-5809-7","10.1109/GEOProcessing.2010.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5437663","Bivariate Best First Search;Heuristic;Multi-Category Based Query","Algorithm design and analysis;Geographic Information Systems;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Information technology;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Process planning;Transportation;Urban areas","algorithm theory;graph theory;query formulation","bivariate best first search;category based query;category sequence traversal queries;minimum cost path;predefined origin destination pair;transportation network;transportation trip planning","","0","","16","","","10-16 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While numerous preference evaluation methods for databases have been proposed (e.g., skyline, top-k, k-dominance, k-frequency), the implementation of these methods at the core of a database system is a double-edged sword. Core implementation provides efficient query processing for arbitrary database queries, however this approach is not practical as each existing (and future) preference method requires a custom query processor implementation. To solve this problem, this paper introduces FlexPref, a framework for extensible preference evaluation in database systems. FlexPref, implemented in the query processor, aims to support a wide-array of preference evaluation methods in a single extensible code base. Integration with FlexPref is simple, involving the registration of only three functions that capture the essence of the preference method. Once integrated, the preference method Â¿livesÂ¿ at the core of the database, enabling the efficient execution of preference queries involving common database operations. To demonstrate the extensibility of FlexPref, we provide case studies showing the implementation of three database operations (single table access, join, and sorted list access) and five state-of-the-art preference evaluation methods (top-k, skyline, k-dominance, top-k dominance, and k-frequency). We also experimentally study the strengths and weaknesses of an implementation of FlexPef in PostgreSQL over a range of single-table and multi-table preference queries.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-5446-4; POD:978-1-4244-5445-7; USB:978-1-4244-5444-0","10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447881","","Computer science;Data engineering;Database systems;Decision making;Engines;Indexes;Information retrieval;Optimization methods;Query processing","query processing","FlexPref;arbitrary database queries;database systems;double edged sword;extensible preference evaluation framework;multitable preference queries;query processing;query processor implementation;single table access;singletable preference queries;sorted list access","","8","","41","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Every neuroscience experiment gathers data on the entire subject, not only the brain, and the brain is the behavioral, not only cognitive, organ in humans. All neuroscience data is therefore correlational: data on the neurobiology when the subject is engaging in behavior X. Behavior is a multi-faceted phenomenon that can be formally parameterized. Using the various facets of behavior as formal parameters, we define the dimensions of a space that covers the range of behaviors; specifying values of the behaviors subjects are engaging in while neuroscience data is gathered identifies the location of the data in behavior space. Having this index provides precise specification of the independent variables of the experiment, necessary information for sharing of data and comparison of results, and guides the development of theory, experiment, and interpretation of findings. The example of drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior is used to illustrate the concept and its use.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5930-8; POD:978-1-4244-5929-2","10.1109/BioSciencesWorld.2010.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5445571","behavior parameters;behavioral indexing;behavioral neuroscience;formal models of behavior;neuroinformatics databases","Animals;Cognition;Databases;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Neuroimaging;Neuroscience;Psychology;Reverse engineering","bioinformatics;brain;neurophysiology","behavioral indexing;brain;drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior;multi-faceted phenomenon;neuoscience experiment;neurobiology","","0","","18","","","7-13 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To quantify our results, we conducted a field experiment with 27 and a survey with 782 subjects. We found a strong correlation between change frequency and preferred integration approaches.

Compared to previous related works, it does not require manual preprocessing to prepare training data. In terms of processing time, it does not need to search for many concepts in the lexical ontology. Furthermore, it is able to handle an unlimited number of ontological concepts in any domain. Our system employs latent semantic analysis together with context voting to find the appropriate concept of the instance. The experiments demonstrate that this approach compared to similarity approach yields higher accuracy for instance classification. In sum, the system achieves higher accuracy when the lexical ontology contains a lot of concepts, which generally occurs in practical problems.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5586-7; POD:978-1-4244-5569-0","10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451997","Instance Classification;Latent Semantic Analysis;Lexical Ontology","Artificial intelligence;Computational linguistics;Databases;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information technology;Motion pictures;Ontologies;Training data;Voting","computational linguistics;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","artificial intelligence;computational linguistics application;instances classification;knowledge base;latent semantic analysis;lexical ontology concepts;unsupervised instance population system","","1","","12","","","26-28 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework consists of the following phases: (1) building the semantic E-learning domain using the known college and course information as concept and sub-concept, (2) generating the semantic user profiles as ontologies, (3) clustering the documents to discover more refined sub-concepts, (4) re-ranking the user's search results based on his/her profile, and (5) providing the user with semantic recommendations. The implementation of the ontologies models is separate from the design and implementation of the information retrieval system, thus providing a modular framework that is easy to adapt and port to other platforms.

Other methods use snow physical and/or snow electromagnetic (EM) models to estimate SD. Here, we introduce novel retrieval approaches that dynamically combine ancillary SD information (e.g., from snow physical models driven with surface meteorological data) with established algorithms based on regression or EM modeling. The basic idea is to recalibrate regression coefficients (or the effective grain size in the case of EM models) once per week in a simple data assimilation scheme. SD is retrieved from Special Sensor Microwave Imager brightness temperature data and evaluated against <i>in situ</i> observations from 37 stations throughout the Northern Hemisphere. As expected, the SD retrievals perform better with (weekly) ancillary SD inputs from <i>in situ</i> measurements (not used in validation) than with (weekly) ancillary SD inputs from snow physical modeling. The best results are obtained with the regression-based approach using dynamically recalibrated coefficients and ancillary SD inputs from <i>in situ</i> observations (rmse = 6 cm). The regression approach still performs better with the time average of the dynamic coefficients (rmse = 8 cm) than with standard literature values based on climatology (""REGR-CLIM""; rmse = 50 cm). For SD retrieval with an EM model, we obtain results comparable to REGR-CLIM (rmse = 44 cm). Driving the novel regression approaches with SD estimates from snow physical modeling still results in improvements over REGR-CLIM for all approaches (rmse = 15 cm). Comparable SD estimates are obtained from the snow physical model alone.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2009.2036910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5404397","Microwave;remote sensing;snow","Brightness temperature;Data assimilation;Electromagnetic modeling;Frequency;Grain size;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Linear regression;Meteorology;Snow","hydrological techniques;remote sensing;snow","Northern Hemisphere;Special Sensor Microwave Imager;effective grain size;frequency 19 GHz;frequency 37 GHz;regression coefficients;remote sensing;snow depth retrieval;snow physical models;spaceborne data;spaceborne microwave brightness temperature;surface meteorological data)","","13","","34","","20100202","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For instance, PubMed allows users to submit highly expressive Boolean keyword queries, but ranks the query results by date only. However, a user would typically prefer a ranking by relevance, measured by an Information Retrieval (IR) ranking function. The naive approach would be to submit a disjunctive query with all query keywords, retrieve the returned documents, and then re-rank them. Unfortunately, such an operation would be very expensive due to the large number of results returned by disjunctive queries. In this paper we present algorithms that return the top results for a query, ranked according to an IR-style ranking function, while operating on top of a source with a Boolean query interface with no ranking capabilities (or a ranking capability of no interest to the end user). The algorithms generate a series of conjunctive queries that return only documents that are candidates for being highly ranked according to a relevance metric. Our approach can also be applied to other settings where the ranking is monotonic on a set of factors (query keywords in IR) and the source query interface is a Boolean expression of these factors. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation on the PubMed database and TREC dataset show that we achieve order of magnitude improvement compared to the current baseline approaches.","1063-6382;10636382","Electronic:978-1-4244-5446-4; POD:978-1-4244-5445-7; USB:978-1-4244-5444-0","10.1109/ICDE.2010.5447918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5447918","","Biomedical computing;Biomedical measurements;Computer interfaces;Databases;Immune system;Information management;Information retrieval;Optical computing;Trademarks;Web services","query processing;relevance feedback;user interfaces","Boolean query interfaces;PubMed algorithm;conjunctive queries;disjunctive query;information retrieval ranking function;query keywords;query ranking;querying mechanisms;ranking support;relevance metric;relevance ranking","","2","","15","","","1-6 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This involves somewhat more advanced query functionality than the usual pattern matching, as some notion of ""most relevant"" is involved. In information retrieval literature, this task is best achieved by using inverted indexes. However, inverted indexes work only for some predefined set of patterns. In the pattern matching community, the most popular pattern-matching data structures are suffix trees and suffix arrays. However, a typical suffix tree search involves going through all the occurrences of the pattern over the entire string collection, which might be a lot more than the required relevant documents. The first formal framework to study such kind of retrieval problems was given by Muthukrishnan. He considered two metrics for relevance: frequency and proximity. He took a threshold-based approach on these metrics and gave data structures taking O(n log n) words of space. We study this problem in a slightly different framework of reporting the top k most relevant documents (in sorted order) under similar and more general relevance metrics. Our framework gives linear space data structure with optimal query times for arbitrary score functions. As a corollary, it improves the space utilization for the problems in while maintaining optimal query performance. We also develop compressed variants of these data structures for several specific relevance metrics.","0272-5428;02725428","Electronic:978-0-7695-3850-1; POD:978-1-4244-5116-6","10.1109/FOCS.2009.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5438585","document retrieval;succinct data structures;text indexing;top-$k$ queries","Computer science;Data structures;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;Tree data structures;USA Councils","data structures;indexing;pattern matching;query processing;relevance feedback;trees (mathematics)","arbitrary score function;frequency metric;information retrieval;inverted indexes;linear space data structure;pattern-matching data structures;proximity metric;query functionality;relevance metrics;space-efficient framework;suffix arrays;suffix tree search;threshold-based approach;top-k string retrieval problem","","14","","36","","","25-27 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our scheme exploits the homomorphic secret sharing scheme to enable sensor nodes encode sensed data into several shares, and distribute them to their neighbors.

But even the smoothed analyses so far are unsatisfactory as the bounds are still super-polynomial in the number n of data points. In this paper, we settle the smoothed running time of the k-means method. We show that the smoothed number of iterations is bounded by a polynomial in n and 1/Â¿, where sigma is the standard deviation of the Gaussian perturbations.

The number of index terms per document is typically 4, which dramatically reduces associated cost in index storage and dissemination. iSearch explores two options to build index: top term-based indexing (TTI) and query-driven indexing (QDI). TTI bases selection of document index terms on term statistics, while QDI progressively refines document index by past queries.

This paper is one in a series describing reference configuration and sizing information for Access data warehouses for small, medium, large solutions to meet business data warehouse needs. The system can be used by managers and end-users to understand the business and make decisions. This system attempts to study OLAP queries which are in terms of a multidimensional data mode. According to the respective roles and privileges, OLAP queries can be retrieved from the data warehouse. The system analyses personnel data for technological universities in Myanmar. This system is implemented by using J Builder 9 language and Microsoft Access.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5586-7; POD:978-1-4244-5569-0","10.1109/ICCAE.2010.5451300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451300","Data warehouse;Star schema;and OLAP","Data analysis;Data mining;Data warehouses;Databases;Decision making;Decision support systems;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Personnel","business data processing;data warehouses;decision making;decision support systems;query processing;relational databases","Access data warehouses;J Builder 9 language;Microsoft Access;Myanmar;OLAP queries retrieval;business data warehouse;decision making;decision support system;information and communication technology;multidimensional data mode;personnel information;reference configuration;technological universities","","1","","10","","","26-28 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Review of Evaluation of Optimal Binarization Technique for Character Segmentation in Historical Manuscripts","C. C. Fung; R. Chamchong","Sch. of Inf. Technol., Murdoch Univ., Perth, WA, Australia","2010 Third International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","20100318","2010","","","236","240","A number of binarization techniques have been proposed in the past for automatic document processing. Although some studies have aimed to evaluate the performance of binarization algorithms, there is no automatic system that is capable of selecting the most appropriate method of binarization. While preprocessing techniques can be applied, binarization is essential to extract the objects in the first place before the characters can be separated for recognition. Although there are several commonly used binarization approaches, there is no single algorithm that is suitable for all images. Hence, there is a need to determine the optimal binarization algorithm for each image. The objective of this paper is to present a survey of the existing methods of binarization and evaluation measurement which have been developed recently. This will lead to the proposal and development of an approach for automatic selection of binarization techniques in handling historical document images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5398-6; POD:978-1-4244-5397-9","10.1109/WKDD.2010.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432648","binarization;evaluation measurement;image Segmentation;quantitative measurement","Character recognition;Data mining;Gray-scale;History;Image analysis;Image converters;Image recognition;Image storage;Information retrieval;Optical noise","character recognition;document image processing;image segmentation","automatic document processing;character segmentation;historical document image;historical manuscript;optimal binarization technique","","3","","21","","","9-10 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
