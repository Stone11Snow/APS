Singing voice separation is one of the active research areas since the singing voice itself contains abundant information within, such as melody, singer's characteristic, lyrics, language, emotion, etc. This wide variety of resources is very useful for diverse areas of multimedia research, including music information retrieval (MIR), singer identification, or even karaoke systems. However, this singing voice separation, especially in mono-channel environment, is very challenging problem, whose existing methods are still impractical for real world music. Our main contribution of this work is to propose a singing voice separation algorithm based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method that can effectively extract the singing voice from the mono-channel music. We demonstrate its utility and effectiveness by experiments in both quantitative evaluation and its pitch detection accuracy from the separated singing voice.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2336-1; POD:978-1-4244-2335-4","10.1109/ISCIT.2008.4700194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700194","","Communications technology;Data mining;Digital audio players;Electronic mail;Independent component analysis;Instruments;Internet;Multimedia systems;Music information retrieval;Source separation","matrix decomposition;music;source separation;speech processing","communication technology;digital music processing;karaoke systems;monochannel music;multimedia research;music information retrieval;nonnegative matrix factorization method;singer identification;singing voice separation","","2","","10","","","21-23 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The described approach provides means for the context adaptation of software components exposed as Web services independently of their specific implementation allowing for added flexibility concerning the adaptation itself or whether it is performed at all. As the service logic is clearly separated from the context adaptation, the same principle can be applied to composite Web services. Specifically, we show that different services and context sources can be combined to provide a Web application separating completely the application logic from the context adaptation. Context plugins loaded on runtime are responsible for invoking the right context sources to retrieve the necessary context information and complete the service adaptation to context.","2166-9570;21669570","POD:978-1-4244-2643-0","10.1109/PIMRC.2008.4699629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4699629","context;context adaptation;web services","Computer architecture;Context-aware services;Information retrieval;Logic;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Runtime;Service oriented architecture;Software performance;Web services","Web services;mobile computing","context adaptation;context-aware Web applications;mobile computing;mobile services;pervasive computing;service adaptation","","7","","16","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The contribution of this paper is to try to define some practical metrics based on imperfect data collected by an intrusion prevention system. Since attacks greatly differ, we propose to group the attacks into several attack type groups. We then define a set of metrics for each attack type group. We introduce an approach that consists in analyzing the evolution of these metrics per attack type group by focusing on outliers in order to give an insight into an organizationpsilas security. The method is assessed for an organization of about 40,000 computers.

Users usually save their mails permanently in mailboxes and retrieve them as need. In the database strategy, each mail is separated into several components and stored in the database individually. Whenever a user queries a specific mail, the mail server retrieves all the components from the database and make up a mail. By using database strategy, it is easy to develop new applications such as search and mobile retrieval. However, the recombination process is time-consuming and causes the response time between query and replay is long. In order to reduce the response time of mail retrieves, we proposed a prediction mechanism built in the mail server. The prediction mechanism predicts the mails that users would access with a high possibility. The mail server reconstructs these mails and saves them in cache. The prediction is based on the user behavior collection and analysis. In our implementation experience, we find that the response time would be reduced and the system performance does not reduce in evidence.","2164-7143;21647143","POD:978-0-7695-3382-7","10.1109/ISDA.2008.348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696516","","Bandwidth;Database systems;Deductive databases;Delay;Electronic mail;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Postal services;System analysis and design","cache storage;database management systems;electronic data interchange;electronic mail;information retrieval;prediction theory","electronic mail database system;information exchange;mail retrieval;mail server;prediction mechanism;user behavior analysis","","0","","15","","","26-28 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In IEEE 802.11 standard, a PS-STA periodically wakes up and retrieves data buffered at the Access Point through contending with both other PS-STAs and AM-STAs for its PS-Poll's transmission. Although AM-STAs usually have no concern with energy, their contention degrades the energy efficiency of PS-STAs, which usually have life concern, by 1) increasing the time duration for data retrieving and 2) increasing the number of PS-STAs which contend throughout the whole beacon interval but get no access opportunity. This paper first proposes a general priority based power saving mode (PBPSM) scheme which achieves PS-STAs' higher energy efficiency than PSM by assigning different channel access priorities. Then, we choose enhanced distributed channel access in IEEE 802.11e to implement the general mechanism and analyze PS-STAs' energy efficiency for both PSM and PBPSM.

This type of search is limited because keywords are not expressive enough to describe all important characteristics of an image. For example, an exact match request cannot be formulated in such systems and in SSI system, users should know natural language (e.g. English, French or German) used.

Otherwise the four precedent neighbors are used to predict the current index during data embedding and retrieving. Moreover, the difference expansion algorithm is used for lossless hiding secret data into prediction error. The prediction error of the indexed image will also be reduced.

Using the saliency maps as the positive and negative labels, the image features are mapped onto a lower-dimensional space using LDA. This enables us to construct a 3D-histogram by direct binning on the feature space. This gives rise to a ""cube"" of image features which have been projected onto a ower-dimensional space so as to maximise the separability of the salient regions with respect to the background. Image retrieval can be performed by computing the distances between the histograms for the query image and the images in the database.

The key is to leverage the resources available at end users, which offers great potential to scale in the Internet. Flash crowd poses a unique challenge for live streaming systems, in which there could be potentially hundred of thousands of users joining the system during the initial few minutes of a live program. This adds considerable difficulty in particular for a P2P based system in quickly ramping to a scale that can provide reasonable streaming services for newly incoming peers. In this paper, we examine the system dynamics under flash crowd based on measurements obtained from the Coolstreaming system. We are particularly concerned with the impact and user behaviors during flash crowd. The results reveal a number of interesting observations: (1) the system can scale up to a limit during the flash crowd; (2) there is a strong correlation between the number of short sessions and joining rate due to the resource competition among newly joined peers; (3) the user behavior during flash crowd can be best captured by the number of retries and the impatience time.","1930-529X;1930529X","POD:978-1-4244-2324-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698114","","Availability;Broadcasting;Contracts;Information retrieval;Internet;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Streaming media;Sun;Time factors","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;video streaming","Coolstreaming system;Internet video streaming;P2P-based live video streaming system;flash crowd dynamics","","26","","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a means to automatically gather and associate service feedback data with parts of the user's identity information. This allows a classification of users into groups with the same identity characteristics, yet maintaining the privacy protection compliant to applicable laws. The key point of this solution is the introduction of pseudonyms, which get linked to the usage statistics and feedback data collected by the service provider. An information query/response system provides the association between feedback and identity data over these pseudonyms, and enables the subsequent retrieval of statistical identity information about a group of users. However, identifying information remains undisclosed and the user's privacy protected.

A typical CBIR system captures image features that represent image properties such as color, texture, or shape of objects in the query image and try to retrieve images from the database with similar features. Recent advances in CBIR systems include relevance feedback based interactive systems. The main advantage of CBIR systems with relevance feedback is that these systems take into account the gap between the high-level concepts and low-level features and subjectivity of human perception of visual content. In this paper, we propose a new approach for image storage and retrieval called association-based image retrieval (ABIR). We try to mimic human memory.

A number of shape descriptors have been reported in the literature. Nevertheless, most of the reported descriptors still face accuracy and computational challenges. Fourier descriptors are considered to be promising descriptors as they are based on sound theoretical foundation, and possess computational efficiency and attractive invariance properties. In this paper, we propose a novel Fourier descriptor based on contour curvature. The proposed descriptor takes an unconventional view of the curvature-scale-space representation of a shape contour as it treats it as a 2-D binary image (hence referred to as Curvature-Scale Image, or CSI). The invariant descriptor is derived from the 2-D Fourier transform of the Curvature-Scale Image. This allows the descriptor to capture detailed dynamics of the shape curvature and enhance the efficiency of the shape matching process. Experiments using images from the MPEG-7 database have been conducted to compare the performance of the proposed descriptor with the Curvature- Scale-Space Descriptor (CSSD), the Generic Fourier Descriptor (GFD), and the 1-D Fourier Descriptor (1-FD).

A novel ranking strategy for search result is proposed to represent the relativity of XML segments and the query. In order to efficiently and effectively process the top-k keyword query on XML streams, based on this ranking strategy, a stack-based algorithm is proposed to dynamically obtain the top-k results with the highest ranks at any time, with a filtering method to delete redundant elements.

Since the data in text categorization field are high-dimensional, feature selection is crucial to make the task more efficient and precise. In this paper, we make an extensive evaluation of the feature selection metrics used in text categorization by using local and global policies. For the experiments, we use three datasets which vary in size, complexity and skewness. We use SVM as the classifier and tf-idf weighting for term weighting. We observed that almost in all metrics, local policy outperforms when the number of keywords is low and global policy outperforms as the number of keywords increases. In addition to the evaluation of the existing feature selection metrics, we propose new metrics, which have shown high success rates especially in datasets with a low number of keywords. Moreover, we propose a keyword selection policy called adaptive keyword selection (AKS). It is based on selecting different number of keywords for different classes and it improved the performance significantly in skew datasets.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2881-6; POD:978-1-4244-2880-9","10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4717900","","Electronic publishing;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Organizing;Software libraries;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization","support vector machines;text analysis","SVM;adaptive keyword selection;feature selection metrics;keyword selection policy;text categorization","","2","","13","","","27-29 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, in this phase-one version of the system, we use aerosol optical depths, surface temperatures, and lower atmospheric temperatures, all from climatology derived from Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (MGS-TES) data and from surface altimetry derived from MGS Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). The DISORT-based model takes the dust and ice aerosol optical depths (scaled to the CRISM wavelength range), the surface pressures (computed from MOLA altimetry, MGS-TES lower atmospheric thermometry, and Viking-based pressure climatology), the surface temperatures, the reconstructed instrumental photometric angles, and the measured I/F spectrum as inputs, and then a Lambertian albedo spectrum is computed as the output. The Lambertian albedo spectrum is valuable geologically because it allows the mineralogical composition to be estimated. Here, I/F is defined as the ratio of the radiance measured by CRISM to the solar irradiance at Mars divided by pi; if there was no martian atmosphere, I/F divided by the cosine of the incidence angle would be equal to the Lambert albedo for a Lambertian surface. After discussing the capabilities and limitations of the pipeline software system, we demonstrate its application on several multispectral data cubes-particularly, the outer reaches of the northern ice cap of Mars, the Tyrrhena Terra area that is northeast of the Hellas basin, and an area near the landing site for the Phoenix mission in the northern plains. For the icy spectra near the northern polar cap, aerosols need to be included in order to properly correct for the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption in the H<sub>2</sub>O ice bands at wavelengths near 2.0 mum. In future phases of software development, we intend to use CRISM data directly in order t- - o retrieve the spatiotemporal maps of aerosol optical depths, surface pressure, and surface temperature.

The results show that syntactic structure is not useful for text classification (as initially expected), but a novel structured representation that uses document's semantic information has the same discriminative power over classes as the traditional bag-of-words one.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725062","SVM;linguistic information;text classification;tree kernels","Information representation;Information retrieval;Kernel;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Morphology;Natural languages;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization","natural language processing;pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis","Portuguese language;SVM algorithm;classification target function;documents bag-of-words representation;linguistic information;machine learning;text classification;tree kernels","","0","","16","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Secure and Reliable Platform Configuration Change Reporting Mechanism for Trusted Computing Enhanced Secure Channels","K. Dietrich","Microcomputing Lab., Inst. for Appl. Inf. Process. & Commun., Graz","2008 The 9th International Conference for Young Computer Scientists","20081212","2008","","","2137","2142","The security of well established secure channel technologies like transport layer security (TLS) or IP security (IPSec) can be significantly improved by emerging concepts like trusted computing. The use of trusted platform modules (TPMs) offers new methods for improving the security of these well established technologies. How secure channel technologies can be adapted to use trusted computing concepts is subject to current research. A major part of this research addresses the integration of the TCG's specified remote attestation. Remote attestation enables a platform to provide a trustworthy proof of its current configuration (i.e. software that has been loaded on the platform). Hence, based on this proof, a remote platform can decide whether to open a channel to another platform or not. In current approaches, the proof of the platform configuration is processed before a secure channel is established, which is not opened if the reported configuration is not accepted by the hosts. However, one important problem has not been solved yet. Currently, no satisfying solution how the change of a platform's configuration can be securely and reliably reported to the remote platform whilst a channel is open, exists. A reliable method to provide a proof for a configuration change can be implemented with only minor modifications of the TPM specification and the TLS protocol. Experimental results show that it is possible to implement this proof mechanism with only a few additional TPM commands.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3398-8","10.1109/ICYCS.2008.530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4709304","TLS;Trusted computing;platform configuration reporting;secure channels","Certification;Computer security;Cryptography;Information processing;Information retrieval;Information security;Laboratories;Proposals;Protocols;Viruses (medical)","IP networks;computer network reliability;cryptographic protocols;telecommunication channels;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IP security;TLS protocol;TPM specification;cryptographic protocol;reliable platform configuration change reporting mechanism;secure channel technology;transport layer security;trusted computing;trusted platform module","","0","1","14","","","18-21 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visual codebooks are generated from the region clusters of low level features. These codebooks are then, matched with the words of the text document related to the image, in various ways. In this paper, we supervise the clustering process by using the orientation information assigned to each interest point of Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features to generate a visual codebook. The orientation information provides a set of constraints in a semi-supervised k-means region clustering algorithm. Consequently, in clustering of regions not only SIFT features are normalized along the dominant orientation, but also orientation information itself is used. Experimental results show that image annotation with added orientation information by semi-supervised clustering is more successful compared to the one that uses SIFT features alone. The proposed algorithm is implemented in a parallel computation environment.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2881-6; POD:978-1-4244-2880-9","10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4717882","","Bridges;Clustering algorithms;Concurrent computing;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Spatial databases;Visual databases;Vocabulary","image processing;pattern clustering","clustering process;image annotation;region clustering algorithms;scale-invariant feature transform;semisupervised clustering;semisupervised k-means","","1","","8","","","27-29 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an approach that models BPEL process models and process instances as resources and thus provides a uniform access scheme for process model and process instance data. This is crucial because access to process model and process instance data is needed in different scenarios that are of key relevance in enterprises today. These scenarios include compliance checking, repair of faulted business processes as well as real-time monitoring of business processes.

Search engines make this task easier only in certain ways; people still have to do the sifting process by themselves. At this point, automatic summarization can complement the task of search engines. In this paper, we consider a new summarization approach for Web information retrieval; i.e. structure-preserving and query-biased summarization. We evaluate this approach on Turkish Web documents using TREC-like topics defined for Turkish. The results of the task-based evaluation show that this approach has significant improvement over Google snippets and unstructured query-biased summaries in terms of f-measure using the relevance prediction approach.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2881-6; POD:978-1-4244-2880-9","10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4717908","","Application software;Data mining;Earthquakes;Humans;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Text analysis;Web search;Web sites","Internet;document handling;query processing;search engines","Google snippet;Internet;Turkish Web document;Web information retrieval;f-measure;information source;relevance prediction approach;search engine summarization;unstructured query-biased summary","","0","","23","","","27-29 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Utilizing database images previously annotated by keywords, the proposed method estimates unknown semantic features of a query image. First, our method performs semantic clustering of the database images and derives a new map from a nonlinear eigenspace of visual and semantic features in each cluster. This map accurately provides the semantic features for the images belonging to each cluster by using their visual features. Further, in order to select the optimal cluster including the query image, the proposed method monitors errors of the visual features caused by the semantic feature estimation process. Then, even if any semantics of the query image are unknown, its semantic features are successfully estimated by the optimal cluster. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method for semantic image retrieval.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:978-1-4244-1765-0","10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711917","Image retrieval;Kernel PCA;Semantic feature","Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet;Kernel;Principal component analysis;Spatial databases;Visual databases","feature extraction;image retrieval;principal component analysis","database images;image retrieval;kernel PCA-based semantic feature estimation approach","","0","","5","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dialogues are indexed relying only on the typical dialogue scene structure, which has been modeled using a statistical framework. The related entropy rate is chosen as a compact index for capturing the specificity of the scene structure. Specifically, entropy rate effectively represents the number of expressed visual concepts and the alternating pattern in which concepts appear inside dialogue scenes. As demonstrated on a large video data set, modern video management systems would benefit from integrating such structure information for effective content organization and dialogue search task.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:978-1-4244-1765-0","10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711693","Dialogue indexing;Hidden Markov Model;Logical Story Units;Markov entropy;Video search","Content management;Entropy;Hidden Markov models;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Motion pictures;Video sharing;Visual databases","database indexing;hidden Markov models;video databases;video retrieval","dialogue scene structure;dialogue searching;fast dialogue indexing;hidden Markov model;related entropy rate;statistical framework;video database;video management system","","0","","13","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the various architectures, the gossip-based approach holds great potential and has been used in real systems. In a gossip-based P2P streaming system, peer nodes are grouped together to exchange pieces of the live stream with each other. Maintaining the group and pulling the streaming data from other peers incur nontrivial overhead. This paper proposes CSLive, a P2P streaming system which gathers nodes that have good network proximity into clusters and lets nodes in the same cluster cooperate with each other to pull the stream. Each node in the cluster is responsible for pulling a subset of the stream, while pushing the subset to other nodes in the cluster. With the cooperative operations, a node can receive most streaming data from other nodes in the same cluster, which have good communication quality. The proposed system is evaluated with simulation.","1521-9097;15219097","POD:978-0-7695-3434-3","10.1109/ICPADS.2008.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724399","Live streaming;P2P","Bandwidth;Communication industry;Computer architecture;Computer industry;Computer science;Embedded system;Information retrieval;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Stability","cooperative systems;peer-to-peer computing","CSLive;cooperative swarming;peer-to-peer live streaming systems","","0","","9","","","8-10 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the users, who need the information, are naive, because they do not have knowledge of internal structures of databases, contents of data sources and query languages. So it is very difficult for them to query and analyze the desired data from autonomous, geographically distributed and heterogeneous data sources. Query expansion is used to answer the usersÂ¿ queries to improve performance and effectiveness of queries. We propose a solution for expanding the usersÂ¿ queries with the support of ontology so that recall is improved and information loss is minimized while answering usersÂ¿ queries. We have developed rules for expanding the semantically meaningful and illustrate with appropriate example.
