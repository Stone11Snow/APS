The aglets system is a popular open sourced Java-based mobile agent system, yet it current supports no complete location service solution. This work designs and implements an open sourced location service system for the aglets mobile agent system, which has four major advantages: easy to integrate for legacy applications, easy to join servers in a single region, easy to link among multi-regions for different laboratories, and easy to implement, thus making the range of applications more extensive.

We observe which weighting factor might be the best for each approach. Our experiments show that the weighting factors consistently enhance the retrieval performance on not only training dataset, but also another extended dataset. Our experiments also highlight that RFI, which is obviously useful for processing unknown query object, is the best among the others. In another side, DI provides faster processing as it uses pre-computed distance, but does not have a capability of processing unknown query object.

Second International Conference on","20070604","2007","","","37","37","XML has been established as a format for data exchange on the Internet, which has a large volume scale. By the increase of the volume of XML data, applications need to have a standard query language for efficient retrieving and integrating XML data. XQuery, which is proposed by W3C, is one of the standard query languages for XML data which is widely accepted by many applications. In relation to this, the efficient processing of XQuery queries has become a new research topic and a few researchers have proposed the methods for optimizing XQuery queries to resolve the problem of efficiency. A number of previous researches refer to other information like XML schema or DTD for optimizing the queries. However, our optimization technique does not use any other information except the XQuery query instance itself. Also, some researches just define system dependant optimization methods. In other words, they optimize the execution plan of XQuery queries therefore their methods depend on their XQuery execution engine. However our method can be used in any XQuery engine and in any middleware like a mediator over distributed XQuery engines, because our input is an XQuery query and output also is an optimized XQuery query- The express power of XQuery language is abundant but its syntax is very complex because XQuery borrowed features from several other languages. Therefore, we think that it is necessary to classify the queries and give an optimization method according to the characteristics of classified queries. For these reasons, we consider FOR clauses in XQuery queries because FOR clauses can generate some redundant execution of unnecessary operations. In this paper, we classify the general cases of XQuery queries including FOR clauses, and propose the rewriting rules based on these cases. The focus of our optimization is to reduce the frequency of iterations generated by FOR clauses, of course, without semantic modification of the original query. We implement a prototype syst- - em for our optimization algorithm and evaluate the performance between original XQuery queries and optimized XQuery queries.","","CD-ROM:0-7695-2844-9","10.1109/ICIW.2007.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4222939","Query Optimization;Query rewriting;XQuery","Computer science;Database languages;Frequency;Information retrieval;Internet;Optimization methods;Prototypes;Search engines;System testing;XML","XML;middleware;query languages;query processing","FOR clauses;XML;XQuery execution engine;XQuery queries;middleware;query language","","1","1","27","","","13-19 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Domain-specific CBIR systems currently have to be implemented bottom up, i.e. almost from scratch, each time a new domain-specific solution is sought. Driven by the recognition that CBIR systems, although developed for different domain-problems, have similar building blocks and architecture, we propose a framework model for the development of CBIR systems. The aim of the framework model is to support the design of domain- specific CBIR-systems on a conceptual level by reusing architectural design and building blocks. The model-driven development of CBIR systems can thus be realized by software components for modeling the data structures and the update, storage and retrieval operations using the predefined framework model, and by components for mapping this model onto a specific implementation platform.","","POD:1-4244-0682-X","10.1109/ICDIM.2007.369343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221880","","Application software;Content based retrieval;Data models;Data structures;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Object oriented modeling;Unified modeling language","content-based retrieval;image retrieval","content-based image retrieval systems;domain-specific CBIR systems;domain-specific retrieval problems;model-driven development","","0","","19","","","6-6 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"SAO: A Stream Index for Answering Linear Optimization Queries","G. Luo; K. L. Wu; P. S. Yu","IBM T.J.

To efficiently answer such queries against a large relation, an onion index was previously proposed to properly organize all the tuples in the relation. However, such an onion index does not work in a streaming environment due to fast tuple arrival rate and limited memory. In this paper, we propose a SAO index to approximately answer arbitrary linear optimization queries against a data stream. It uses a small amount of memory to efficiently keep track of the most ""important"" tuples in a sliding window of a data stream. The index maintenance cost is small because the great majority of the incoming tuples do not cause any changes to the index and are quickly discarded. At any time, for any linear optimization query, we can retrieve from the SAO index the approximate top-K tuples in the sliding window almost instantly. The larger the amount of available memory, the better the quality of the answers is. More importantly, for a given amount of memory, the quality of the answers can be further improved by dynamically allocating a larger portion of the memory to the outer layers of the SAO index. We evaluate the effectiveness of this SAO index through a prototype implementation.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:1-4244-0803-2; POD:1-4244-0802-4","10.1109/ICDE.2007.368998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221788","","Costs;Databases;History;Indexes;Information retrieval;Linear approximation;Petroleum;Predictive models;Prototypes;Streaming media","linear programming;query processing","data stream;linear optimization queries answering;stream approximate onion-like structure","","0","","6","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If there is a significant contiguous area of T in an image, it is considered to contain that texture for retrieval purposes. We have experimented with sky and grass textures in the Corel Volume 12 image set. Experiments with a single image indicate that classifiers for the two textures can be learned to a high accuracy.

The relevance of the features is determined through a set of positive and negative examples of a specific object defined a priori by the user. The calculation of the relevance of the features is performed by maximizing an objective function defined on the mixture likelihoods of the positive and negative object examples sets.

The broadcast data are retrieved from a central database server. We apply three different data broadcast schemes including: (i), filtering technique for mobile device to perform transitive queries and display the desired data from incoming multiple entity types broadcast data items; (ii), the index broadcasting scheme designed to predict the arrival of the desired data to appropriately execute power conserving mode; (iii), incorporate multiple channel environments to allow mobile device to tune into multiple broadcast channels to receive the desired data.

The proposed SRC-based RF mechanism employs an effective search result clustering (SRC) algorithm to obtain salient phrases, based on which we could construct an accurate and low-dimensional textual space for the resulting Web images. Given the textual space, we could integrate RF into Web image retrieval in a practical way. The proposed mechanism shows advantage over traditional relevance feedback methods in the following two aspects. On the one hand, our relevance feedback scheme could catch and reflect user's search intension precisely, for the noisy terms would be exempted from the term list with the aid of clustering, thus, the usability of RF in textual space for Web image retrieval is guaranteed. On the other hand, with the exemption of noisy term, the computation with regards to the low-dimensioned textual space is feasible; therefore, the issues of scalability and efficiency for Web image retrieval are addressed.

Then, for evaluation of search engines precision and normalized recall ratios are calculated at various cut-off points for each query and search engine. Furthermore, the results are used to make comparison of the search engines with local search engines.

In Internet-scale data integration tasks, where there may be hundreds or thousands of data sources providing data of relevance to a particular domain, a better approach is to allow the user to discover the mediated schema and the set of sources to use through an iterative exploration of the space of possible schemas and sources. In this paper, we present μBE, a data integration tool that helps in this iterative exploratory process by automatically choosing the data sources to include in a data integration system and defining a mediated schema on these sources. The data integration system desired by the user may depend on several subjective and objective criteria, and the user guides μBE towards finding this system by iteratively solving a series of constrained non-linear optimization problems, and modifying the parameters and constraints of the problem in the next iteration based on the solution found in the current iteration. Our formulation of the optimization problem is designed to make it easy for the user to provide such feedback. A simple, intuitive user interface helps the user in this process.

In order to increase the success rate of blind search, replication techniques are widely used in these systems. Most P2P systems replicate the most frequently accessed data objects to improve system performance. However, existing replication strategies cannot answer the question that how many replicas of an object should be kept in the P2P system. If an object is replicated excessively, it inevitably will affect the average efficiency of a replica, which will decrease the whole search performance. This paper addresses the issue of finding the proper number of replicas for an object according to its query rate. In this paper, we firstly investigate the precise relation among success rate, the allocation of replicas and query rate. Then we propose an approach of the allocation of copies to optimize the success rate.

The resulting sequence is long-term segmented and is fed as input to a hidden Markov model (HMM) which models a predefined rhythmic pattern. An enhanced Viterbi algorithm is proposed, that extracts a best-state sequence, which determines the pattern location boundaries.

Given a query video containing m feature vectors, an independent nearest neighbor (NN) search for each feature vector is often first performed. Completing all the NN searches, an overall similarity is then computed, i.e., a single video retrieval usually involves the searches for m times. Since normally nearby feature vectors in a video are similar, a large number of expensive random disk accesses are expected to repeatedly occur, which crucially affects the overall query performance. Batch nearest neighbor (BNN) search is stated as a single operation that performs a batch of individual NN searches. This paper presents a novel approach to efficient high-dimensional BNN search called dynamic query ordering (DQO) for advanced optimizations in both I/O and CPU cost. Observing the overlapped candidates (or search space) of a pervious query may help to further reduce the candidate sets of succeeding queries, DQO aims to progressively find a query order such that the common candidates among queries are fully utilized to maximally reduce the total number of candidates. Modelling the candidate set relationship by a candidate overlapping graph (COG), DQO iteratively selects the next query to be executed based on its estimated pruning power to the rest of queries with the dynamically updated COG.

The desiderata of efficient skyline querying in P2P environment include: 1) progressive returning of answers, 2) low processing cost in terms of number of peers accessed and search messages, 3) balanced query loads among the peers. In this paper, we propose a solution that satisfies the three desiderata. Our solution is based on a balanced tree structured P2P network. By partitioning the skyline search space adaptively based on query accessing patterns, we are able to alleviate the problem of ""hot"" spots present in the skyline query processing. By being able to estimate the peer nodes within the query subspaces, we are able to control the amount of query forwarding, limiting the number of peers involved and the amount of messages transmitted in the network. Load balancing is achieved in query load conscious data space splitting/merging during the joining/departure of nodes and through dynamic load migration.

Ideally we would like the mediator to retrieve such relevant uncertain answers and gauge their relevance by accessing their likelihood of being relevant answers to the query. However, the autonomous nature of the databases poses several challenges, such as the restricted access privileges, limited query patterns, and sensitivity of database and network resource consumption in the Web environment. We introduce a novel query rewriting and optimization framework QPIAD that tackles these challenges to retrieve relevant uncertain answers. Our technique involves reformulating the user query based on approximate functional dependencies (AFDs) among the database attributes and ranking these queries using value distributions learned from naive Bayes classifiers.

HDKs correspond to carefully selected terms and term sets appearing in a small number of collection documents. We provide a theoretical analysis of the scalability of our retrieval model and report experimental results obtained with our HDK-based P2P retrieval engine. These results show that, despite increased indexing costs, the total traffic generated with the HDK approach is significantly smaller than the one obtained with distributed single-term indexing strategies. Furthermore, our experiments show that the retrieval performance obtained with a random set of real queries is comparable to the one of centralized, single-term solution using the best state-of-the-art BM25 relevance computation scheme.

When the number of classes is large, the performance of classification algorithms may be affected. In order to improve the performance by reducing the number of classes for each classifier, we propose to use hierarchical classifiers according to the question taxonomy, in which each internal node is attached a classifier. We try to use semi-supervised learning to consume unlabeled questions with expectation to improve the performance of classifiers in the hierarchy. We explored different applications of learning methods in for each classifier of the hierarchy: a) supervised learning for all classifiers at all levels; b) semi-supervised learning for the first-level classifier and supervised learning for other classifiers; c) semi-supervised learning for all classifiers. The experiments show that the first method (a) has better results than those of flat classification; the second method (b) produces better results than those of the first method while the effort to increase the performance of fine classifiers in the last method (c) is not so successful.

In order to speed up the retrieval efficiency, previous approaches usually reduce the dimensionality of the entire data set to a fixed lower value before building indexes (referred to as global dimensionality reduction (GDR)). More recent works focus on locally reducing the dimensionality of data to different values (called the local dimensionality reduction (LDR)). However, so far little work has formally evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of both GDR and LDR for range queries. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a general cost model for both GDR and LDR, in light of which we introduce a novel LDR method, PRANS. It can achieve high retrieval efficiency with the guarantee of optimality given by the formal model. Finally, a B<sup>+</sup>-tree index is constructed over the reduced partitions for fast similarity search. Extensive experiments validate the correctness of our cost model on both real and synthetic data sets, and demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed PRANS method.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:1-4244-0803-2; POD:1-4244-0802-4","10.1109/ICDE.2007.367852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221655","","Computational efficiency;Computer science;Costs;Data analysis;Degradation;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Proposals;Space technology","query processing","data dimensionality;fast similarity search;general cost model;global dimensionality reduction;high dimensional space;local dimensionality reduction;retrieval efficiency;tree index","","2","1","29","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, selected lower-level MPEG-7 features are used to represent the partitions and a clustering technique is applied to group similar patterns into a cluster. The cluster indices will then be used to construct a corellogram which is not based on the lower-level primitives, but on regions consisting of a distribution of primitives.

In this paper, we confront two different models about the spectral characterization of musical instruments. The first assumes a constant envelope of the spectrum (i.e., independent from the pitch), whereas the second assumes a constant relation among the amplitude of the harmonics. The first model is related to the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs), while the second leads to what we will refer to as harmonic representation (HR). Experiments on a large database of real instrument recordings show that the first model offers a more satisfactory characterization, and therefore MFCCs should be preferred to HR for instrument modelling/classification.","1520-6149;15206149","CD-ROM:1-4244-0728-1; POD:1-4244-0727-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4217451","Musical instruments modelling;feature extraction;harmonics structure","Cepstrum;Councils;Data mining;Feature extraction;Frequency;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Recommender systems;Spatial databases","audio signal processing;harmonic analysis;music;musical instruments","Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients;automatic instrument classification;automatic knowledge extraction;harmonic representation;harmonics;music signals;spectral features","","5","","8","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In subimage search, the user selects an image region and the retrieval system attempts to find matching subimages in an image database that are strongly similar. Solutions have been proposed using salient features or ""interest points"" that have associated descriptor vectors. However, searching large image databases by exhaustive comparison of interest point descriptors is not feasible. To solve this problem, we propose a novel off-line indexing scheme based on the most significant bits (MSBs) of these descriptors. On-line search uses this index file to limit the search to interest points whose descriptors have the same MSB value, a process up to three orders of magnitude faster than exhaustive search. It is also incremental, since the index file for a union of a group of images can be created by merging the index files of the individual image groups. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated experimentally on a variety of image databases.","","POD:0-7695-2786-8","10.1109/CRV.2007.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228570","","Computer vision;Councils;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Merging;Spatial databases","database indexing;image matching;image retrieval;merging;query formulation;very large databases;visual databases","descriptor vectors;index file merging;interest points;large image database searching;most significant bits;offline indexing scheme;strongly similar subimage retrieval;subimage matching","","0","2","13","","","28-30 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A popular approach is to represent both graphs and queries on graphs by sequences, thus converting graph search to subsequence matching. State-of-the-art sequencing methods work at the finest granularity - each node (or edge) in the graph will appear as an element in the resulting sequence. Clearly, such methods are not semantic conscious, and the resulting sequences are not only bulky but also prone to complexities arising from graph isomorphism and other problems in searching. In this paper, we introduce a novel sequencing method to capture the semantics of the underlying graph data. We find meaningful components in graph structures and use them as the most basic units in sequencing. It not only reduces the size of resulting sequences, but also enables semantic-based searching.

Constructed using standardized knowledge base representation, the virtual teaching assistant agent's knowledge is thus replaceable, making it reusable in multiple courses. Carried in both Web as well as modern instance message interfaces, the agent supports both keyword and sentence based query, as well as multi-lingual functionality. In addition, it owns the ability to learn from other agents or knowledge sources, thus enriching its intelligence.

A large number of bioinformatics datasets from primary and (thousands of) secondary databases are scattered on the Web in various formats. A biologist end-user might need to access and use tens of databases and tools every day. For this reason, the bioinformatics community is developing more and more service-oriented architectures (SOAs): software architecture of loosely coupled software services that can be accessed without knowledge of, or control over, their internal architecture. Data-processing and analysis tasks can be automated by having free access to bioinformatics Web services (WSs) that are the building blocks of the SOAs. In this paper we introduce a new bioinformatics Web server, mepsMAP (mapping epitopes on protein surface: Mining Annotated Proteins), developed to identify the recognition sites between antibodies and their cognate antigens. In some cases, the recognition site is represented by a continuous segment of the antigen sequence, but much more often the epitope is ""conformational,"" i.e. the antibody recognizes the location and type of exposed antigen side chains that are not necessarily contiguous in the antigen's sequence, but brought together by its three-dimensional structure. A facility on the server allows the user to search putative conformational epitopes on protein surface, querying the system for proteins with a given annotation. The mepsMAP server has been implemented as a SOA composed by a database and a set of four WSs. We present here the software architecture of the system with a detailed description of the WS dataflow that has been optimized to provide the best computing performance while maintaining the easiest end-user access to the system via a Web interface.","1536-1241;15361241","","10.1109/TNB.2007.897488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4220627","Antigens;Web services;epitopes;service-oriented architectures (SOAs)","Bioinformatics;DNA;Databases;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Protein engineering;Scattering;Sequences;Service oriented architecture;Software architecture","Internet;biology computing;data mining;molecular biophysics;proteins","Web services;annotated Proteins;antibodies;antigens;bioinformatics datasets;data analysis;data mining;data processing;epitopes;mepsMAP Server;protein surface;recognition sites;service-oriented architectures","Algorithms;Antigens;Database Management Systems;Databases, Protein;Epitope Mapping;Information Storage and Retrieval;Proteins;Sequence Analysis, Protein","0","","23","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These organizations also produce many text documents and use the Web as their largest source of external information. Although these documents include highly valuable information that should also be exploited by companies, they cannot be analyzed by current OLAP technologies because they are unstructured and mainly contain text. The current trend is to find these documents available in XML-like formats. Our proposal is to build XML document warehouses that can be used by companies to store unstructured information coming from their internal and external sources. In (Perez et al., 2005) we proposed an architecture for the integration of a corporate warehouse of structured data with a warehouse of text-rich XML documents. We call the resulting warehouse a contextualized warehouse. Since the XML document warehouse may contain documents about many different topics, we apply well-known information retrieval (IR) (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999) techniques to select the context of analysis from the document warehouse. First, the user specifies an analysis context by supplying a sequence of keywords (e.g., an IR condition like ""financial crisis""). Then, the analysis is performed on a so-called R-cube (Relevance cube), which is materialized by retrieving the documents and facts related to the selected context. Each fact in the R-cube will be linked to the set of documents that describe its context, and will have assigned a numerical value representing its relevance with respect to the specified context (e.g., how important the fact is for a ""financial crisis""). In (Perez et al., 2005) we provided R-cubes with a data model and an algebra. This paper presents a prototype R-cube system, and explains how to use it.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:1-4244-0803-2; POD:1-4244-0802-4","10.1109/ICDE.2007.369041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221831","","Algebra;Data models;Data warehouses;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Performance analysis;Proposals;Prototypes;Text analysis;XML","Internet;XML;data mining;data structures;data warehouses;information retrieval","OLAP cubes;R-Cubes;World Wide Web;XML documents;data structures;data warehouse;information retrieval","","2","","7","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed a search and retrieval system that tackles this information overload problem from two angles. First, we show how to automatically rank and display the top-n most relevant tuples.

Trees can be manipulated efficiently while preserving a lot of structural information of the original graphs. In our proposed method, frequent subtrees of a database are selected as the feature set. To save memory, the set of feature trees is shrunk based on a support threshold function and their discriminative power. A tree-partition based query processing scheme is proposed to perform graph queries. The concept of center distance constraints is introduced to prune the search space. Furthermore, a new algorithm which utilizes the location information of indexing structures is used to perform subgraph isomorphism tests.

Those extracted semantic elements are used by latter algorithm that will render suggestions in which might contain new semantic elements for later use by domain users to enrich ontology. After extracting semantic elements, a ""document weighting algorithm"" is applied to get summary information of document with respect to all extracted semantic words and then to be stored in knowledge base which contains ontology and database to be used later in other applications.

We have implemented and experimentally evaluated our query processing method and found that our strategy reduces query time between 50% and 60% for practical user cache sizes and network parameters.","1530-2075;15302075","CD-ROM:1-4244-0910-1; POD:1-4244-0909-8","10.1109/IPDPS.2007.370552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4228280","","Computer science;Data mining;Data warehouses;Heart;Information retrieval;Job shop scheduling;Manufacturing;Marketing and sales;Processor scheduling;Query processing","data mining;data warehouses;grid computing;query processing;scheduling","OLAP query fragment aggregation;cache extraction;data grid scheduling;data warehouses;online analytical processing;query processing","","2","","17","","","26-30 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe the scientific rationale and mission architecture for a future aerosol mission concept, the Aerosol Global Interactions Satellite (AEGIS). Its payload is designed to eliminate ambiguities in aerosol microphysical retrievals and contribute to the next generation of atmospheric models. By combining several satellite-based approaches aimed at observing the 3D distribution of aerosol abundances, sizes, shapes, and absorption, AEGIS represents a major advance in our ability to monitor and characterize particulate matter from space, and comprises a logical next step beyond the Earth observing system, the ""A-train,"" and Glory.","1095-323X;1095323X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0525-4; POD:1-4244-0524-6","10.1109/AERO.2007.352709","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161283","","Aerosols;Backscatter;Information retrieval;Laser radar;Low earth orbit satellites;NASA;Optical scattering;Payloads;Remote sensing;Space technology","aerosols;remote sensing","3D remote sensing;Aerosol Global Interactions Satellite;aerosol microphysical retrievals;aerosol mission concept;low Earth orbit;mission concept;myriad processes","","1","","52","","","3-10 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we proposed and implemented a novel algorithm to extract tri-literal Arabic roots. Rootless words are filtered out then prefixes and suffixes removal is performed. Double letters that belong to the Arabic word are removed after sorting term letters. Letter removal is conducted until three letters are remained. Finally, the remaining letters are arranged according to their order in the original word. The implementation of the algorithm has been tested on two types of Arabic text documents. The results of both runs were very promising and satisfactory showing over 73% of accuracy.","2161-5322;21615322","CD-ROM:1-4244-1031-2; POD:1-4244-1030-4","10.1109/AICCSA.2007.370899","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4230974","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;Shape;Sorting;Surface morphology;Testing;Visual BASIC","feature extraction;information retrieval;natural language processing;query languages","Arabic language;Arabic text documents;information retrieval systems;letter removal;prefixes-suffixes removal;stemming role;triliteral arabic root extraction","","6","1","13","","","13-16 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept uses techniques proven with the multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) instrument, currently flying in polar low-Earth orbit (LEO) on NASA's Terra satellite. MISR has demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining accurate stereophotogrammetric retrievals of cloud and aerosol plume heights and height-resolved cloud-tracked wind vectors. MISR obtains multiangle imagery with along-track pointing angles ranging from nadir to 70deg forward and backward of nadir and makes use of the several-minute time delay among a triplet of multiangle views to separate the effects of wind displacement from height-induced stereoscopic parallax. Careful attention to multiangle image co-registration (crucial for obtaining accurate wind retrievals) has led to wind estimates that exhibit negligible bias relative to reanalysis data. The root-mean-square uncertainty in speed is estimated to be in the 1-3 m/sec range, depending on whether the wind component is parallel or perpendicular to the flight direction and on the degree of quality control applied. The uncertainty in height assignment is on the order of 300 mum. Comparison of results from a forward-viewing angle triplet with independent retrievals from a backward-viewing triplet provides an important control on retrieval quality. A key attribute of the stereophotogrammetric approach to retrieving cloud heights (and winds) is that the technique is purely geometric. Accurate radiometric calibration is not required, thereby enabling significant simplification of a future instrument dedicated to stereo height and wind retrievals. Furthermore, the approach is insensitive to atmospheric temperature profiles and cloud emissivities, and provides data of consistent quality at all latitudes from polar orbit. It is also purely passive, so senso- r lifetime is not a major issue. Since the technique relies on pattern matching, only a single mid-visible spectral band is required (a separate thermal infrared band, e.g., at 3.7 mum, would be needed in order to acquire measurements at night). Future improvements in computer capability will enable improved pattern-matching algorithms that could be implemented operationally. This simple, compact, and relatively inexpensive concept would assist numerical weather prediction models by retrieving cloud-motion vector winds in traditionally data-sparse areas (mid-oceans and high latitudes), would continue the unique data record begun with MISR by establishing long-term cloud-top height and cloud-motion wind monitoring with sensitivities capable of detecting atmospheric response to climate forcings, and would provide global measurements of the injection and transport heights of distinct aerosol plumes from wildfires, dust storms, and volcanic eruptions.","1095-323X;1095323X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0525-4; POD:1-4244-0524-6","10.1109/AERO.2007.352712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161286","","Aerosols;Clouds;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Instruments;Low earth orbit satellites;Satellite broadcasting;Spectroradiometers;Uncertainty;Wind forecasting","clouds;geophysical signal processing;image matching;photogrammetry;radiometers;stereo image processing;wind","cloud motion wind vectors;cloud-top heights;low-Earth orbit;multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer instrument;pattern matching;quality control;root-mean-square uncertainty;stereophotogrammetric retrievals;vertically-resolved atmospheric winds;wide-swath multiangle stereo imaging system","","0","","13","","","3-10 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
