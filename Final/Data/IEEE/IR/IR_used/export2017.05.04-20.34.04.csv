The BIOPHYS algorithm is an improved, physically-based inversion approach for deriving BSI for independent use and validation and for monitoring, inventory and quantifying forest disturbance as well as input to ecosystem, climate and carbon models. Based on the multiple-forward mode (MFM) inversion approach, BIOPHYS results were summarised from different studies (Minnesota/NASA COVER; Virginia/LEDAPS; Saskatchewan/BOREAS), sensors (airborne MMR; Landsat; MODIS) and models (GeoSail; GOMS). Applications output included forest density, height, crown dimension, branch and green leaf area, canopy cover, disturbance estimates based on multi-temporal chronosequences, and structural change following recovery from forest fires over the last century. Good correspondences with validation field data were obtained. Integrated analyses of multiple solar and view angle imagery further improved retrievals compared with single pass data. Quantifying ecosystem dynamics such as the area and percent of forest disturbance, early regrowth and succession provide essential inputs to process-driven models of carbon flux. BIOPHYS is well suited for large-area, multi-temporal applications involving multiple image sets and mosaics for assessing vegetation disturbance and quantifying biophysical structural dynamics and change. It is also suitable for integration with forest inventory, monitoring, updating, and other programs.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2011.2164899","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6018319","BOREAS;Biophysical structure;LEDAPS;Landsat;MODIS;canopy reflectance models;change;fire;forest disturbance;harvest;inversion","Atmospheric modeling;Biological system modeling;Satellite navigation systems;Table lookup","atmospheric boundary layer;ecology;fires;geophysical image processing;image segmentation;vegetation;vegetation mapping","BIOPHYS algorithm;GOMS;GeoSail;Landsat;MODIS;Minnesota/NASA COVER;Saskatchewan/BOREAS;Virginia/LEDAPS;airborne MMR;biophysical structural change;biophysical structural dynamics;canopy cover;canopy reflectance model inversion;carbon flux;carbon model;climate model;crown dimension;ecosystem dynamics;forest density;forest disturbance;forest disturbance information;forest fires;forest inventory;green leaf area;image mosaics;improved forest biophysical structural information;improved physically-based inversion approach;look-up table approaches;multiple image sets;multiple solar angle imagery;multiple-forward mode inversion approach;multitemporal chronosequences;single pass data;statistical empirical methods;validation field data;vegetation disturbance;view angle imagery","","3","","37","","20110915","Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose to use the conceptual information of the low-level image features to establish a correspondence between the image features and a set of high-level semantic categories. In doing so, image objects are indexed using concepts that describe the low-level color, texture, and shape features in a way that reflects the human understanding of their visual properties. Experimentally, we show that using the conceptual information outperforms using the low-level features for indexing and classifying image regions. In the retrieval process, we demonstrate the effectiveness of using the conceptual information in queries to enrich the search process of users by handling non-trivial queries incorporating both the semantic concepts and the conceptual information of the queried semantic concepts.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4577-1303-3; POD:978-1-4577-1304-0; USB:978-1-4577-1302-6","10.1109/ICIP.2011.6116137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6116137","Conceptual Information;Image Pattern Recognition;Semantic Gap;Semantic-Based Image Indexing & Retrieval","Data mining;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Semantics;Shape;Visualization","image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;indexing","concept-based image indexing;conceptual information;high-level semantic categories;image object;image region;image retrieval;image texture;low-level color;low-level image feature;nontrivial queries;queried semantic concept;search process;shape feature;visual properties","","0","","13","","","11-14 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is based on a nonlinear relation between L-band backscatter and volumetric soil moisture and does not require ancillary information on the surface, e.g., land classification, vegetation canopy, surface roughness, etc. It is based on the definition of three limiting cases or end-members: 1) smooth bare soil; 2) rough bare soil; and 3) maximum vegetation condition. In this study, an estimation method is proposed for the end-member parameters that is iterative and only uses space-borne measurements. The major advantages of the algorithm include an analytic formulation (direct inversion possible), and the fact that there is no requirement for ancillary information. Ancillary data often misclassify the surface and the parameterizations linking surface classification to model parameter values are often highly uncertain. The retrieval algorithm is tested using 3 years of space-borne scatterometer observations from the Aquarius/SAC-D. Retrieved soil moisture accuracy is assessed in several ways: comparison of global spatial patterns with other available soil moisture products (two reanalysis modeling products and retrievals based on the Aquarius radiometer), extended triple collocation (ETC) and time series analysis over selected target areas. In general, low bias and standard deviation are observed with levels comparable to independent radiometer-based retrievals. The errors, however, increase across areas with high vegetation density. The results are promising and applicable to forthcoming L-band radar missions such as SMAP-NASA (2015) and SAOCOM-CONAE (2016).","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2496326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7332736","Aquarius/SAC-D;microwave remote sensing;radar;radar roughness;radar vegetation index (RVI);scatterometer;soil moisture","Backscatter;L-band;Soil moisture;Spaceborne radar;Vegetation mapping","soil","Aquarius;L-band backscatter;L-band radar soil moisture retrieval;L-band scatterometer measurements;SAOCOM-CONAE;SMAP-NASA;ancillary information;extended triple collocation;land classification;maximum vegetation condition;radar-only retrieval algorithm;soil moisture mapping;space-borne measurements;surface roughness;time series analysis;vegetation canopy;volumetric soil moisture","","2","","32","","20151120","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents an approach for automated video indexing and video search in large lecture video archives. First of all, we apply automatic video segmentation and key-frame detection to offer a visual guideline for the video content navigation. Subsequently, we extract textual metadata by applying video Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology on key-frames and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) on lecture audio tracks. The OCR and ASR transcript as well as detected slide text line types are adopted for keyword extraction, by which both video- and segment-level keywords are extracted for content-based video browsing and search.

The Semantic Web aims to provide greater functionality, via intelligent tools such as information extractors, brokers, reasoning services or question answering systems. Semantics can be addressed at several levels. In this paper, we focus on the lowest level-word semantics on which other higher levels such as concept, paragraph, or document levels can be based upon. This model, which we call Word Semantics (WS), does not include the rich set of tags proposed by the XML/RDF standards. Nevertheless, this simpler WS format comes with a big advantage: it is possible with existing technologies and resources. Practically, this new model relies on understanding word meanings, identifying important named entities such as person, organization and others, and linking all this information via an external general purpose ontology, namely WordNet. With these features, we regard the WS model as a short but strong step toward the long term goal of a Semantic Web","","POD:0-7695-1417-0","10.1109/ICTAI.2001.974475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974475","","Data mining;HTML;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Knowledge management;Microstrip;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantic Web;XML","Internet;artificial intelligence;hypermedia markup languages;information resources;information retrieval;search engines","Semantic Web;Web content;brokers;information extractors;intelligent tools;question answering systems;reasoning services;word semantics","","4","","20","","","7-9 Nov 2001","07 Nov 2001-09 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the different methods of image processing and variety of tactics for the image analysis are proposed. Through image processing various operations such as determining image values, optimizing contrast, color correction, correcting non-uniform illumination, Geometric transformations, image arithmetic and many other neighborhood operations are possible to carry over. Processing of the images not only in the time domain but also in the frequency domain is done for extraction of more information. By forming binary images with the separation of background images, the features of principle images can be obtained. Thresholding, Morphological operations, Boolean operations are some of the analysis techniques used in this paper. Global measurements, feature measurement and classifications are the continuous steps followed by thresholding so that the complete information resided in an image can be precisely extracted.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4556-3; POD:978-1-5090-4557-0","10.1109/GET.2016.7916748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7916748","Contrast;Geometric transformation;Illumination;Morphological operation;Neighborhood operation","Brightness;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Low-pass filters;Maximum likelihood detection;Nonlinear filters","","","","","","","","","19-19 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ranganath","","Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","20140519","2010","22","8","1808","1818","The medial temporal lobes (MTLs) are critical for episodic memory but the functions of MTL subregions are controversial. According to memory strength theory, MTL subregions collectively support declarative memory in a graded manner. In contrast, other theories assert that MTL subregions support functionally distinct processes. For instance, one view is that perirhinal cortex (PRc) processes item information, parahippocampal cortex (PHc) processes context information, and the hippocampus binds item and context. Here, we report two experiments that tested competing predictions from these models. In these studies, subjects encoded color–word associations by imagining color either as a contextual association (context detail condition) or as a feature of the item to be encoded (item detail condition). Results showed that encoding color information as an item detail improved source recognition in amnesic patients with recollection deficits. Furthermore, event-related fMRI data from healthy subjects revealed PRc activation associated with successful retrieval of item details, whereas activation in the hippocampus and PHc was associated with recollection-based source retrieval. The qualitatively different patterns of results observed in PRc and hippocampus/PHc are inconsistent with a memory strength account and are consistent with the idea that different MTL regions process different types of episodic information.","0898-929X;0898929X","","10.1162/jocn.2009.21335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793734","","","","","","0","","","","","Aug. 2010","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The directed information (DI) is a variant of the classical mutual information which attempts to capture the direction of information flow that videos naturally possess. It is applied directly to the empirical probability distributions of both audio-visual features over successive frames. We utilize RASTA-PLP features for audio feature representation and SIFT features for visual feature representation. We compute the joint probability density functions of audio and visual features in order to fuse features from different modalities. With SODA, we further estimate the DI in a manner that is suitable for high dimensional features <i>p</i> and small sample size <i>n</i> (large <i>p</i> small <i>n</i> ) between pairs of video-audio modalities. We demonstrate the superiority of the SODA approach in video indexing, retrieval, and activity recognition as compared to the state-of-the-art methods such as hidden Markov models (HMM), support vector machine (SVM), cross-media indexing space (CMIS), and other noncausal divergence measures such as mutual information (MI).

Therefore, there is an urgent demand for an effective Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system devoted to stereo images. To meet such a demand, this paper proposes new wavelet-based retrieval approaches that exploit not only the visual contents of the Stereo Image (SI) pair but also its related disparity field. The first approach takes into account implicitly the disparity information by computing features from the disparity compensated left image and the right image. The second one aims at extracting relevant features directly from the left and right views, and the disparity map. Experimental results indicate that adding disparity information allows us to improve the retrieval performances of stereo images.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-5751-4; POD:978-1-4799-5752-1","10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7025605","Content based image retrieval;disparity map;feature extraction;retrieval performance;stereo pairs;wavelet domain","Decision support systems","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;stereo image processing;visual databases;wavelet transforms","CBIR system;SI;content based image retrieval system;disparity compensated left image;disparity compensated right image;disparity field;disparity information;disparity map;feature extraction;image databases;stereo image retrieval;visual contents;wavelet-based retrieval approaches","","2","","20","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, a signature object is characterized by spatial features computed from recognition result of background blobs. The background blobs are computed by analyzing character holes and water reservoir zones in different directions. For the indexation purpose, a codebook of the background blobs is created using a set of training data. Zernike Moment feature is extracted from each blob and a K-Mean clustering algorithm is used to create the codebook of blobs. During retrieval, Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) is used to detect the query signature and a voting is casted to find possible location of the query signature in a document. The spatial features computed from background blobs found in the target document are used for GHT. The peak of votes in GHT accumulator validates the hypothesis of the query signature. The proposed method is tested on a collection of mixed documents (handwritten/printed) of various scripts and we have obtained encouraging results from the experiments.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4774-9; POD:978-1-4673-2262-1","10.1109/ICFHR.2012.270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424396","Background Information;Document Retrieval;Generalized Hough Transform;Signature Spotting","Cavity resonators;Feature extraction;Handwriting recognition;Reservoirs;Shape;Transforms","Hough transforms;digital signatures;feature extraction;handwriting recognition;image coding;pattern clustering;query processing","GHT;K-mean clustering algorithm;Zernike moment feature extraction;background blob;character hole;cluttered background;codebook;generalized Hough transform;handwritten document;indexation purpose;printed document;query signature;signature based document retrieval;signature object;spatial feature;water reservoir zone","","2","","13","","","18-20 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At present, image retrieval is mainly restricted by the conflict between retrieval accuracy and retrieval speed. In order to solve this problem, an image retrieval method based on wavelet decomposition of YUV component images had been proposed in this paper. First, YUV component images were computed from original image information. Second, every component image was carried out wavelet decomposition, and then low-frequency component was extracted. Finally, similarity function was generated by fusing low-frequency of three component images. Experimental results demonstrated that the method proposed in this paper has a high retrieval accuracy at a fast speed.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4923-1; POD:978-1-4673-4893-5","10.1109/ISDEA.2012.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6454761","Digital library;Image retrieval;Wavelet decomposition;YUV component","Accuracy;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Libraries;Reliability;Time measurement;User interfaces","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;wavelet transforms","YUV clour information;YUV component image;digital library;image information;image retrieval method;low-frequency component extraction;retrieval accuracy;retrieval speed;similarity function;wavelet decomposition","","0","","8","","","16-18 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the potential to use ground-based, zenith-pointing K-band radiometer measurements along with optimized background data sets consisting of radiosonde profiles to detect dynamic changes and gradients in water vapor profiles. To explore this capability, the HUMidity EXperiment 2011 (HUMEX11) was conducted at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) Site near Lamont, OK, USA. This enables the choice of appropriate retrieval parameters to monitor temporal changes in atmospheric water vapor profiles. The results of this study illustrate that in a retrieval algorithm both the choice of the size of the background data set measured near the radiometer measurement time and the choice of atmospheric layer thickness affect the ability to remotely sense dynamic changes in water vapor. In general, it is found that background data sets of larger size provide better accuracy in a statistical sense but inhibit the ability to detect gradients.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2370073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047794","Atmospheric measurements;covariance matrix;humidity;microwave radiometry;remote sensing","Accuracy;Atmospheric measurements;Covariance matrices;Laser radar;Microwave measurement;Microwave radiometry;Temperature measurement","atmospheric humidity;remote sensing;troposphere","AD 2011;HUMEX11;Humidity Experiment;Lamont;U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains Site;USA;atmospheric water-vapor profile retrieval;background information optimization;frequency 22.235 GHz;ground-based microwave radiometer measurement;radiosonde profile;troposphere;water vapor absorption line;water vapor remote sensing;zenith-pointing K-band radiometer measurement","","1","","31","","20150224","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The problem with cartographic generalization of spatial data is concerned with deriving spatial data with proper level of details when the data are used for an application. The generalization process is not simply a process of selecting objects or parts of objects suitable for an application; it should maintain the semantic information carried with the spatial data, such as topological relationships among objects and the overall “look and feel” of the data after generalization. Most difficulties of map generalization are because the importance of objects, which determines whether an object should be included and how it should be visualized in the generalized data set, is decided not only by their size, but also the “meaning” of these objects to the application. The latter is application-dependent, and often subjective. With more and more computerized applications making use of shared spatial data sources, and the increasing number of applications, efficient spatial data generalization becomes a critical issue. At the same time, it becomes less and less likely to have human intervention or have pre-materialized spatial data generalization for all applications in the Internet environment. The authors investigate issues for efficient spatial data generalization, with a unique focus on spatial database design and spatial operation processing. We propose several types of extensions and novel applications of z-values, a commonly used spatial indexing mechanism, to achieve our goals","","POD:0-7695-1022-1","10.1109/DLRP.2000.942191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=942191","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Data visualization;Humans;Information retrieval;Internet;Mathematics;Navigation;Spatial databases","Internet;cartography;database indexing;image retrieval;visual databases","Internet environment;cartographic generalization;database generalization;look and feel;map generalization;more computerized applications;pre-materialized spatial data generalization;semantic information;shared spatial data sources;spatial data;spatial data generalization;spatial database design;spatial indexing mechanism;spatial information retrieval;spatial operation processing;topological relationships;z-values","","0","","13","","","2000","13 Nov 2000-16 Nov 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the last decade, Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) became a considerable research interest to handle the large amounts of collecting video media on the Internet. Due to concerning a large ratio of the videos on the Internet to humans, human action retrieval is presented as a new topic in CBVR domain. In this paper, we seek to improve the current state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms for CBVR by using the statistical information. The statistical information is utilized to represent the video by a vector with m units instead of local points of m×n units and creating a histogram of Bag of Words and also, it decreases the complexity significantly. Furthermore, each vector is used to compare the videos and to find the similar videos to the query one instead of histogram of Bag of Words. The experimental results on KTH dataset illustrated that in contrast to the Bag-of-Words model and its various parameters, our method can perform better.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5660-9; POD:978-1-4799-5661-6","10.1109/IKT.2014.7030333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030333","Content-based video retrieval;Human action recognition;Statistical information","Legged locomotion;Pattern recognition;Radio frequency","Internet;content-based retrieval;image motion analysis;statistical distributions;vectors;video retrieval;video signal processing","CBVR;Internet;bag-of-words model;content-based video retrieval;feature statistical information;human action retrieval;vector","","2","","30","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These observations can be used to improve land surface model (LSM) soil moisture states through data assimilation (DA). In this paper, SMOS soil moisture retrievals are assimilated into the Noah LSM via an Ensemble Kalman Filter within the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Land Information System. Bias correction is implemented using cumulative distribution function (cdf) matching, with points aggregated by either land cover or soil type to reduce the sampling error in generating the cdfs. An experiment was run for the warm season of 2011 to test SMOS DA and to compare assimilation methods. Verification of soil moisture analyses in the 0-10-cm upper layer and the 0-1-m root zone was conducted using in situ measurements from several observing networks in central and southeastern United States. This experiment showed that SMOS DA significantly increased the anomaly correlation of Noah soil moisture with station measurements from 0.45 to 0.57 in the 0-10-cm layer. Time series at specific stations demonstrates the ability of SMOS DA to increase the dynamic range of soil moisture in a manner consistent with station measurements. Among the bias correction methods, the correction based on soil type performed best at bias reduction but also reduced correlations. The vegetation-based correction did not produce any significant differences compared with using a simple uniform correction curve.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2579604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7539527","Data assimilation;Kalman filters;land surface;microwave radiometry;passive microwave remote sensing;soil moisture","Data models;Land surface;Microwave measurement;Microwave radiometry;Soil moisture;Vegetation mapping","Kalman filters;data assimilation;geographic information systems;moisture;remote sensing;soil","AD 2011;NASA land information system;National Aeronautics and Space Administration;Noah LSM;Noah soil moisture;SMOS satellite;SMOS soil moisture retrieval;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity;central United States;cumulative distribution function;data assimilation;ensemble Kalman filter;in situ measurements;land cover;land surface model;mission accuracy;soil type;southeastern United States;vegetation-based correction;warm season","","","","","","20160810","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among them, Google Glass includes a small screen located in front of the right eye, a camera filming in front of the user and a small computing unit. Google Glass has the advantage to provide online services while allowing the user to perform tasks with his/her hands. These augmented glasses uncover many useful applications, also in the medical domain. For example, Google Glass can easily provide video conference between medical doctors to discuss a live case. Using these glasses can also facilitate medical information search by allowing the access of a large amount of annotated medical cases during a consultation in a non-disruptive fashion for medical staff. In this paper, we developed a Google Glass application able to take a photo and send it to a medical image retrieval system along with keywords in order to retrieve similar cases. As a preliminary assessment of the usability of the application, we tested the application under three conditions (images of the skin; printed CT scans and MRI images; and CT and MRI images acquired directly from an LCD screen) to explore whether using Google Glass affects the accuracy of the results returned by the medical image retrieval system. The preliminary results show that despite minor problems due to the relative stability of the Google Glass, images can be sent to and processed by the medical image retrieval system and similar images are returned to the user, potentially helping in the decision making process.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4244-7929-0; POD:978-1-4244-7927-6","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944625","","Cameras;Computed tomography;Glass;Google;Image retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging","Internet;content-based retrieval;human computer interaction;image retrieval;medical image processing;search engines","CT images;Google Glass;Internet;LCD screen;MRI images;augmented glasses;camera filming;computers;content-based medical image retrieval system;decision making process;medical information search;online services;video conference;wearable computing devices","","5","","10","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Conjunctive Patches Subspace Learning With Side Information for Collaborative Image Retrieval","L. Zhang; L. Wang; W.

A variety of relevance feedback schemes have been designed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts for an image retrieval task. Various collaborative image retrieval (CIR) schemes aim to utilize the user historical feedback log data with similar and dissimilar pairwise constraints to improve the performance of a CBIR system. However, existing subspace learning approaches with explicit label information cannot be applied for a CIR task although the subspace learning techniques play a key role in various computer vision tasks, e.g., face recognition and image classification. In this paper, we propose a novel subspace learning framework, i.e., conjunctive patches subspace learning (CPSL) with side information, for learning an effective semantic subspace by exploiting the user historical feedback log data for a CIR task. CPSL can effectively integrate the discriminative information of labeled log images, the geometrical information of labeled log images, and the weakly similar information of unlabeled images together to learn a reliable subspace. We formulate this problem into a constrained optimization problem and then present a new subspace learning technique to exploit the user historical feedback log data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real-world image database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in improving the performance of a CBIR system by exploiting the user historical feedback log data.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2012.2195014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6185675","Collaborative image retrieval (CIR);log data;side information;subspace learning","Geometry;Image retrieval;Manifolds;Measurement;Radio frequency;Semantics;Visualization","computer vision;document image processing;face recognition;image classification;image retrieval;optimisation;visual databases","collaborative image retrieval;computer vision;conjunctive patches subspace learning;constrained optimization problem;content-based image retrieval;discriminative information;face recognition;image classification;image management;labeled log images;pairwise constraints;real-world image database;relevance feedback schemes;semantic gap;side information;subspace learning framework","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiology Information Systems;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subtraction Technique","22","","53","","20120417","Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in MANETs, content retrieval is faced with significant challenges for nodes' high mobility. Information-Centric MANETs (ICMs) are expected to provide benefits, and there are great significance and challenges for realistically modeling content retrieval in ICMs. In this paper, we design an analytical model of content retrieval for ICMs in 1-dimensional case, which considers the nodes mobility, natures of wireless environment and caching in-networking features in ICN. Our model extracts many considerations in a pervasive methodology composed of three basic objects: locations, nodes, and contents. And closed-form expressions for throughput and delay are derived based on the hit/miss probabilities at the mobile nodes. Several simulation experiments are conducted to check the reliability of proposed model. Overall, the results show that this model can be chosen to guide further research and evaluation of optimized ICMs in the future.","2166-0077;21660077","Electronic:978-1-4673-4941-3; POD:978-1-4673-4942-0; USB:978-1-4673-4940-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2012.6477715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477715","1-dimensional case;MANETs;content retrieval;information-centric networking;model","Ad hoc networks;Analytical models;Mathematical model;Mobile computing;Mobile nodes;Throughput;Wireless communication","content-based retrieval;mobile ad hoc networks;probability;telecommunication network reliability;ubiquitous computing","ICM;ICN;caching in-networking;content retrieval model;content-based addressing;hit/miss probability;host-based addressing;information centric MANET;information centric networking;mobile node;network delay;network throughput;node high mobility;node mobility;pervasive methodology;reliability;wireless environment","","3","","19","","","3-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we propose a new method for dynamic case retrieval with subjective preferences and objective information, which considers the personal preferences of the decision makers and changes in the attributes of the emergency as the situation develops. First, we present a formula for calculating the case similarity and changing trends in the case considered, where similar cases are obtained. Next, we describe a method for measuring the overall assessment value with respect to similar historical cases, which is obtained by aggregating the case similarity, the utility case similarity, the first response time, and the implementation effect. The subjective preferences and objective information are also integrated in the decision-making process.

However, one major limitation of both standard Inverted Index and Bag-of-Words model is that they ignore spatial information of the visual words in images. This might reduce retrieval accuracy.

We approach this problem in a different way by rectifying vehicles from disparate views into the same reference view and searching the vehicles based on informative parts such as grille, lamp, and wheel. To extract those parts, we fit 3D vehicle models to a 2D image using active shape model (ASM). In the experiments, we compare different 3D model fitting approaches and verify that the impact of part rectification on the content-based vehicle retrieval performance is significant. We propose a model fitting approach with weighted jacobian system which leverages the prior knowledge of part information and shows better results. We compute mean average precision of vehicle retrieval with L1 distance on NetCarShow300 dataset, a new challenging dataset we construct.

The main idea of the framework is to utilize the location, trajectory and azimuth information acquired by sensors such as GPS receivers and 3D electronic compasses in conjunction with video contents to query videos. The raw spatial information is synthesized to point, line and polygon according to the camcorder parameters such as focal length and angle of view. We defined the point, line and polygon as frame point, video line and FOV (Field of View) polygon and used the spatial relation of these objects and the query objects (point/line/polygon).

For two-dimensional binary shape images, Zernike moments (ZMs) adopted by MPEG-7 are computed as the normal shape descriptors. To get un-biased description by the ZMs, we proposed to locate the minimum bounding circle (MBC) for shape content, which accommodates major shape information in images inside while excludes erroneous noises outside. A fast algorithm to locate the MBC for shapes in image has been developed. The best functionality of the proposed UQM is that, excluding simplicity, new feature sets could be plugged directly into system to improve, while free of degradation in the retrieval performance.

In this paper, we propose a novel location-aware information brokerage scheme, termed LAIB, where the network area is divided into cube grids, and data are replicated and retrieved in the hashed geographic location in each grid designated by the producer and the consumer, respectively. In LAIB, a polylogarithmic number of grids are designated by the producer and by the consumer, and at least one grid, whose distance from the grid of the consumer is smaller than the distance from the grid of the consumer to the grid of the producer, is designated by both the producer and the consumer. Simulations show that, as the network area is divided into a moderate number of grids, LAIB has good performance in term of retrieval latency stretch while ensuring moderate replication memory, replication message, and retrieval message overhead costs.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2012.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127861","Wireless ad hoc network;double-ruling technique;information brokerage;routing algorithm","Binary trees;Distance measurement;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols;Three dimensional displays;Vegetation","ad hoc networks","3D wireless ad hoc network;bounded data retrieval path length;bounded replication;retrieval message overhead cost;retrieval-guaranteed location-aware information brokerage scheme","","0","","30","","20120110","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm adopts a snowball approach that elicits rarely used keywords from commonly used keywords to build a technical term set under the assistance of patent experts. The elicitation process was inspired by the phenomenon that some inventors tend to use special keywords called design-around synonyms in their issued patents in order to elude the search. Applying the algorithm to DVD3C and DVD6C patent pools, the experiments indicated that those design around synonyms would be found successfully.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-49-7; POD:978-1-4673-0231-9","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6108420","design-around synonyms;keyword selection;patent retrieval","Algorithm design and analysis;Companies;Optical design;Optical recording;Optical reflection;Patents;Text mining","bibliographic systems;citation analysis;patents","DVD3C patent pools;DVD6C patent pools;bibliographic information;bibliometics;citation;design-around synonyms;keyword collection algorithm;keyword elicitation;keyword selection;patent counts;patent retrieval;snowball approach","","0","","6","","","24-26 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Images which are present in social multimedia networking websites are accompanied by different tags, comments, annotations and other related information which tend to form an image rich information networks. Due to existence of different related information to images (tag, annotation etc.) retrieval of images from image rich information networks is very challenging and complex task. In this paper we have proposed an integrated approach (S-Cbir) to retrieve an images from image rich information networks. The proposed algorithm consists integration of two different techniques such as link based image retrieval and content based image retrieval systems. K-Simrank algorithm is first applied to find out the node similarity in image rich information networks and then CBIR technique is applied to find out relevant images. SIFT, CEDD, feature and texture extraction descriptors are used in CBIR technique. The search results shows that proposed algorithm refines the search results and also improves the accuracy of search.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8080-2; Electronic:978-1-4799-8081-9; POD:978-1-4799-8082-6","10.1109/ICCSP.2015.7322727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7322727","content based image retrieval;image retrieval;image-rich information networks;link based image retrieval","Computers;Image color analysis;Indexing;Yttrium","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;social networking (online)","CEDD;Facebook;Flickr;S-CBIR;SIFT;content based image retrieval system;feature extraction descriptors;image-rich information networks;integrated algorithm;social networking sites;texture extraction descriptors","","","","19","","","2-4 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many approaches for content based image retrieval have been proposed but completely satisfactory result has not yet been obtained. In this paper a new approach for content-based image retrieval using the bag of visual words (BoW) has been proposed. In this approach, two separate visual vocabularies are produced based on the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and hue descriptor. Traditional SIFT BoW model do not utilize any color information in image description. We incorporate hue descriptor in our method which adds complementary information to BoW representation of images and increase the overall performance of retrieval. The quantization in BoW model is an essential step that has a great impact on the final result but it produces loss in quantization. To overcome this unfavorable effect, soft assignment is used in our proposed approach in which each feature vector can be assigned to multiple nearest visual words based on some weighting function. Experimental results on benchmark dataset showed that the proposed approach has a superior performance with respect to other methods.","2164-7054;21647054","Electronic:978-1-4673-5634-3; POD:978-1-4673-5632-9","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599562","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599562","Content-based image retrieval;SIFT descriptor;bag of visual words;hue descriptor;soft assignment","Feature extraction;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Quantization (signal);Vectors;Visualization","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;transforms","BoW representation;SIFT BoW model;bag of visual words;bag of visual words approach;color information;content-based image retrieval;hue descriptor;image database;image description;nearest visual words;scale invariant feature transform;soft assignment","","0","","11","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It first extracts the feature vectors by SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform). These extracted features are invariant to illumination, rotation, translation, scale and expression. Then eliminates the false matching points according to the improved SIFT feature vectors matching criteria, calculates the distance between the face images with the residual matching points, and completes the first retrieve, with the result of returning the top 50 similar images. After this, refines the first result by relevance feedback strategy of the feedback log information to solve the semantic gap between the high-level semantics and low-level features of images.

In addition, querying massive videos is inherently data intensive, computing intensive and concurrent intensive, thus, the process demands effective computing solutions, such as cloud computing. In this paper, we focus on video retrieval methods using geographic information in the Windows Azure cloud. The main idea is to query videos utilizing the location, trajectory and azimuth information acquired by sensors. The raw spatial information is synthesized to point, line and polygon according to the camcorder parameters. We defined the frame point, video trajectory, field of view polygon and cone, and then used the spatial relationships to retrieve videos. We implemented a framework with the methods in Windows Azure.

In this paper, we propose to properly combine visual information with additional multi-faceted information, to define a novel multimodal similarity measure. More specifically, we combine visual features, which strongly relate to the image content, with semantic information represented by manually annotated concepts, and geo tagging, very often available in the form of object/subject location. Furthermore, we propose a supervised machine learning approach, based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), to automatically learn optimized weights to combine the above features.

We approach this problem in a different way by rectifying vehicles from disparate views into the same reference view and searching the vehicles based on informative parts such as grille, lamp, and wheel. To extract those parts, we fit 3-D vehicle models to a 2-D image using active shape model. In the experiments, we compare different 3-D model fitting approaches and verify that the impact of part rectification on the content-based vehicle retrieval performance is significant. We propose a model fitting approach with weighted Jacobian system which leverages the prior knowledge of part information and shows promising improvements. Then, we use pyramid histogram of orientation feature to describe rectified parts (e.g., grille, wheel, lamp). We compute mean average precision of vehicle retrieval with L1 distance on NetCarShow300 dataset, a new challenging dataset we construct.

Finally, ensemble learning is employed to strengthen classifiers' generalization ability of RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) as the base classifier. On the basis of large-scale datasets, this method is tested and the result of it shows that our method provides higher accuracy and performance for image annotation, feature matching and example-based object-classification.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7981-3; POD:978-1-4799-7982-0","10.1109/CSE.2014.317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023828","AIB Clustering;Gaussian Mixed Model;Image representation;Multi-Instance Learning;RBM;Scene Recognition","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Gaussian distribution;Image classification;Image color analysis;Mutual information;Training","Gaussian processes;entropy;image classification;image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;pattern clustering","Gaussian mixed model;MI bag;RBM;agglomerative information bottleneck clustering;example-based object-classification;feature matching;image annotation;image color;image retrieval;information entropy theory;multiinstance learning;restricted Boltzmann machine;vision classification","","0","","44","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to achieve an efficient result; this paper a proposed a technique for the generation of image content descriptor with three features viz., Color auto-Correlogram, Gabor Wavelet and Wavelet Transform. Color Auto-Correlogram Feature is associated with color information of an image which is derived from the RGB color space of an image. The Gabor Wavelet Feature is has the texture information to extract the textural features associated with the image and the Wavelet Transform Feature is linked with shape information in the extraction of edges in an image. The feature extraction process is accomplished based on the input query image from the IDB and the features are stored in a feature dataset. The Manhattan distance is applied on the user given query image and feature vector computed from database images for measuring similarity. Finally, the proposed technique retrieves the meaningful image from the image database which satisfies the user expectation. The performance of the retrieval system has been analyzed by the performance measures Precision and Recall. The efficiency of the proposed feature descriptor is tested for CBIR system using Corel image database, Li image database and Caltech-101 image database.","","","10.1109/ICCTIDE.2016.7725364","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7725364","Color auto-Correlogram Feature;Content Based Image Retrieval;Gabor Wavelet Feature;Wavelet Transform Feature","Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Wavelet transforms","content-based retrieval;edge detection;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;vectors;wavelet transforms","CBIR system;Caltech-101 image database;Corel image database;Gabor wavelet feature;Li image database;Manhattan distance;RGB color space;color autocorrelogram feature;content based image retrieval system;digital image processing;edge extraction;feature vector;image color;image content descriptor generation;image texture;query image;semantic information;shape features;similarity measurement;textural feature extraction;wavelet transform feature","","","","","","","7-9 Jan. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mammographic mass retrieval system can help radiologists to improve the diagnostic accuracy by retrieving biopsy-proven masses which are similar with the diagnostic ones. However, although screening mammograms usually consists of two-view(MLO and CC) mammography of the same breast, most breast CAD systems incorporate with image retrieval techniques are based on a single-view principle where query ROI within a view is analyzed independently. In this paper, a mammographic mass retrieval approach based on multi-view information is proposed. In this work, the query example is a multi-view(MLO and CC) mass pair instead of the single view mass in the traditional image retrieval framework. In the experiments, some visual features are used for retrieval evaluation. Both distance similarity measures, such as Euclidean distance, and k-NN regression model based non-distance similarity measures are used for comparison. Experimental study was carried out on a database with 126 biopsy-proven masses(63 mass pairs). Preliminary results showed that multi-view based retrieval approach achieves better retrieval accuracy than single-view based one, especially for the k-NN regression model based similairy metric.","2151-7614;21517614","Electronic:978-1-4244-5089-3; POD:978-1-4244-5088-6","10.1109/icbbe.2011.5780212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5780212","","Accuracy;Breast;Image retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging;Observers","cancer;feature extraction;image retrieval;mammography;medical image processing;neural nets;regression analysis","Euclidean distance;biopsy-proven masses;breast CAD systems;breast cancer;image retrieval framework;k-NN regression model;malignant disease;mammographic mass retrieval approach;multiview information","","0","","11","","","10-12 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such color spaces are known to separate between luminance and chrominance, contrary to RGB representation. The magnitude of the luminance component is then represented via the Gamma distribution. For chrominance, a new proposed information is investigated, namely the extended relative phase (ERP). This latter allows to capture the phase information inter-chrominance components. This information is characterized using the circular Wrapped cauchy (WC) distribution. The resulting {Gamma, WC} model has the advantage to be a linear-circular model. It, thus, represents color components considering their nature. Secondly, it permits to catch an information of dependence between chrominance components while being univariate. This means a modeling with simple feature extraction and straightforward implementation of similarity measurement, compared to the multivariate characterization widely used for color textures. Results on the Vistex database show that the study of {magnitude, ERP} information in LC color spaces, improves the retrieval performances compared to the RGB based characterization.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3837-4; POD:978-1-5090-3938-8","10.1109/WINCOM.2016.7777203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777203","Color texture;L*a*b*;dtcwt;kullback-leibler divergence;statistical modeling","Correlation;Databases;Image color analysis;Maximum likelihood estimation;Space missions;Wavelet transforms","feature extraction;gamma distribution;image colour analysis;image texture","Gamma distribution;L*a*b* color space;RGB based characterization;Vistex database;Wrapped cauchy distribution;chrominance components;color texture characterization;color texture retrieval;extended relative phase;extended relative phase information;feature extraction;luminance-chrominance color spaces;univariate multimodel","","","","","","","26-29 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resulting Edge-worth series had various slope cumulants and cumulant functions as series coefficients, and multidimensional Hermite polynomials as the series basis functions. The slope probability density was used to specify a series of relationships between the slope and glint cumulants and cumulant functions up to third order. These relationships were inverted to retrieve the slope third cumulant function, from which we obtained the slope bispectrum via Fourier transformation.

According to cognitive models, there are two lobes in human brain, one is responsible to solve the problem of object recognition, while the other solves the problem of localization (or detection). It is the exchange of mutual information (back and forth) between these two lobes which enables the human brain to simultaneously detect and recognize the objects in a complex scene. Based on the above cognitive paradigm, we propose a RADAR (Retrieval After Detection and Recognition) framework, to solve the problem of object-centric CBIR. Our proposed RADAR framework helps to simultaneously detect and recognize the object in a given test sample for retrieval task. Object-Centric CBIR retrieves a set of samples from a database of identified categories, similar to the categories in a query image using a matching criteria based on features extracted from the localized region(s). Results are shown using various real-world datasets (including PASCAL VOC) to exhibit the performance of the proposed method.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7458-0; POD:978-1-4799-7459-7","10.1109/ICAPR.2015.7050704","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050704","CBIR;Cognitive Model;Detection;Iterative Feedback;Recognition","Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Kernel;Radar imaging;Training;Visualization","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;object recognition;query processing","CBIR;RADAR framework;cognitive models;cognitive paradigm;cognitive sciences;human brain;image retrieval content;information extraction;mutual information;object centric CBIR retrieval;object centric content based image retrieval;object recognition;query image;retrieval after detection and recognition framework","","0","","31","","","4-7 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without the analysis of the object-level features, it is hard to achieve high performance on semantic retrieval. As a branch of object detection study, moving object detection also becomes a hot research field and gets a great amount of progress recently. This paper proposes a moving object detection and retrieval model that integrates the spatial and temporal information in video sequences and uses the proposed integral density method (adopted from the idea of integral images) to quickly identify the motion regions in an unsupervised way. First, key information locations on video frames are achieved as maxima and minima of the result of Difference of Gaussian (DoG) function. On the other hand, a motion map of adjacent frames is obtained from the diversity of the outcomes from Simultaneous Partition and Class Parameter Estimation (SPCPE) framework. The motion map filters key information locations into key motion locations (KMLs) where the existence of moving objects is implied. Besides showing the motion zones, the motion map also indicates the motion direction which guides the proposed integral density approach to quickly and accurately locate the motion regions. The detection results are not only illustrated visually, but also verified by the promising experimental results which show the concept retrieval performance can be improved by integrating the global and local visual information.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4875-3; POD:978-1-4673-4370-1","10.1109/ISM.2012.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424688","SPCPE;Spatial-temporal;integral density;integral image;key motion location;moving object","Feature extraction;Multimedia communication;Object detection;Streaming media;Training;Video sequences;Visualization","Gaussian processes;image motion analysis;multimedia systems;object detection;video retrieval","DoG function;SPCPE framework;automatic object detection technique;difference of Gaussian function;global visual information;integral density method;local visual information;motion map;motion zones;moving object detection;multimedia semantic analysis;semantic retrieval;simultaneous partition and class parameter estimation;spatial-temporal multimedia information;video retrieval","","7","","18","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel content-based method for retrieving of this human motion captured data. The proposed method includes two key steps, one is motion descriptor construction, and the other is retrieval based on query. Firstly, for representing motion by images, multi-view information is captured, and then switching liner dynamic system (SLDS) is built based on image fusion and light stream technology. Secondly, through inferring and coding of SLDS, a graph-based motion descriptor can be obtained. Lastly, based on proposed motion descriptor, the motion retrieval would be operated through direct matching between motion descriptors.

In this paper, we assess the information content in the oxygen A-band for the retrieval of macrophysical cloud parameters using precise radiative transfer simulations covering a wide range of geophysical conditions in conjunction with advance inversion techniques. The information content of the signal with respect to the retrieved parameters is analyzed in a stochastic framework using two common criteria: the degrees of freedom for a signal and the Shannon information content. It is found that oxygen A-band measurements with moderate spectral resolution (0.2 nm) provide two pieces of independent information that allow the accurate retrieval of cloud-top height together with either cloud optical thickness or cloud fraction. Additionally, our results confirm previous studies indicating that the retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness (CGT) from single-angle measurements is not reliable in this spectral region. Finally, a sensitivity study shows that the retrieval of macrophysical cloud parameters is slightly sensitive to the uncertainty in the CGT and very sensitive to the uncertainty in the surface albedo.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2013.2271986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563202","Information content of hyperspectral measurements;oxygen A-band;retrieval of macrophysical cloud parameters","Atmospheric modeling;Clouds;Gases;Optical scattering;Optical sensors;Satellites;Vectors","aerosols;atmospheric optics;atmospheric techniques;clouds;radiative transfer;remote sensing","CGT retrieval;Shannon information content;advance inversion techniques;aerosol property determination;cloud fraction;cloud geometrical thickness retrieval;cloud optical thickness;cloud property determination;cloud-top height retrieval;geophysical conditions;macrophysical cloud parameter retrieval;oxygen A-band measurement;radiative transfer simulation;satellite sensors;single-angle measurement;spectral region;spectral resolution;stochastic framework;surface albedo uncertainty","","3","","37","","20130718","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
