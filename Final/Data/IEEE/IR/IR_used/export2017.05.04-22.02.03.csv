A similarity measure similar to the quadratic color histogram distance measure is defined for this descriptor. The representative colors can be indexed in the three-dimensional (3-D) color space thus avoiding the high-dimensional indexing problems associated with the traditional color histogram. For similarity retrieval, each representative color in the query image or region is used independently to find regions containing that color. The matches from all of the query colors are then combined to obtain the final retrievals. An efficient indexing scheme for fast retrieval is presented.

Chung Cheng Univ., Taiwan","Proceedings of the 34th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","20020807","2001","","","9 pp.","","Expertise is essential in problem solving, particularly for executives. Much literature indicates that in solving daily problems, executives may employ both analytical thinking and intuition. To develop analytical thinking skills and to effectively apply intuition, company executives require expertise. Therefore, the use of executive support systems (ESS) may differ substantially between experts and novices. Previous ESS research has failed to address the effects of expertise on its use. Therefore, this study examines how professionals use ESS to address business-oriented tasks. The professionals were divided into two groups, depending on whether they were experts or novices in the business represented by those tasks. Results in this study can be summarized as follows: (1) Computer self-efficacy strongly influenced executive use of the ESS. (2) Both the main effects of expertise and interaction of expertise and task were insignificant on their perceived usefulness (PU) and user information satisfaction (UIS). (3) Experts felt the ESS was of greater rise when more powerful systems were employed, rather than less powerful systems, while the difference for novices between more and less powerful systems was insignificant. (4) For experts, the UIS score rated significantly higher when employing more powerful systems in both tasks. However novices rated significantly higher only when employing the systems that cognitively fit the performed task. Implications for further application and research are also discussed.","","POD:0-7695-0981-9","10.1109/HICSS.2001.927187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927187","","Companies;Decision making;Electronic switching systems;Information management;Information retrieval;Information systems;Problem-solving","decision support systems;management information systems;problem solving","analytical thinking;business-oriented tasks;empirical study;executive support systems;expert use;intuition;novice use;problem solving;user information satisfaction","","0","","46","","","6-6 Jan. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulations were to be carried out for nadir and off-nadir (53.1°) observation angles at frequencies between 10 and 85 GHz. Among the radiative transfer models were two-stream, multiple stream and Monte Carlo models. The results showed that there were two major sources of differences between the codes. 1) If surface reflection/emission was considered isotropic, simulated brightness temperatures were significantly higher than for specular reflection and this effect was most pronounced at nadir observation and over ocean-type surfaces. 2) Flux-type models including delta-scaling could partially compensate for the errors introduced by the two-stream approximation. Largest discrepancies occurred at high frequencies where atmospheric scattering is most pronounced and at nadir observation.

Since speaker-independent speech recognition technology results in a significantly lower recognition rate than that found when the recognizer is trained for a particular speaker, we applied a number of post processing algorithms to the output of the recognizer to render it suitable for the Textract text mining system. We indexed the call transcripts using a search engine and used Textract and associated Java technologies to place the relevant terms for each document in a relational database. Following a search query, we generated a thumbnail display of the results of each call with the salient terms highlighted. We illustrate these results and discuss their utility. We describe a distinct document genre based on the notetaking concept of document content, and propose a significant new method for measuring speech recognition accuracy.","","POD:0-7695-0981-9","10.1109/HICSS.2001.926472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926472","","Data mining;Displays;Information retrieval;Search engines;Speech analysis;Speech recognition;Telephony;Text analysis;Text mining;Text recognition","Java;computer telephony integration;data mining;marketing data processing;relational databases;search engines;speech processing;speech recognition;text analysis","Java technologies;Samsa;Textract text mining system;call transcripts;document content;document genre;notetaking concept;outbound telephone calls;post processing algorithms;recognition rate;recorded outbound marketing calls;relational database;search engine;search query;speaker-independent speech recognition technology;speech analysis;speech recognition;speech recognition accuracy measurement;summary application;text mining technologies;thumbnail display","","1","2","19","","","6-6 Jan. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a smart data-retrieving engine is proposed, which adopts a retrieval policy named the just-in-time policy. The policy requires the retrieval process of an object to be finished right before the playback time of the object. By converting the synchronization relationship of objects in the SMIL document to the real-time synchronization model, which simplifies the handling of the synchronization relationship, and considering the network condition, the data-retrieving engine could determine the request time for each object. The engine then makes the request to fetch each object for the ongoing presentation according to the pre-computed request time, and provides the player with proper media objects for smooth playback of the presentation","","POD:0-7803-7097-1","10.1109/ICC.2001.937268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937268","","Computer science;Data engineering;Delay effects;Document handling;Engines;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Multimedia communication;Timing;Web sites","distributed object management;multimedia servers;multimedia systems;search engines;synchronisation","SMIL-based distributed multimedia presentation;Synchronization Multimedia Integration Language;data-retrieving engine;just-in-time retrieval policy;object request time;object retrieval process;playback time;pre-computed request time;real-time synchronization model;synchronization relationship","","3","","17","","","2001","11 Jun 2001-14 Jun 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Studying laser waveforms for such plant canopies is needed for the advanced retrieval of three-dimensional (3D) canopy structure parameters from the vegetation canopy lidar (VCL) mission. For discontinuous plant canopies, a hybrid geometric optical and radiative transfer (GORT) model describing the effects of 3D canopy structure parameters of discrete canopies on the radiation environment has been modified for use with lidar. The GORT model is first used to describe the canopy lidar waveforms as a function of canopy structure parameters and then validated using scanning lidar imager of canopies by echo recovery (SLICER) data collected in conifer forests in central Canada during the boreal ecosystem-atmosphere study (BOREAS). Model simulations show that the clumping in natural vegetation, such as leaves clustering into tree crowns causes larger gap probability and smaller waveforms for discontinuous plant canopies than for horizontally homogeneous plant canopies. Ignoring the clumping effect can result in significantly lower values for the estimated foliage amount in the profile and in turn lower estimated biomass. Because of clumping, only the gap probability and apparent vertical projected foliage profile can be directly retrieved from the canopy lidar data. The retrieval is sensitive to the ratio of the volume backscattering coefficients of the vegetation and background, and this ratio depends on canopy architecture as well as foliage spectral characteristics","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.951085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951085","","Backscatter;Biomass;Biomedical optical imaging;Geometrical optics;Information retrieval;Laser modes;Laser radar;Optical sensors;Solid modeling;Vegetation mapping","forestry;geophysical techniques;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;vegetation mapping","canopy structure parameters;clumping;clustering;conifer;discrete canopy;foliage;forest;geometric optical and radiative transfer;geometric optical model;geophysical measurement technique;heterogeneous canopy;laser remote sensing;laser waveform;lidar waveform;optical method;plant canopies;spatial arrangement;three-dimensional structure;vegetation mapping","","102","","35","","","Sep 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

High speed acoustic transmission over a shallow water channel characterized by small grazing angles presents formidable difficulties. The reflection losses associated with such small angles are low, causing large amplitudes in multi-path signals. When the signal is transmitted from the transmitter to the receiver, in the case of multipath in the environment, the transmitter and receiver have a higher SNR (signal-to-noise ratio) when they have array sensors rather than single sensors. In this paper, we propose a transmit array system for high data rate underwater acoustic communication. With sensor arrays, the transmitter can reduce or suppress the interference, it provides an improved desired signal level.

Each image feature is then represented by several dimensions. Furthermore, the medical image has an evolutionary content that changes over time and according to several events. Our proposition allows medical users to easily describe the content evolution of many images. To achieve that, a spatial knowledge model is integrated into our approach that verifies the coherence between feature spaces and assists both system and user whenever precision is needed or specific ambiguity occurs.

It is important to predict the structure and functions of the protein from a DNA sequence or an amino acid sequence from a viewpoint of biology, medical science, protein engineering and so on. But at present no method is available to predict them accurately from the sequence. Instead, there are some approaches to estimate the functions approximately based on a similarity retrieval of sequences. We propose a new method for similarity retrieval of amino acid sequence based on the concept of homology retrieval using data compression. Introduction of the compression by dictionary technique enables us to describe the text data as an n-dimensional vector using n dictionaries which are generated by compressing n typical texts, and it also enables us to classify them based on their similarity. To classify the data clearly, it is effective to use ideal character strings as dictionaries. In this paper, we introduce genetic algorithm for dictionary generation and classify the amino acid sequences.

Our proposal focuses on reusing incomplete models and their verification results - which are obtained from a model-checking algorithm - in order to improve this kind of life-cycle. Making good use of these previous verification results can reduce the formal verification costs by minimizing the set of requirements and the set of system states where the properties must be verified.

An architecture with multipath decoding, improved phonotactic models using binary-tree structures, and acoustic pronunciation models serve as a framework for experiments and discussion on these two tasks. In particular, language identification accuracy on a telephone-speech task (NIST'95 evaluation) in six and nine languages is presented together with results from a perceptual experiment carried out with human listeners.

In the non-electronic world there are several services that are based on anonymous interactions between individuals. The migration of these services to the Internet world is infeasible without the provision of anonymizers to guarantee anonymity. Anonymizers based on mix computers interposed between the sender and the receiver of an e-mail message have been used in the Internet for several years by senders of e-mail messages who do not wish to disclose their identity. Unfortunately, the degree of anonymity provided by this paradigm is limited and fragile. First, the messages sent are not truly anonymous but pseudo-anonymous since one of the mixes, at least, always knows the sender's identity. Secondly, the strength of the system to protect the sender's identity depends on the ability and willingness of the mixes to keep the secret. If the mixes fail, the sender's anonymity is compromised. The authors propose a novel approach for sending truly anonymous messages over the Internet where the anonymous message is sent from a PDA which uses dynamically assigned temporary, non-personal, random IP and MAC addresses.

"Towards meaningful high-dimensional nearest neighbor search by human-computer interaction","C. C. Aggarwal","IBM Thomas J. Watson Res. Center, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA","Proceedings 18th International Conference on Data Engineering","20020807","2002","","","593","604","Nearest neighbor search is an important and widely used problem in a number of important application domains. In many of these domains, the dimensionality of the data representation is often very high. Recent theoretical results have shown that the concept of proximity or nearest neighbors may not be very meaningful for the high dimensional case. Therefore, it is often a complex problem to find good quality nearest neighbors in such data sets. Furthermore, it is also difficult to judge the value and relevance of the returned results. In fact, it is hard for any fully automated system to satisfy a user about the quality of the nearest neighbors found unless he is directly involved in the process. This is especially the case for high dimensional data in which the meaningfulness of the nearest neighbors found is questionable. We address the complex problem of high dimensional nearest neighbor search from the user perspective by designing a system which uses effective cooperation between the human and the computer. The system provides the user with visual representations of carefully chosen subspaces of the data in order to repeatedly elicit his preferences about the data patterns which are most closely related to the query point. These preferences are used in order to determine and quantify the meaningfulness of the nearest neighbors. Our system is not only able to find and quantify the meaningfulness of the nearest neighbors, but is also able to diagnose situations in which the nearest neighbors found are truly not meaningful","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-1531-2","10.1109/ICDE.2002.994777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994777","","Data engineering;Data mining;Data structures;Humans;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Nearest neighbor searches;Spatial databases","data mining;data structures;database management systems;query processing;user interfaces","data mining;data patterns;data representation;data sets;databases;high dimensional data;high-dimensional nearest neighbor search;human-computer interaction;query point;visual representations","","13","","28","","","2002","26 Feb 2002-01 Mar 2002","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A methodology for redesigning the collaborative processes with undesirable multi-way task dependency","F. Daneshgar","Basser Dept. of Comput.

This methodology was based on an awareness model in which awareness is defined in terms of collaborative semantic concepts such as actors, roles, and artefacts. Also, a LotusNOTES-based software called AWT (aware-ware template) was introduced in that paper for implementing the methodology of that study. According to that methodology awareness levels of the actors can be assessed, raised and maintained at desired/required levels. One practical limitation of that methodology which creates inefficiency and unnecessary overhead problems was that each simple task must participate in one, and only one collaborative task. In other words, during the design phase of the collaborative process, no simple task could be linked to more than one other simple task. The question in this paper is that how to apply AWT software to a collaborative process where a simple task already is designed to be related to more than one other simple task without loss of efficiency and clarity. This paper provides a guideline for redesigning such collaborative process in a way that the requirements of the AWT are met without any arbitration or loss of originality and integrity in the collaborative process. To further, clarify the technical issues involved in this enhanced methodology a case study representing a collaborative process called `cohort of students' is used","","POD:0-7695-0951-7","10.1109/ICOIN.2001.905568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=905568","","Application software;Collaboration;Collaborative software;Collaborative work;Computer science;Database systems;Guidelines;Information retrieval;Process planning;Workstations","commerce;database management systems;educational computing;groupware","AWT software;LotusNOTES-based software;actors;artefacts;aware-ware template;awareness model;business applications;cohort of students;collaborative database;collaborative processes;collaborative semantic concepts;collaborative structures;database analysis;database design;database planning;multi-way task dependency;overhead problems;roles","","0","","21","","","2001","31 Jan 2001-02 Feb 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Retrieving all updates to such rapidly changing information is wasteful of both network bandwidth and battery power. Existing consistency models for such services allow for only coarse grained timeouts on how often information should be retrieved. The authors argue for the benefits of a continuous consistency model for user access to Internet portal services. Using this model, users are able to specify the maximum error in their view of the data. For instance, users may specify that they wish to receive an updated stock quote only if the user's view diverges from the actual value by more than 3%. Services may also use application-specific semantics to control data consistency, e.g., new bids carry more weight as the auction draws to a close. We use a simulator to model the bandwidth and energy benefits available from a more flexible consistency model. Such benefits depend upon the rate at which underlying data values change. To capture representative distributions, we use a trace based study of updates to weather, news, and stock quotes from a popular portal to determine representative distribution ranges. Our initial results indicate bandwidth and energy savings that increase as users are willing to tolerate larger bounds on data accuracy","","POD:0-7695-1137-6","10.1109/WIAPP.2001.941871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=941871","","Bandwidth;Batteries;Computer science;Delay;Engineering profession;Information retrieval;Portals;Postal services;Ubiquitous computing;Weather forecasting","Internet;data integrity;information resources;mobile computing;online front-ends;wireless LAN","Internet portal services;application-specific semantics;auction;battery power;coarse grained timeouts;consistency models;continuous consistency model;data accuracy;data consistency;energy benefits;flexible consistency model;maximum error;network bandwidth;news;personalized information;popular portal;rapidly changing information;real time access;representative distribution ranges;simulator;stock quotes;trace based study;underlying data values;updated stock quote;user access;weather;wireless Web portals;wireless devices","","0","1","15","","","2001","23 Jul 2001-24 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation principle is considered in the context of an approach to ontology-based querying, where domain knowledge in the form of a dictionary and an ontology is utilized in the computation of groups of attributes and aggregation parameters.

In particular this paper develops a technique to predict the system's performance with respect to the user query.

The volume of information and its lack of organization present a real danger of cognitive overload. Searching for information is even more frustrating. How can we help novices to search the Internet effectively? One solution is to develop a courseware, using conceptual models based on constructivism, to teach them how to search. This paper describes the process we used to design and develop the conceptual models to teach Internet searching. We begin with a brief review of constructivist learning, mental models and conceptual models. This is followed by the process we used to develop the necessary conceptual models, using the Courseware Engineering Methodology (CEM). Next an evaluation of the conceptual models is given.

The words (color names) consist of a hue name with its modifier, or a hue name only. This system can translate input hue system data to color names (output). Triangular membership functions are applied to the hue angle, and conical membership functions are applied to the relationship between lightness and saturation. By treating the membership function of tone modifier as a fuzzy relation between lightness and saturation, we can easily obtain the membership grade of a target modifier as an output fuzzy set from projection of an input fuzzy set. Three modifiers associated with respective grades indicate vague colors. The present paper proposes a fuzzy system that can determine a few tone modifiers (e.g., dark, dull, deep, etc.) suitable for color names in common use.

As a result, conventional query frameworks are not applicable to video databases.

Little work has been done to combine various aspects into a single framework. We describe our approach of developing a general-purpose image retrieval system over the Web. A main feature of our system is its hybrid approach by integrating both semantic and visual feature retrieval methods. By combining keyword-based query selection with content-based retrieval techniques, the system is able to provide effective image searching and retrieval.

Among them, nearest neighbor queries are important in many settings, including spatial databases (Find the k closest cities) and multimedia databases (Find the k most similar images). Previous analyses have concluded that nearest-neighbor search is hopeless in high dimensions due to the notorious “curse of dimensionality”. We show that this may be overpessimistic. We show that what determines the search performance (at least for R-tree-like structures) is the intrinsic dimensionality of the data set and not the dimensionality of the address space (referred to as the embedding dimensionality). The typical (and often implicit) assumption in many previous studies is that the data is uniformly distributed, with independence between attributes. However, real data sets overwhelmingly disobey these assumptions; rather, they typically are skewed and exhibit intrinsic (“fractal”) dimensionalities that are much lower than their embedding dimension, e.g. due to subtle dependencies between attributes. We show how the Hausdorff and Correlation fractal dimensions of a data set can yield extremely accurate formulas that can predict the I/O performance to within one standard deviation on multiple real and synthetic data sets","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.908983","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=908983","","Cities and towns;Discrete Fourier transforms;Fractals;Image databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Nearest neighbor searches;Query processing;Spatial databases","database indexing;database theory;fractals;multimedia databases;query processing;tree data structures;visual databases","data sets;database indexing;dimensionality curse;fractal dimensions;high-dimensional spaces;input output performance;multimedia databases;nearest neighbor queries;search performance;self-similarity;spatial databases;spatial queries;tree data structures","","62","9","42","","","Jan/Feb 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Designed to be flexible yet simple, DIMES uses XML to represent, store, retrieve and interoperate metadata in a distributed environment. DIMES accepts metadata in any well-formed XML format and thus assumes the “tree” semantics of metadata entries. Additional domain knowledge can be represented as specific links through XML's ID/IDREF mechanism.

Imposing distributional assumptions on the assumed underlying latent factors makes the proposed model suitable for both visualization and clustering. The system noise will be modeled in parametric form, as a member of the exponential family of distributions and this allows us to deal with different (continuous or discrete) types of observables in a unified framework. In this paper, we focus on discrete case formulations which, contrary to self organizing methods for continuous data, imply variants of Bregman divergencies as measures of dissimilarity between data and reference points and, also, define the matching nonlinear relation between latent and observable variables. Therefore, the trait variant of the model can be seen as a data-driven noisy nonlinear independent component analysis, which is capable of revealing meaningful structure in the multivariate observable data and visualizing it in two dimensions. The class variant (which performs the clustering) of our model performs data-driven parametric mixture modeling. The combined (trait and class) model along with the associated estimation procedures allows us to interpret the visualization result, in the sense of a topographic ordering.

We use the information provided by low-level sensing mechanisms to construct a set of local, perceptual features, with which to categorize at run-time possible target objects. Once objects are activated, based on their interactivity information and on the current task script, the agent can reparametrize its behavior, according to its mission goal defined in a global plan script.

We have developed a frequency quadrupled Nd:YLF laser as a source of photons to Compton backscatter from a beam of electrons circulating in a storage ring. The laser beam must be transported 22 meters to the interaction region in the synchrotron and the mode at that point must be matched to the electron beam. Unfortunately, the laser is non-Gaussian, so that both the phase and intensity must be known to calculate the beam propagation. The Gerchberg-Saxton phase retrieval procedure deduces the phase of an image from intensity measurements in the image plane and the diffraction plane. For a freely propagating non-TEM/sub 00/ beam it is generally difficult to locate the waist. Also, if the Rayleigh range of the beam is too small, high spatial resolution of the beam profiling device is necessary; conversely, if the Rayleigh range is too large, it may be difficult to make a measurement at a great enough distance to achieve the far field condition. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a generalization of the Gerchberg-Saxton procedure to include intensity measurements in multiple planes of the propagating beam. We have tested the algorithm with ""synthetic"" data generated computationally by propagating multimode Hermite-Gaussian beams, extracting intensity profiles at a series of planes and adding normally distributed noise. To test the procedure with data, we have measured the profile of the laser beam in several planes after an optical transport system, retrieved the phase, propagated the retrieved beam back to a location near the laser exit and compared this reconstructed beam profile to a measurement at that location.","","POD:1-55752-662-1","10.1109/CLEO.2001.948043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948043","","Electron beams;Frequency;Information retrieval;Laser beams;Laser modes;Laser noise;Optical noise;Optical propagation;Phase measurement;Ring lasers","laser beams;laser modes;laser noise;laser variables measurement;lithium compounds;neodymium;optical frequency conversion;solid lasers;wave functions","Compton backscatter;Gerchberg-Saxton phase retrieval procedure;Nd:LiYF/sub 4/ laser;Rayleigh range;YLiF/sub 4/:Nd;arbitrary measurement plane;coherent beams;electron beams;frequency quadrupled laser;intensity measurements;interaction region;laser beam;mode;multiple planes;noise;nonGaussian laser;nonTEM/sub 00/ beam;phase determination;phase retrieval algorithm;propagating beam;propagating multimode Hermite-Gaussian beams;random steps;reconstructed wavefunction;storage ring;synchrotron;synthetic data","","0","","3","","","11-11 May 2001","06 May 2001-11 May 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aggregating cache utilizes predetermined groupings of files to perform group retrievals. These groups are maintained by the server, and built dynamically using observed inter-file relationships. Through a simple analytical model we demonstrate how this mechanism has the potential to reduce average latencies by 75% to 82%. Through trace-based simulation we demonstrate that a simple aggregating cache can reduce the number of demand fetches by almost 50%, while simultaneously improving cache hit ratios by up to 5%","1526-7639;15267639","POD:0-7695-1315-8","10.1109/MASCOT.2001.948880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=948880","","Analytical models;Bandwidth;Cache storage;Costs;Delay;File servers;Information retrieval;Lifting equipment;Mobile computing;Prefetching","cache storage;digital simulation;file servers","aggregating cache;aggregating caches;analytical approximation;analytical model;cache hit ratios;client filtering;file prefetching;file retrieval;group retrieval;inter-file relationships;latency reduction;server;storage system performance;trace-based simulation","","4","","21","","","2001","15 Aug 2001-18 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper discusses two of these approaches, the fuzzy semantic typing of Subasic and Huettner and the computational semiotics of Rigger. From a theoretical point of view, such methods have been criticized on both philosophical and linguistic grounds. lit this paper, we perform some simple experiments to see whether useful insights or even useful text processing methods can be gleaned from application of techniques derived from one of these pragmatic approaches (computational semiotics). We conclude that the results are inconsistent and provide neither useful surface measures of regularities nor insights into underlying syntactico-semantic properties of linguistic utterance.","","POD:0-7803-7461-4","10.1109/NAFIPS.2002.1018043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1018043","","Dictionaries;Engines;Fuzzy logic;Information retrieval;Speech;Surface structures;Text analysis;Text processing","fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms;text analysis","fuzzy approach;linguistic text analysis;linguistic utterances;patterns;pragmatic approaches;surface structure;text analysis","","1","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The object boundary of each view is considered as a two dimensional (2-D) shape and is represented by the locations of the maxima of its curvature scale space (CSS) image contours. The idea is to identify an unknown object from an image taken from a random view by using the stored descriptions of the standard views. The CSS image has been selected for MPEG-7 standardization. The maxima of CSS image have already been used to represent 2-D shapes in different applications under similarity transforms. Since the new application involves affine transforms, we first examine the effects of general affine transforms on the representation and show that the locations of the maxima of the CSS image do not move dramatically even under large affine transformations. Our system for shape-based retrieval from large image databases is then applied to multiview 3-D object representation and recognition. Our collection of 3-D objects consists of 18 aircraft of different shapes. Three silhouette contours corresponding to random views are separately used as input for each object. Results indicate that robust and efficient 3-D free-form object recognition through multiview representation can be achieved using the CSS representation","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/83.892449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=892449","","Aircraft;Cascading style sheets;Image databases;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Shape;Standardization;Two dimensional displays","image representation;image retrieval;object recognition;transforms;visual databases","2D shape;3D free-form object recognition;3D object representation;CSS representation;MPEG-7 standardization;affine-similar shape retrieval;aircraft;curvature scale space;general affine transforms;image contours;large image databases;multiview 3D object recognition;multiview 3D object representation;object boundary;silhouette contours;similarity transforms","","22","1","26","","","Jan 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This system was developed as a potential alternative to the current state of wind tunnel data collection, which requires the use of long lengths of cable carrying low-level sensor signals that are extremely susceptible to induced noise. Irk addition, present methods of retrieving data require that multiple cables be routed across the balance, creating alternate load paths. With the advent of wireless data transfer, not only are these two items addressed, but also the reduction of external cables to the model will reduce wind tunnel model installation time as well as the cost of operation. This paper will describe the results of two separate wind tunnel tests, conducted at NASA Langley's Transonic Dynamics Tunnel and the 16-foot Transonic Tunnel, in which this new embedded system was used to collect data from typical aerodynamic measurements. The recorded results from these wind tunnel experiments include data from pressure, model attitude, temperature, and force balance transducers","","POD:0-7803-7022-8","10.1109/ICIASF.2001.960267","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=960267","","Aerodynamics;Communication cables;Costs;Data acquisition;Embedded system;Information retrieval;NASA;Sensor systems;System testing;Wireless sensor networks","aerospace simulation;data acquisition;embedded systems;radiotelemetry;wind tunnels","MEMS sensors;aerodynamic measurements;embedded electronics;embedded wireless data acquisition;external cables reduction;force balance transducers;in-model data acquisition system;model attitude;plug and play/test concept;pressure transducers;smart wing test;temperature transducers;transonic dynamics tunnel;wind tunnel model applications;wireless telemetry","","6","","7","","","Aug 2001","27 Aug 2001-30 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
