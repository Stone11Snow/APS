With the surge of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), service discovery has become increasingly crucial. However, the public UDDI Business Registry - the primary service discovery mechanism over the Internet - has been shut down permanently since 2006. Moreover, keyword-based service discovery is insufficient in coping with complex discovery requirements posed by modern software developers. In this paper, we propose an empirical semantic- based Web service discovery approach. It provides an automatic Web service discovery mechanism that can locate relevant Web services based on concepts rather than keywords. The major contribution of this paper is three fold. First we articulate three requirements that software developers often raise during the component/service development and discovery process. Next, we propose the application of Latent Semantic Analysis into the area of Web services discovery. To our best knowledge, little work has been done in this area which leverages concept-based Information Retrieval models in service discovery. Last, we provide a proof-of-concept system prototype that can suffice three specific requirements of semantic service discovery.","1530-0803;15300803","POD:978-0-7695-3100-7","10.1109/ASWEC.2008.4483230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483230","Semantic Web;Service discovery;Web services;component retrieval","Application software;Australia;Humans;Information retrieval;Markup languages;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Service oriented architecture;Software engineering;Web services","Web services;information retrieval;semantic Web","Internet;concept-based Information Retrieval;latent semantic analysis;public UDDI business registry;semantic Web services discovery;service-oriented architecture;software developer;software engineering","","8","","34","","","26-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although cryptography can protect the contents of communication, the transmission times of packets alone can reveal significant networking information such as source- destination pairs and routes of traffic flow. This article focuses on analytical approaches to anonymous networking for the prevention of information retrieval through packet timing analysis. In particular, an analytical measure for route anonymity is proposed using information theoretic equivocation. Based on the metric, provably anonymous countermeasures are described for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, where traffic is subjected to strict constraints on medium access and latency. A key objective is to bridge a long standing gap between the information theoretic approach to secrecy in communication, and a more pragmatic approach of Chaum mixing used in anonymous systems on the Internet. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated using an orthogonal transmitter directed signaling network.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2008.4473096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4473096","","Cryptography;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Particle measurements;Protection;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Telecommunication traffic;Timing;Wireless networks;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;ad hoc networks;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","Internet;anonymous wireless networking;communication secrecy;information theory;orthogonal transmitter directed signaling network;packet timing analysis;route anonymity;unauthorized traffic analysis;wireless ad hoc network;wireless sensor networks","","9","","13","","","February 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, manually creating labels is not only time-consuming but also subject to human errors, and eventually, becomes impossible for a very large amount of data (e.g. 24/7 surveillance video). To minimize the human effort in labeling, we propose a unified multiclass active learning approach for automatically labeling video data. We include extending active learning from binary classes to multiple classes and evaluating several practical sample selection strategies. The experimental results show that the proposed approach works effectively even with a significantly reduced amount of labeled data. The best sample selection strategy can achieve more than a 50% error reduction over random sample selection.","","POD:0-7695-1950-4","10.1109/ICCV.2003.1238391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238391","","Application software;Cameras;Computer errors;Computer vision;Geriatrics;Humans;Information retrieval;Labeling;Object recognition;Robustness","computer vision;image sampling;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","computer vision;human activity modelling;image sequences;multiclass active learning;object recognition;sample selection strategy;video data labeling;visual information retrieval","","56","3","17","","","13-16 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work discusses this idea and shows patterns to deal with related issues. This approach can help organizations and people to control irrelevant data through the knowledge of different ways to eliminate them.

To this end, we construct a ""video ontology"" which is a formal and explicit specification of events. Specifically, an event is modeled to have 4 dimensions of semantic contents (i. e. Action, Location, Time and Shooting technique). For retrieving such events, concepts in 4 dimensions need to be automatically detected. So, we conduct ""video data mining"" to extract ""semantic patterns"" from videos. Here, a semantic pattern is a combination of low-level features (e.g. color; motion and audio) associated with events of a certain kind. Thus, semantic patterns can be used to characterize concepts in 4 dimensions of semantic contents. Furthermore, we refine the video ontology by extracting new semantic patterns from subspaces of videos, which cannot be retrieved by previously extracted patterns. Finally, we classify each event into video genres which potentially contain this event. It is useful for limiting video genres from which events of user's interest are retrieved.","","POD:0-7695-3084-2","10.1109/ISM.Workshops.2007.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4475984","","Conferences;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Event detection;Information retrieval;Mood;Motion pictures;Multimedia systems;Ontologies;YouTube","","","","1","","13","","","10-12 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various integration schemes are presented and a long-term shared memory is used to exploit the retrieval experience from multiple users. Also, a concept digesting method is proposed to reduce the complexity of storage demand. The experimental results manifest that the integration of multiple RF approaches gives better retrieval performance than using one RF technique alone, and that the sharing of relevance knowledge between multiple query sessions also provides significant contributions for improvement. Further, the storage demand is significantly reduced by the concept digesting technique.

And the central server classifies one peer to a certain level according to the peer's downloading bandwidth which coordinates with the layer level of the video data encoded using scalable wavelet coding. The peer retrieves correspondingly unavailable data from partners according to availability information. There are three principal advantages of this architecture: 1) easy to manage, as the server authorizes, classifies, and clusters each new peer according to its bandwidth as it joins the overlay network, and thus the servers maintain a global structure; 2) efficiency in dynamically heterogeneous networks, as users with different processing ability under heterogeneous networks can retrieve the adaptive data from their partner peers according to their downloading bandwidths, and 3) robustness and resilience, as the partner peers can adapt to quick switching among multi-suppliers, and the scalable video transmission is adaptive.

However, a disadvantage of all these approaches is that the learned projective functions are linear combinations of all the original features, thus it is often difficult to interpret the results. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework, called <b>Unified</b> <b>Sparse</b> <b>Subspace</b> <b>Learning</b> (USSL), for learning sparse projections. USSL casts the problem of learning the projective functions into a regression framework, which facilitates the use of different kinds of regularizes. By using a L<sub>1</sub>-norm regularizer (lasso), the sparse projections can be efficiently computed. Experimental results on real world classification and clustering problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-3018-4","10.1109/ICDM.2007.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470231","","Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Helium;Information processing;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Scattering","data reduction;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","data mining;dimensionality reduction;information processing;information retrieval;learned projective functions;linear discriminant analysis;locality preserving projection;pattern recognition;principal component analysis;spectral regression;unified sparse subspace learning","","59","","30","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Originally, we propagate GMMs in a decentralized fashion (gossip) in a network, and aggregate GMMs from various sources, through a technique that only involves little computation and that makes parsimonious usage of the network resource, as model parameters rather than data are transmitted. The aggregation is based on iterative optimization of an approximation of a KL divergence allowing closed-form computation between mixture models.

The retrieval is realized through mapping and solving a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem [1]. MIL is a supervised learning problem in which the interest is to know the ""instance"" label according to the known labels of the ""bag"" containing the instances. This problem can be mapped exactly to a region-based Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) scenario, in which it is assumed that the user is only interested in one particular region of the query image instead of the image as a whole. By incorporating Relevance Feedback (RF) [2] technique in CBIR, in each retrieval iteration the user is asked for the relativity of each retrieved image to the query image region. Therefore, the label of the whole image (bag) is known. The learning algorithm then needs to find out the labels of the unseen image regions (instances) in the database. In the proposed system, the One-class Support Vector Machine (SVM) [3] is applied as the learning algorithm.

This approach can be considered as a special case of pseudo distance theory implementation. There is a functional prediction system in the observed power and heat producing company which makes the information retrieval in cooperation with the domain expert less difficult. The knowledge on the price and on the not acceptable errors is used for modification of the learning error function.

Current research on re- trieval in P2P systems focuses largely on keyword-based retrieval and other weakly interactive query paradigms. In contrast, interaction is at the center of our contri- bution. We demo a Bayesian, PicHunter-like image browser that helps the user in finding images in distributed col- lections. Such browsers operate by presenting sequences of thumbnail-based collection overviews to the user, at each step collecting user feedback that is used to update a Bayesian model. Our approach is scalable in that the state of the Bayesian model is maintained locally in the browsing peer and only a few thumbnails are requested from the network at each step. Each query step is thus done in a short timeframe. At the conference we will present one peer that is connected to a P2P network consisting of 50 peers, let- ting visitors try the browsing functionality of our sys- tem.","","POD:0-7695-3084-2","10.1109/ISM.Workshops.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4475947","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Conferences;Image retrieval;Informatics;Information retrieval;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Tagging","","","","0","","3","","","10-12 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We chose a TV-guide that offers recommendations to users on interesting programs according to their tastes to be our case. Participants were asked to tag a number of TV programs. They were also asked to give a rating for the program. The results show a variety of tags. We composed a category scheme of these tags, which on a high level distinguishes between attitude tags, content tags, and self-reference tags. Tags that reflect the genre, the participant's opinion, and the program's characteristics were assigned most often.

This requires characterizing program execution behavior. Equally important is the aspect of diagnosing (finding root-cause of) faults encountered. In this article, we address the problem of identifying the root cause of failure from the test sequences that caused failure. Taking analogies from biological sequence alignment and information retrieval domains we propose two approaches for finding the root cause of failure. The first approach is to align all the test sequences pertaining to a fault and identifying the common pattern among these sequences. The other approach is based on an information retrieval technique viz., the latent semantic indexing (LSI). Our experiments and analysis showed that the sequence alignment based approach has the potential to aid significantly in identifying the root cause of failure. The LSI based approach automatically clusters the test sequences based on their functionality, which assists in determining the different manifestations of a fault.","1530-0803;15300803","POD:978-0-7695-3100-7","10.1109/ASWEC.2008.4483225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483225","API;Fault Diagnosis;Latent Semantic Indexing;Root Cause Analysis;Sequence Alignment","Australia;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Fault diagnosis;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Software engineering;Testing","program diagnostics;program testing;software fault tolerance","fault diagnosis;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;program execution behavior;root cause analysis;sequence alignment;software fault identification;test sequence","","3","","16","","","26-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In case a leaf is about to split, some distant objects are removed from the leaf (reducing the covering radius), and then again inserted into the M-tree in a usual way. A regular leaf split is performed only after a series of unsuccessful reinsertion attempts. We expect the forced reinsertions will result in more compact M- tree hierarchies (i.e., more efficient query processing), while the index construction costs should be kept as low as possible. Considering both low construction costs and low querying costs, we examine several combinations of construction policies with reinsertions. The experiments show that forced reinsertions could significantly decrease the number of distance computations, thus speeding up indexing as well as querying.","","POD:978-0-7695-3101-4","10.1109/SISAP.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492933","M-tree;forced reinsertions","Application software;Biometrics;Costs;Data structures;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Query processing;Routing;Software engineering","query processing;tree data structures","M-tree building method;metric access methods;regular leaf split","","2","","16","","","11-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This perspective is accessible to computer scientists, as primary sequence data is modeled as strings and fundamental algorithmic tools can be applied. However, by sticking with this formative foundation, we computer scientists are failing to recognize new challenges and opportunities arising in this rapidly changing arena. Most notably, sequence data represents a polymer; a complex molecule is itself composed of a linear sequence of smaller molecules (monomers). The monomers interact with each other, both with their local neighbors and at long range, forming secondary and tertiary structure. As more sophisticated similarity models incorporate elements of these three-dimensional chemical environments, they have the potential to supplant the use of primary structure homology as the foremost method of data retrieval.","","POD:978-0-7695-3101-4","10.1109/SISAP.2008.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492920","bioinformatics;metric space;similarity search","Amino acids;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Cells (biology);Genomics;Information retrieval;Proteins;RNA;Sequences","biology;information retrieval","biological data retrieval;biological sequence similarity;gene sequence;homology-based retrieval","","0","","26","","","11-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these query-adaptive approaches can range from meta-search over text collections to multimodal search over video databases, we propose that all such systems can be framed and discussed in the context of a single, unified framework. In our paper, we keep an eye towards the domain of video search, where search cues are available from a rich set of modalities, including textual speech transcripts, low-level visual features, and high-level semantic concept detectors. The relative efficacy of each of the modalities is highly variant between many types of queries. We observe that the state of the art in query-adaptive retrieval frameworks for video collections is highly dependent upon the definition of classes of queries, which are groups of queries that share similar optimal search strategies, while many applications in text and Web retrieval have included many advanced strategies, such as direct prediction of search method performance and inclusion of contextual cues from the searcher. We conclude that such advanced strategies previously developed for text retrieval have a broad range of possible applications in future research in multimodal video search.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2008.916345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457922","Multimedia indexing and retrieval;multimodal search;query-adaptive fusion;query-class-dependent models","Detectors;High definition video;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Search engines;Search methods;Spatial databases;Speech;Visual databases;Web search","multimedia computing;query processing;video retrieval","Web retrieval;high-level semantic concept detectors;low-level visual features;metasearch;multimodal search;query-adaptive retrieval;query-adaptive search;text retrieval;textual speech transcripts;video search","","15","5","59","","","April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In its first phase, the QoS consideration design relied only on the underlying physical network, depending on some traffic engineering such as the classification of the traffic as well as QoS-routing mechanism etc. However, the QoS-aware service management, especially for the QoS service adaptation within overlay network, has been neglected. In this paper, we propose a solution, which enable QoS information into the overlay service management, so as to provide a QoS aware service overlay network (QSON). Within such QSON, service components are organized into different subnets, while, the service belonging to the same subnet has the similar QoS. With the help of such QoS-aware service subnets, service lookup and selection will be achieved in a way where QoS is integrated into such information retrieval. Using a P2P-based service location system, the service routing will be QoS-aware, and is proved to be scalable and have good performance.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1009-5; POD:978-1-4244-1008-8","10.1109/CHINACOM.2007.4469494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469494","Ambient Networks;QoS-awareenss for overlay;context-aware;overlay network;self-management","Ambient networks;Design engineering;Distributed computing;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Quality of service;Research and development;Routing;Service oriented architecture;Telecommunication traffic","computer network management;peer-to-peer computing;performance evaluation;quality of service;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic","P2P-based service location system;QoS-aware service adaptation;QoS-aware service adaptive transport overlay network;QoS-aware service management;QoS-routing mechanism;ambient network service lookup;network traffic;performance evaluation;virtual network","","2","","22","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A main step in many distance based XML clustering algorithms is to calculate pair-wise distances between documents; naturally, a time-efficient technique requests the pair-wise distances to be determined in a timely manner. In case of dynamic XML documents, the amount of changes between versions cannot be predicted. Therefore, in case of clustered dynamic XML documents, if changes were little or if they affected only some of the clustered documents, recalculating pair-wise distances every time would be highly redundant.

Current research on retrieval in P2P systems focuses largely on keyword-based retrieval and other weakly in- teractive query paradigms. Within this paper, we present a Bayesian image browser that helps the user in finding images in dis- tributed collections. Bayesian image browsers operate by presenting sequences of thumbnail-based collections to the user, at each step collecting user feedback that is used to update a Bayesian model. In contrast to query by example (QBE) no initial query image is needed in order to start the query process. Our approach is scalable in that the state of the Bayesian model is maintained locally in the browsing peer and only a small number of thumbnails is requested from the network at each step. Each query step is thus done in a short time frame. In this paper we present the method, as well as first experiments done using a JXTA-based implementation.","","POD:0-7695-3084-2","10.1109/ISM.Workshops.2007.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4475989","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Computer science;Conferences;Image retrieval;Informatics;Information retrieval;Network servers;Peer to peer computing","","","","0","","15","","","10-12 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of this method can produce dimension reduction by as much as a factor of n, the number of data points in the database, over sequential search. We demonstrate that the curse of dimensionality is not based on the dimension of the data itself, but primarily upon the effective dimension of the distance function. We also introduce a new distance function that utilizes fewer dimensions of the higher dimensional space to produce a maximal lower bound distance in order to approximate the full distance function.

"Application of Bioinformatics in the Design of Gene Expression Microarrays","S. Khalid; M. Khan; P. Wang; X. Liu; S. L.

Although microarrays have the power to distinguish between the expression levels of genes within cells that are representative of various conditions the immediate results require further mining to determine the genes, which have been differentially expressed. This process narrows down the dataset to only those genes that are of most interest to the researcher from which hypotheses can be generated regarding their significance within the molecular mechanism being investigated. Consequently, this would lead to a more in-depth investigation within the researchers area of expertise and potential further microarray experiments. Such experiments would aim to answer more detailed biological questions arising from the analysis of the initial microarray. As a result of the enhanced focus, it would be ideal to use more specialised microarrays to gain further knowledge into the biological aspect under examination. Although commercially available they may be of limited use if they fail to represent the targeted pathways and biological processes to the extent required. Hence, customised microarrays become extremely advantageous benefiting researchers with particular requirements. Furthermore, due to the immense cost of DNA gene chips it is not feasible to purchase microarrays for every biological question. As a result it becomes imperative for biologists to maximise the use of existing gene sets. In order to achieve this, bioinformatics tools are necessary to extract meaningful data from the gene set according to a biologists requirements. To this end, we have developed the first software called Gene Chip Design which can extract meaningful data from a given gene set according to a biologists needs. Our unique information retrieval software is a powerful, flexible and - user-friendly tool aimed at researchers needing to generate personalised custom in-house arrays that represent the genes from specialised biological pathways of interest. With the inbuilt functionality to generate from any given generalised gene set a novel gene chip specific to a researchers interest, our software can be applied within any biological field. We have also integrated an ontology to allow the global functional characterisation of any given gene set, together with the unique ability to categories genes in a more structured and informative manner within numerous functional groups. Furthermore, our software identifies biological pathways pertaining to genes of interest and more so highlights such genes within complex pathways. These aspects also provide researchers with the control to identify further genes with biological functions of interest to extract from their gene set and incorporate into their unique gene chip. Using our NIA 15K Mouse cDNA Clone Gene Set, we have designed several gene chips including an oncology gene chip. Furthermore, combined with our previous microarray experimental results we have developed a novel immuno-tolerance gene chip that can be used for further studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying autoimmune disease.

We introduce a novel motion descriptor based on optical flow measurements in a spatiotemporal volume for each stabilized human figure, and an associated similarity measure to be used in a nearest-neighbor framework. Making use of noisy optical flow measurements is the key challenge, which is addressed by treating optical flow not as precise pixel displacements, but rather as a spatial pattern of noisy measurements which are carefully smoothed and aggregated to form our spatiotemporal motion descriptor. To classify the action being performed by a human figure in a query sequence, we retrieve nearest neighbor(s) from a database of stored, annotated video sequences. We can also use these retrieved exemplars to transfer 2D/3D skeletons onto the figures in the query sequence, as well as two forms of data-based action synthesis ""do as I do"" and ""do as I say"".

Only statistical information about future queries is available during encoding and storage. Fusion coding of correlated sources poses new challenges due to the conflicting objectives of exploiting inter-source correlations and enabling efficient selective retrieval. Practical signal compression imposes additional constraints on system complexity. We propose a shared-descriptions approach for the design of lossy fusion coding systems, to manage the precise tradeoffs between storage rate, retrieval rate, distortion and system complexity, within one unified framework. An iterative descent algorithm is derived for the design of such fusion coders.

In fact, despite the great attention that this primitive has received in traditional and even multidimensional databases, little has been done for general metric databases. We consider a particular type of similarity join: Given two sets of objects and a distance threshold r, find all the object pairs (one from each set) at distance at most r. For this sake, we devise a new metric index, coined List of Twin Clusters, which indexes both sets jointly (instead of the natural approach of indexing one or both sets independently). Our results show significant speedups over the basic quadratic-time naive alternative. Furthermore, we show that our technique can be easily extended to other similarity join variants, e.g., finding the k-closest pairs.","","POD:978-0-7695-3101-4","10.1109/SISAP.2008.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492934","Similarity joins","Cleaning;Data mining;Data structures;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Recruitment;Resumes;Search problems","data structures;database management systems;query processing","data structure;general metric databases;k-nearest neighbor search;metric index;metric spaces;multidimensional databases;similarity joins;twin clusters","","0","","13","","","11-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pivot-based search algorithm precomputes some distances to these reference points, which are used to discard objects during a search without comparing them directly with the query. Though most of the algorithms proposed to date select these reference points at random, previous works have shown the importance of intelligently selecting these points for the index performance. However, the proposed pivot selection techniques need to know beforehand the complete database to obtain good results, which inevitably makes the index static. More recent works have addressed this problem, proposing techniques that dynamically select pivots as the database grows. This paper presents a new technique for choosing pivots, that combines the good properties of previous proposals with the recently proposed dynamic selection. The experimental evaluation provided in this paper shows that the new proposed technique outperforms the state-of-art methods for selecting pivots.","","POD:978-0-7695-3101-4","10.1109/SISAP.2008.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4492931","Pivot selection;similarity search","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computational biology;Computer science;Databases;Indexes;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Partitioning algorithms;Proposals","query processing","dynamic pivot selection technique;index static;pivot-based search algorithm;similarity search","","7","","7","","","11-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To efficiently manage and exchange multimedia information, interoperability between coded data and metadata is required and standardization is central to achieving the necessary level of interoperability. In the context of this paper, the term retrieval refers to the process by which a user, human or machine, identifies the content it needs, and the term delivery refers to the adaptive transport and consumption of the identified content in a particular context or usage environment. Both the retrieval and delivery processes may require content and context metadata. This paper will argue that maximum quality of experience depends not only on the content itself (and thus content metadata) but also on the consumption conditions (thus context metadata). Additionally, the rights and protection conditions have become critically important in recent years, especially with the explosion of electronic music commerce and different ldquoshoppingrdquo conditions. This paper will review existing multimedia standards related to information retrieval and adaptive delivery of multimedia content, emphasizing the need for such standards, and will show how these standards can help the development, dissemination, and valorization of MIR research results. Moreover, it will also discuss limitations of the current standards and anticipate what future standardization activities are relevant and needed.

However, its flexibility would make a non contiguous retrieval of partial stream data, which degrade disk performance greatly. We note that in a disk array the video data can be split into several discontinuous sub-streams by the striping manner of disk array. In view of this, we reorganize sub-streams taking into account both of the decoding dependency of two dimensional scalable video and the location in a disk array. It is shown that the advantages of our placement include: minimizing the seek frequency while maximizing utilization of each disk, maximizing the load balancing and parallelism of disk array.

Experiments dealing with the well-known Reuters-21578 and Ohsumed datasets show that our method can achieve a better classification accuracy while reducing the feature dimension dramatically.","","POD:978-0-7695-3096-3","10.1109/WAINA.2008.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483086","feature selection","Data analysis;Entropy;Filters;Gain measurement;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Sampling methods;Text categorization;Vocabulary","classification;feature extraction;information retrieval","classification;feature selection methods;hidden topic analysis;information retrieval;text categorization","","3","","16","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is also pass-efficient because sampling and quantizing are combined together in a single step and the whole process can be completed within one pass over the input matrix. In the evaluations on compression ratio and reconstruction error, the sampling method exhibits impressive capability in providing succinct and tight approximations for the input matrices. The most significant finding in the classification experiment is that the <i>k</i>-NN classifier based on the approximation can even outperform the standard one.

Several solutions to this problem have been proposed, starting with Berkman and Vishkin's linear-space solution [6], and leading to a succinct solution using only 2n + o(n) bits in addition to the input array [12]. The theoretical contribution of this article is to push this latter approach one step further and show that for compressible input arrays the RMQ-information can be compressed as well. In particular, we show that information for 0(l)-RMQs can be stored within the same entropy bounds that are achieved by the currently best schemes for storing A itself in compressed form, while still being able to access O(logn) contiguous bits in O(l) time [10]. Two such entropy- bounded schemes for 0(l)-RMQs are developed, each with its own practical advantage. We test these two methods extensively and compare them to three other schemes for RMQs: the currently best non-succinct solution [2], and two succinct approaches: Sadakane's 4n + o(n)-bit solution [22], and our own 2n + o(n)-bit solution. The results of this practical evaluation are (1) the practical space consumptions of the non-compressed schemes scale surprisingly well with their theoretical guarantees, and (2) for compressible input arrays our new compressed schemes can indeed reduce the space, with little or no slowdown in query time.","1068-0314;10680314","POD:978-0-7695-3121-2","10.1109/DCC.2008.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483305","entropy-bounded scheme;range minimum query;succinct data structure","Compressors;Data compression;Data flow computing;Data structures;Entropy;Flow graphs;Information retrieval;Navigation;Testing;Tree graphs","computational complexity;data compression;data structures;entropy;query processing","Berkman-Vishkin linear-space solution;RMQ-information compression;array preprocessing;practical entropy-bounded scheme;range minimum query","","3","","28","","","25-27 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In support of these applications, we explored a search strategy for k- nearest neighbor searches with MVP-trees that greedily identifies k answers and then improves the answer set monotonically. The algorithm returns an approximate solution when terminated early, as determined by a limiting radius or an internal measure of progress. Given unbounded time the algorithm terminates with an exact solution. Approximate solutions to k-nearest neighbor search provide much needed speed improvement to hard nearest-neighbor problems. Our anytime approximate formulation is well suited for interactive search applications as well as applications where the distance function itself is an approximation.

Computational semantics performs a conceptualization of the world using computational processes for composing a meaning representation structure from available signs and their features present, for example, in words and sentences. Spoken language understanding (SLU) is the interpretation of signs conveyed by a speech signal. SLU and natural language understanding (NLU) share the goal of obtaining a conceptual representation of natural language sentences. Specific to SLU is the fact that signs to be used for interpretation are coded into signals along with other information such as speaker identity. Furthermore, spoken sentences often do not follow the grammar of a language; they exhibit self-corrections, hesitations, repetitions, and other irregular phenomena. SLU systems contain an automatic speech recognition (ASR) component and must be robust to noise due to the spontaneous nature of spoken language and the errors introduced by ASR. Moreover, ASR components output a stream of words with no structure information like punctuation and sentence boundaries. Therefore, SLU systems cannot rely on such markers and must perform text segmentation and understanding at the same time.","1053-5888;10535888","","10.1109/MSP.2008.918413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4490201","","Automatic speech recognition;Handicapped aids;Information retrieval;Logic;Natural languages;Noise robustness;Performance analysis;Qualifications;Routing;Speech processing","computational linguistics;grammars;natural languages;speech recognition","SLU systems;automatic speech recognition;computational semantics;grammar;natural language understanding;speech signal;spoken language understanding","","26","","30","","","May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our method is available as a pre-processing of applications for mining various opinions. In order to find personal documents on the Web, we focus on four kinds of subjective expressions: (1) negative meaning expressions, (2) final particles, (3) interjections, and (4) specific symbols such as face marks. Measuring the frequencies of these subjective expressions in a document, our method classifies Web documents into personal and non-personal ones. Besides, our method gives the documents scores which show the accuracy of the classification results. We experimentally confirmed the effectiveness of the proposal using 1200 Web documents. The experimental results have shown the precision and recall of the proposed classification are 0.70 and 0.87, respectively. In addition, we have confirmed that personal documents can be easily obtained by gathering documents which are given high scores.","","POD:978-0-7695-3096-3","10.1109/WAINA.2008.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483080","Personal Web Pages;Subjective Expressions;WWW","Application software;Blogs;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency measurement;Informatics;Information retrieval;Proposals;Search engines;Technology planning","Internet;classification;data mining;information retrieval;text analysis","Japanese Web documents;documents scoring;face marks;final particles;interjections;negative meaning expressions;opinion mining;personal Web document retrieval;personal opinions;subjective expression extraction","","0","","10","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Timely business information convergence is necessary for the collaboration but difficult to achieve in such environment. A framework is proposed to adaptively collect the process information in dual-shore software outsourcing and to timely share the information among these heterogeneous working units. The further information analysis is also enabled, which may enhance the timely collaboration and decision making.","","POD:0-7695-3038-9","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472279","","Collaborative work;Computer science;Convergence;Decision making;Educational institutions;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information security;Information technology;Outsourcing","","","","1","","13","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Proposal of cascade neural network model for text document space dimension reduction by latent semantic indexing","I. Mokris; L.

This model comes out of the vector space model, which for document set uses the full index representation. To decrease the matrix dimension for document set representation the Latent Semantic Model is used. Main advantage of latent semantic model in relation to the vector space model is the great reduction of the matrix dimension for document set representation. Described approach is performed by cascade neural network.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2106-0; POD:978-1-4244-2105-3","10.1109/SAMI.2008.4469139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4469139","","Indexing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Neural networks;Neurons;Proposals;Shape;Singular value decomposition","indexing;information retrieval;natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis","Slovak language;cascade neural network;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;matrix dimension;text document space dimension reduction","","3","","11","","","21-22 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Genre Categorization of Web Pages","J. Chaker; O. Habib","King Saud Univ., Riyadh","Seventh IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW 2007)","20080331","2007","","","455","464","With the increase of the number of web pages, it is very difficult to find wanted information easily and quickly out of thousands of web pages retrieved by a search engine. To solve this problem, many researches propose to classify documents according to their genre, which is another criteria to classify documents different from the topic. Most of these works assign a document to only one genre. In this paper we propose a new flexible approach for document genre categorization. Flexibility means that our approach assigns a document to all predefined genres with different weights. The proposed approach is based on the combination of two homogenous classifiers: contextual and structural classifiers. The contextual classifier uses the URL, while the structural classifier uses the document structure. Both contextual and structural classifiers are centroid-based classifiers. Experimentations provide a micro-averaged breakeven point (BEP) more than 85%, which is better than those obtained by other categorization approaches.","2375-9232;23759232","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3033-8; POD:0-7695-3033-8","10.1109/ICDMW.2007.120","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4476707","","Computer science;Conferences;Data mining;Educational institutions;Graphics;HTML;Information retrieval;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","Internet;classification;information retrieval;search engines;text analysis","Web page retrieval;contextual classifier;document classification;document genre categorization;search engine;structural classifier","","7","","40","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique of crash-only failure is proposed as a useful first step and we illustrate how it is particularly applicable to web services in a SOA.","","POD:978-0-7695-3082-6","10.1109/MCETECH.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483423","","Availability;Computer crashes;Contracts;Information retrieval;Mission critical systems;Protocols;Runtime;Semiconductor optical amplifiers;Service oriented architecture;Web services","Web services;semantic Web;software architecture","Web services;failure semantics;service descriptions;service failure;service-oriented architecture","","0","","13","","","23-25 Jan. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new approach of integrating four processes for Web resource categorization which can promote the efficiency of information retrieval. The processes can extract both the explicit relations extracted directly from the ontologies in a traditional way and the potential relations inferred from existing ontologies by focusing on some new challenges such as extracting important class names, using WordNet relations and detecting the methods of describing the Web resources. Our proposed method can achieve a notable improvement in categorizing the valuable Web resources based on incomplete ontologies for a Semantic Web search system.","","POD:978-0-7695-3096-3","10.1109/WAINA.2008.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4483084","","Animals;Data mining;Dictionaries;Horses;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Search engines;Semantic Web;World Wide Web","information analysis;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","WordNet relation;information retrieval;ontology;semantic Web resource categorization","","0","","10","","","25-28 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
