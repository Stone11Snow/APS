Integrating LCA into the design process can only be achieved by automating the extraction of LCI-relevant product data. Product models, that are used in product design, contain information relevant to the LCI and enabling structured access to that data reduces the amount of work for the LCA analyst by avoiding repeated determination and input of LCI data (data redundancy). This paper introduces a framework for a structured data retrieval in an LCA context through the use of feature technology. In a product model that includes a feature model, information on design features (e.g. geometry, dimensions) and manufacturing properties (e.g. material used, machining process applied) are included. Structured and efficient access to the LCI relevant data can be realized by a dedicated application program interface (API) bridging the gap between an LCA program and the product model. The characteristics and basic functionality of the API are described and the advantages of using an API are discussed. The basic idea of the framework is illustrated with a designed part","","POD:0-7695-1266-6","10.1109/.2001.992358","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992358","","Data mining;Information analysis;Information geometry;Information retrieval;Machining;Manufacturing processes;Process design;Product design;Solid modeling;Virtual manufacturing","CAD/CAM;application program interfaces;engineering information systems;environmental factors;information retrieval;manufacturing data processing;production engineering computing","data redundancy;dedicated application program interface;feature model;feature technology;life cycle assessment;life cycle inventories;manufacturing properties;product design;product models;structured data retrieval framework","","2","","","","","2001","11 Dec 2001-15 Dec 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scientific data models are especially difficult to integrate because of their wide variety, high granularity, large storage requirements, and open-ended use requirements. NCSA is fortunate to have an opportunity, through its applications technologies teams and its close relationships with government organizations such as NASA and the National Cancer Institute, to investigate new tools and strategies for integrating distributed scientific data collections.

This makes it impossible to specify management policies for individual objects. Instead it is necessary to specify policy for groups of objects. This paper describes a framework for the construction of the ADlets Distributed Migration Mechanism (ADDMM), which is used by the Adlet System for the management of adlets. The Adlet System is a new approach for multimedia information retrieval and fusion based on the concept of active document advertising, whereby an adlet (the metadata of a document) travels in the network to seek out documents of interest to the parent document, and at the same time advertises its parent document to other interested adlets. ADDMM provides the Adlet System with the facility of managing migrating adlets. ADDMM supports location-independent transparency and minimal interface by utilizing the ADDNS naming system that provides a mechanism for transparent naming and locating adlets, which in turn supports ADDMM transparency at the adlet access level. With the ADDMM migration mechanism, various adlet migration protocols can be constructed and deployed. A visual diagram is introduced to specify such protocols for adlets migration, which can also be employed to specify distributed object management policies","","POD:0-7695-0607-0","10.1109/ISORC.2000.839539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839539","","Access protocols;Advertising;Data structures;Databases;Electrical capacitance tomography;Identity-based encryption;Information retrieval;Manipulator dynamics;Multimedia systems;Remotely operated vehicles","diagrams;distributed object management;information resources;meta data;multimedia databases;naming services","ADDMM;ADlets Distributed Migration Mechanism;Adlet System;active document advertising;adlet migration protocols;distributed object management policies;large distributed systems;location-independent transparency;metadata;multimedia information retrieval;naming system;transparent naming;visual diagram","","0","1","20","","","2000","15 Mar 2000-17 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This kind of technique is greatly affected by two factors: synonymy (different words having the same meaning) and polysemy (a word with several meanings), also known as ambiguity. Synonymy may result in a loss of semantic difference, while polysemy may lead to wrong semantic links. S.J. Green (1999) proposed the concept of a synset (a set of words having the same or a close meaning) and used a synset method to solve the problems of synonymy and polysemy. Although the synonymy problem can be solved, the polysemy problem still remains, because it is not actually possible to use an entire document as a basis to identify the meaning of a word. In this paper, we propose the concept of a context-related semantic set in order to identify the meaning of a word by considering the relations between the word and its contexts.

We present an approach to querying flat files as well as Web data sources through an object database view based on a database system and a wrapper. Generally, a wrapper has two tasks: it first sends a query to the source to retrieve data and, secondly builds the expected output with respect to the virtual structure. Scientific data servers, and in particular the ones publicly available on the Web, usually provide information retrieval techniques to access data. Our wrappers are composed of a retrieval component, based on an intermediate object view mechanism called `search views' mapping the source capabilities to attributes, and a XML engine to perform these two tasks. If the retrieval component is specific to each data source, this approach shows that the extraction component (the XML engine) can be common. We describe our system and focus on the retrieval component of the Object-Web Wrapper (OWW) for Web sources. The originality of our approach consists of (1) a common wrapper architecture for flat files and Web data sources sharing a XML engine for data extraction, (2) a generic view mechanism to access data sources with limited capabilities, and (3) the representation of hyperlinks as abstract attributes in the object view as well as their use in the search view.

Raw multimedia data is assumed to exist in the form of programs that typically consist of a combination of media types such as visual, audio, and text. We partition each such media stream into smaller units based on actual physical events. These physical events within each media stream can then be effectively indexed for retrieval. The concept of logical events is introduced next; we define logical events as those that can provide different “views” of the content as may be desired by a user. Such events usually result from either the correlation of events that cross different media types, of by merging recursively chosen events from a lower level within each media type. We then address the related issue of how to develop a practical multimedia information retrieval system that exploits the aforementioned concepts of physical and logical events as well as other aspects such as storage, representation and indexing to enable efficient search, retrieval, and browsing. Finally, we implement the proposed concepts and solutions within a multimedia system that addresses a real application, effective browsing of broadcast news, and evaluate its performance","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/76.856446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=856446","","Engines;Explosions;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 4 Standard;MPEG 7 Standard;Merging;Multimedia communication;Multimedia systems;Streaming media","broadcasting;database indexing;image retrieval;multimedia databases;multimedia servers;online front-ends;telecommunication standards","MPEG-7;audio media;broadcast news;events correlation;logical events;media stream indexing;multimedia browser;multimedia data;multimedia description standard;multimedia information retrieval system;multimedia search;performance;physical events;representation;server implementation;storage;system application;system implementation;text;visual media","","6","30","22","","","Aug 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For tasks such as information retrieval or information filtering, it is therefore necessary to reduce the dimensionality. A statistical method called latent semantic analysis (LSA) can be used not only for dimensional reduction but also for transformation of the original space into a much lower-dimensional but much more meaningful feature space, usually called a semantic space. However, LSA is known to consume a lot of both memory and computational time. This paper illustrates how to resolve these problems. Neural networks are proposed that perform LSA in a quasi-parallel fashion, where only one orthogonal factor spanning the semantic space is computed at a time. The memory space required could therefore be significantly reduced. In addition, due to their homogeneous structures and learning rules, implementation of the neural networks could be readily done on a VLSI chip or any parallel processing system.

Since very few data and information systems existed at the time, users accepted this paradigm and worked within its framework. In the past year, another data access paradigm has emerged and is gaining popularity among members of the EOSDIS user community. The new approach is one of discovery and navigation where the user interface shows the user everything that is available and the user simply navigates to what is needed. The authors have also seen that some of their more serious or routine users have special needs and require very flexible user interfaces to meet their special needs.

However the traditional probabilistic retrieval model lacks the ability to handle structural information. We define a new retrieval function based on the probabilistic model which overcomes this drawback. The presented query language allows the assignment of structural roles to individual terms. The efficient evaluation of queries in this framework requires appropriate index structures. We design text and structure indexes and show how their information is combined during evaluation.

Its dual view interface always returns the retrieved results in two views: a list of titles for document space and “Topic Word Graph” for word space. They are lightly coupled with their cross-reference relation, and inspire users for further interaction. DualNAVI supports two kinds of search facilities, document associative search and keyword associative search, both of them are similarity based search from given items as a query. The dual view provides a natural interface to invoke these two search functions.

We review two relevant lines of research bearing on this question and show how our results are being used in the design of a new Web interface for cross-language text retrieval. One line of research, ""interactive IR"", is concerned with the user interface issues for information retrieval systems such as how best to display the results of a text search. We review our current research, on ""document thumbnail"" visualizations, and discuss current Web conventions, practices and folklore. The other area of research, ""Cross-Language Text Retrieval"", is concerned with the design of automatic techniques, including Machine Translation, to retrieve texts in languages other than the language of the query. We review work we have done concerning query translation and multilingual text summarization. We then describe how these results are being applied and extended in the design a new demonstration interface, Keizai, an end-to-end, Web-based, cross-language text retrieval system. Beginning with an English query, the system will search Japanese and Korean Web data and display English summaries of the top ranking documents. A user should be able to accurately judge which foreign language documents are relevant to their information need and glean necessary information from the translation to schedule specific documents for human translation and subsequent analysis.","","POD:0-7695-0493-0","10.1109/HICSS.2000.926726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926726","","Dictionaries;Displays;Humans;Identity-based encryption;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Prototypes;Read only memory;User interfaces;Visualization","information retrieval systems;language translation;search engines;text analysis","Keizai;Web interface;cross-language text retrieval;document thumbnail visualizations;end-to-end Web-based cross-language text retrieval system;foreign language documents;human interactions;information retrieval systems;multilingual text summarization;query translation","","7","30","18","","","4-7 Jan. 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, in order for faculty to become involved in the development of “online” courses, the production process must be easy and convenient. Second, before either faculty or students are willing to go “online”, both must be convinced that there are advantages to an Internet-based course over video-tapes and, in fact, advantages over a classroom, such as searching and indexing, assessment, and the ability to view or re-view a lecture “on-demand”. In this paper, we describe some of our efforts over the last year to overcome these obstacles.

But there are information needs, which require the utilization of image evidence. In this paper, we investigate image-feature for large and heterogeneous collections. Both the nature and complexities of information needs are key elements for an effective retrieval. Retrieval needs that depend on perceptual similarities (as found in art galleries, building architecture) require the utilization of visual cues.

Because of the temporal nature of music and the inexactness of user queries, most effort on music retrieval systems focus on issues such as indexing and approximation match. In contrast, the processing of music before feature extraction, such as the identification of a melody track, were often considered easy or done. This may be the case in a controlled environment, such as one for musicology research, where the pieces are carefully analyzed by human beings before being submitted to the database. However, in an environment where large volumes of music is obtained from the Web, manual music analysis is impractical. Since many well-known musical features often pertain to the melody of musical pieces, and users often remember the melody of a song, algorithms that select the melody tracks of a piece are important for Web-based content-based retrieval systems.

It is especially difficult for naive users to discover informative pages by popular Web search engines, since they don't have background and domain knowledge about the status of Web systems. Therefore, many kinds of Web search engines have been developed in order to support the processes of Web information retrieval. We are developing the Japanese Web search engine “Mondou (RCAAU)”. Though our engine is one of the first generation of Web search engines, we tried to implement the rapidly emerging technologies of data mining in our search engine from 1995. We are also implementing Java applets based on information visualization. The author presents technical overviews of the Mondou Web search engine. One of the most important techniques is the text mining algorithms based on the primitive association rules. Mondou provides highly relevant feedback keywords to users, in order to support search steps. Using the associative keywords, users can modify the combination of keywords in the initial query. We also introduce the concept of an integrated query mechanism for different search engines based on the KQML agents. Furthermore, in order to visualize the characteristics of search results, we are developing Java applets to display the ROC graph and the clusters of specific documents. We are also trying the improve Web robots for the Mondou system from the view point of data cleaning.

The prime source of this information is to be extracted from vertical profiles of radar reflectivity obtained with the CloudSat 94 GHz nadir pointing radar. When this information is augmented by other measurements of the constellation, a rich data source for studying clouds, precipitation and the interaction of cloud processes with aerosol can be expected.

Access to heterogeneous local systems can now be performed via a single query interface, integrating features of database query systems and information retrieval or search services. BlueView distributed query processing allows for combining structured queries against meta data with content-based (text retrieval) queries against full-text collections. Legacy systems such as existing preprint servers, search engines, or meta data (catalog) systems can also be integrated. Meta data and full-text documents can be replicated within this distributed architecture. In particular, in the view of members of a certain university, metadata and documents can be replicated to a local document server and integrated under different local user views.

The obtained vectors are projected into the latent semantic subspace determined by SVD, where the vectors are then smoothed by a self-organizing map (SOM). The smoothing by the closest document clusters is important here, because the documents are often short and have a high word error rate (WER). As the clusters in the semantic subspace reflect the news topics, the SOMs provide an easy way to visualize the index and query results and to explore the database.

In order to realize quite compact structure, this paper presents a compression method by dividing the trie constructed into several pieces (blocks). It enables us to reduce the number of bits representing entries of the double arrays. The trie obtained must trace to the blocks and this causes that retrieval time might be slow because of a state connection. To solve this problem, we propose a new trie construction method to compress and minimize the number of state connections.

First, we discuss the effects of five feature normalization methods on retrieval performance. Then, we show that the probabilistic methods perform significantly better than geometric approaches like the nearest neighbor rule with city-block or Euclidean distances. They are also more robust to normalization effects and using better models for the features improves the retrieval results compared to making only general assumptions.

The number of electronic data files made accessible by metadata increases rapidly, however at the present retrieving textual, audio, video and/or mixed data files through metadata is definitely restricted. In particular, there is only a limited number of metadata formats at hand. Nevertheless, within the framework of testbeds, some efforts have been made not only to develop retrieval systems adjusted to the respective field of application, but also to unite several metadata formats into one system in order to obtain better search results. This paper describes specifications for developing an attribute service which, as part of the “Dragon Slayer” distributed file system, is intended to offer a uniform platform for different metadata formats, and to offer efficient information metadata retrieval. Via the interface provided by the Dragon Slayer file system, the user can assign metadata to files and reference them via these metadata. For each metadata format used, an external meta module is incorporated into the file system which, depending on its format, manages and searches for metadata in a database, according to their format","1089-6503;10896503","POD:0-7695-0780-8","10.1109/EURMIC.2000.874405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=874405","","Databases;Electronic mail;File servers;File systems;Floods;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Network servers;Operating systems;System testing","cataloguing;distributed databases;meta data;multimedia databases;query processing","Dragon Slayer distributed file system;cataloguing;electronic data files;external meta module;interface;meta data management;multimedia;retrieval systems","","1","94","15","","","2000","05 Sep 2000-07 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Angular information is used for generating the feature vector (index) as it gives global description of the image, allows compact indexing, fast retrieval and scale, translation and rotation invariant matching. In the case of very large images, however, the angular information is not always sufficient to differentiate images from each other. To alleviate this problem, we extend the idea by including also positional information of the lines in the feature vector. This gives more representative description of the images and therefore allows more accurate image matching. The main problems of this approach are: (1) to keep the feature vector compact, and (2) to preserve the property of the matching being translation and rotation invariant. We give solutions to both of these problems and introduce a new indexing scheme, which has better matching accuracy but at the cost of slower retrieval time","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-0750-6","10.1109/ICPR.2000.902940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=902940","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Engineering drawings;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Spatial databases","Hough transforms;content-based retrieval;document image processing;image matching;image retrieval","Hough transform;angular information;compact indexing;content-based image retrieval;fast retrieval;feature vector;image differentiation;line-drawing image indexing;matching accuracy;positional information;retrieval time;rotation-invariant matching;scale-invariant matching;translation-invariant matching","","2","3","6","","","2000","03 Sep 2000-07 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Research to extract maximum benefit from the Internet is still in its infancy. Different research areas like data mining, information retrieval, machine learning and knowledge discovery, are giving the problem due attention and all seem to converge onto a common theme-wrappers. Wrappers provide access to heterogeneous information sources by converting or translating queries into source specific queries or commands. We discuss improvements on a distinctive approach, wrapper conduction, to automatically generate a wrapper once an information source has been identified. We will show how different information filtering systems we developed employ numerous Internet information sources in an attempt to exploit this knowledge base by automatically wrapping the source to safeguard the evolvability of the same system once new sources become available on the WWW. We examine and compare the performance these systems achieved when employing wrapper-conducted queries in contrast to tailored hand-coded ones; comparative results are presented","","POD:0-7695-0789-1","10.1109/IDEAS.2000.880632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880632","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Data mining;IP networks;Information retrieval;Internet;Metasearch;Search engines;World Wide Web;Wrapping","data mining;information resources;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","WWW information sources;data mining;information retrieval;knowledge discovery;knowledge resources;machine learning;source specific queries;wrapper conduction;wrappers","","0","1","59","","","2000","18 Sep 2000-20 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes some of the requisite speech and language technologies that would be required and introduces an effort aimed at integrating these technologies into a system, called Rough 'n' Ready, which indexes speech data, creates a structural summarization, and provides tools for browsing the stored data. The technologies highlighted in the paper include speaker-independent continuous speech recognition, speaker segmentation and identification, name spotting, topic classification, story segmentation, and information retrieval. The system automatically segments the continuous audio input stream by speaker, clusters audio segments from the same speaker, identifies speakers known to the system, and transcribes the spoken words. It also segments the input stream into stories, based on their topic content, and locates the names of persons, places, and organizations.

The GCMD is a repository that contains Earth Science data collected by various agencies worldwide. The GCMD does not house the actual data, it contains descriptions of the data including the location of the actual data set. The GCMD also provides search services to locate these data descriptor files. For data to be included in the GCMD database, it must be submitted to the GCMD in the Directory Interchange Format (DIF). This DIF submission is currently done by data collectors manually submitting the DIF to the GCMD, but this manual system cannot keep pace with the amount of data being collected. Our proposed solution to keep pace with data being collected is to design and develop a data access system for the GCMD to automate the DIF creation process. Our data access system will be capable of autonomously searching Web sites for Earth Science data sets, extracting the metadata from these data sets, and creating a DIF for the file. The paper describes our prototype system that uses a URL pool to direct its search for Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) files. The HDF file is a self-describing format and contains metadata describing the contents of the files. This metadata is extracted and mapped to the DIF format.

The initial WAG prototype dealt exclusively with “standard” Web pages, which typically are HTML or XML documents and present non- or semi-structured information, and they vary widely in their means of presenting information to the user. We present the extension of the WAG system to deal with form pages.

Shapes are partitioned into tokens in correspondence with their protrusions, and each token is modeled according to a set of perceptually salient attributes. Shape indexing is obtained by arranging shape tokens into a suitably modified M-tree index structure. Two distinct distance functions model respectively, token and shape perceptual similarity. Examples from a prototype system and computational experiences are reported for both retrieval accuracy and indexing efficiency.

The use of an intelligent agent-based collaborative information retrieval tool known as Casmir has been explored as a means to address this complex area. A commercial domain (automotive manufacturer) has been used to illustrate its likely potential. Specifically, the aim of the illustration has been to develop a methodology for the articulation and dissemination of context based situated knowledge and the use of Casmir to push knowledge into the user domain. In order to evaluate the tool 50 naive users were set a specific, collaborative information retrieval task. The results of the user evaluation are presented. Phase one of the evaluation focused on serendipitous information discovery and showed a clear increase in precision of information retrieved over time. Phase two of the evaluation required a qualitative evaluation of the software from the users. The results of the phase two evaluation indicated that the collaborative information retrieval functionality of the tool was regarded as beneficial, especially in supporting group working in an informal manner.

Scientists and artists have worked for a long time on how to preserve and restore the murals' colors, but have not found satisfactory methods. Discovering how to use advanced computer techniques to preserve, restore, and reuse Dunhuang fresco art information is a very interesting and complex task. In our project, we integrate many techniques, such as image processing, information retrieval, knowledge representation, and intelligent reasoning, to deal with these problems. Restoration of the frescoes is the basic focus of our project. Because of human activity, most of the frescoes fade day-by-day, with some seriously damaged. We propose a new, intelligent approach to color restoration. Each restored fresco will be preserved in the fresco database along with the original. For many of the Dunhuang frescoes, the key to preservation is to find an effective method for organizing, storing, managing, and retrieving the fresco data. We adopt content- and semantics-based image retrieval methods to solve these problems.

This provides accurate query formulation and improves the accuracy in the search results. By co-jointly matching image features in a multidimensional space rather than in separate independent feature spaces, the precision in image retrieval is improved from more than 50% to up to 90% for the top 10 most similar images retrieved. The impact of the information of the image's background has been mentioned in a very few published papers.
