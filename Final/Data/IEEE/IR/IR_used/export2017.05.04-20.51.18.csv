In the second part, we explore an image representation in terms of keywords which reflect the semantic content of an image. Our approach is inspired by the desire to augment low-level image representation with massive amounts of world knowledge, to facilitate computer vision tasks like image retrieval based on this information. We represent an image as a weighted mixture of a predetermined set of concrete concepts whose definition has been agreed upon by a wide variety of audience. To achieve this objective, we use concepts defined by Wikipedia articles, e.g., sky, building, or automobile.

Existing works mainly focus on scenarios in which each storage node stores a linear combination of a subset of K data packets generated by different source nodes. By solving the linear equations, a collector can recover all the K data packets with high probability. This paper explores the problem of flexible and efficient data dissemination and retrieval in wireless sensor networks. Our scheme exploits the broadcast nature of wireless transmission and improves the traditional random walk algorithm for efficient data dissemination. Furthermore, through the use of Fountain codes in data encoding, it enables a mobile collector to recover up-to-date data generated by any subset of source nodes. Specifically, by querying any t(1 + ε) storage nodes at the t-th time slot, the target data can be retrieved without having to decode all the source packets. Simulation results validate our analysis and show that the proposed schemes are flexible and efficient.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-4244-6404-3; POD:978-1-4244-6402-9","10.1109/ICC.2010.5501767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5501767","","Broadcasting;Costs;Equations;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Maximum likelihood decoding;Peer to peer computing;Reed-Solomon codes;Robustness;Wireless sensor networks","codes;mobile radio;wireless sensor networks","Fountain codes;data dissemination;data encoding;data retrieval;data storage;distributed storage coding;linear equation;mobile collector;random walk algorithm;wireless sensor networks;wireless transmission","","2","","14","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also resilient to noise. An example of automatic image semantic annotation using this description method is reported using a database with 738 images. The K Nearest Neighbor is used as classifier and the Manhattan distance is used for image similarity computation.

The individual's biometric image are put on a contact-less card equipped with an RFID tag and for each identity authentication, the data on the card are compared with the online biometric image. If the individual's identity is authenticated, then there will be no need for him/her to punch in the personal information since his/her information will be retrieved from the database through their electronic personal code (EPLC). This article has made use of the HMAX model which works hierarchically based on human's and some animals' visual system for extracting the features of images. Template matching has been done on the features of image taking a threshold of 0.9. To test the mentioned model, FVC2008 standard dataset containing 800 fingerprint images (8 images for 100 people) was employed. The experiments indicate that not only does the above-mentioned model show invariance to picture rotation and its scale but it also proves to be 98 percent responsive on the given dataset. The experimented pictures were also fed into the PCA model.

Naive Bayesian classifier is used to guide the crawlers by rating the web page before it is downloaded. For this analysis topics to be crawled are represented using a set of relevant documents. The features used by Bayesian Classifier in construction of the model are collected from the document corpus using Document Frequency and Information Gain feature selection methods. Performance of both the crawlers is evaluated when 500 features are selected using Document Frequency and Information Gain feature selection methods.

In this paper, we propose a novel spatial matching method, in which the transformation hypothesis can be estimated from only a single correspondence without the assumption of the viewpoints from which the images are taken. Firstly, affine covariant neighborhoods(ACNs) of features are used to eliminate possible false matches. Secondly, we decompose the affine transformation into three sub-transforms and conquer each sub-transform by exploiting the shape information and the ACNs of a single pair of corresponding features. Experiment results demonstrate that this method improves the average retrieval precision evidently with less computation in comparison with the previous methods.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4244-4296-6; POD:978-1-4244-4295-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5495402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5495402","affine transformations;object-based image retrieval;spatial matching;visual words","Computational efficiency;Computers;Educational technology;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Least squares approximation;Robustness;Shape","affine transforms;image matching;image retrieval;object recognition","affine covariant neighborhood;affine transformation hypotheses;robust spatial matching method;visual words based object retrieval","","1","","15","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Similarity between models is measured with a L1-norm in the probability density histogram where the distances of feature descriptors are normalized.

More specifically, the novelty with respect to the system lies in its ability to find relevant content on the web, and its ability to personalize and adapt this content based on the system's observation of its learners and the accumulated ratings given by the learners. Hence, although learners do not have direct interaction with the open Web, the system can retrieve relevant information related to them and their situated learning characteristics.

In this paper, to improve the discriminative power and reduce the ambiguity of visual word, we propose a novel bispace quantization strategy. Local features are quantized to visual words first in descriptor space and then in orientation space. Moreover, geometric consistency constraints are embedded into the relevance formulation.

This problem is nonconvex and has no analytical solution. Through a careful analysis and reformulation, we show that the secrecy-rate maximization problem has a convex equivalent in form of a semidefinite program (SDP). We also prove that the respective optimal transmit covariance generally can yield a rank-one structure, implying that transmit beamforming is secrecy-rate optimal in the considered scenario.

There are substantial shortcomings of this approach, specifically spotting performance is hampered when patterns or sensor noise level changes. In this work an unsupervised sensitivity adaptation mechanism is proposed for activity event spotting based on expected activity event rates. The expected event rate for activity spotting was derived from the generalisation metric used in information retrieval. To illustrate generalisation effects and depict relations of spotting performance and event rate, different event rates were simulated and their precision-recall spotting performance analysed. Subsequently, the sensitivity adaptation concept is presented and evaluated. For this purpose two large datasets from personal healthcare applications were considered to explore benefits and limitations of this adaptation approach: recognition of drinking motions from inertial sensors and chewing strokes from sound. Results showed up to 28% spotting performance increase for event rate adapted operation, confirming performance benefits for sensitivity adaptation. The approach will be most applicable in situations, where estimated event rate statistics show low variance and long monitoring durations allow effective sensitivity adaptations.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7088-4; POD:978-1-4244-7087-7","10.1109/SUTC.2010.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5504685","activtiy spotting;adaptive recognition;pattern event detection;unsupervised recogntition","Acoustic sensors;Adaptive signal processing;Computer networks;Feedback;Information retrieval;Noise level;Pervasive computing;Sensor systems;Wearable computers;Wearable sensors","","","","1","","25","","","7-9 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, before conducting an effective system analysis and extracting data for program comprehension, it is necessary to select the relevant messages, and to expose only the meaningful information.

WUSNs have the potential to impact a wide variety of novel applications including intelligent irrigation, environment monitoring, border patrol, and assisted navigation. Although its deployment is mainly based on underground sensor nodes, a WUSN still requires aboveground devices for data retrieval, management, and relay functionalities. Therefore, the characterization of the bi-directional communication between a buried node and an aboveground device is essential for the realization of WUSNs. In this work, empirical evaluations of underground-to- aboveground (UG2AG) and aboveground-to-underground (AG2UG) communication are presented. More specifically, testbed experiments have been conducted with commodity sensor motes in a real-life agricultural field. The results highlight the asymmetry between UG2AG and AG2UG communication with distinct behaviors for different burial depths. To combat the adverse effects of the change in wavelength in soil, an ultra wideband antenna scheme is deployed, which increases the communication range by more than 350% compared to the original antennas. The results also reveal that a 21% increase in the soil moisture decreases the communication range by more than 70%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical study that highlights the effects of the antenna design, burial depth, and soil moisture on both UG2AG and AG2UG communication performance. These results have a significant impact on the development of multi-hop networking protocols for WUSNs.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-4244-6404-3; POD:978-1-4244-6402-9","10.1109/ICC.2010.5502315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502315","","Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Irrigation;Monitoring;Navigation;Relays;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Soil moisture;Ultra wideband antennas;Wireless sensor networks","underground communication;wireless sensor networks","aboveground devices;aboveground-to-underground communication;underground electromagnetic propagation;underground-to-aboveground communication;wideband antenna scheme;wireless underground sensor networks","","26","1","18","","","23-27 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But, does having more diverse data in the repository always produce better results? In this paper, we report on an empirical study to examine the effect of increasing data diversity to improve feature location through search. In particular, we looked at the effect of including: i) change sets from revision control system, ii) tickets from issue trackers, and iii) elements from a Static Dependency Graph (SDG). We searched for three features of Jajuk, an open source Java jukebox, and two features of jEdit, an open source Java text editor. We used four different corpuses built with a combination of the above data. We used Eclipse's code search and an index built with source code as baseline conditions. We found that it is not always better to have more diverse data. Adding SDG data to change sets increased recall, but drove down precision. Adding data from issue trackers had little effect and in one case lowered recall.

A network of cortical areas was found to be differently activated during retrieval of labile and stabilized memory, including the left superior parietal lobule and precuneus for labile memory and the left inferior parietal lobule and postcentral gyrus for labile and stabilized memory. These results show that state-specific cortical networks are systematically activated during memory retrieval.

This often constitutes an extremely challenging task due to the large amounts of data that must be compared in real-time. This paper proposes a framework to detect, and represent changes through a compact model.

The Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG) value of each face is then calculated and stored for later utilization. To retrieve models in the testing database, we first forecast each face's DCG value by searching its most similar face's DCG value in training database, and then the top k faces with highest forecasted DCGs are selected as query input. A greedy algorithm is finally applied to get the total similarity.

In this task the timbral information has been widely used, however many musical moods are characterized not only by timbral information but also by musical scale and temporal features such as rhythm patterns and bass-line patterns.

In word recognition, one fifth of the words were recognized in clean singing, the performance being lower on polyphonic music. We study the use of the recognition results in a query-by-singing application. Using the recognized words, we retrieve the songs by searching for the text in a text lyrics database.

Due to the noisy and sparse nature in the human generated tags, how to understand and utilize these tags for image retrieval tasks has become an emerging research direction. As the low-level visual features can provide fruitful information, they are employed to improve the image retrieval results. However, it is challenging to bridge the semantic gap between image contents and tags. To attack this critical problem, we propose a unified framework in this paper which stems from a two-level data fusions between the image contents and tags: 1) A unified graph is built to fuse the visual feature-based image similarity graph with the image-tag bipartite graph; 2) A novel random walk model is then proposed, which utilizes a fusion parameter to balance the influences between the image contents and tags. Furthermore, the presented framework not only can naturally incorporate the pseudo relevance feedback process, but also it can be directly applied to applications such as content-based image retrieval, text-based image retrieval, and image annotation.

In the proposed scenario, an agent is able to sense the distance between itself and its neighbors and the direction in which it sees its neighbors with respect to its local reference frame.

In this paper, we propose a novel support vector and K-Means based hybrid algorithm for data clustering. Firstly, we identify the outliers and overlapping data points through the support vector approach. Secondly, we remove the outliers and overlapping data points and then run the K-Means on the rest data points to obtain clustered data set. Finally, we build support vector description for each cluster, and then assign the removed data points to the cluster with the smallest distance, thus resulting in labeling the whole data set. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effective, which exploits the advantages of both support vector clustering and K-Means.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5704-5; POD:978-1-4244-5701-4","10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5512345","Data Clustering;K-Means clustering;Support Vector Clustering","Automation;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Image processing;Information retrieval;Labeling;Pattern recognition;Shape;Static VAr compensators;Sun","pattern clustering;support vector machines","K-means based hybrid clustering algorithm;data clustering;support vector based hybrid clustering algorithm","","0","","12","","","20-23 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Controller design for tracking induced miss-rates in cache memories","N. Almoosa; Y. Wardi; S. Yalamanchili","School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, USA","IEEE ICCA 2010","20100726","2010","","","1355","1359","Cache systems are on-chip memory elements used to store data that are frequently referenced by programs. The advantage of storing data in cache, as compared to RAM, is that it has faster retrieval times, but it has the disadvantage of on-chip energy consumption. A cache-decay interval is the amount of time a cache element holds unreferenced data before being turned off (cleared). The choice of a cache-decay interval comprises a balance between low energy consumption and low induced miss rates. In certain applications this balance is determined off line by computing the cache-decay interval that would yield a given level of induced miss rates. However, the lack of precise models, coupled with program-dependent behavior of the cache system, result in possibly-drastic fluctuations in the induced miss rates for a given decay interval. This paper presents a control system designed to track a given reference of induced miss rates by recomputing (in real time) the decay interval. Simulation studies indicate that the plant can be approximated adequately by a power function. The controller's design is carried out in the log domain, where the system is linear but subjected to an unknown output disturbance. We propose an integral controller and perform its stability analysis. Simulation studies on Simplescalar, a microprocessor simulator, testify to the efficacy of our proposed approach and appear to yield tighter bounds than those derived to-date by other means.","1948-3449;19483449","Electronic:978-1-4244-5196-8; POD:978-1-4244-5195-1","10.1109/ICCA.2010.5524405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5524405","","Cache memory;Control systems;Energy consumption;Fluctuations;Information retrieval;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Real time systems;Stability analysis;System-on-a-chip","cache storage;control system synthesis;energy consumption","RAM;cache decay interval;cache memory;controller design;data storage;faster retrieval times;integral controller;microprocessor simulator;on chip energy consumption;on chip memory element;possibly drastic fluctuation;stability analysis;tracking induced miss rates","","0","","11","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Central to the approach is the use of a lossy version of the Lempel-Ziv incremental parsing (LZIP) algorithm, which constructs a dictionary by incrementally parsing music feature vectors. LZIP is adopted as a source characterization technique owing to it's universal-coding nature, and asymptotic convergence to the entropy of the source. The dictionary is composed of variable-length parsed representations, which are used to construct a highly sparse co-occurrence matrix, which counts the occurrence of the parsed representations in each music. As a feature analysis framework, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is then applied to the co-occurrence matrix to generate a lower-dimensional approximation that exposes the most salient features of the represented audio documents. The aforementioned approach, in addition to adopting reduced sampling rates and quantized feature vectors, yields a system with reduced requirements in terms of processing and storage, and increases the tolerance to noisy queries. We demonstrate the performance of the system in the music genre classification problem, and analyze its robustness to perturbed queries. Moreover, we demonstrate that using the incremental parsing algorithm in forming the audio dictionary has superior retrieval performance compared to techniques yielding a dictionary with fixed-length entries such as vector quantization.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4244-4296-6; POD:978-1-4244-4295-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2010.5496245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496245","Lempel-Ziv;Music retrieval;feature extraction;incremental parsing;vector quantization","Content based retrieval;Convergence;Dictionaries;Entropy;Feature extraction;Indexing;Music information retrieval;Noise reduction;Sampling methods;Sparse matrices","computational linguistics;content-based retrieval;dictionaries;feature extraction;music;sparse matrices;vector quantisation","Lempel-Ziv incremental parsing algorithm;asymptotic convergence;audio dictionary;audio document;content based retrieval;feature extraction;latent semantic analysis;linguistic processing approach;music feature vector;music indexing;source characterization technique;sparse cooccurrence matrix;universal coding nature;variable length parsed representation;vector quantization","","0","","9","","","14-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it may also worsen the information retrieval problems, for more information resources means higher needs for proper management in order to find needed information in the right format at right time. We assume that user's PIM behavior with PCs will have impact on how they will perform PIM in other environments. There is a need to reassess the existing PIM tools and testing formerly claimed theories of PIM behavior in the context of today's digital information environment. This paper reports on the findings of a survey conducted with 118 computer users to investigate their information organization and retrieval strategy and the factors that affect their choices of adopting different strategies.

Hence, the presented system supports users by offering an intuitive preference formulation which is known from daily life: the spontaneous quality judgement between objects without deeper knowledge of underlying attributes. This facilitates the interaction with the presented system as no new cognitive burdens are introduced into the search process. Based on these preferences, a machine-learning algorithm concludes an appropriate query via inductive reasoning in order to retrieve more relevant documents in an iterative manner.

Our experimental study based on a domain centered corpus shows that a consistent performance improvement can be achieved when concept-centered phrases are included in addition to the single term based features in document representations.

Based on this, a probabilistic approach is used for retrieving songs with similar rhythmic patterns. These are then mixed rhythm-synchronously with transitions maintaining continuity and regularity of beats. We apply the presented methods into workout-mix generation, which aims at automatically selecting rhythmically similar music given a seed song and a user-defined tempo profile.

In TCM, only certain sequences of successive constellation points are allowed (mapping by set partitioning). The novel idea in this paper is to apply the TCM concept to the antenna constellation points of spatial modulation (SM). The aim is to enhance SM performance in correlated channel conditions. SM considers the multiple transmit antennas as additional constellation points and maps a first part of a block of information bits to the transmit antenna indices. Therefore, spatial multiplexing gains are retained and spectral efficiency is boosted. The second part of the block of information bits is mapped to a complex symbol using conventional digital modulation schemes. At any particular time instant, only one antenna is active. The receiver estimates the transmitted symbol and the active antenna index and uses the two estimates to retrieve the original block of data bits. In this paper, TCM partitions the entire set of transmit antennas into sub-sets such that the spacing between antennas within a particular sub-set is maximized. The scheme is called trellis coded spatial modulation (TCSM). Tight analytical performance bounds over correlated fading channels are proposed in this paper. In addition, the performance and complexity of TCSM is compared to the performance of SM, coded V-BLAST (vertical Bell Labs layered space-time) applying near optimum sphere decoder algorithm, and Alamouti scheme combined with TCM. Also, the performance of all schemes with turbo coded modulation is presented. It is shown that under the same spectral efficiency, TCSM exhibits significant performance enhancements in the presence of realistic channel conditions such as Rician fading and spatial correlation (SC). In addition, the complexity of the proposed scheme is shown to be 80% less than the V-BLAST complexity.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2010.07.091526","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508985","Alamouti scheme;MIMO;Rician fading;Spatial modulation;V-BLAST;space-time coding;spatial correlation;sphere decoder;trellis coded modulation","Antenna accessories;Bandwidth;Digital modulation;Fading;Information retrieval;Modulation coding;Performance analysis;Receiving antennas;Samarium;Transmitting antennas","","","","86","","50","","","July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
