Two descriptions of coded data are formed from these sub-signals and transmitted over different channels.

"Delta-K interferometric SAR technique for snow water equivalent (SWE) retrieval","G. Engen; T. Guneriussen; Y. Overrein","NORUT Inf. Technol. Ltd., Oslo, Norway","IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","20040504","2004","1","2","57","61","This letter describes the concept of using delta-K technique on interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data for deriving the snow water equivalent (SWE) of dry snow-covered ground by utilizing the presence of scatterers in both datasets. The main scattering contribution from a dry snow cover is from the snow-ground interface. Thus, the interferometric phase of two SAR images, one with no snow and one with dry snow cover, contains information on the SWE. By performing a delta-K processing of the two SAR scenes followed by averaging, an estimation of the SWE can be achieved. The first step in the delta-K InSAR processing is to split the band into two nonoverlapping subfrequency band images. The resulting two subband images then contain two new carrier frequencies with a small delta frequency or delta-K separation. The next step is to multiply the two subband images together to obtain the delta-K image, one for summer and one for winter. Finally, the delta-K interferometric SAR image is generated by multiplying the two delta-K images from summer and winter together. In this letter, experimental results using European Remote sensing Satellite 1 (ERS-1) data from a summer and winter situation show that the delta-K phase can be estimated to a few degrees accuracy for an area of 10×10 km<sup>2</sup> corresponding to an SWE accuracy of approximately 100 mm.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2003.822880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291381","","Floods;Frequency;Hydroelectric power generation;Information retrieval;Radar scattering;Remote sensing;Satellites;Snow;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Water resources","geophysical signal processing;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;snow;synthetic aperture radar","European Remote sensing Satellite 1 data;SAR images;carrier frequencies;delta-K interferometric SAR image;delta-K interferometric SAR processing;delta-K separation;dry snow-covered ground;interferometric synthetic aperture radar data;nonoverlapping subfrequency band images;scattering contribution;snow water equivalent retrieval;snow-ground interface","","9","","11","","","April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such systems often extract a set of features, such as color, texture and shape, from the raw image data and store them as content descriptors. Users on the network search and exchange information with each other using feature data that contains sufficient information for image classification/retrieval. A query is formed at the client by extracting the features from the sample image, having them compressed and transmitted to the remote server. The corresponding image is classified through comparing the query feature vector with all the entries in the database and finding the most similar ones. We pose this problem as a statistical classification problem and consider the design of a transform coding scheme minimizing the detrimental effect of compression. Different from traditional transform coding which was designed to provide the best reconstruction from compressed data, here the goal is to preserve the separation between the feature vectors generated by different classes. Linear discriminant analysis is used due to the property that discrimination information is preserved in lowest dimensional space in transform domain, so that efficient scalar quantization and entropy coding can be applied to the transform coefficients. We propose a greedy algorithm to perform bit allocation in transform domain such that classification information from all dimensions can be employed in quantizer design. We show that our proposed transform coding scheme achieves much better classification performance than traditional KLT transform coding, based on both real data (Brodatz textures) and synthesized random source.","","POD:0-7803-8104-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292260","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Image classification;Image coding;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Network servers;Shape;Transform coding","Internet;algorithm theory;content-based retrieval;distributed processing;entropy codes;feature extraction;image classification;image coding;image reconstruction;image retrieval;multimedia communication;transform coding","distributed image classification systems;entropy coding;exchange information;feature compression;greedy algorithm;image retrieval;linear discriminant analysis;network search;remote server;scalar quantization;statistical classification problem;synthesized random source;transform coding scheme","","0","","16","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But it is not suitable for VLSI implementations because it contains search-the-best-metric operation as a throughput bottleneck and suffers from unstructured data manipulation.

The most similar results determine a final ranking. While this approach is suitable for smaller sized images, which are adequately described by one set of features, it falls short for large scenes, e.g. satellite images. In this case several set of features have to be extracted at different positions within the image. A study showed that the selection of appropriate locations is not straightforward and that more suitable techniques result in a significantly increased computational burden. Therefore this paper proposes the utilisation of feature functions that approximate the expected feature value at any arbitrary image position. To incorporate not just a local context but also a globally dependent description for each location, radial basis functions were used.

To perform such queries, a search engine maintains an inverted file, which lists for each keyword the documents containing it. The size of such a file is comparable with that of the document collection, which is a considerable storage overhead. We show how the inverted file can be compressed by ordering the documents in the collection in a specific way. Finding the near-optimal order can be recast as a Hamming-distance traveling salesman problem.","","POD:0-7803-7902-0","10.1109/NLPKE.2003.1275907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275907","","Computer science;Frequency;Influenza;Information retrieval;Internet;Maintenance engineering;Natural languages;Pressing;Search engines;Traveling salesman problems","Boolean algebra;data compression;document handling;information retrieval;search engines;travelling salesman problems","Boolean inverted file compression;Boolean query;Boolean search;Hamming-distance traveling salesman problem;document ordering;information retrieval;near-optimal order;search engine","","0","2","5","","","26-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the approach, video shots are grouped into clusters of similar scenes based on shot color attributes. First, the similarity between video shots is measured by shot color histogram intersection. To obtain scene likeness matrix in a maximum-a-posterior (MAP) probability manner, a thresholding method is proposed on shot similarity matrix. Then, a graph is constructed based on the scene likeness that similar shots have an edge between them. Based on the constructed graph, a graph partitioning method is proposed to cluster video shots into different scenes such that the connectivity of video shots within one cluster is higher than that between different clusters. The advantage of the graph partitioning method is that the cluster number need not to be known as a prior. The graph partitioning method is compared with conventional k-means clustering method; in which the cluster number is determined by the cluster validity measure. The main contributions of the paper lie in the formulation of video scene clustering to a graph partitioning problem, and the comparison with the conventional k-means clustering method. Experimental results are presented to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed graph theoretic approach.","","POD:0-7803-8185-8","10.1109/ICICS.2003.1292773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292773","","Clustering methods;Histograms;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Merging;Prototypes;Video recording","graph theory;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern clustering;video signal processing","cluster number;cluster validity measure;graph partitioning method;graph partitioning problem;graph theoretic approach;k-means clustering method;maximum-a-posterior probability;shot color attributes;shot color histogram intersection;shot similarity matrix;video scene clustering","","2","","15","","","15-18 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering that P2P technologies are the key to an ubiquitous communication world in which various network entities dynamically form e-communities by cooperating with each other, the model contains essential P2P-handling functions as an application program interface and conceals complicated behavior. Achieved by the development of collaborative applications, its effectiveness is shown by comparisons with off-the-shelf P2P products from the viewpoints of communication performance and software development productivity.

It is also to allow for dynamic connectivity to accessible data sources provided that the connection protocol is either already available with it or it can be uploaded dynamically. XMed receives requests from the client, analyzes, and forwards them to their corresponding destinations. Results are wrapped in XML and sent back to their corresponding client. It manages the users' accounts, authorization and security to facilitate the connection to the desired data source remotely.

The clustering works on terms extracted from the documents in a certain category and organizes them in a tree-like hierarchical structure - a thesaurus. The thesaurus is then employed for automatic query expansion in an e-commerce application in order to obtain better results for product searching.

Some of previous blind watermark schemes either suffer significantly from host data interference or require expensive cost of storage. In this paper, we attempt to resolve the question. Here, we present three general schemes for blind watermark. The first two based on lattice principle and property of periodic function, respectively. The host data interference is eliminated by only a little of cost of storage in the third scheme.

Traditionally, the similarity between two images has been calculated as a weighted distance between two feature vectors. This approach, however, may not be mathematically and computationally appropriate, and does not provide enough flexibility in modeling user queries. The paper proposes a framework that generalizes a wide set of previous approaches to similarity calculation, including the weighted distance approach. Image similarities are obtained through a decision making process based on low-level feature distances using fuzzy theory.

The feasibility of the new EICA method has been successfully tested for content-based face image retrieval using 1,107 frontal face images from the FERET database. The images are acquired from 369 subjects under variable illumination, facial expression, and time (duplicated images).

We provide an alternative approach that decomposes audio observations of music into semantically significant dimensions where each resultant dimension corresponds to the perceived meaning of the audio, and only the most significant meanings (those which are most effective in describing music audio) are kept.

Since efficiency and speed are important factors in interactive visual content retrieval, most of the current approaches impose restrictive assumptions on similarity calculation and learning algorithms. Specifically, content-based image retrieval techniques generally assume that perceptually similar images are situated close to each other within a connected region of a given space of visual features. This paper proposes a novel method for interactive image retrieval using query feedback. Query feedback learns the user query as well as the correspondence between high-level user concepts and their low-level machine representation by performing retrievals according to multiple queries supplied by the user during the course of a retrieval session. The results presented in this paper demonstrate that this algorithm provides accurate retrieval results with acceptable interaction speed compared to existing methods.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.826759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294956","","Bandwidth;Content based retrieval;Data compression;Disaster management;Feedback;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia systems","content-based retrieval;convergence;fuzzy set theory;image processing;image retrieval;indexing;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia systems;relevance feedback","MPEG-7 visual descriptors;content-based image retrieval techniques;convergence;feature combination;fuzzy aggregation operators;interactive image retrieval;multimedia indexing;multimedia retrieval;multiple queries;online interactive learning;query feedback;relevance feedback;visual content","","24","1","35","","","May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On board, is the Ocean Color Monitor (OCM) instrument, which has identical spectral bands to the SeaWiFS instrument but with a spatial resolution of 236/spl times/360 meters. OCM has been acquiring data since late 1999 but has largely been ignored in the scientific community. This neglect is possibly due to a lack of advertising and announcements to the scientific community, its launch immediately following the launch of the long awaited SeaWiFS instrument, the lack of algorithm development for the platform, or that the data is provided at cost to the user. Whatever the case, scientific quality data and products are now available and should certainly be addressed by those doing ocean color research, especially in coastal waters. The similarities between OCM and SeaWiFS have allowed scientists at SeaSpace Corporation and Rutgers University's Coastal Ocean Observation Lab to use the NASA SeaWiFS algorithms to produce scientific quality data. The high resolution allows retrievals close to beaches, and in wetlands, where other instruments drop data. OCM uses a linear array of CCD detectors, not a rotating mirror, which allows for identical ground resolutions at nadir and at the swath edge, and may ultimately increase the lifetime of the instrument due to minimal wear and power consumption. Comparisons of OCM to in situ data sets, other color sensors, and improvements in retrievals will all be presented here.","","POD:0-933957-30-0","10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1282622","","Advertising;Costs;IEEE news;Information retrieval;Instruments;Monitoring;Oceans;Satellites;Sea measurements;Spatial resolution","CCD image sensors;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing","AD 1999;CCD detector array;Coastal Ocean Observation Lab;IRS-P4 satellite;Indian Space Research Organization;NASA SeaWiFS algorithm;OCM;Ocean Color Monitor;Rutgers University;SeaWiFS instrument;beach retrieval;beach wetland;coastal water;color sensor;ground resolution;instrument drop data;minimal wear lifetime;ocean color research;platform algorithm;polar orbiting Oceansat;power consumption;rotating mirror;scientific community;scientific quality data;spatial resolution;swath edge","","0","","","","","22-26 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many efforts have been made for text detection in videos. However, there is still a lack of performance evaluation protocols for video text detection. In this paper, we propose an objective and comprehensive performance evaluation protocol for video text detection algorithms. The protocol includes a positive set and a negative set of indices at the textbox level, which evaluate the detection quality in terms of both location accuracy and fragmentation of the detected textboxes. In the protocol, we assign a detection difficulty (DD) level to each ground truth textbox. The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore tolerant to different ground-truth difficulties to a certain degree. We also assign a detectability index (DI) value to each ground-truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground-truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance. The automatic performance evaluation scheme has been applied to performance evaluation of a text detection approach to determine the best thresholds that can yield the best detection results. The protocol has also been employed to compare the performances of several text detection systems. Hence, we believe that the proposed protocol can be used to compare the performance of different video/image text detection algorithms/systems and can even help improve, select, and design new text detection methods.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2004.825538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281823","","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Detection algorithms;Helium;Image analysis;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Protocols","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;indexing;protocols;text analysis;video signal processing","automatic performance evaluation protocol;detectability index;detection difficulty level;video indexing;video retrieval;video text detection algorithm","","54","1","21","","","April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a MPEG-7 based multimedia content description tool which annotates multimedia data with twelve main attributes regarding its semantic representation. The twelve attributes include answers of who, what, when, where, why and how (5W1H) the digital content was produced as well as the respective direction, distance and duration (3D) information. We define digital multimedia contents including image, video and music embedded with the proposed semantic attributes as dozen dimensional digital content (DDDC).

In this paper we introduce a system for interactive image retrieval that combines different approaches to feature based queries. Furthermore, it allows multimodal interaction because apart from conventional input devices like mouse and keyboard, it is possible to operate the system using a touch screen or even natural language.

Proceedings. 2003","20040322","2003","","","825","826","The sinica BOW (academia sinica bilingual ontological WordNet) is intended as a linguistic infrastructure for knowledge representation and knowledge engineering. It is built upon the relation-based structure of WordNet. On one hand, a bilingual WordNet is constructed with the crucial design feature of treating bilingual translation correspondences as lexical semantic relations. On the other hand, SUMO (suggested upper merged ontology) is adopted as the shared system of conceptual categorization. SUMO is also one of the first conceptual categorization systems to be mapped to an English lexicon. By the combination of ontology and WordNet, we hope that sinica BOW will 1) give each linguistic form a rigorous conceptual location, 2) clarify the relation between conceptual classification and linguistic instantiation, and 3) facilitate genuine cross-lingual access of knowledge. In addition to the integration of WordNet and ontology, it is also an important goal of sinica BOW to integrate lexical resources such that the linguistic-to-conceptual representation and language -to- language gaps can be bridged simultaneously. Taking lexicon as a bridging knowledgebase and ontology as the overall knowledge structure seems to be a logical choice. Integrating the two resources with multilingual capacity will add to the versatility and open new possibilities.","","POD:0-7803-7902-0","10.1109/NLPKE.2003.1276018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1276018","","Concrete;Databases;Encoding;Information processing;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Knowledge engineering;Natural languages;Ontologies;Psychology","computational linguistics;knowledge representation;natural languages;word processing","English lexicon;academia sinica bilingual ontological WordNet;conceptual categorization;cross-lingual access;knowledge engineering;knowledge representation;knowledge structure;lexical semantics;linguistic infrastructure;linguistic instantiation;multilingual capacity;suggested upper merged ontology","","0","","3","","","26-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

No.03CH37492)","20040413","2003","2","","1045 Vol.2","","The use of QuikSCAT data for wind retrievals of tropical cyclones is described. The evidence of QuikSCAT sigma-0 dependence on wind direction for >30 m/s wind speeds is presented. The QuikSCAT sigma-0s show a peak-to-peak wind direction modulation of /spl sim/1 dB at 35 m/s wind speed, and the amplitude of modulation decreases with wind speed. The decreasing directional sensitivity to wind speed agrees well with the trend of QSCAT1 model function at near 20 m/s. A correction of the QSCAT1 model function for above 23 m/s wind speed is proposed. We explored two microwave radiative transfer models to correct the attenuation and scattering effects of rain for wind retrievals. One is derived from the collocated QuikSCAT and SSM/I data set, and the other one is a published parametric model developed for rain radars. These two radiative transfer models account for the effects of volume scattering, scattering from rain-roughened surfaces and rain attenuation. The models suggest that the sigma-0s of wind-roughened sea surfaces for 40-50 m/s winds are comparable to the contributions of rain for up to about 10-15 mm/h. Both radiative transfer models have been used to retrieve the ocean wind vectors from the collocated QuikSCAT and SSM/I rain rate data for several tropical cyclones. The resulting wind speed estimates of these tropical cyclones show improved agreement with the wind fields derived from the best track analysis and Holland's model for up to about 15 mm/h SSM/I rain rate. A comparative analysis of maximum wind speed estimates suggests that other rain parameters likely have to be considered for further improvements.","","POD:0-933957-30-0","10.1109/OCEANS.2003.178483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283443","","Amplitude modulation;Attenuation;Information retrieval;Oceans;Parametric statistics;Radar scattering;Rain;Sea surface;Tropical cyclones;Wind speed","meteorological radar;rain;storms;wind","Holland model;QSCAT1 model function;QuikSCAT wind retrieval;SSM/I data set;directional sensitivity;microwave radiative transfer model;ocean wind vectors;parametric model;peak-to-peak wind direction modulation;rain attenuation;rain parameter;rain radar;rain scattering effect;rain-roughened surfaces;track analysis;tropical cyclone;volume scattering;wind speed;wind-roughened sea surface","","0","","","","","22-26 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection of chorus sections is essential for the computational modeling of music understanding and is useful in various applications, such as automatic chorus-preview functions in music browsers or retrieval systems. Most previous methods detected as a chorus a repeated section of a given length and had difficulty in identifying both ends of a chorus section and in dealing with modulations (key changes). By analyzing relationships between various repeated sections, our method, called RefraiD, can detect all the chorus sections in a song and estimate both ends of each section. It can also detect modulated chorus sections by introducing a similarity that enables modulated repetition to be judged correctly. Experimental results with a popular-music database show that this method detects the correct chorus sections in 80 of 100 songs.","","POD:0-7803-7850-4","10.1109/ASPAA.2003.1285812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285812","","Audio recording;Computational modeling;Databases;Music information retrieval","audio signal processing;music;parameter estimation;pattern recognition;signal detection","automatic chorus-preview functions;chorus-section detection;compact-disc recordings;computational modeling;key changes;modulated chorus sections;modulated repetition;music browsers;music retrieval systems;music understanding;musical audio signals;popular music;refrain","","0","","","","","19-22 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To support mobility, multicast caching has been introduced as a method for allowing roaming clients to request packets that they have been unable to receive during the change from one access network to another. The basic idea has been to introduce a multicast cache, which stores the multicast streams as individual, uniquely defined, packets. The mobile clients may upon entering an access network request the packets that they lack from the multicast cache. The main problem with the current approach is that a multicast cache that does not contain the requested packets merely returns an error message to the mobile client. To solve this problem, we extend the model to allow multicast caches to forward client requests according to some dynamically configurable policy. If another multicast cache contains the data, it is sent it to the client, which then can continue processing the multicast stream as it normally would.","","POD:0-7803-8114-9","10.1109/APCC.2003.1274293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1274293","","Computer science;Cryptography;Electrostatic precipitators;IP networks;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Propagation losses;Protection;Roaming","Internet;cache storage;mobile radio;multicast communication;packet radio networks;radio access networks","Internet;access network;hierarchical multicast caching;mobility","","0","","5","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since sense tagging for ambiguous words is expensive and labor intensive, it is worth looking for some reasonable substitutes. We suggest a kind of substitute for Chinese sense tagged data, which is called pseudo training data. The suggestion is based on a linguistic phenomenon in Chinese, which some multicharacter-words inherit only one sense and some syntactical features from ambiguous one-character-words. Data derived from unambiguous multicharacter-words are employed as pseudo training data. Pseudo training data have an advantage of being able to be collected automatically. Our experiments show that classifiers trained by not too much pseudo training data outperform classifiers trained by small quantities of sense tagged samples for Chinese ambiguous word senses. Further experiments show combination of a small set of tagged data and a large quantities pseudo training data is a more promising way to word sense disambiguation.","","POD:0-7803-7902-0","10.1109/NLPKE.2003.1275884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1275884","","Humans;Information retrieval;Information science;Natural language processing;Tagging;Training data","linguistics;natural languages;word processing","Chinese word sense disambiguation;linguistic phenomenon;pseudo training data;sense tagged samples;training classifiers","","2","","10","","","26-29 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of the 2003 Joint","20040504","2003","3","","1586","1590 vol.3","Several query-by-humming techniques have been proposed for content-based music retrieval. Reliable pitch extraction is critical for such music retrieval systems to work well. Previous pitch detection methods are based on music note with silence or hum with specific syllables; otherwise the segmentation errors can seriously deteriorate pitch detection. This paper presents a pitch tracking using a region growing approach, which does not rely on note segmentation. A novel harmonic analysis technique is proposed to efficiently group the partials of a harmonic in the power spectrum. The pitch tracking method operates by initially finding the frames with reliable pitch and subsequently finalizing the pitch detection by growing the pitch region. Experimental results show that the proposed method has high robustness and accuracy for continuous pitch contour extraction.","","POD:0-7803-8185-8","10.1109/ICICS.2003.1292734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292734","","Content based retrieval;Design methodology;Frequency;Harmonic analysis;Human voice;Labeling;Music information retrieval;Power system harmonics;Robustness","acoustic signal processing;content-based retrieval;frequency estimation;harmonic analysis;music","content-based music retrieval;harmonic analysis technique;pitch contour extraction;pitch extraction;pitch tracking method;power spectrum;query-by-humming techniques;region growing approach;reliability","","1","","5","","","15-18 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A practical way to index an image database is to use low-level image features such as textures or colors which can be attracted by machines automatically. This paper presents a new method of image indexing and retrieval based on Gabor wavelet and Legendre moments called (GWLM). It is well known that Gabor wavelet decomposition achieves the theoretical lower bound of the uncertainty principle. They attain maximum joint space-frequency resolution which is highly significant in the process of texture extraction in which the conflicting objectives of accuracy in texture representation and texture spatial localization are both important. To improve the efficiency of retrieval rate we also utilized the Legendre moments which significantly improved the retrieval rate up to about 25%. The feature vector consists, of 48 parameters from Gabor wavelets plus 10 Legendre moments. The length of feature vector is relatively small compared to other methods such as WBIIS which uses 768 features. This has a significant impact on the speed of retrieval process. Experimental results carried out on two databases of natural and medical images. The proposed method clearly outperforms some image indexing methods such as WBIIS and DHSE. The presented method works independent of image color or brightness, therefore it is able to retrieve similar images with different colors or brightness.","1094-687X;1094687X","POD:0-7803-7789-3","10.1109/IEMBS.2003.1279806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1279806","","Biomedical imaging;Brightness;Feature extraction;Frequency;Gabor filters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Spatial databases","database indexing;feature extraction;image retrieval;image texture;medical image processing;visual databases","Gabor wavelet decomposition;Gabor wavelet moments;Legendre moments;feature vector consists;image databases;image indexing;image retrieval;joint space-frequency resolution;low-level image features;texture extraction;texture representation;texture spatial localization;uncertainty principle","","1","","7","","","17-21 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is applicable for clear atmospheres without any aerosol in a spectral range between approximately 800 and 2500 nm. Standard gas by gas methods yield a 6% rms error in H<sub>2</sub>O retrieval from Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data, reaching several tens percent for a set of widespread ground materials and resulting from an simplifying assumption of linear variations of the reflectance model within gas absorption bands and partial accounting of the gas induced signal. JRGE offers a theoretical framework consisting in a two steps algorithm that accounts for sensor characteristics, assumptions on gas concentrations and reflectance variations. It estimates variations in gas concentrations relatively to a standard atmosphere model. An adaptive cubic smoothing spline like estimation of the reflectance is first performed. Concentrations of several gaseous species are then simultaneously retrieved using a nonlinear procedure based on radiative transfer calculations. Applied to AVIRIS spectra simulated from reflectance databases and sensor characteristics, JRGE reduces the errors in H<sub>2</sub>O retrieval to 2.87%. For an AVIRIS image acquired over the Quinault prescribed fire, far field CO<sub>2</sub> estimate (348 ppm, about 6% to 7% rms) is in agreement with in situ measurement (345-350 ppm) and aerosols yield an underestimation of total atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> content equal to 5.35% about 2 km downwind the fire. JRGE smoothes and interpolates the reflectance for gas estimation but also provides nonsmoothed reflectance spectra.

It is based on the reordering of the coefficient subbands into s structure similar to the structure of the multiresolution wavelet subbands. A self-adaptive procedure for generating weights to be associated with different subbands is proposed. A method for assigning suitable weights for new query image is also introduced.

A novel MPEG-7 motion activity descriptor is discussed that is a combination of temporal and spatial descriptors. These descriptors represent both temporal motion intensity as well as spatial distribution of motion activity. It is assumed that the apriori information about the shot boundaries is available. The temporal descriptors are obtained by classifying the shots into five different intensity levels based on fuzzy membership functions. A high value of intensity indicates high activity and a low value of intensity indicates low activity. The spatial descriptors are obtained using motion vectors. The individual frames are characterized into spatial regions depending on the change in motion activity between successive frames. The main motivation behind this approach is to pick those frames as key frames that have maximum centralized spatial activity and high motion intensity. The motion intensity and spatial distribution are then fed to a neural network that decides the key frames based on maximum temporal activity and centralized spatial distribution. Results illustrate that the proposed approach is computationally less intensive once the network is trained and works much better than selecting the first frame and middle frame of the shot as key frame for a wide range of video sequences.","","POD:0-7803-8104-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292250","","Application software;Computer networks;Content based retrieval;Content management;Drives;Information retrieval;Internet;MPEG 7 Standard;Neural networks;Video sequences","feature extraction;neural nets","MPEG-7 motion descriptors;apriori information;content-based system applications;fuzzy membership functions;key frame extraction;neural network;shot boundaries;spatial distribution;temporal motion intensity;temporal-spatial descriptors;video sequences","","6","","12","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our method begins with the computation of a robust estimate of the spectral envelope called the composite transfer function (CTF). The CTF is derived from the instantaneous amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal partials which make up the vocal signal. Unlike traditional source-filter theory , the CTF does not explicitly separate the spectral characteristics of the vocal source and the vocal tract filter. The principal components of the CTFs are used as features for a quadratic classifier to identify singers. The approach is validated on a database containing samples from twelve classically trained singers. In cross validation experiments, test set accuracies of approximately 95% are found for a baseline case. The classifier's performance is not degraded when different vowels are included in classifier training and evaluation. Restricting the frequency range of the CTFs and using a test set containing samples extracted from solo performances of Italian arias reduces the test set accuracy to 70-80%.","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/TSA.2003.822637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284338","","Amplitude estimation;Filtering theory;Filters;Frequency estimation;Instruments;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Testing;Timbre;Transfer functions","audio signal processing;signal sampling;speaker recognition;spectral analysis;transfer functions","Italian arias;classifier evaluation;classifier training;composite transfer function;quadratic classifier;singer identification;singing voice identification;source filter theory;spectral characteristics;spectral envelope estimation;spectrum based system;vocal signal;vocal source;vocal tract filter","","18","","40","","","March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our experimental results are first evaluated on 3 instrument categories, i.e. vocal music, instrumental music, and their combinations. Furthermore each category is split into two individual cases to give a 6-class problem. Our results show that good performance could be obtained with simple features, such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and cepstral coefficients derived from linear prediction signal analysis. Even with a limited amount of training data, we could give an accuracy of 90.60% in the case of three categories.

We describe how the new algorithm will be used for the texture component of a novel CBIR service called DIRECT, which is designed to provide image based searches in distributed digital libraries without the need for manual entry of annotations and image metadata.","","POD:0-7803-8104-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2003.1292251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1292251","","Content based retrieval;Digital modulation;Gabor filters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Power engineering and energy;Power engineering computing;Software libraries;Tiles","amplitude modulation;content-based retrieval;digital libraries;filtering theory;frequency modulation;image retrieval;image texture","DIRECT;Gabor filter magnitude responses;computed AM-FM image models;content-based image retrieval;distributed digital libraries;modulation domain;texture retrieval algorithm","","6","","17","","","9-12 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we present several novel exponentiation algorithms, namely, a protected square-and-multiply algorithm, its right-to-left counterpart, and several protected sliding-window algorithms. We also illustrate our methodology applied to point multiplication on elliptic curves. All these algorithms share the common feature that the complexity is globally unchanged compared to the corresponding unprotected implementations.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2004.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1288550","65;Cryptographic algorithms;atomicity;elliptic curves.;exponentiation;protected implementations;side-channel analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Concrete;Elliptic curve cryptography;Elliptic curves;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Protection;Security;Timing","computational complexity;cryptography","computational complexity;cryptographic algorithm;elliptic curve;exponentiation algorithm;protected sliding-window algorithm;protected square-and-multiply algorithm;side-channel analysis;side-channel atomicity","","74","19","17","","","June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The goals of the approach are (i) to support a user in a step-by-step searching for a product and (ii) to ensure the product he has found is the best solution for his need. The product database is based on a light-weighted ontology and structured in the form of a lattice that enables hierarchicals clustering of users' requests. It means that a user can navigate from a very general product-attribute cluster, which satisfies user's buying need and contains a lot of products, to the very specific clusters that seem to contain a few, but for the user highly relevant, products. In each navigation step, the user is provided with the minimal set of navigation alternatives. In order to enhance the processing of the lattice, the partial ordering of the products-attributes clusters is computed using methods from formal concept analysis.","","POD:0-7695-2073-1","10.1109/EEE.2004.1287339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287339","","Airplanes;Airports;Costs;Databases;Information retrieval;Lattices;Navigation;Ontologies;Portals;Topology","electronic commerce;formal verification;query processing","formal concept analysis;light-weighted ontology;on-line product catalog;product database;products-attribute cluster;step-by-step searching","","1","1","18","","","28-31 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, work on content-based retrieval for remote sensing images (RSI) is seldom reported in literature. In this paper, a new strategy for content-based remote sensing images retrieval based on shape similarities measures has been proposed, which includes the shape description of each object and spatial relational representation between objects based on the two-level attributed relational graph (ARG). We have also showed that Zernike moments are very effective in describing shape features of each region, and the two-level ARG is efficient for spatial relational information of each disjoint region of an object in RSI. As one of the applications, we have applied this method in our network-oriented multiple satellites images management and online distribution system, and the cloud objects of NOAA AVHRR images are used for verifications. An actual case for the descriptions of a cloud object with Zernike moments, the representations of relations with a two-level ARG and the shape similarity measure results in the database is given.","","POD:0-7803-7925-X","10.1109/RISSP.2003.1285780","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285780","","Clouds;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Pixel;Remote sensing;Satellites;Shape measurement;Vegetation mapping","Zernike polynomials;content-based retrieval;graph theory;image retrieval;remote sensing;visual databases","Zernike moments;attributed relational graph;content based image retrieval;image database area;network oriented multiple satellites image management system;online distribution system;remote sensing images;shape similarity measures;spatial relational information;spatial relational representation","","0","","14","","","8-13 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
