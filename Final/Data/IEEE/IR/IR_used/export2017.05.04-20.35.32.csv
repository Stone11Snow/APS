"Semantic labeling - unveiling the main components of meaning of free-text","Y. Zieman; R. Salas","Unveil Technologies, Inc.","Proceedings Eighth Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval","20050627","2001","","","228","235","An experimentally proven methodology for computing semantic labels for natural language and its use in semantic processing of text is described. A combinatorial model of the conceptual space is created where semantic labels result as combinations ofprimary or atomic concepts called Semantic Factors. The set of about 2,500 Semantic Factors is defined. The basic semantic element of a language is a morpheme-type element (s-morpheme), the minimalpart ofa language that bears its own meaning. All s-morphemes in the Knowledge Base (about 15,000 for English) are labeled. The label for a phrase (its ??Concept Codel7 results as a combination of the labels for the smorphemes constituting it. Algorithms are designed to identify the s-morphemes in a phrase and to generate the phrase??s Concept Code. The matching procedure compares Concept Codes and identifies conceptually close ones - those sharing a maximal number of Semantic Factors. Similarity is identified here as a match between the Concept Codes of two Text objects. Since a Concept Code is essentially language independent, this technology is appropriate for implementation in cross-language applications. An example is described of an application in the bio-medical domain, where documents of a database of more than 12 million titles are being successfully retrieved in about 50% of the queries normally rejected by traditional search methods.","","POD:0-7695-1192-9","10.1109/SPIRE.2001.989766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989766","","Algorithm design and analysis;Appropriate technology;Databases;History;Information retrieval;Labeling;Natural languages;Search methods;Space technology;Thesauri","","","","0","1","8","","","13-15 Nov. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of the big advantages that the semantic Web promises, there are still several problems to solve. Those concerning ontologies include their availability, development, and evolution. In the area of information retrieval, the dimension of document vectors plays an important role. Firstly, with higher index dimensions the indexing structures suffer from the ""curse of dimensionality"" and their efficiency rapidly decreases. Secondly, we may not use exact words when looking for a document, thus we miss some relevant documents. LSI is a numerical method, which discovers latent semantics in documents by creating concepts from existing terms. In this paper we present a basic method of mapping LSI concepts on given ontology (Word-Net), used both for retrieval recall improvement and dimension reduction. We offer experimental results for this method on a subset of TREC collection, consisting of Los Angeles Times articles","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553017","","Computer science;Costs;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Multidimensional systems;Ontologies;Q measurement;Semantic Web;Software engineering","information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Web retrieval;WordNet ontology;dimension reduction;document vectors;indexing structures;information retrieval;latent semantics;retrieval recall improvement;semantic Web content","","11","","12","","","8-9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reported in this paper is the result of the initial study, which aim to investigate the emotional design preferences of the perceived images or objects of children's clothing and investigate how these personal preferences work to the desirable products. It is part of our future objective to develop intelligent web based system that account for emotional acquisition on the clothing design attributes. It is believed the emotional desire elicited by the consumer can influence what constitute quality design and the decision to purchase a product. The main objective of this exploratory study is to investigate associations between consumer's subjective emotional responses towards children's clothing so that similar dimension could be summarized. The outcome will result to more objective emotional dimension analyzed by Correlation Coefficient Analysis, in which 40 dimension of emotions are identified. The research concludes that this dimension of emotion could be used in describing the design of children's wear which evoke the children's sensibility and psychological feelings of pleasurable and desirable.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466940","Correlation Coefficient Analysis (CCA);Emotional Intelligence;Kansei Engineering (KE);Product Emotion;children's clothing","Clothing;Design engineering;Intelligent manufacturing systems;Intelligent sensors;Intelligent systems;Peer to peer computing;Product design;Psychology;Shape;Standardization","behavioural sciences computing;clothing;customer satisfaction;production engineering computing","Kansei engineering methodology;Kansei semantic space;consumer subjective emotional response;correlation coefficient analysis;emotional acquisition;emotional design preference;female children clothing;intelligent Web based system;urban wear context","","1","","21","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Importantly, images are arranged so that visually similar images are located close to each other on the sphere. Organisation on a grid layout prevents image overlap and hence contributes to a clear presentation.

Given the huge number of heterogeneous Deep Web data sources, the end users may not know the sources that can satisfy their information needs. Selecting and ranking sources in relevance to the user requirements is challenging. Our system finds appropriate sources for such users by allowing them to input just an imprecise initial query. As a key insight, we observe that the semantics and relationships between deep Web sources are self-revealing through their query interfaces, and in essence, through the co-occurrences between attributes. Based on this insight, we design a co-occurrence based attribute graph for capturing the relevances of attributes, and using them in ranking of sources in the order of relevance to users requirement.

In this paper, we propose a new method for mining user access patterns that allows the prediction of multiple non-consecutive Web pages, i.e., any pages within the Web site. Our approach consists of two major steps. First, the shortest path algorithm in graph theory is applied to find the distances between Web pages. In order to capture user access behavior on the Web, the distances are derived from user access sequences, as opposed to static structural hyperlinks. We refer to these distances as minimum reaching distance (MRD) information. The association rule mining (ARM) technique is then applied to form a set of predictive rules which are further refined and pruned by using the MRD information. The proposed approach is applied as a collaborative filtering technique to recommend Web pages within a Web site. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves performance over the existing Markov model approach in terms of precision and recall, and also has a better potential of reducing the user access time on the Web","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553005","Association Rule Mining;Collaborative Filtering;Web Data Extraction;Web Log/Navigation Path Analysis.","Association rules;Collaboration;Data mining;Distributed computing;Information filtering;Information filters;Predictive models;Research and development;Web pages;Web server","Markov processes;Web sites;data mining;graph theory;information filtering","Markov model;Web data extraction;Web log analysis;Web navigation path analysis;Web page recommendation;Web page request prediction;Web site;association rule mining;collaborative filtering;graph theory;minimum reaching distance information;shortest path algorithm;static structural hyperlinks;user access patterns;user access sequences","","11","","15","","","8-9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The similarity distance between the responses is used in producing the patterns. Hence, it is a critical success factor in presenting the visual of the multiple response clustering patterns. When the pattern is represented in 3-D space, the height of each object (the given coordinate) represents the summation of distance ratio between one coordinate to all other coordinates, in which, the ratio is the distance between two coordinates with relative to the maximum distance of two points in the data set.

In a non-gestural approach, handwritten musical notation is entered naturally via a pen tablet as we would do using pen and paper. A sequence of observed ink patterns representing musical symbols is captured and used to construct different HMM models. The proposed approach exploits both global and local information derived from ink patterns which we have demonstrated the exploitation of this information via different features employed in different HMMs. The specificity and sensitivity measures of these different classification models are compared using unseen test sets. The experiment shows that using non-gestural method is a very good approach to obtain handwritten music notation input, as it is most natural and does not require user training. It is also shown that HMM is very suitable to be used as the classifier in this domain, showing very high recognition rates. Additionally, the experimental results also concluded that models from HMMs with more hidden states also outperform the HMM with a lesser number of hidden states since a larger model has more capacity. The results also suggest that HMMs offer flexibility in encoding useful knowledge in the models.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466906","hidden markov model;non-gestural approach;pen-based music editing;recognizing handwritten music notation;representing and reasoning about music","Computer interfaces;Encoding;Handwriting recognition;Hidden Markov models;Human computer interaction;Image recognition;Information technology;Ink;Testing;Writing","handwritten character recognition;hidden Markov models","handwritten music notation recognition;hidden Markov model;musical symbols;nongestural approach;pen tablet","","4","","22","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fifty selected images are used as sample queries and they are retrieved based on fusion of geometric shape descriptors. Similarities of these images are measured using Euclidean distance and performances of the retrievals are evaluated using both quantitative and qualitative tests.

In this paper, we present two main features of our algorithm in data extraction. We develop a tree matching algorithm to check the similarity of data records. This simplifies the complicated process of a full tree matching algorithm. We also use the size of bounding box to further improve the similarity check of data records.

In this paper, we advocate that we have yet to be concerned about the reliability and performance levels that the Web services composition will exhibit upon execution, which is still an ongoing research problem finding notable interest. Focusing on this issue, we propose to estimate the reliability and performance of Web services compositions. We concentrate on one important aspect that has received little attention so far: the consideration of the failures repercussions on the overall composition execution performance. Specifically, our targets are twofold. Firstly, we propose to enrich WS-SAGAS with a new set of advanced aggregation patterns so that it fits with the inherent business processes complexity and thereby it allows to specify, as Web services compositions, any business process no matter how it turns out to. Secondly, we propose to estimate the reliability and performance of each of these patterns, and this, in both, correct and faulty situations. Our enriched WS-SAGAS model ameliorates considerably the chances to acquire more plausible estimations of the reliability and performance because of its failure awareness. Moreover, analyzing these estimations helps to investigate the reasons that may lay behind these failures and indeed to contribute noticeably to acquire more reliable compositions execution with high performance level","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1552996","","Aggregates;Computer science;Delay;Failure analysis;Layout;Logic;Performance analysis;Protocols;Quality of service;Web services","Internet","WS-SAGAS;Web services compositions paradigm;advanced aggregation patterns;autonomous applications integration;business processes complexity;failures repercussions;heterogeneous applications integration","","2","","26","","","8-9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The lack of understanding of tacit knowledge impedes the efforts of managing it as a source of competitive advantage. The research employs the grounded theory approach and data are gathered through semi-structured interviews incorporating the critical incidences technique. It is discovered that tacit knowledge of Malaysian academicians is knowledge internalized in their work practices, which is externalized through action strategies in fulfilling the seven performance indicators introduced by the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education. Three dimensions of tacit knowledge are discovered, namely the intellectual-affirmation tacit knowledge, self tacit knowledge and social tacit knowledge. Theoretical contributions from this study include a paradigm model of knowledge internalization and a theoretical model of tacit knowledge dimensions in Malaysian academia. Practically, the research highlights the tacit knowledge content of successful academicians which is imperative to improve the performance of an academician and the institution.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466892","Grounded Theory;Knowledge Management;Tacit Knowledge;Tacit Knowledge Dimensions","Computer science;Curriculum development;Decision making;Educational institutions;Impedance;Information management;Knowledge management;Management information systems;Product development;Turing machines","educational institutions;further education;knowledge management","Malaysian Ministry of Higher education;Malaysian academia;academicians;action strategies;critical incidences technique;grounded theory;higher learning;institution assets;intellectual-affirmation tacit knowledge;knowledge internalization;performance indicators;self tacit knowledge;semistructured interviews;social tacit knowledge;tacit knowledge dimensions;work practices","","1","","27","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, we give a simple and precise characterization of the extent, to which latent semantic indexing (LSI) can deal with polysems, and when it fails to do so. Third, we demonstrate that the recombination of the intricate, yet relatively cheap mechanism of PLSI for mapping queries to attributes, with a simplistic, easy-to-compute set of document rankings gives a retrieval performance which is at least as good as that of the most sophisticated concept-based retrieval schemes and which does not require any precomputation","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553019","","Conferences;Frequency;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Ontologies;Vectors;Web search;Web sites","content-based retrieval;information retrieval","concept-based retrieval;document rankings;latent semantic indexing;probabilistic sibling PLSI;query mapping;query-independent rankings;rank aggregation;ranked retrieval","","2","1","21","","","8-9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme enables us to store, retrieve and update XML documents efficiently. When storing XML documents in relational databases, XML tree structures must be preserved explicitly. To this end, a label is assigned to nodes in the XML tree. In general, document retrieval and update performance is affected by node labeling schemes. We use SPIDER (Schema based Path IDentifiER), a labeling scheme for XML documents utilizing DTDs that makes retrieval and update more efficient. SPIDER only identifies paths from root node to a node. Thus, multiple nodes appearing in the same path cannot be distinguished by only using SPIDER. We introduced Sibling Dewey Order to identify such nodes. Generally, when a new node is inserted into XML documents, some other nodes need to be relabeled to preserve the order of nodes. In our method, only Sibling Dewey Order is relabeled; SPIDER is not affected. Since the range of relabeling is small, it is possible to update documents efficiently. We stored documents utilizing SPIDER in a relational database and then translated various XPath expressions into SQL using SPIDER.

The unstructured data such as multimedia files, documents, spreadsheets, news, emails, memorandums, reports and web pages are difficult to capture and store in the common database storage. The underlying reason is due to the tools and techniques that proved to be so successful in transforming structured data into business intelligence and actionable information, simply do not work when it comes to unstructured data. As a result, new approaches are necessary. Attempts have been undertaken by several researchers to deal with unstructured data, but, so far it is hard to find a tool that can store and retrieve the extracted and classified unstructured data into a structured database system. This paper is to present our research on unstructured data identification, extraction and classification of web pages, which is then transformed into structured format in Extensible Markup Language (XML) document, and later stored into a multimedia database. The contribution of this research is in the approach of capturing the unstructured data and the efficiency of a multimedia database to handle this kind of data.

Therefore, it is important that computer games for children are well-designed and usable for the children. In order to evaluate the usability of the computer game, children must be observed while exploring and playing the game and given the chance to express their opinions. Therefore, to involve children effectively, appropriate evaluation techniques are needed. This paper will discuss an observation method that has been adopted in a usability testing with the children. In this study, a computer game called Jelajah is chosen as the game to be tested for the usability evaluation with children. Jelajah is suitable for the experiment because it is an adventure game which is a very common game genre for children. Five preschool children aged between five and six years old are selected for this study. During the usability testing session, facilitator observes the child and fill in the observation checklist form in order to track the effectiveness and efficiency of the game. After the test session completed, the child is required to answer a simple interview-based questionnaire to know their level of satisfaction after playing the game. Data collected are both qualitative and quantitative. The collected data are analyzed to determine the levels of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The levels of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction are being measured by averaging them to a single metric that can represent the usability of Jelajah.

The quality and the quantity of this information influence the accuracy of the terminology extractor. In this paper, we assume that logical structure of documents constitute a rich source of contextual information which can be used to infer semantic relations between terms and thus construct a termino-ontological resource. We propose a top-down indexing method which attributes greatest importance to terms that appear in the head nodes of the document. Terms are weighted according to their position in the hierarchical structure of the document. Once documents are indexed, logical relationships between their fragments are mined to build a contextual network of terms. Links of this network help deduce semantic relations useful for terminology organization. A so extracted knowledge can be exploited as a mapping scheme in a domain-specific information retrieval (IR) system. We experiment our approach by taking the example of an Arabic corpus talking about animals.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466894","Document indexing;Domain-specific IR;Logical structure;Terminology extraction","Animal structures;Computer science;Data mining;Indexing;Information management;Information retrieval;Intelligent structures;Navigation;Ontologies;Terminology","indexing;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition","Arabic corpus;contextual information;information retrieval system;knowledge extraction;mapping scheme;semistructured document indexing;termino ontological resource;terminology extraction;top down indexing method","","1","","21","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also referred to as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), a discipline under Social Science and Behavioral Science that deals with human factors. How well human can interact with the computers determines how well users are able to communicate and perform their desired tasks. In a collaborative environment, many activities are running concurrently among people who are communicating from different physical locations. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good user interface that supports the information exchange and at the same time being user friendly and easy to use. In this paper, a comparative study was conducted on user interface of several bridge game applications, which one of those game applications was developed under JACIE (Java-based Authoring language for Collaborative Interactive Environment) Graphic User Interface (GUI) output. JACIE is a scripting language, designed to support rapid prototyping and implementation of distributed interactive collaborative applications. While focusing on various accessibility features and HCI rules, we compare different elements of each feature in an attempt to improve the usability of JACIE's interface.

In this context, we propose an ontological technique using existing lexical database for English (WordNet) for the extraction of data records. We find that wrappers designed based on ontological technique are able to reduce the number of potential data regions to be extracted, thus they are able to improve the data extraction accuracy. We then use visual cue from the browser rendering engine to locate and extract the relevant data region from the web page by measuring the size of text and image of data records.

Currently, there are 7,995 vocabularies of utterances in the database collection and for the purpose of this study; the vocabulary is limited to ten words which are most frequently spoken selected from ten speakers. Endpoint detection, which aims to distinguish the speech and non-speech segments of digital speech signal, is considered as one of the key preprocessing steps in speech recognition system. Proper estimation of the start and end of the speech (versus silence or background noise) avoids the waste of speech recognition evaluations on preceding or ensuing silence. In this study, the endpoint detection and speech segmentation task is achieved by using the short-time energy (STE) and short-time zero crossing (STZC) measures and combination of both approaches. As a result, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) recognizer derived the recognition accuracy rate of 91.4% for combination of both algorithms, if compared only 86.3% for STE and 82.1% for STZC rate alone. The experiments show that there are many problems arise where there are still misdetection of word boundaries for the words with weak fricative and nasal sounds. Other obstacles issues such as speaking styles or mood of speaking can also cause the recognition performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466898","endpoint detection;infinite impulse response;mel frequency cepstral coefficient;short-time energy;short-time zero crossing","Background noise;Databases;Detection algorithms;Energy measurement;Hidden Markov models;Mood;Speech analysis;Speech enhancement;Speech recognition;Vocabulary","hidden Markov models;natural language processing;speech processing;speech recognition;word processing","Malay Parliamentary speech;digital speech signal;endpoint detection;hidden Markov model;isolated word;short time energy;short time zero crossing;speech recognition system;speech segmentation;vocabulary","","4","","14","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The preliminary study found that tasks during the pre-online information searching contribute towards the development of search terms. Three categories related to search terms development during pre-online information searching emerged during the analysis namely conceptualising, expressing and selecting. The scope of study focused on the pre-online information searching stage and further investigation on how search terms were formulated should be extended throughout the information searching process. The results of this study provide design implication as to how to develop personalised search interfaces where users could be assisted since the beginning of the information searching process which saw significant development of search terms. This study provides grounds into the ways in which users formulate initial search terms. It is hoped that the study could establish the importance of search terms selection during the pre-online information searching based on the Malaysian perspective.

Despite extensive research on knowledge transfer issues, there is a dearth of research that has explicitly focused on the role of transactive memory in enabling intra-organizational knowledge transfer in information technology (IT) outsourcing context, particularly e-government IT outsourcing. Although the information systems literature has recently acknowledged the role of transactive memory plays in improving knowledge processes, most of the research is still in the basic concept of transactive memory which is emphasized more on the individual communication concept rather than integrating those concept with the existing organization memory system. Moreover, it is still at a conceptual level rather than practical action for a firm to address. Therefore, this paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the factors that have been cited as significant influences on the ability to transfer knowledge from the vendor to the client organizations in the context of e-government IT outsourcing, and examine the role of transactive memory system towards effective knowledge transfer process between organizations. Drawing on several theoretical streams, this paper will propose an integrated conceptual framework of inter-organizational knowledge transfer which further can be used for research enhancement.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466896","Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO);Knowledge Management;Knowledge Transfer;Organizational Learning;Transactive Memory System (TMS)","Deductive databases;Electronic government;Information science;Information technology;Knowledge management;Knowledge transfer;Learning;Memory management;Outsourcing;Technology management","government data processing;knowledge management;outsourcing;transaction processing","IT outsourcing;Malaysia e-government;information systems;information technology;inter-organizational knowledge transfer;knowledge transfer process;transactive memory system","","1","","54","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce a novel XML structural representation called common XPath (CXP), which encodes the frequently occurring elements with the hierarchical information, and propose to take the CXPs mined to form the feature vectors for XML document clustering. In other words, data mining acts as a feature extractor in the clustering process. Based on this idea, we devise a path-based XML document clustering algorithm called PBClustering which groups the documents according to their CXPs, i.e. their frequent structures.

The objective of the paper is to provide an analysis of Addaall's stemmer performance for Arabic information. Furthermore, it sheds some lights on the effectiveness of Addaall in relation to other stemmers. The paper assumes that previous studies did not examine extensively the requirements and limitations of Addaall and its prospects for Arabic IR effectiveness. So far there is no standard stemmer for Arabic IR that can be used and generalized. Therefore, this research will examine and evaluate the retrieval performance of Addaall stemmer using root and light stemming searches. It will use Al-Jazeera news as a test document.

This task is becoming harder due to large amount of video archives including broadcast news, documentary videos, movies and particularly internet which let users to search and share videos all over the world. Retrieving videos is challenging since queries can be on object, motion, texture, color, audio, etc. Indexing the video content supporting spatial relations will give more accurate results. For this purpose, segmentation and localization should be done. In this work, we propose to find new concept without availability of annotation and then retrieve videos according to queries defined by users and support spatial relations. To do mentioned purposes, we developed context model supporting spatial relations for better retrieval results. Our main contribution for better video retrieval is extracting spatial information in addition to using semantic word similarity for finding new concept without availability of annotations.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466951","Content-based Analysis;Semantic knowledge;Spatial Information;Video retrieval","Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Context modeling;Data mining;Information retrieval;Internet;Layout;Motion pictures;Multimedia communication;Video sharing","content-based retrieval;image segmentation;video retrieval;visual databases","context model support;semantic video retrieval;spatial relations;video localization;video segmentation","","0","","35","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various kinds of research have been conducted on similarity retrievals of 3D models since the late 1990's. Although most of the retrieval techniques focus on shape similarity of the 3D models, our technique allows users to retrieve and classify 3D models based on texture pattern similarity. To test our texture similarity retrieval technique, a set of a textured 3D model database was synthesized from 3D polygonal models and 2D texture images. The database was analyzed by software programs, and texture features were extracted from each 3D model. The extracted texture features were computed based on HLAC (higher order local autocorrelation) and fractal dimensions. Often, both kinds of texture features were used for analyzing 2D texture images. However, we extended the techniques to handle three dimensional volumetric data for extracting features from textured 3D models. Our experimental web-based retrieval system successfully retrieved textured 3D models with fairly acceptable recall-precision rates. This retrieval technique which is based on texture patterns can be used in conjunction with traditional shape similarity retrieval techniques, and the technique can enhance similarity retrieval performances.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466933","3D Model;Multimedia database;Shape feature;Similarity Retrieval;Solid texture","Data analysis;Data mining;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases;Testing","image retrieval;image texture;visual databases","2D texture images;3D polygonal models;HLAC;Web based retrieval system;higher order local autocorrelation;similarity retrieval technique;texture similarity retrieval technique;textured 3D model;textured 3D model database;three dimensional volumetric data","","2","","18","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ultimate goal is to show that the immune based algorithms may be adapted as new alternatives for solving class timetabling problems. The algorithms have been implemented on benchmark datasets. Experimental results have shown that all algorithms are good optimization algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on fitness values, relative robustness, and CPU times. Tests of hypotheses have significantly shown that the immune network is more effective than the other two algorithms. All algorithms can handle the hard and soft constraints very well. The values of relative robustness have shown that the timetables produced by clonal selection are more robust compared to the other two algorithms. The recorded CPU times have revealed that the immune network has acquired the longest time on all datasets. A comparison with published results has shown that all algorithms are as good as other solution methods.

In first stage algorithm follows standard flooding by the limited number of hops, but in the next stage it will choose nosy nodes in each region. These nodes maintain the data index of all clients' nodes. This proposed algorithm extends the search quality by reducing redundant messages in each hop.

Record linkage is not only crucial in integrating multi-source databases that have been generated independently, but is also considered to be one of the key issues in integrating heterogeneous Web resources. However, when targeting large-scale data, the cost of enumerating all the possible linkages often becomes impracticably high. Based on this background, this paper proposes a fast and efficient method for linkage detection. The features of the proposed approach are: first, it exploits a suffix array structure that enables linkage detection using variable length n-grams. Second, it dynamically generates blocks of possibly associated records using blocking keys extracted from already known reliable linkages. The results from our preliminary experiments where the proposed method was applied to the integration of four bibliographic databases, which scale up to more than 10 million records, are also reported in the paper.","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1552993","","Computer vision;Costs;Couplings;Databases;Explosives;Humans;Informatics;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Web sites","","","","10","2","30","","","08-09 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The language is familiar and crucial to all Muslims world wide and Muslims are highly recommended to understand the language of the holy Quran to ease them when reciting the Quran. The Minister of Education has started introducing Arabic language to Muslim's primary school children since 2005 under the JQAF program. However, the implementation of most of the foreign language classes are not really successful as those subjects were taught with little or no regards with the current field-tested paradigm of foreign language acquisition. Many teachers are using almost outdated paradigms of learning for their students. This situation is unproductive for a fast growing learner who wants to acquire knowledge. Therefore, this project is conducted to assist the Malaysian Muslim children to understand the Arabic language better as it is part of the JQAF syllabus. This courseware is specially developed to accompany the primary school Arabic language text book and its scope is to ensure that students know how to manipulate the Arabic words according to its gender. Prior to the development stage of this project, a study towards a suitable instructional design strategies of teaching and learning Arabic language grammar especially in differentiating the masculine and feminine words is conducted. As a result, the storytelling approach has been adapted. Storytelling helps stimulates the children's cognitive skills in recognizing and remembering the words according to its gender. The multimedia elements such as graphic, animation, and audio are fully utilized in this application to create an interesting way of learning and thus gain the students attention. An alpha testing towards the STAr courseware has been conducted to five respondents who are the Year one students.

Presently, segmentation poses one of the most challenging problems in medical imaging. Segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is an important part of brain imaging research. In this study, we used controlled experimental data as our testing data. The data is designed which that prior knowledge of the size of the abnormalities are known. This is done by cutting various shapes and sizes of various abnormalities and pasting it onto normal brain tissues, where the tissues and the background are divided into different categories. The segmentation is done with twenty data of each category. The knowledge of the size of the abnormalities by number of pixels are then used as the ground truth to compare with the PSO segmentation results. The proposed PSO technique is found to produce potential solutions to the current difficulties in detecting abnormalities in human brain tissue area as it produced promising segmentation outcomes for light abnormalities. Nevertheless, the PSO produced poor performance in dark abnormalities segmentation as it produces low correlation values in all conditions.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466910","Computer vision;MRI;Medical imaging;Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO);Swarm Intelligence","Biomedical imaging;Brain;Computer vision;Diseases;Humans;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Particle swarm optimization;Testing","biomedical MRI;image segmentation;medical image processing;particle swarm optimisation","MRI image segmentation;brain abnormalities;brain segmentation;magnetic resonance imaging;medical imaging;particle swarm optimization","","1","","8","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have studied methods for discovering maximally frequent tree structured patterns in semistructured Web documents. A tag tree pattern is an edge labeled tree with ordered children and structured variables. An edge label of a tag tree pattern is a tag or a keyword in Web documents, or a wildcard for any string. Each variable, which matches any subtree, represents a field of a Web document. A tag tree pattern is much more powerful than a usual tree structured pattern. In order to represent tree structured patterns with rich structural features, we introduce a new kind of variables, called height-constrained variables. An (i, j)-height-constrained variable matches any subtree such that the trunk length of the subtree is at least i and the height of the subtree is at most j. We propose a method for generating all maximally frequent tag tree patterns with height-constrained variables and no variable-chain","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553002","","Character generation;Conferences;Data mining;Data models;HTML;Informatics;Information retrieval;Internet;Technical Activities Guide -TAG;XML","Internet;data mining;document handling;information retrieval;tree data structures","Web information retrieval;characteristic tree structured patterns;edge labeled tree;frequent pattern discovery;height-constrained variables;maximally frequent tag tree patterns;semistructured Web documents;structured variables","","2","","19","","","8-9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new approach based on BDDs (Binary Decision Diagrams) for database analysis problems. BDDs are graph-based representation of Boolean functions, now widely used in system design and verification area. Here we focus on Zero-suppressed BDDs (ZBDDs), a special type of BDDs, which are suitable for handling large-scale sets of combinations. Using ZBDDs, we can implicitly enumerate combinatorial item set data and efficiently compute set operations over the ZBDDs. We present some encouraging experimental results of frequent item set mining problem for practical benchmark examples, some of which have never been generated by previous method.","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1552989","","Binary decision diagrams;Binary trees;Boolean functions;Data analysis;Data structures;Databases;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Large-scale systems;System analysis and design","","","","2","","17","","","08-09 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems provide a view, called a target schema, on the top of the data sources. Mappings are defined for describing the way instances of the target schema are derived from instances of the data sources. The generation of such mappings is a difficult problem, especially when the target schema and the source schemas are in XML format. In this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find the mappings for a target schema given the source schemas and a set of semantic correspondences. In our framework, the target schema is decomposed into subtrees. Mappings are first determined for each subtree, and then combined to generate the mapping for the whole target schema. The generated mappings are expressed in a standard language, such as XQuery or XSLT.","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553010","","Conferences;Humans;Information retrieval;Mediation;XML","","","","0","","17","","","08-09 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome these challenges, feature selection approach was firstly employed, using the preprocessed dataset from interaction logs of 130 students. A Bayesian Network was subsequently constructed to handle the uncertainty inherent in assessing scientific inquiry skills. Both quantitative and qualitative portions of the Bayesian Network were elicited from a domain expert. Empirical study concluded that (i) expert elicited features outperformed features selected by feature selection algorithms; (ii) Machine-learned Bayesian Network can better encode knowledge about patterns of scientific inquiry skills acquisition as compared to NaiÂ¿ve Bayesian Network.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466911","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466911","Bayesian Networks;Feature Selection;Scientific Inquiry Skills;Student Modeling","Bayesian methods;Feature extraction;Graphical user interfaces;Humans;Inference mechanisms;Information technology;Predictive models;Uncertainty","belief networks;computer aided instruction;feature extraction;graphical user interfaces;pattern classification","INQPRO learning environment;classification model;feature extraction;machine-learned Bayesian network;model construction;naive Bayesian network;scientific inquiry skills acquisition","","0","","19","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first one is about the learner's requirement and the second one in about the personalized recommendation technique. Finally, this study proposes the knowledge based recommendation system as suitable recommendation technique. This recommendation aims to recommend to the learner, some materials based on the learner's need.

We outline a general approach to automating the discovery of mappings between relational data sources which leverages new perspectives on the data mapping problem and report on a prototype implementation. Our approach utilizes heuristic search within a space delineated by basic relational transformation operators. A further novelty of our approach is that these operators include data to metadata transformations (and vice versa), allowing a generalization of previous solutions such as token-based schema matching.","","POD:0-7695-2414-1","10.1109/WIRI.2005.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1553011","","Computer science;Database systems;Informatics;Information management;Large-scale systems;Management information systems;Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Semantic Web","","","","2","","26","","","08-09 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Courses must be allocated to teachers/lecturers, students, timeslots and venues without violating a set of predefined constraints determined by the respective institution. The problem is complex due to the different requirements set by the institutions and the process of finding a solution can be lengthy and time-consuming. This paper presents our research findings on implementing a bipartite graph edge coloring approach in solving a course timetabling problem. The data set used in this study is gathered from the Department of Information Technology in a Private College. Three data sets (from three different semesters) were tested in our experiment. The results are analyzed by comparing the total penalties of violation on a set of predefined soft constraints between the current timetable (produced manually) and the timetable from our prototype developed. The results from experimental research showed that the bipartite graph edge coloring approach on the course timetabling problem in this case study was able to reduce the penalties, thus producing better quality timetable compared to the manual timetable. In future research, more experiments can be conducted using the bipartite graph edge coloring approach with larger scope of data sets.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5652-9; POD:978-1-4244-5650-5","10.1109/INFRKM.2010.5466912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466912","bipartite;graph;scheduling;timetabling","Artificial intelligence;Bipartite graph;Educational institutions;Humans;Information technology;Prototypes;Resource management;Testing;Time factors","educational courses;graph colouring;scheduling;search problems","Department of Information Technology;bipartite graph edge coloring approach;course timetabling problem;private college","","0","","21","","","17-18 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
