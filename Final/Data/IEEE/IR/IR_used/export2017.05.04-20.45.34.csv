An effective method to the discovery of temporal behavioral patterns in the data set is proposed in this paper. The method consists of a two-step approach which is applied recursively to the data set. First, a clustering algorithm is used to segment the data into classes. Then, hidden Markov models are employed to find the underlying temporal behavioral patterns. These steps are applied recursively to features extracted from the data set until convergence. The main objective is to minimize the misclassification of patient profiles into various classes. This results in a hierarchical tree model consisting of a number of classes; each class groups similar patient temporal behavioral patterns together. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated through the application to a subset of the Australian national health insurance data set. It is shown that the proposed method not only clusters data into various categories of interest, but it also automatically marks the periods in which similar temporal behavioral patterns occurred.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1501824","Index Terms- Data mining;and association rules.;classification;clustering;information search and retrieval","Australia;Data mining;Diseases;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Hospitals;Information retrieval;Insurance;Medical services;Predictive models","data mining;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;medical information systems;pattern clustering;temporal databases","Australian medical claim data;information retrieval;information search;national health insurance system;patient misclassification;pattern discovery;temporal behavioral patterns","","7","","11","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Eng., Univ. of Manchester, UK","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","20050919","2005","16","5","1256","1268","We present a new method for content management and knowledge discovery using a topology-preserving neural network. The method, termed topological organization of content (TOC), can generate a taxonomy of topics from a set of unannotated, unstructured documents. The TOC consists of a hierarchy of self-organizing growing chains (GCs), each of which can develop independently in terms of size and topics. The dynamic development process is validated continuously using a proposed entropy-based Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Each chain meeting the criterion spans child chains, with reduced vocabularies and increased specializations. This results in a topological tree hierarchy, which can be browsed like a table of contents directory or web portal. A brief review is given on existing methods for document clustering and organization, and clustering validation measures. The proposed approach has been tested and compared with several existing methods on real world web page datasets. The results have clearly demonstrated the advantages and efficiency in content organization of the proposed method in terms of computational cost and representation. The TOC can be easily adapted for large-scale applications. The topology provides a unique, additional feature for retrieving related topics and confining the search space.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2005.853415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510724","Bayesian information criterion (BIC);content management;document categorization;hierarchical clustering;information retrieval (IR);self-organizing maps (SOMs);taxonomy generation;topic hierarchy;topological tree structure","Bayesian methods;Computational efficiency;Content management;Large-scale systems;Neural networks;Portals;Taxonomy;Testing;Vocabulary;Web pages","Internet;classification;content management;data mining;document handling;entropy;information retrieval;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","Web content management;clustering validation;document categorization;document clustering;document organization;dynamic development process;entropy-based Bayesian information criterion;information retrieval;knowledge discovery;self-organizing growing chains;self-organizing maps;topic taxonomy;topological content organization;topological tree hierarchy;topology-preserving neural network;unannotated unstructured documents","Abstracting and Indexing as Topic;Artificial Intelligence;Database Management Systems;Documentation;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internet;Natural Language Processing;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","9","1","48","","","Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The task was to identify relevant events and outliers in the data and highlight observations that are connected to an earlier kidnapping of employees from a company called GASTECH. In contrast to earlier challenges, the focus was on real-time data processing. The microblog messages were hosted on a web-server that simulated real-time streaming of the data during a 4.5 hour period and the challenge participants had to monitor and analyze them as they were transmitted. To tackle the challenge we developed ScatterScopes, a real-time enabled visual analytics system that fosters understanding of ongoing events by means of spatiotemporal overview and hierarchical drilldown. Trends and anomalies in space, time and content can be quickly identified with the system using interactive maps, sentiment timelines and textual search. Once interesting or suspicious subsets of elements are selected, their inherent topic structure can be further dissected based on a highly interactive treemap of message clusters. Subset selection and recombination is furthermore supported by a filter-and-flow mechanism that can also be used to formulate and test hypotheses based on Boolean logic. ScatterScopes has been used by our team to successfully identify and describe all events hidden in the MC3 data streams.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6227-3; POD:978-1-4799-6186-3","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042579","Information Search and Retrieval;Social Media;User Interfaces","Market research;Monitoring;Real-time systems;Sentiment analysis;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Urban areas;Visual analytics","","","","0","","1","","","25-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these challenges, we advocate for the use of multiple cloud storage providers simultaneously using network coding as the key enabling technology. Our goal is to study two challenges of network coded storage systems. First, the efficient update of the number of coded fragments per cloud in a system aggregating multiple clouds in order to boost the download speed of files. We developed a novel scheme using recoding with limited packets to trade-off storage space, reliability, and data retrieval speed. Implementation and measurements with commercial cloud providers show that up to 9x less network use is needed compared to other network coding schemes, while maintaining similar download speeds and reliability. Second, the ability to update coded fragments from a linear erasure code when the original file is modified. We exploit code structure to provide efficient representations of the evolution of the file. Evaluations using file changes on software library repositories show that a five-order of magnitude reduction in network and storage use is possible compared to state-of-the-art.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2015.2481433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7274724","Distributed systems;Error control codes;Information Storage and Retrieval","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Control systems;Decoding;Encoding;Network coding;Reliability","","","","","","","","20150923","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This can be reasonably considered to acquire higher recall without degrading the precision on the whole. Furthermore, our approach can escape from complex Chinese parsing problems and don't need to recognize Chinese base noun phrases accurately before the aligning process. Also, it can also relieve, to some extent, the serious impacts of error spread which may result from the unstable and impractical Chinese base noun phrases extraction tools. Another, dealing with high frequency noun phrases with statistical information also can realize the recognition of some non-compositional phrase pairs, which is difficult for pure syntax-based or lexicon-based systems to handle.","","POD:0-7803-9361-9","10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598762","Base noun phrase;Bilingual alignment;Cross-lingual information retrieval","Application software;Automation;Data mining;Degradation;Frequency;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Natural languages;Pattern recognition;Statistical analysis","grammars;natural languages;statistical analysis","Chinese parsing problem;Chinese-English parallel corpus;Dice coefficient similarity metrics;bilingual base noun phrase alignment;bilingual lexical information;high-frequency base noun phrase;low-frequency base noun phrase;statistical co-occurrence information","","2","","14","","","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our PASS architecture consists of three parts: (i) leveraging past work to represent all activities in A via a single “merged” graph, (ii) partitioning the graph into a set of C subgraphs, where (C + 1) is the number of compute nodes in a cluster, and (iii) developing a parallel activity detection algorithm that uses a different compute node in the cluster to intensively process each subgraph. We propose three possible partitioning methods and a parallel activity-search detection (PASS_Detect) algorithm that coordinates computations across nodes in the cluster. We report on experiments showing that our algorithms enable us to handle both large numbers of observations per second as well as large merged graphs. In particular, on a cluster with 9 compute nodes, PASS can reliably handle between 400K and 569K observations per second and merged graphs with as many as 50K vertices.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654141","Activity detection;Distributed systems;Information Storage and Retrieval;parallel computation;temporal stochastic automata","Automata;Clustering algorithms;Image edge detection;Partitioning algorithms;Stochastic processes;Throughput;Video surveillance","graph theory;parallel algorithms;stochastic automata","PASS architecture;PASS system;PASS_Detect algorithm;graph partitioning;parallel activity detection algorithm;parallel activity-search detection;partitioning methods;single merged graph;temporal stochastic automata","","0","","24","","20131104","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a more secure compression and decompression technique for large natural language texts. The merits of our method are: (1) The word-based approximate matching process can be performed directly on the secure compressed text directly; (2) updating a word directly into the compressed text is supported; (3) the decompression process can be started at the position of the search results; (4) the search process does not require complex encryption computation. The scheme we present is simple. The complexity of the search phase is only O(n), which makes our scheme very practical.

It is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and some other music-related applications. In this paper, a hierarchical framework is presented to automate the task of mood detection from acoustic music data, by following some music psychological theories in western cultures. The hierarchical framework has the advantage of emphasizing the most suitable features in different detection tasks. Three feature sets, including intensity, timbre, and rhythm are extracted to represent the characteristics of a music clip. The intensity feature set is represented by the energy in each subband, the timbre feature set is composed of the spectral shape features and spectral contrast features, and the rhythm feature set indicates three aspects that are closely related with an individual's mood response, including rhythm strength, rhythm regularity, and tempo. Furthermore, since mood is usually changeable in an entire piece of classical music, the approach to mood detection is extended to mood tracking for a music piece, by dividing the music into several independent segments, each of which contains a homogeneous emotional expression. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the proposed algorithms produce satisfactory results. On our testing database composed of 800 representative music clips, the average accuracy of mood detection achieves up to 86.3%. We can also on average recall 84.1% of the mood boundaries from nine testing music pieces.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.860344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561259","Affective computing;hierarchical framework;mood detection;mood tracking;music emotion;music information retrieval;music mood","Acoustic signal detection;Computer vision;Data mining;Mood;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Psychology;Rhythm;Testing;Timbre","acoustic signal detection;audio signal processing;feature extraction;music","automatic music mood detection;intensity feature set;music audio signal tracking;music clip emotional expression;music retrieval;music understanding;rhythm feature set;rhythm regularity;rhythm strength;spectral contrast features;spectral shape features;tempo;timbre feature set","","156","4","44","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

LSI can resolve the problems of polysemy and synonymy, and can reduce noise in the raw document-term matrix. But LSI is not an optimal approach to text classification. Because LSI is a complete unsupervised method, which ignores categories discrimination, it often drops the performance of text classification when it is applied to the whole training documents.

In this paper, we report our work on compressed pattern matching in LZW compressed files. The work includes an extension of Amir et al.'s well-known ""almost-optimal"" algorithm. The original Amir et al.'s algorithm has been improved to search not only the first occurrence of the pattern but also all other occurrences. A faster implementation for so-called ""simple patterns"" is also proposed. The work also includes a novel multiple-pattern matching algorithm using the Aho-Corasick algorithm. The algorithm takes O(mt+n+r) time with O(mt) extra space, where n is the size of the compressed file, m is the total length of all patterns, t is the size of the LZW trie, and r is the number of occurrences of the patterns. Extensive experiments have been conducted to test the performance of our algorithms and to compare with other well-known compressed pattern matching algorithms, particularly the BWT-based algorithms and another similar multiple-pattern matching algorithm by Kida et al. that also uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm on the LZW compressed data. The results showed that our multiple-pattern matching algorithm is competitive among the best compressed pattern-matching algorithms and is practically the fastest among all approaches when the number of patterns is not very large. Therefore, our algorithm is preferable for general string matching applications. The proposed algorithm is efficient for large files and it is particularly efficient when being applied on archive search if the archives are compressed with a common LZW trie. LZW is one of the most efficient and popular compression algorithms used extensively and our method requires no modification on the compression algorithm. The work reported in this paper, therefore, has great economic and market potential.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2005.133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453495","Index Terms- Data compaction and compression;information search and retrieval;pattern matching.","Compaction;Compression algorithms;Helium;Image coding;Information retrieval;Internet;Memory;Pattern matching;Power generation economics;Testing","computational complexity;data compression;file organisation;information retrieval;pattern matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;BWT-based algorithm;LZW compressed files;computational complexity;data compaction;data compression;information retrieval;information search;pattern matching","","8","","14","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, user profiles which only contain a user’s past annotation information may not be enough to support the selection of expansion terms, especially for users with limited previous activity with the system. We propose a novel model to construct enriched user profiles with the help of an external corpus for personalized query expansion. Our model integrates the current state-of-the-art text representation learning framework, known as word embeddings, with topic models in two groups of pseudo-aligned documents. Based on user profiles, we build two novel query expansion techniques. These two techniques are based on topical weights-enhanced word embeddings, and the topical relevance between the query and the terms inside a user profile respectively. The results of an in-depth experimental evaluation, performed on two real-world datasets using different external corpora, show that our approach outperforms traditional techniques, including existing non-personalized and personalized query expansion methods.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2017.2668419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7852459","Information Search and Retrieval;Personalization;Query Formulation;User profiles and alert services","Collaboration;History;Search problems;Semantics;Vocabulary;Web pages;Web search","","","","","","","","20170213","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Our informational context is also faster paced, with news and developments spreading across media and the Internet at an often astounding rate. In today's competitive world, the first response to a trend is usually the most effective. Thus far, the technology responsible for this information complexity offers little to help us quickly understand and act upon it. Although visualization is useful, its techniques are typically too slow or simply not designed to help users understand highly time-sensitive and dynamic information streams. To address this, we developed TextPool, a system that uses temporal pooling to visualize live text streams such as newswires and system telemetry. In temporal pooling, systems gather recent stream content into a buffer (pool) to use for visualization. Because the stream continues to flow through the pool in real time, the visualization must be dynamic, using motion to respond to the pool's changing content. The TextPool system processes live text streams in real time using information retrieval techniques, extracts the most frequently occurring salient terms from the buffered streams, and displays related terms next to one another in a dynamic text collage.","0272-1716;02721716","","10.1109/MCG.2005.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1438258","data streams;information retrieval;information visualization;motion;newswires;perception;text layout","Computer displays;Computer performance;Data visualization;Feeds;History;Motion detection;Navigation;Performance analysis;Software algorithms;Software performance","data visualisation;information retrieval;motion estimation;real-time systems;text analysis;visual perception","Internet;TextPool system;data visualization;information retrieval techniques;informational context;live text streams visualization;newswires;system telemetry;temporal pooling","","12","3","23","","","May-June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many researchers are using concept lattice defined in formal concept analysis (FC A) as a basis for measuring query-document relevance in text retrieval, i.e. concept lattice-based ranking (CLR). However, formal concept analysis's notion of similarity for measuring documents relevance in text retrieval is only based on the shortest path linking the query to the document. It is not well defined. To resolve the problems of this approach, first, we evaluate reasonable different weights of edges in the Hasse diagram based on the conceptual generality or specificity. Second, we present a user profile based on concept lattice, and the algorithm for constructing concept lattice based user profile is provided. Third, we present a combination CLR approach by measuring the similarity among query, user profile and document according to the relation between query and user interest based on concept lattice.

Marian","Microsoft Res., Redmond, WA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20040802","2004","16","8","992","1009","Repositories of multimedia objects having multiple types of attributes (e.g., image, text) are becoming increasingly common. A query on these attributes will typically, request not just a set of objects, as in the traditional relational query model (filtering), but also a grade of match associated with each object, which indicates how well the object matches the selection condition (ranking). Furthermore, unlike in the relational model, users may just want the k top-ranked objects for their selection queries for a relatively small k. In addition to the differences in the query model, another peculiarity of multimedia repositories is that they may allow access to the attributes of each object only through indexes. We investigate how to optimize the processing of top-k selection queries over multimedia repositories. The access characteristics of the repositories and the above query model lead to novel issues in query optimization. In particular, the choice of the indexes used to search the repository strongly influences the cost of processing the filtering condition. We define an execution space that is search-minimal, i.e., the set of indexes searched is minimal. Although the general problem of picking an optimal plan in the search-minimal execution space is NP-hard, we present an efficient algorithm that solves the problem optimally with respect to our cost model and execution space when the predicates in the query are independent. We also show that the problem of optimizing top-k selection queries can be viewed, in many cases, as that of evaluating more traditional selection conditions. Thus, both problems can be viewed together as an extended filtering problem to which techniques of query processing and optimization may be adapted.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1318583","65;Top-k query processing;information retrieval.;information search;multimedia databases","Computer Society;Cost function;Filtering;Helium;Histograms;Information retrieval;Matched filters;Multimedia databases;Query processing;Relational databases","computational complexity;database indexing;information filters;multimedia databases;optimisation;query formulation;query processing","database index;multimedia repositories;query processing;relational query model;search-minimal execution space;top-k selection query optimization","","59","","37","","","Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Organizations always apply a set of transformations on their data before releasing it. While determining the best set of transformations has been the focus of extensive work in the database community, most of this work suffered from one or both of the following major problems: scalability and privacy guarantee. Differential Privacy provides a theoretical formulation for privacy that ensures that the system essentially behaves the same way regardless of whether any individual is included in the database. In this paper, we address both scalability and privacy risk of data anonymization. We propose a scalable algorithm that meets differential privacy when applying a specific random sampling. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1) we propose a personalized anonymization technique based on an aggregate formulation and prove that it can be implemented in polynomial time; and 2) we show that combining the proposed aggregate formulation with specific sampling gives an anonymization algorithm that satisfies differential privacy. Our results rely heavily on exploring the supermodularity properties of the risk function, which allow us to employ techniques from convex optimization. Through experimental studies we compare our proposed algorithm with other anonymization schemes in terms of both time and privacy risk.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6709680","Data;Data sharing;Database Management;Database design;Differential privacy;General;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technology and Systems;Knowledge and data engineering tools and techniques;Online Information Services;Security;and protection;anonymity;data sharing;data utility;integrity;modeling and management;risk management;scalability;security","Aggregates;Communities;Data privacy;Databases;Privacy;Scalability;Security","data privacy;optimisation","convex optimization;data anonymization;data usage maximization;database community;privacy risk;privacy risk minimization;random sampling;scalability risk;supermodularity-based differential privacy preserving algorithm","","3","","32","","20140110","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A key step for the mobile App usage analysis is to classify Apps into some predefined categories. However, it is a nontrivial task to effectively classify mobile Apps due to the limited contextual information available for the analysis. For instance, there is limited contextual information about mobile Apps in their names. However, this contextual information is usually incomplete and ambiguous. To this end, in this paper, we propose an approach for first enriching the contextual information of mobile Apps by exploiting the additional Web knowledge from the Web search engine. Then, inspired by the observation that different types of mobile Apps may be relevant to different real-world contexts, we also extract some contextual features for mobile Apps from the context-rich device logs of mobile users. Finally, we combine all the enriched contextual information into the Maximum Entropy model for training a mobile App classifier. To validate the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on 443 mobile users' device logs to show both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The experimental results clearly show that our approach outperforms two state-of-the-art benchmark methods with a significant margin.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2013.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6585246","Data mining;Feature evaluation and selection;Information Search and Retrieval;Mobile App classification;enriched contextual information;real-world contexts;web knowledge","Context;Engines;Feature extraction;Knowledge engineering;Mobile communication;Semantics;Web search","Internet;feature extraction;maximum entropy methods;mobile computing;pattern classification;search engines","Web knowledge;Web search engine;contextual feature extraction;contextual information;intelligent personalized context-based services;maximum entropy model;mobile app classification;mobile app classifier;mobile app usage analysis;mobile user context-rich device logs;user preferences","","14","","34","","20130823","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The mere presence of text, its words, and meaning are closely related to the semantics of the object or scene. This paper exploits textual contents in images for fine-grained business place classification and logo retrieval. There are four main contributions. First, we show that the textual cues extracted by the proposed method are effective for the two tasks. Combining the proposed textual and visual cues outperforms visual only classification and retrieval by a large margin. Second, to extract the textual cues, a generic and fully unsupervised word box proposal method is introduced. The method reaches state-of-the-art word detection recall with a limited number of proposals. Third, contrary to what is widely acknowledged in text detection literature, we demonstrate that high recall in word detection is more important than high f-score at least for both tasks considered in this work.

By automating the process of information retrieval, further utilization by targeted applications is enabled. The key idea in our novel system is to exploit the format of the Web pages to discover the underlying structure in order to finally infer and extract pieces of information from the Web page. Our system first identifies the section of the Web page that contains the information to be extracted and then extracts it by using clustering techniques and other tools of statistical origin. STAVIES can operate without human intervention and does not require any training. The main innovation and contribution of the proposed system consists of introducing a signal-wise treatment of the tag structural hierarchy and using hierarchical clustering techniques to segment the Web pages. The importance of such a treatment is significant since it permits abstracting away from the raw tag-manipulating approach. Experimental results and comparisons with other state of the art systems are presented and discussed in the paper, indicating the high performance of the proposed algorithm.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1524964","Index Terms- Automatic wrappers;Web data extraction;Web mining;Web structure mining;data source wrappers;generic wrappers;information retrieval.;intelligent agents on the Web;resource discovery","Clustering algorithms;Computer Society;Data mining;Humans;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Technological innovation;Web mining;Web pages;Web sites","Internet;data mining;information retrieval systems;pattern clustering","STAVIES;automatic Web wrapper generation;hierarchical clustering techniques;human browsing;information dissemination;information extraction system;tag structural hierarchy;unknown Web data sources","","20","","27","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More so, most datasets only contain pure power time series, despite labels being required to determine when a device is in use from when it is idle (incurring stand-by consumption or being off), and by extension to separate human activities triggering the consumption from the baseline consumption. We build upon our Collaborative Annotation Framework for Energy Datasets (CAFED) to evaluate and distinguish the performance of expert users against that of regular users. Through a user study with curated benchmark annotation tasks, we provide data-driven and efficient techniques to detect weak and adversarial workers and promote users when the contributors' user-base is limited.

This paper presents a genetic algorithm (GA) that combines a direct and an indirect approach to treating binary constraints in genetic operators. A new genetic operator combines randomness and heuristics for guiding the reproduction of new individuals in a population. Individuals are composed of spatial objects whose relationships are indexed by a content measure.

We present the framework of such a search engine based on domain ontologies. In this framework, a search request, which can be either a keyword list as in traditional search methods or a query in complex form containing various restrictions to the search, is first processed by a query parser which then finds qualified RDF triples in domain ontologies. Web documents relevant to the requested concepts and individuals specified in these triples are then retrieved by a document retriever. And finally, the retrieved documents are ranked according to their relevance to the user's query. An extended term-document matrix is built to reflect the relevance between documents, concepts/individuals, and terms. Such a matrix makes it possible for the search engine to work even in case that there are no available domain ontologies for user requests.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527258","Information Retrieval (IR);Knowledge Representation;OWL-QL;Semantic Web, Ontology;Semantic search","Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;OWL;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Search engines;Search methods;Semantic Web;Time division multiplexing","information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines;semantic Web;text analysis","document ranking;document relevance;document retrieval;document term relations;domain ontologies;information retrieval;keyword list;knowledge representation;query parser;search request;semantic Web;semantic search engine;term-document matrix;user query","","6","2","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given a database S of objects in a metric space M and a query object q in M, in a range searching problem the goal is to find the objects of S within some threshold distance to g, whereas in a k-nearest neighbor searching problem, the k elements of S closest to q must be produced. These problems can obviously be solved with a linear number of distance calculations, by comparing the query object against every object in the database. However, the goal is to solve such problems much faster. We combine and extend ideas from the M-tree, the multivantage point structure, and the FQ-tree to create a new structure in the ""bisector tree"" class, called the Antipole tree. Bisection is based on the proximity to an ""Antipole"" pair of elements generated by a suitable linear randomized tournament. The final winners a, b of such a tournament is far enough apart to approximate the diameter of the splitting set. If dist(a, b) is larger than the chosen cluster diameter threshold, then the cluster is split. The proposed data structure is an indexing scheme suitable for (exact and approximate) best match searching on generic metric spaces. The Antipole tree outperforms by a factor of approximately two existing structures such as list of clusters, M-trees, and others and, in many cases, it achieves better clustering properties.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1401892","Index Terms- Indexing methods;information search and retrieval.;similarity measures","Algorithm design and analysis;Binary trees;Clustering algorithms;Data structures;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Indexing;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern recognition","database indexing;pattern clustering;query processing;tree data structures;tree searching","Antipole tree indexing;information retrieval;k-nearest neighbor search;metric space;pattern recognition;query processing;tree data structure","","29","","53","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The major drawback of many existed systems, which try to make different synergies between filtering strategies, is usually concerned with not taking care of resource availability, being especially critical for the presenting of successful commercial deployments. The essence of the presented solution is both in the encapsulation of many known searching algorithms inside separate filtering agents, and in the integration of flexible resource aware coordination mechanisms into one manager agent. The flexibility of the realised coordination scheme in facilitating an easy integration of novel strategies is practically demonstrated in a system serving as an intelligent personal information assistant. Experimental results, obtained during two week long system usage, show the successful elimination of long lasting jobs with duration over 1000 seconds in spite of the regular integration of novel strategies.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527937","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527937","Filtering framework;Information filtering agents;Information retrieval;Multi agent systems;Real time environment;Strategy coordination;System resource awareness","Availability;Delay;Electronic mail;Encapsulation;Filtering algorithms;Humans;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Resource management","information filtering;information filters;information resources;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","information resources;information retrieval;intelligent personal information assistant;learning;multiagent information filtering system;multiagent systems;real time environment;resource availability;resource aware coordination","","1","","23","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we study a new research problem called spatio-textual similarity join: given two sets of spatio-textual objects, find the similar object pairs. We make the following contributions: (1) We develop a filter-and-refine framework and devise several efficient algorithms. We extend the prefix filter technique to generate spatial and textual signatures for the objects and build inverted index on top of these signatures. Then we generate candidate pairs using the inverted lists of signatures. Finally we refine the candidates and generate the final result.

As an important area within the field of music information retrieval (MIR), the goal of music recognition is, given a database of musical pieces and a query document, to locate all occurrences of that document within the database, up to certain possible errors. In particular, the identification of the query with regard to the database becomes possible. The approach presented in this paper is based on a general algorithmic framework for searching complex patterns of objects in large databases.

Defining a motif by a set of geospatial entities with certain characteristics, we present an approach to inferring important regions for the motif based on density of these entities. The evaluation of the approach for several motifs showed that the inferred regions are among the most popular places for a motif of interest according to the opinion of several experts and official rankings.

The major data structure in the information retrieval system is an inverted file, which records the positions of each term in the documents. When the information set substantially grows, the number of terms and documents are significantly increased as well as the size of the inverted files. Approaches to reduce the inverted file without sacri.cing the query efficiency are important to the success of scalable information systems. In this paper, we propose a compression approach by using Binary Decision Diagram Encoding (BDD) so that all possible ordering correlation among large amount of documents will be extracted to minimize the posting representation. Another advantage of using BDD is that BDD expressions can e.ciently perform Boolean queries, which are very common in retrieval systems. Experiment results show that the compression ratios of the inverted files have been improved signi.cantly by the BDD scheme.","","POD:1-58113-293-X","10.1109/SC.2001.10019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1592812","BDD;Information Retrieval;Inverted File;Scalable Information Systems","Binary decision diagrams;Boolean functions;Computer science;Data structures;Encoding;Information retrieval;Information systems;Keyword search;Management information systems;Permission","","BDD;Information Retrieval;Inverted File;Scalable Information Systems","","0","2","14","","","10-16 Nov. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visual analytical means can help to gain insights in the recorded data. However, the analysis of eye movement is challenging as they do not follow any underlying network. Hence, unfiltered and detailed visualization of this data often suffers from cluttering and overplotting, which hampers pattern detection. To tackle these issues, we adapt an existing interactive filtering approach for geographic trajectory data and apply it to eye tracking trajectories. It allows to narrow down the data for a local analysis of different fixation patterns and eye movement between fixations, while exploring them directly the spatial context of the stimulus. In a case study we describe the application of our approach on an eye tracking experiment using a static stimulus with data recorded from eight participants.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4731-4; POD:978-1-5090-4732-1","10.1109/ETVIS.2016.7851162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7851162","Information Storage and Retrieval [H.3.3]: Information Search and Retrieval—Information ﬁltering;Query formulation;Selection process; Information Interfaces and Presentation [H.5.2]: User Interfaces-GUI;","Data visualization;Filtering;Gaze tracking;Image color analysis;Lenses;Trajectory;Visualization","data visualisation;gaze tracking;geographic information systems;image filtering","Saccadelenses;cluttering;data visualization;eye movement;eye tracking trajectories;fixation patterns;geographic trajectory data;interactive exploratory filtering;interactive filtering;overplotting;pattern detection;spatial context;static stimulus;visual stimulus","","","","","","","23-23 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major challenges for this study arise from the fact that a singer's voice tends to be arbitrarily altered from time to time and is inextricably intertwined with the signal of the background accompaniment. To determine who is singing, or whether or when a particular singer is present in a music recording, methods are presented for separating vocal from nonvocal regions, for isolating singers' vocal characteristics from background music, and for distinguishing singers from one another. Experimental evaluations conducted on a pop music database consisting of solo and duet tracks confirm the validity of the proposed methods.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.854091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561289","Music information retrieval;singer detection;singer identification;singer tracking","Computer networks;Content based retrieval;Databases;IP networks;Indexing;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Signal processing;Target recognition","content-based retrieval;database indexing;multimedia systems;music;speaker recognition;tracking","automatic singer recognition;content-based information retrieval;multimedia applications;pop music database;popular music recordings;solo vocal signal estimation;solo vocal signal modeling","","31","","28","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, data in today's digitally connected world is growing at a rapid pace. Taxonomy represents theme inherent in a data set. So, taxonomy should evolve and reflect changes occurred in the data set, otherwise, it could not represent theme of the underlying data set accurately. Many automatic techniques are available that are generating taxonomy effectively for large to small data sets but, very less focus has been made on the evolution of taxonomy. In this paper, we propose a novel Taxonomy Incremental Evolution (TIE) algorithm that can incrementally evolve an existing taxonomy, whenever new documents are added in underlying data set, rather than regenerating a taxonomy from scratch. The proposed methodology can rest on top of any of the available clustering based automatic taxonomy generation techniques and incrementally evolve an existing taxonomy. We tested the TIE algorithm, in comparison to regeneration, on a text data set belonging to computing domain. The results obtained show that evolution is a better approach as compared to regeneration, as far as time efficiency is considered. Moreover, lexical and hierarchical quality of the evolved taxonomy found to be equally comparable to the regenerated taxonomy. Thus, the TIE algorithm can give an updated taxonomy in a considerably shorter period of time.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838225","Hierarchical clustering;Information extraction and retrieval;Knowledge organization and management;Taxonomy generation and evolution","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data models;Electrical engineering;Labeling;Taxonomy","text analysis","TIE;clustering based automatic taxonomy generation;digital world;taxonomy incremental evolution;text data set","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SSTN problem is important for many societal applications, such as surface and air transportation management systems. The problem is NP hard, and is challenging due to an inherently large data volume and novel semantics (e.g., Lagrangian reference frame). Related works rely on orthogonal partitioning approaches (e.g., snapshot and longitudinal) and incur excessive I/O costs when performing common STN queries. Our preliminary work proposed a non-orthogonal partitioning approach in which we optimized the LGetOneSuccessor() operation that retrieves a single successor for a given node on STN. In this paper, we provide a method to optimize the LGetAllSuccessors() operation, which retrieves all successors for a given node on a STN. This new approach uses the concept of a Lagrangian Family Set (LFS) to model data access patterns for STN queries. Experimental results using real-world road and flight traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms prior work for LGetAllSuccessors() computation workloads.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529086","Combinatorial algorithms;Combinatorics;Data;Data Storage Representations;Data Structures;Database Management;Discrete Mathematics;Graphs and networks;Information Storage;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technology and Systems;Languages;Mathematics of Computing;Query languages;Spatial databases;Spatial databases and GIS;Storage and access methods;Storage/repositories;Systems;Temporal databases;geographic information systems;graph partitioning;lagrangian reference frame;spatio-temporal network databases","Data structures;Delays;Indexes;Roads;Sensor phenomena and characterization","query processing;storage management;temporal databases;visual databases","LFS;LGetOneSuccessor() operation;Lagrangian approaches;Lagrangian family set;NP hard problem;SSTN problem;STN queries;air transportation management systems;data access patterns;disk I/O cost minimization;flight traffic datasets;large data volume;nonorthogonal partitioning approach;orthogonal partitioning approaches;real-world road traffic datasets;spatio-temporal network dataset storage","","0","","26","","20130611","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We define the CONTINUOUS k-DIVERSITY PROBLEM along with appropriate constraints that enforce continuity requirements on the diversified results. Our proposed approach is based on cover trees and supports dynamic item insertion and deletion. The diversification problem is in general NP-hard; we provide theoretical bounds that characterize the quality of our cover tree solution with respect to the optimal one.

This study aims to develop an intelligent Web portal system that unlike traditional Web portals uses a number of intelligent methods, including information extraction (IE), information retrieval (IR), and heuristic algorithm (HA), and provides more meaningful and integrated information to Web users.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-9298-1","10.1109/ICSMC.2005.1571751","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1571751","Web portal;information extraction;information retrieval","Computer science;Data mining;Heuristic algorithms;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Portals;Web and internet services;Web pages;World Wide Web","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;portals","Internet;Web page information integration;Web site classification;heuristic algorithm;information extraction;information retrieval;intelligent Web portal system","","5","","31","","","10-12 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system constructed the vector set, which composed of the vectors of each domain, by using the materials having been classified manually. When the user visited the Internet, the historical pages were recorded and downloaded. The system extracted the information from the pages and constructed the vector of every page. The distance between the page vector and the domain vector was calculated. The more the distance the more the relativity. The personalized model of the given user was built by the relativity. Due to the limit of the dictionary, the method of the word segmentation called ""a domain independent dictionary free lexical acquisition model for Chinese document"" was used. In this paper, some key technologies related to the system were discussed, such as extracting the class keywords, classifying methods, and the algorithm of the page value calculating. In the last paragraph, the future works, such as the storing of semi-structure information, and the calculating of the Web page's value were mentioned.","1550-445X;1550445X","POD:0-7695-2249-1","10.1109/AINA.2005.296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423559","Class keywords;Intelligent agent;Meta-search engine;Personalization;Personalized Information Retrieval","Artificial intelligence;Data mining;Dictionaries;Feedback;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Internet;Learning systems;Metasearch;Search engines","Internet;cooperative systems;information retrieval;search engines","Chinese meta-search engine model;Internet;class keywords;intelligent agent;lexical acquisition model;personalized information retrieval","","0","","15","","","28-30 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NGSW is the first large-scale repository of its kind, consisting of speeches, news broadcasts, and recordings from the 20th century. After presenting an overview of the audio stream content of the NGSW, with sample audio files from U.S. Presidents from 1893 to the present, an overall system diagram is proposed with a discussion of critical tasks associated with effective audio information retrieval. These include advanced audio segmentation, speech recognition model adaptation for acoustic background noise and speaker variability, and information retrieval using natural language processing for text query requests that include document and query expansion. For segmentation, a new evaluation criterion entitled fused error score (FES) is proposed, followed by application of the CompSeg segmentation scheme on DARPA Hub4 Broadcast News (30.5% relative improvement in FES) and NGSW data. Transcript generation is demonstrated for a six-decade portion of the NGSW corpus. Novel model adaptation using structure maximum likelihood eigenspace mapping shows a relative 21.7% improvement. Issues regarding copyright assessment and metadata construction are also addressed for the purposes of a sustainable audio collection of this magnitude. Advanced parameter-embedded watermarking is proposed with evaluations showing robustness to correlated noise attacks. Our experimental online system entitled “SpeechFind” is presented, which allows for audio retrieval from a portion of the NGSW corpus. Finally, a number of research challenges such as language modeling and lexicon for changing time periods, speaker trait and identification tracking, as well as new directions, are discussed in order to address the overall task of robust phrase searching in unrestricted audio corpora.","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/TSA.2005.852088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495452","Accent classification;broadcast news;document expansion;environmental sniffing;fidelity;fused error score;information retrieval;language modeling;model adaptation;query expansion;robust speech recognition;robustness;security;speech segmentation;spoken document retrieval;watermarking","Adaptation model;Audio recording;Background noise;Broadcasting;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Loudspeakers;Natural language processing;Speech recognition;Streaming media","audio signal processing;information retrieval;natural languages;speech recognition;watermarking","CompSeg segmentation scheme;DARPA Hub4 Broadcast News;National Gallery of the Spoken Word;SpeechFind;acoustic background noise;advanced audio segmentation;advanced parameter-embedded watermarking;audio information retrieval;copyright assessment;correlated noise attacks;fused error score;language modeling;metadata construction;natural language processing;overall system diagram;robust phrase searching;speaker variability;speech recognition model;spoken document retrieval;structure maximum likelihood eigenspace mapping;sustainable audio collection;text query requests;transcript generation;unrestricted audio corpora","","55","2","104","","","Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"An Overview on XML Semantic Disambiguation from Unstructured Text to Semi-Structured Data: Background, Applications, and Ongoing Challenges","J. Tekli","Electrical and Computer Engineering Department (ECE), Lebanese American University (LAU), Lebanon","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20160429","2016","28","6","1383","1407","Since the last two decades, XML has gained momentum as the standard for web information management and complex data representation. Also, collaboratively built semi-structured information resources, such as Wikipedia, have become prevalent on the Web and can be inherently encoded in XML. Yet most methods for processing XML and semi-structured information handle mainly the syntactic properties of the data, while ignoring the semantics involved. To devise more intelligent applications, one needs to augment syntactic features with machine-readable semantic meaning. This can be achieved through the computational identification of the meaning of data in context, also known as (a.k.a.) automated semantic analysis and disambiguation, which is nowadays one of the main challenges at the core of the Semantic Web. This survey paper provides a concise and comprehensive review of the methods related to XML-based semi-structured semantic analysis and disambiguation. It is made of four logical parts. First, we briefly cover traditional word sense disambiguation methods for processing flat textual data. Second, we describe and categorize disambiguation techniques developed and extended to handle semi-structured and XML data. Third, we describe current and potential application scenarios that can benefit from XML semantic analysis, including: data clustering and semantic-aware indexing, data integration and selective dissemination, semantic-aware and temporal querying, web and mobile services matching and composition, blog and social semantic network analysis, and ontology learning. Fourth, we describe and discuss ongoing challenges and future directions, including: the quantification of semantic ambiguity, expanding XML disambiguation context, combining structure and content, using collaborative/social information sources, integrating explicit and implicit semantic analysis, emphasizing user involvement, and reducing computational complexity.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2525768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7398037","Content analysis and indexing;Document Preparation;Document management;Semantic Networks;document and text processing: document and text editing – Document management;document preparation: document preparation – Markup languages;information search and retrieval;knowledge representation formalisms and methods: semantic networks","Context;Films;Motion pictures;Semantics;Standards;Syntactics;XML","","","","","","228","","20160203","June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
