The large effective storage capacity using compressed video leads to the application of fast storage and retrieval functions, to enable quick user-friendly searching for and access to specific parts of the video data. We explore the feasibility of a near real-time semantic sports video analyzer for an experimental consumer media server. This tool is able to automatically extract and analyze key events in a video sequence. The analyzer employs several visual cues and a model for real-world coordinates, so that key parameters (e.g. speed and position) of a player can be determined with sufficient accuracy. This special data can be stored as metadata, thereby facilitating intelligent searching of events. The tool consists of four processing steps: (1) playing frame detection, (2) court extraction, as well as a 3-D camera model, (3) player segmentation and tracking, and (4) event-based high-level analysis exploiting visual cues extracted in the real-world. Our system has been evaluated in a new distributed AV content analysis system for home entertainment.

Linear discriminant analysis and its variants have been widely used in CBIR applications because of their effectiveness in finding a projection that maps the original high-dimensional space to a low-dimensional one and preserves the most discriminant features. Those techniques assume images from certain class(es) are all visually similar and try to cluster them in the projected space. In this paper we show that the human high-level concept of semantic similarity between images may not arise only from the low-level visual similarity and consequently that assumption is inappropriate in many cases. We propose an adaptive discriminant projection (ADP) framework which could model different data distributions based on the clustering of different classes. To learn the best model fitting the real scenario, boosted adaptive discriminant projection is further proposed. Extensive experiments are designed to evaluate our methods and compare them to the state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark data set and real image retrieval applications.

This paper proposes a layered Gaussian mixture model (LGMM) to exploit high dimensional features for classifying various shots in video. LGMM decomposes a high dimensional feature space by building a pyramid structure and estimating the distribution of local partitions in each layer using Gaussian mixtures from the bottom of the pyramid to the top. We reduce the dimension of features in each local region at a lower layer by projecting them onto the estimated Gaussian components. These projected feature vectors are then used to estimate the Gaussian mixture models at a upper layer. The final dimension of the feature is adjustable by choosing the number of Gaussians at the top layer of the pyramid. We demonstrate the proposed method using motion features to classify video shots.

Over the last few years, kernel-based approach has been a popular choice for the implementation of the relevance feedback based CBIR system. This is largely due to its ability to classify patterns with limited sample data. A long flat vector has been a popular choice for the input configuration. The reasons are because it is relatively easy to implement and more importantly, because it preserve the information of identifying the target images via different combination of image features. However, one of the biggest weaknesses of such configuration is the ""curse of dimensionality"". This paper introduces a relevance feedback framework via the use of statistical discriminant analysis method to select only relevant feature for next image retrieval cycle. Hence, minimize the dimensionality of the feature vector. This approach has been tested with four sets of images labelled with different themes. Each set contains 500 images, 50 labelled as positive while the rest are negative. The test showed an improvement from the previous flat input vector configuration when the training samples are relatively small","","POD:0-7803-9283-3","10.1109/ICICS.2005.1689057","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1689057","Content-based image retrieval;Feature Selection;Relevance Feedback;Statistical Discriminant Analysis","Content based retrieval;Explosions;Feedback;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Image sampling;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Testing","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;image sampling;relevance feedback","CBIR;content-based image retrieval system;data sampling;image feature selection;pattern classification;relevance feedback framework;statistical discriminant analysis method","","2","","13","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present an approach to visualize files using fractal figures, which: (1) convey the overall development effort; (2) illustrate the distribution of the effort among various developers; and (3) allow files to be categorized in terms of the distribution of the effort following gestah principles. Our approach allows us to discover files of high development efforts in terms of team size and effort intensity of individual developers.

In this paper, we propose a novel method in which style information is used in both logical entity classifier training and recognition phases. In the training phase, training data are first classified into distinct styles, and a dedicated support vector machine (SVM) is then learned for each style.

On the assumption that a persons face is likely to appear when his/her name is mentioned in the caption, first all the faces associated with the query name are selected. Among these faces, there could be many faces corresponding to the queried person in different conditions, poses and times, but there could also be other faces corresponding to other people in the caption or some non-face images due to the errors in the face detection method used. However, in most cases, the number of corresponding faces of the queried person will be large, and these faces will be more similar to each other than to others. In this study, we propose a graph based method to find the most similar subset among the set of possible faces associated with the query name, where the most similar subset is likely to correspond to the faces of the queried person. When the similarity of faces are represented in a graph structure, the set of most similar faces will be the densest component in the graph. We represent the similarity of faces using SIFT descriptors. The matching interest points on two faces are decided after the application of two constraints, namely the geometrical constraint and the unique match constraint. The average distance of the matching points are used to construct the similarity graph. The most similar set of faces is then found based on a greedy densest component algorithm. The experiments are performed on thousands of news photographs taken in real life conditions and, therefore, having a large variety of poses, illuminations and expressions.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640931","","Automatic control;Data analysis;Face detection;Face recognition;Image analysis;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information resources;Information retrieval;Lighting","","","","22","","11","","","2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The frequency behavior of the extinction coefficients obtained with the different models between 5 and 90 GHz is also studied. The four models are also driven with inputs derived from snow-pit data, and the outputs are compared with ground-based measurements of brightness temperatures at 18.7 and 36.5 GHz. Significant differences among the brightness temperatures and the extinction coefficients simulated with the four models in the cases of the six classes of snow are observed. Moreover, no particular model is found to be able to systematically reproduce all of the experimental data.

With the help of hash keys obtained as integers converted from the real valued vectors, keypoints are stored with object IDs and retrieved with no search process. Voting for object IDs is employed to determine a recognized object as the one with the largest vote. Experimental results show that the proposed method is at least 400 times faster than a brute-force method while 90% of objects were correctly recognized","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-2521-0","10.1109/ICPR.2006.480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1699964","","Character recognition;Engines;Image databases;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Object recognition;Uniform resource locators;Voting","computer vision;data structures;feature extraction;image retrieval;object recognition","data representation;high dimensional vectors;information access;keypoint extraction;keypoint hashing;object images;planar object recognition","","0","","6","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One motivation is, of course, to help people understand the behavior of systems with no (complete) documentation. However, such reverse-engineered dynamic models can also be used for quality assurance purposes. They can, for example, be compared with design sequence diagrams and the conformance of the implementation to the design can thus be verified. Furthermore, discrepancies can also suggest failures in meeting the specifications. Due to size constraints, this paper focuses on the distribution aspects of the methodology we propose. We formally define our approach using metamodels and consistency rules.

In this paper, we present modified insertion and deletion algorithms to maintain the tree in better shape dynamically. Without applying any complex rebalancing technique, or using considerable amount of space, both algorithms maintain the tree in such a way that even a series of insertions and asymmetric deletions do not cause the tree to grow beyond n/2. A comparative study of traditional and modified insert algorithms shows that for random input, the modified insert algorithm produces a tree with 20% to 30% reduction in height, forcing the average number of comparisons required for a successful search to go down by 15% to 20%","1550-6037;15506037","POD:0-7695-2602-0","10.1109/IV.2006.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1648303","","Application software;Binary search trees;Binary trees;Computer science;Cost function;Information retrieval;Information systems;Shape;Tree data structures;Tree graphs","graph theory;tree searching","computer science;data access;data retrieval;insert algorithms;random binary search tree","","2","","8","","","5-7 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, TMTR constraints parameterized by a vector, whose coordinates specify periodically the maximum runlengths of 1's ending at the positions, are investigated. A canonical way to classify such constraints and simplify their minimal graph presentations is introduced. It is shown that there is a particularly simple presentation for a special class of TMTR constraints and explicit descriptions of their characteristic equations are derived. New upper bounds on the capacity of TMTR constraints are established, and an explicit linear ordering by capacity of all tight TMTR constraints up to period 4 is given. For MTR constrained systems with unconstrained positions, it is shown that the set of sequences restricted to the constrained positions yields a natural TMTR constraint.

To support such applications efficiently, content-based video indexing must be addressed. Typically, each video is represented by a sequence of frames. Due to the high dimensionality of frame representation and the large number of frames, video indexing introduces an additional degree of complexity. In this paper, we address the problem of content-based video indexing and propose an efficient solution, called the ordered VA-file (OVA-file) based on the VA-file. OVA-file is a hierarchical structure and has two novel features: 1) partitioning the whole file into slices such that only a small number of slices are accessed and checked during k nearest neighbor (kNN) search and 2) efficient handling of insertions of new vectors into the OVA-file, such that the average distance between the new vectors and those approximations near that position is minimized. To facilitate a search, we present an efficient approximate kNN algorithm named ordered VA-LOW (OVA-LOW) based on the proposed OVA-file. OVA-LOW first chooses possible OVA-slices by ranking the distances between their corresponding centers and the query vector, and then visits all approximations in the selected OVA-slices to work out approximate kNN. The number of possible OVA-slices is controlled by a user-defined parameter delta. By adjusting delta, OVA-LOW provides a trade-off between the query cost and the result quality. Query by video clip consisting of multiple frames is also discussed. Extensive experimental studies using real video data sets were conducted and the results showed that our methods can yield a significant speed-up over an existing VA-file-based method and (distance with high query result quality. Furthermore, by incorporating temporal correlation of video content, our methods achieved much more efficient performance","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2006.174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1704805","Video retrieval;high-dimensional data;index structure;kNN.;ordered VA-File;similarity query","Content based retrieval;Costs;Data mining;Feature extraction;Helium;Indexing;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Video recording;World Wide Web","database indexing;query formulation;vectors;video retrieval","content-based video indexing;content-based video retrieval;distributed WWW video resources;hierarchical indexing structure;k nearest neighbor search;ordered VA-file;query vector;video archives;video clip","","26","1","34","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, in gMRBIR, we also make use of relevance feedback and active learning to refine the retrieval result so that it converges to the query concept as fast as possible.

First, each image is coarsely segmented into regions, and visual features are extracted from each region. Second, the regions are categorized using a novel algorithm that performs clustering and feature weighting simultaneously.

Hyperlink analysis, which is capable of measuring the potential information contained in a Web page with respect to the Web space, is gaining more attention. The links to and from Web pages are an important resource that has largely gone unused in existing search engines. Web pages differ from general text in that they possess external and internal structure. The Web links between documents can provide useful information in finding pages for a given set of topics. Making use of the Web link information would allow the construction of more powerful tools for answering user queries. Google has been among the first search engines to utilize hyper links in page ranking. Still two main flaws in Google need to be tackled. First, all the backlinks to a page are assigned equal weights. Second, less content rich pages, such as intermediate and transient pages, are not differentiated from more content rich pages. To overcome these pitfalls, this paper proposes a heuristic based solution to differentiate the significance of various backlinks by assigning a different weight factor to them depending on their location in the directory tree of the Web space","","POD:0-7803-9521-2","10.1109/ICTTA.2006.1684421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1684421","","Computer science;Explosives;Frequency;Gain measurement;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Web pages;Web search","hypermedia;information analysis;search engines","heuristic hyperlink analysis;hyperlink based search engines;page ranking","","0","","12","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the rapid growth of telecommunication, broadcast and information technologies, improved audio compression technology and reduced cost of large storage systems, vast amount of voice data is being collected every day. This paper introduces the concept of a speech analytics server, which comprises a transcription gateway extension to standard voice servers. The gateway handles the tasks which are specific to transcription services and are not currently handled by basic voice servers. In order to enable extensive speech analytics, an interface to an unstructured information management architecture (UIMA) is implemented","","POD:0-7695-2650-0","10.1109/ICDT.2006.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1698508","","Business;Costs;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Manuals;Monitoring;Sections;Speech analysis;Speech processing;TV broadcasting","audio coding;data compression;network servers;speech processing;speech recognition","audio compression technology;speech analytics server;transcription gateway extension;unstructured information management architecture;voice servers","","0","3","","","","29-31 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach, which concentrates on extracting associated expansion terms for a given query so as to improve the retrieval performance, can be divided into three stages. The first stage, called association calculation, is to measure associations between term-term pairs. The second stage focuses on how to select suitable terms for expansion. In the last stage, a reweighting scheme is introduced in order to clarify the impact of each expansion term. Experimental results on the TREC collection demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-2521-0","10.1109/ICPR.2006.703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1699302","","Data mining;Degradation;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Mutual information;Pattern recognition;Performance analysis;Web sites","query processing","TREC collection;association calculation;global analysis;information retrieval;query expansion;reweighting scheme","","1","","10","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Impact of Data Retrieval Pattern on Homogeneous Signal Field Reconstruction in Dense Sensor Networks","M. Dong; L. Tong; B. M. Sadler","QUALCOMM Inc.","IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","20061016","2006","54","11","4352","4364","We analyze the impact of data retrieval pattern on the reconstruction performance of a one-dimensional homogeneous random field measured by a large-scale sensor network. From a networking perspective, we connect data retrieval protocols and different sampling schemes. Specifically, we show that the data retrieval pattern affects the efficiency of reconstruction; as the number of received packets M increases, the deterministic retrieval pattern that schedules sensors to transmit from equally spaced locations results in a faster decay of distortion than the random pattern does. In particular, we show that the ratio of the excess reconstruction distortion under the random retrieval pattern to that under the deterministic one grows as logM+O(loglogM). Comparing the reconstruction performance directly, we further show that, in the high measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, the benefit from carefully scheduling sensor transmissions from specific locations instead of collecting in a random fashion is substantial. In the low SNR regime, however, using the random pattern results in little reconstruction performance loss. Finally, as Mrarrinfin, we show the strong convergence property of reconstruction distortion under the random pattern","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2006.881233","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1710381","Data retrieval;estimation;random field;sampling;sensor network;signal reconstruction","Convergence;Distortion measurement;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Performance loss;Protocols;Sampling methods;Signal to noise ratio","signal reconstruction;signal sampling;wireless sensor networks","SNR;data retrieval pattern;dense sensor networks;homogeneous signal field reconstruction;sampling schemes;sensor transmissions;signal-to-noise ratio","","21","","21","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specially, in distributed environments, where workflow steps are located at different sites, workflows can create an independent and interoperable environment between the scientific applications and databases, when combined with the Web services technology. Web services have been useful as legacy code wrappers, in order to facilitate distributed workflow definition and orchestration. However, there is an increasing need to address workflow intermediate data management. This work presents the In Services system that provides support for bio informatics workflows redefinition. This redefinition enables the user to include specific data management services, according to his needs.
