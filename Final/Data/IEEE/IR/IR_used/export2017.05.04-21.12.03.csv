Despite notable advances in this direction, with continuously accumulating text documents, maintaining up-to-date ordering among documents in the domains of interest is a challenging task. Conventional approaches can produce an ordering that is only valid within a given corpus. Thus, with such approaches, ordering should be completely redone as documents are added to or deleted from the corpus. In this paper, we introduce a corpus- independent framework for rapid ordering of documents in a dynamically changing corpus. Like in many practical approaches, our framework suggests utilizing a similarity measure in some metric space indicating the degree of relevance of a document to the domain of interest. However, unlike in corpus- dependent approaches, the relevance score of a document remains valid with changes being introduced into the corpus (insertion of new documents, for example), thus allowing a rapid ordering within the corpus. This paper particularly details a statistical approach to compute such relevance scores.","2161-5322;21615322","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1968-5; POD:978-1-4244-1967-8","10.1109/AICCSA.2008.4493529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4493529","","Computer science;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Information retrieval;Robustness;Statistics","information retrieval systems","corpus- independent framework;documents rapid ordering;dynamically changing corpus;information retrieval systems;text documents ranking","","0","","26","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While XML supports expressive query languages such as XPath and XQuery, these languages require schema knowledge so as to write an appropriate query which may not be available in distributed systems with autonomous and dynamic sources. Thus, there is a need for approximate query processing. Furthermore, retrieving the top-k results incurs large communication and processing cost, since partial result lists from numerous sites need to be combined and ranked to assembly the top-k answers. To address both of these issues, we present an approach for approximate XPath processing over distributed collections of XML data based on a clustered path index, where data is grouped based on structural information. Our method gradually generalizes a query by applying a set of structural transformations to it and the retrieved results are ranked based on the edit distance between two path expressions. A compact indexing data structure is used to reduce the index construction cost. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly reduces the communication cost for retrieving the top-k results, while maintaining a low construction cost for the clustered index.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497608","","Assembly;Computer science;Costs;Database languages;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Phase measurement;Query processing;Routing;XML","XML;data structures;distributed processing;pattern clustering;query languages","XQuery;clustered index approach;clustered path index;distributed XPath processing;index construction cost;indexing data structure;query languages;schemaless XML data;structural information;top-k queries","","2","","6","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PermJoin is optimized to maximize the early overall throughput and to adapt to fluctuations in data arrival rates. PermJoin is a non- blocking operator that is capable of producing join results even if one or more data sources are blocked due to slow or bursty network behavior. Furthermore, PermJoin distinguishes itself from all previous techniques as it: (1) employs a new flushing policy to write in-memory data to disk, once memory allotment is exhausted, in a way that helps increase the probability of producing early result throughput in multi-join queries, and (2) employs a novel state manager module that adaptively switches operators between joining in-memory data and disk-resident data in order to maximize overall throughput.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497580","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Design optimization;Feedback;Fluctuations;Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Memory management;Switches;Throughput","query processing","PermJoin;data arrival rates;early results;multijoin query plans;network behavior","","2","1","11","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most commonly used information is the distribution of the data itself but the use of dimensional choice based on the information in the query as well as the parameters of the distribution can provide an effective improvement in the query processing speed and storage. The use of this method can produce dimension reduction by as much as a factor of n, the number of data points in the database, over sequential search. We demonstrate that the curse of dimensionality is not based on the dimension of the data itself but primarily upon the effective dimension of the distance function. We also introduce a new distance function that utilizes fewer dimensions of the higher dimensional space to produce a maximal lower bound distance in order to approximate the full distance function.

However, it is often difficult for users to explicitly express their preferences in a way that can be used directly in content-based retrieval systems. A promising approach to overcome the semantic gap between user preferences on the one hand and feature-based, quantitative similarity measures in multimedia databases on the other hand are relevance feedback systems that learn a ranking function through interacting with the user. In each iteration of a feedback loop, database objects marked as relevant are used to derive a new ranking function. To this end we propose to utilize not only the last iteration of relevance feedback but the history of all objects selected as relevant throughout the entire relevance feedback session. Using the same mathematical framework, we also examine reducing the iteration count in exploratory searches via taking the direction of movement through the database into account.","","POD:978-1-4244-2161-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498386","","Content based retrieval;Covariance matrix;Feedback loop;History;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Radio frequency;Shape;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;iterative methods;multimedia databases;relevance feedback","content-based retrieval systems;database objects;feedback loop;multimedia databases;ranking function;relevance feedback;user preferences","","1","","8","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a novel multidimensional querying approach to semi-structured data searches in personal information systems by allowing users to provide fuzzy structure and metadata conditions in addition to traditional keyword conditions. The provided query interface is more comprehensive than content-only searches as it considers three query dimensions (content, structure, metadata) in the search. We have implemented our proposed approach in the Wayfinder file system.

Though most of the algorithms proposed to date select these reference points at random, previous works have shown the importance of intelligently selecting these points for the index performance. However, the proposed pivot selection techniques need to know beforehand the complete database to obtain good results, which inevitably makes the index static. More recent works have addressed this problem, proposing techniques that dynamically select pivots as the database grows. This paper presents a new technique for choosing pivots, that combines the good properties of previous proposals with the recently proposed dynamic selection. The experimental evaluation provided in this paper shows that the new proposed technique outperforms the state-of-art methods for selecting pivots.","","POD:978-1-4244-2161-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498350","","Clustering algorithms;Computational biology;Computer science;Databases;Indexes;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern recognition;Proposals","database indexing","database indexing;dynamic pivot selection technique;pivot-based search algorithm;similarity search;state-of-art method","","0","","7","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm returns an approximate solution when terminated early, as determined by a limiting radius or an internal measure of progress. Given unbounded time the algorithm terminates with an exact solution. Approximate solutions to k-nearest neighbor search provide much needed speed improvement to hard nearest-neighbor problems. Our anytime approximate formulation is well suited for interactive search applications as well as applications where the distance function itself is an approximation.

The semantic matching is performed to compare the similar meanings between ones of failed keyphrases and ones in the knowledge base. Therefore, the failed keyphrases that are matched by semantic matching are recused as keyphrases. The experiments with the summary sentences in 60 articles of IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems and glossaries from four resources are performed in initializing Domain Knowledge Base. Other summary sentences in 100 articles of IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems and in 15 chapters in a Computer Information System textbook are experimented in recovering the failed keyphrases.

In order to unleash this potential, the wealth of information available on the Web needs to be extracted and organized. There is a need for new querying techniques that are simple and yet more expressive than those provided by standard keyword-based search engines. Searching for knowledge rather than Web pages needs to consider inherent semantic structures like entities (person, organization, etc.) and relationships (isA, located In, etc.). In this paper, we propose NAGA, a new semantic search engine. NAGA builds on a knowledge base, which is organized as a graph with typed edges, and consists of millions of entities and relationships extracted from Web-based corpora. A graph-based query language enables the formulation of queries with additional semantic information. We introduce a novel scoring model, based on the principles of generative language models, which formalizes several notions such as confidence, informativeness and compactness and uses them to rank query results. We demonstrate NAGA's superior result quality over state-of-the-art search engines and question answering systems.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497504","","Biological system modeling;Cultural differences;Data mining;Database languages;Informatics;Information retrieval;Instruction sets;Search engines;Web pages;Web sites","Internet;Web sites;graph theory;knowledge based systems;query languages;query processing;search engines","NAGA;Web pages;Web-based corpora;World Wide Web;generative language models;graph-based query language;keyword-based search engines;knowledge base;querying techniques;question answering systems;ranking knowledge;searching knowledge;semantic search engine;state-of-the-art search engines","","6","4","31","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these applications, spatial or temporal search function could provide an effective way for users to retrieve specific GPS tracks they are interested in. However, existing spatial-temporal index for trajectory data has not exploited the characteristic of user behavior in these online GPS track sharing applications. In most cases, when sharing a GPS track, people are more likely to upload GPS data of the near past than the distant past. Thus, the interval between the end time of a GPS track and the time it is uploaded, if viewed as a random variable, has a skewed distribution. In this paper, we first propose a probabilistic model to simulate user behavior of uploading GPS tracks onto an online sharing application. Then we propose a flexible spatio-temporal index scheme, referred to as Compressed Start-End Tree (CSE-tree), for large-scale GPS track retrieval. The CSE-tree combines the advantages of B+ Tree and dynamic array, and maintains different index structure for data with different update frequency. Experiments using synthetic data show that CSE-tree outperforms other schemes in requiring less index size and less update cost while keeping satisfactory retrieval performance.","1551-6245;15516245","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3154-0","10.1109/MDM.2008.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511428","GPS log;GPS track;GeoLife;spatio-temporal indexing","Asia;Conference management;Costs;Frequency;Global Positioning System;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Random variables;Trajectory","Global Positioning System;Internet;database indexing;geographic information systems;probability;query processing;temporal databases;tree data structures;visual databases","B<sup>+</sup> Tree;CSE-tree spatio-temporal indexing scheme;GIS;Web applications;compressed start-end tree;dynamic array;large-scale GPS track retrieval;online sharing application;probabilistic model;query processing;random variable;skewed distribution;user behavior","","9","1","21","","","27-30 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This issue has been studied using adaptive models such as Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), which describe the signal as a weighted sum of basis spectra. However basis spectra representing multiple pitches result in inaccurate transcription. To avoid this, we propose a family of constrained NMF models, where each basis spectrum is expressed as a weighted sum of narrowband spectra consisting of a few adjacent partials at harmonic or inharmonic frequencies. The model parameters are adapted via combined multiplicative and Newton updates. The proposed method is shown to outperform standard NMF on a database of piano excerpts.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-1483-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4517558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517558","Pitch transcription;harmonicity;inharmonicity;nonnegative matrix factorization;spectral smoothness","Content based retrieval;Databases;Frequency;Instruments;Matrix decomposition;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Narrowband;Source separation;Sparse matrices","audio signal processing;harmonics;matrix decomposition","Newton update;inharmonic frequency;inharmonic nonnegative matrix factorization;music signal;narrowband spectra;polyphonic pitch transcription","","32","","15","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a scenario where we integrate a set of such sources, and we pose queries over them, the values needed to access a source may have to be retrieved from other sources that are possibly not even mentioned in the query: answering queries at best can then be done only with a potentially recursive query plan that gets all obtainable answers to the query. Since data sources are typically distributed over a network, a major cost indicator for the execution of a query plan is the number of accesses to remote sources. In this paper we present an optimization technique for conjunctive queries that produces a query plan that: (1) minimizes the number of accesses according to a strong notion of minimality; (2) excludes all sources that are not relevant for the query. We introduce Toorjah, a prototype system that answers queries posed on sources with limitations by means of optimized query plans. Toorjah adopts a strategy that is aimed to retrieve answers as early as possible during query processing, and to present them to the user as they are computed. We provide experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our optimization, by showing the reduction of the number of accesses in a large number of cases.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497413","","Computer interfaces;Computer science;Costs;Data mining;Finance;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Prototypes;Query processing;Scattering","query processing","Internet;data source;query plan optimization;query processing","","13","","18","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we address the problem of each peer choosing the k best pointers to store (in addition to its index pointers) to minimize the average query lookup times. We focus on two popular P2P systems, namely Pastry and Chord: we exploit the inherent structure of these systems to develop efficient, scalable algorithms for optimally choosing the k additional pointers. Simulations with Chord and Pastry demonstrate that our algorithms are very effective in reducing the lookup times significantly. Our approach can be used in tandem with other techniques such as item caching and replication, and is particularly useful for applications such as name services in mobile environments or location services, where we can expect a low churn rate for peers and a relatively higher churn rate for items.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497509","","Acceleration;Costs;Delay;Frequency;IEEE news;IP networks;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Routing protocols","cache storage;peer-to-peer computing;table lookup;telecommunication network routing","Chord P2P system;DHT;Pastry P2P system;average query lookup times;distributed hash tables;peer caching;peer-to-peer systems;routing table;structured P2P systems","","1","","26","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

No connection has ever been made between them to our knowledge, except in our initial paper, However, future practical QIP systems will probably involve ""observed mixtures"", in the BSS sense, of quantum states (qubits), e.g. associated to coupled spins. We here investigate how individual qubits may be retrieved from cylindrical-symmetry Heisenberg-coupled versions of them, and we show the relationship between this problem and classical BSS. We thus introduce a new nonlinear mixture model for qubits, motivated by actual quantum physical devices. We analyze the invertibility and ambiguities of this model. We propose practical data processing methods for (i) estimating the mixing parameter with a maximum likelihood approach and (ii) performing inversion to retrieve the sources. This yields a major extension as compared to our previous paper, not only in terms of considered spin coupling model, but also because we here introduce a much more powerful mixture estimation procedure.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-1483-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4518405","blind source separation;maximum likelihood estimation;quantum information processing;qubits","Antenna measurements;Blind source separation;Data processing;Information processing;Information retrieval;Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation;Quadratic programming;Source separation;Yield estimation","blind source separation;maximum likelihood estimation","BSS;cylindrical-symmetry Heisenberg spin coupling;data processing methods;maximum likelihood blind separation;nonlinear mixture model;quantum information processing;quantum states","","3","","4","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To minimize the data loss, quick replication is important to replace lost redundancy on other nodes in reaction to failures. The popular approach is the availability based replication which uses the individual node availability. However, with the high churn some replicas leave or fail within similar time. As a result, it requires bursty data traffic and sometimes it loses data. This paper explores the time-related replication which uses the information of the session time to prevent the bursty failures. It tries to get the primary replica which has enough time to replace the lost redundancy. Moreover, the sparse replicas spread on the timeline and the number of overlapped replicas lessens as best it can. Results from a simulation study suggest that the time-related replication keep the high data availability with less data copy traffic.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3106-9","10.1109/ICN.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498188","Availability;Peer-to-Peer;Replication","Availability;Broadcasting;Computer networks;Discrete event simulation;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Time measurement;Timing;Traffic control","peer-to-peer computing;storage management","data copy traffic;peer-to-peer storage system;quick replication;time-related replication;wide-area storage systems","","3","","13","","","13-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A regular leaf split is performed only after a series of unsuccessful reinsertion attempts. We expect the forced reinsertions will result in more compact M- tree hierarchies (i.e., more efficient query processing), while the index construction costs should be kept as low as possible. Considering both low construction costs and low querying costs, we examine several combinations of construction policies with reinsertions. The experiments show that forced reinsertions could significantly decrease the number of distance computations, thus speeding up indexing as well as querying.","","POD:978-1-4244-2161-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498352","","Biometrics;Buildings;Costs;Data structures;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Query processing;Routing;Software engineering","database indexing;query processing;tree data structures","data structure;database indexing;forced reinsertion technique;m-tree building method;query processing;regular leaf split","","0","","16","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Koala achieves these low duty cycles by letting the network's nodes sleep most of the time and reviving them through an efficient wake-up strategy whenever the gateway performs a bulk data download. Unlike other systems which consume energy to maintain consistent network state (e.g. routes, sleep schedules, etc.) across the network's nodes, Koala maintains no persistent routing state on the motes. Instead, a basestation calculates the network paths using reachability information collected by the motes. The flexible control protocol (FCP), a protocol we developed, is then used to install this routing information on the network's nodes. This paradigm of operation not only eliminates the overhead of maintaining routing state, but also significantly reduces the complexity of the networking code running on the motes. Results from simulation and an actual implementation on TinyOS 2 indicate that Koala can achieve very low duty cycles under a wide range of download and network sizes.","","POD:978-0-7695-3157-1","10.1109/IPSN.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4505492","Data gathering;duty-cycling;low-power;network wake-up;routing","Communication system traffic control;Computer network reliability;Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Information processing;Information retrieval;Power system reliability;Routing protocols;Sleep;Wireless sensor networks","environmental factors;information retrieval;monitoring;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","Koala;data download;data retrieval;environmental monitoring;flexible control protocol;wireless sensor networks","","52","","28","","","22-24 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although in some cases it can be retrieved by means of ancillary data, in most cases the modulus of the target effective rotation vector must be estimated. A blind technique is proposed for estimating the modulus of the target effective rotation vector that exploits information carried by the chirp rate of scattering centres. A technique based on image segmentation, local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT), and image contrast (IC) maximisation is used in order to extract the scattering centres and estimate their chirp rate.

Conventional file system which has been used for personal computers is the FAT and it is still adopted for most of current portable devices. The major problem of the FAT is overhead due to cluster switching which involves retrieving and updating of cluster connection information saved on the file allocation table. Because of this overhead, response time of file read and write operation cannot be guaranteed in the FAT. This paper proposes the NFAT which guarantees expected response time by reducing cluster switching overhead when it reads and writes data for portable multimedia devices. To verify our proposal, we have implemented a prototype NFAT file system on ARM9 development board and a Secure Digital Card. The experimental results show that the NFAT does not have irregular response time when performing read/write operations. Therefore, the NFAT is suitable file system for mobile devices which have real-time requirements in reading and writing multimedia data.","","POD:978-0-7695-3134-2","10.1109/MUE.2008.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4505749","Cluster Switching Overhead;FAT;NFAT","Buffer storage;Delay;Design engineering;File systems;Flash memory;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Microcomputers;Multimedia systems;Writing","file organisation;mobile computing;multimedia computing;notebook computers","ARM9 development board;FAT file system design;FAT file system implementation;New FAT file system;Secure Digital Card;cluster connection information;file allocation table;mobile multimedia devices;performing read/write operations;portable multimedia devices;reduced cluster switching overhead","","2","","12","","","24-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A color histogram describes the global color distribution of an image. It is very easy to compute and is insensitive to small changes in viewing positions. However, the histogram is not robust to large appearance changes. Moreover, the histogram might give similar results for different kinds of images if the distributions of colors are same in the images. On the other hand, color correlogram is efficiently used for image indexing in content-based image retrieval. Color correlogram extracts not only the color distribution of pixels in images like color histogram, but also extracts the spatial information of pixels in the images. The characteristic of the color Correlogram to take into account the spatial information as well as the distribution of color pixels greatly attracts the researcher for content based image retrieval. In this paper, we propose the image bin (histogram value divisions) separation technique followed by extracting maxima of frequencies and plotting a correlogram. At first, the histogram is first calculated for an image. After that, it is subdivided into four equal bins. Each bin is subdivided into four more bins and for every such subdivision the maxima of frequencies s calculated. This information is stored in the form of a correlogram. The distance between correlogram of the query image with the corresponding correlogram of database images is calculated.

We describe Cyclex, an approach that efficiently executes such repeated IE, by recycling previous IE efforts. Specifically, given a current corpus snapshot U, Cyclex identifies text portions of U that also appear in the previous corpus snapshot V. Since Cyclex has already executed IE over V, it can now recycle the IE results of these parts, by combining these results with the results of executing IE over the remaining parts of U, to produce the complete IE results for U. Realizing Cyclex raises many challenges, including modeling information extractors, exploring the trade-off between runtime and completeness in identifying overlapping text, and making informed, cost-based decisions between redoing IE from scratch and recycling previous IE results. We describe initial solutions to these challenges, and experiments over two real-world data sets that demonstrate the utility of our approach.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497503","","Computer integrated manufacturing;Data mining;Databases;Debugging;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Recycling;Runtime;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","information retrieval;text analysis","Cyclex;evolving text data;information extraction;real-world text corpora;static text corpora","","11","","24","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such routing is particularly challenging in distance-vector networks, where only the shortest-distance information is available to the nodes. We address this challenge by algorithms that retrieve distance-vector information from other nodes in the network, referred to as reference nodes, and exploit it for computing guaranteed area-avoiding paths. Having these paths, the source can direct the packets using loose source routing towards the destination. We lay out the model for area avoidance routing and study several algorithms for calculating area-avoiding paths. In addition, we address the problem of dynamically selecting reference nodes.

Most notably, sequence data represents a polymer; a complex molecule is itself composed of a linear sequence of smaller molecules (monomers). The monomers interact with each other, both with their local neighbors and at long range, forming secondary and tertiary structure.

The above constraint also limits the number of users that can be served in each time slot. In this paper, we propose a new on-demand data broadcast model with modified network coding. Our approach enables a server to encode multiple data items in each time slot, while each mobile user retrieves the data items by decoding the encoded data items with the locally stored data items. Our approach is different from the traditional network coding because each time slot encodes only a subset of data items, which are decided according to identities of the requested and stored data items of users. The simulation results show that our algorithm can reduce the access time by 66% as compared to the traditional schemes.","1551-6245;15516245","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3154-0","10.1109/MDM.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4511450","multi-data;network coding;on-demand broadcast","Broadcasting;Computer network management;Conference management;Engineering management;Environmental management;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Network coding;Network servers","broadcasting;data handling;encoding;mobile computing","mobile computing;multidata delivery;multiple data items;network coding;on-demand data broadcast model","","4","","8","","","27-30 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, information search and retrieval has emerged as a key application area. Text-based search is the most active area, with applications that range from Web and local network search to searching for personal information residing on one's own hard-drive. Speech search has received less attention perhaps because large collections of spoken material have previously not been available. However, with cheaper storage and increased broadband access, there has been a subsequent increase in the availability of online spoken audio content such as news broadcasts, podcasts, and academic lectures. A variety of personal and commercial uses also exist. As data availability increases, the lack of adequate technology for processing spoken documents becomes the limiting factor to large-scale access to spoken content. In this article, we strive to discuss the technical issues involved in the development of information retrieval systems for spoken audio documents, concentrating on the issue of handling the errorful or incomplete output provided by ASR systems. We focus on the usage case where a user enters search terms into a search engine and is returned a collection of spoken document hits.","1053-5888;10535888","","10.1109/MSP.2008.917992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4490200","","Automatic speech recognition;Bandwidth;Computer errors;Content based retrieval;Costs;Digital audio broadcasting;Document handling;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Search engines","audio signal processing;content-based retrieval;search engines;speech recognition","ASR systems;information retrieval systems;search engine;speech search;spoken audio documents;spoken content browsing;spoken content retrieval;text-based search","","59","4","30","","","May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Intuitively, location privacy may be obtained at the cost of query performance and query accuracy. The challenge addressed is how to obtain the best possible performance, subjected to given requirements for location privacy and query accuracy. Existing privacy solutions that use spatial cloaking employ complex server query processing techniques and entail the transmission of large quantities of intermediate result. Solutions that use transformation-based matching generally fall short in offering practical query accuracy guarantees. Our proposed framework, called SpaceTwist, rectifies these shortcomings for k nearest neighbor (kNN) queries. Starting with a location different from the user's actual location, nearest neighbors are retrieved incrementally until the query is answered correctly by the mobile terminal. This approach is flexible, needs no trusted middleware, and requires only well-known incremental NN query processing on the server. The framework also includes a server-side granular search technique that exploits relaxed query accuracy guarantees for obtaining better performance. The paper reports on empirical studies that elicit key properties of SpaceTwist and suggest that the framework offers very good performance and high privacy, at low communication cost.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497445","","Computer science;Costs;Decoding;Information retrieval;Lungs;Middleware;Mobile computing;Nearest neighbor searches;Privacy;Query processing","data privacy;mobile computing;pattern recognition;query processing","SpaceTwist;data privacy;k nearest neighbor queries;kNN queries;location privacy;mobile services;query accuracy guarantees;query performance;query processing;relaxed query;server-side granular search;spatial cloaking;transformation-based matching","","80","","23","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides advantages shared with other P2P-based information retrieval systems, the system has several characteristics that distinguish itself from other systems: First, an adaptive indexing scheme which can dynamically identify important terms is used. Important terms are indexed in a chord-like ring, while other terms are aggregated in a balanced tree. We argue that this architecture is more flexible and suitable for term indexing than DHT-based methods. Furthermore, this structure allows to eliminate the requirement of maintaining global knowledge, and hence we can avoid the difficulty in maintaining such knowledge. Term aggregation is useful not only for performance enhancement, but also for improving the quality of search, by using of the term statistics information obtained via the aggregation. Traditional IR techniques such as query expansion can be utilized based on the information. Therefore, COSTA finely integrates distributed indexing with information retrieval. Advanced techniques, such as node clustering, caching and workload balance, are employed.

DBOM also handles inconsistencies that may be caused by the execution of uncertain mappings. The proposed solution is based on setting preferences over the views and attributes of the views of the mappings. We demonstrate DBOM in the context of a medical informatics application that requires the integration of drug related information into an OWL knowledge base.","","POD:978-1-4244-2161-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498323","","Biomedical informatics;Drugs;Impedance;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Logic;OWL;Ontologies;Relational databases;Semantic Web","knowledge based systems;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);relational databases;semantic Web","DBOM system;OWL knowledge bases;data integration;database ontology mapping system;impedance mismatch problem;mapping language;relational databases;semantic Web compliant knowledge base;tuples","","1","","7","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a possible scenario of application of some reputation techniques to lookup and data retrieval processes in a P2P network based on the popular Kademlia algorithm. Unlike most of existing reputation management systems for DHT-based P2P environments, we don't use a number of successful downloads as the main instrument to evaluate a trustworthiness of peers, but we propose to consider any type of interactions between nodes. This choice is motivated by the fact that file sharing is not a unique service supported by DHT-based P2P systems. There are other application areas for P2P (e.g. collaborative and distributed computing) where it is important to consider such aspects as a risk factor, a ""stay on-line"" time or a number of requests without reply.","","POD:978-1-4244-1784-1","10.1109/NGI.2008.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4510821","","Collaboration;Data security;Distributed computing;Environmental management;File systems;Information retrieval;Instruments;Memory;Peer to peer computing;Routing","file organisation;groupware;peer-to-peer computing;table lookup","DHT-based collaborative environments;DHT-based peer-to-peer networks;Kademlia algorithm;P2P network;data retrieval;file sharing;lookup processes;reputation management systems","","2","","20","","","28-30 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, a similarity query retrieves all data objects in a data set that are similar to a given query object. Previous work on similarity search usually consider the search problem in the full space. In this paper, however, we propose a novel problem, subspace similarity search, which finds all data objects that match with a query object in the subspace instead of the original full space. In particular, the query object can specify arbitrary subspace with arbitrary number of dimensions. Since traditional approaches for similarity search cannot be applied to solve the proposed problem, we introduce an efficient and effective pruning technique, which assigns scores to data objects with respect to pivots and prunes candidates via scores. We propose an effective multipivot-based method to pre-process data objects by selecting appropriate pivots, where the entire procedure is guided by a formal cost model, such that the pruning power is maximized. Finally, scores of each data object are organized in sorted list to facilitate an efficient subspace similarity search. Extensive experiments have verified the correctness of our cost model and demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach for the subspace similarity search.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1837-4; POD:978-1-4244-1836-7","10.1109/ICDE.2008.4497440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4497440","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Data analysis;Data engineering;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Search problems","query processing;search problems","arbitrary subspaces;data object retrieval;multipivot-based method;query object;search problem;similarity query;similarity search","","1","","31","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact, despite the great attention that this primitive has received in traditional and even multidimensional databases, little has been done for general metric databases. We consider a particular type of similarity join: Given two sets of objects and a distance threshold r, find all the object pairs (one from each set) at distance at most r. For this sake, we devise a new metric index, coined List of Twin Clusters, which indexes both sets jointly (instead of the natural approach of indexing one or both sets independently). Our results show significant speedups over the basic quadratic-time naive alternative. Furthermore, we show that our technique can be easily extended to other similarity join variants, e.g., finding the k-closest pairs.","","POD:978-1-4244-2161-9","10.1109/ICDEW.2008.4498353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4498353","","Cleaning;Data mining;Data structures;Databases;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Recruitment;Resumes;Search problems","data structures;database indexing;pattern clustering;query processing","data structure;dataset indexing;k-nearest neighbor search;metric index;metric space model;range query;similarity join algorithms;twin clusters","","0","","13","","","7-12 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an extension of the QBE paradigm to the broad class of natural and environmental sounds, which occur frequently in continuous recordings. We explore several cluster-based indexing approaches, namely non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and spectral clustering to efficiently organize and quickly retrieve archived audio using the QBE paradigm. Experiments on a test database compare the performance of the different clustering algorithms in terms of recall, precision, and computational complexity.

The key novelty of the hashing technique proposed here is that it can be applied to spaces with arbitrary distance measures, including non-metric distance measures. First, we describe a domain-independent method for constructing a family of binary hash functions. Then, we use these functions to construct multiple multibit hash tables. We show that the LSH formalism is not applicable for analyzing the behavior of these tables as index structures. We present a novel formulation, that uses statistical observations from sample data to analyze retrieval accuracy and efficiency for the proposed indexing method.

New distance measures and queries for high dimensional categorical time series are then proposed and efficient query processing techniques for answering these queries are developed. We conducted experiments using our proposed distance measures and queries on human motion capture databases.

It has been widely used in many fields of information processing, such as machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, and pattern recognition. However, the computation of LDA involves dense matrices eigen-decomposition which can be computationally expensive both in time and memory. Specifically, LDA has O(mnt + t<sup>3</sup>) time complexity and requires O(mn + mt + nt) memory, where m is the number of samples, n is the number of features and t = min (m,n). When both m and n are large, it is infeasible to apply LDA. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for discriminant analysis, called Spectral Regression Discriminant Analysis (SRDA). By using spectral graph analysis, SRDA casts discriminant analysis into a regression framework which facilitates both efficient computation and the use of regularization techniques. Our theoretical analysis shows that SRDA can be computed with O(ms) time and O(ms) memory, where s(les n) is the average number of non-zero features in each sample.

In contrast to traditional relational keyword search (R-KwS), an OS comprises a more complete and therefore semantically meaningful set of information about the enquired DS. The proposed paradigm is based on two key concepts: Affinity and Importance. The system investigates and quantifies the Affinity of relations in order to automatically create OSs and OS importance (Im(OS)) in order to rank them. Im(OS)s considers the weight (i.e. pagerank) of tuples, Affinity and size of OS.
