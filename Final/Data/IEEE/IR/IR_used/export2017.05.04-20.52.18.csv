Our method utilizes the machinery of compressive sensing, which allows an under determined system of equations to be approximately solved by l<sub>1</sub>-minimization if the data is a sparse linear combination of an appropriate set of basis vectors. Such sparsity is seen in these correlated databases. If the sparsity is high or if some distortion is permitted in the retrieved data, the data can be retrieved by a reconstruction operation with a constant storage cost independent of the number of records stored. If exact retrieval is needed, some additional storage is required for each record, much smaller than the size of the original record. We illustrate the performance of this method with a database of remote sensing images.","1058-6393;10586393","Electronic:978-1-4244-5827-1; POD:978-1-4244-5825-7","10.1109/ACSSC.2009.5470158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470158","","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Equations;Image coding;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Information systems;Machinery","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;minimisation;visual databases","compact data storage;compressive sensing machinery;content based retrieval;correlated data storage;correlated database;l<sub>1</sub>-minimization;querying technique;sparse linear combination","","5","","10","","","1-4 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important characteristic of conventional content-based recommendation systems is that they use the same ranking list to make recommendations for items in each group, ignoring differences among items inside of a group. The paper proposes a content-based recommendation system built on top of a weighted un-directional graph. The graph describes the content similarity between items based on the semantic relations of their metadata. Neighbors of a node in the graph construct a ranking list of items to be recommended and there is a ranking list for each item. So it is able to emphasize differences among related items.

In this paper, we present two techniques to take such a context into account.

Existing methods usually suggest terms based on statistics in documents as well as query logs and external dictionaries, and they neglect the fact that the topic information is very crucial because it helps retrieve topically relevant documents. To give users gratification, we propose a novel term suggestion method: as the user types in queries letter by letter, we suggest the terms that are topically coherent with the query and could retrieve relevant documents instantly. For effectively suggesting highly relevant terms, we propose a generative model by incorporating the topical coherence of terms. The model learns the topics from the underlying documents based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For achieving the goal of instant query suggestion, we use a trie structure to index and access terms. We devise an efficient top-k algorithm to suggest terms as users type in queries. Experimental results show that our approach not only improves the effectiveness of term suggestion, but also achieves better efficiency and scalability.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6600-9; POD:978-1-4244-6599-6","10.1109/APWeb.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474152","Query Term Suggestion;Top-k Search;Topic Model","Coherence;Computer science;Dictionaries;Explosions;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Scalability;Search engines;Statistics;Web search","document handling;interactive systems;query processing","LDA;Latent Dirichlet allocation;external dictionaries;query term suggestion;relevant documents;top-k algorithm;topic based query terms","","3","2","30","","","6-8 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A rapid proliferation has been witnessed in the fields of both theoretical research and development of the CBIR system. The most commonly used transformation techniques in CBIR include wavelet and Fourier transformations; in spite of their widespread utilization, they have not been very effective in representing the image regions that are separated by smooth contours. An effective alternative, Contourlet Transformation performs well in representing the time-frequency localization of the images. In this paper, we propose a CBIR system for effective retrieval of images from a database for a given query image. The proposed CBIR system utilizes CT to extract the content of the image in terms of directional contours, horizontal and vertical edges of the image. In addition, the system extracts texture, color and spatial features from the images. In image retrieval, the system measures the similarity between the features of the query image and the images in the database using Squared Euclidean distance.

Finally it decides which Web database can be chosen based on the retrieval performance. This method can not only accurately select the Web databases which satisfy the user queries but also improve the speed of the database query and the quality of retrieval.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6389-3; POD:978-1-4244-6388-6","10.1109/ETCS.2010.613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5459955","Web database selection;component;retrieval performance;topic","Books;Computer science;Computer science education;Content based retrieval;Costs;Databases;Educational technology;Engines;Information retrieval;Machine learning","Web sites;information retrieval;query languages;query processing","World Wide Web;database query;deep Web database;retrieval performance;user queries;website characteristics","","0","","11","","","6-7 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Basically the thumbnail and the corresponding image give the multiscale representations of the image. The second is that from visual point of view, it is obvious that salient images would be easier to catch users' eyes and more likely to be clicked than cluttered ones in low-level vision.

To solve the problem, k-dominant skyline queries have been introduced, which can reduce the number of retrieved objects by relaxing the definition of the dominance. Though it can reduce the number of retrieved objects, the k-dominant skyline objects are difficult to maintain if the database is updated.

The impact of this new operating system will not be as dramatic as the move from Windows XP to Windows Vista. However, changes to this operating system mirror many changes in consumer usage of technology and present both opportunities and challenges for investigators. Arguably, the most important challenge to computer forensics examiners is access to the suspect's files on a computer. The introduction of BitLocker, which debuted with Microsoft's Vista operating system, provided a major barrier to investigators because this encryption tool could encrypt at the file, folder or drive level. Further advances to this tool in Windows 7 create even greater barriers to access; Microsoft's BitLocker To Go now goes beyond just hard drive encryption but also encrypts a system's associated devices. This research will also identify changes, which were introduced with Windows 7, and in response to a shift in consumer demand. The most notable shift in consumer demand, found by the authors of this research, is in Microsoft's integrated touch-screen capabilities.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5550-8; POD:978-1-4244-5548-5","10.1109/LISAT.2010.5478284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478284","BitLocker;Windows 7;computer forensics;investigation;operating system","Application software;Authentication;Biometrics;Computer networks;Cryptography;Forensics;Information retrieval;Law enforcement;Mirrors;Operating systems","computer forensics;cryptography;operating systems (computers)","BitLocker;Microsoft Vista;Microsoft Windows 7;computer forensics examinations;encryption tool;operating system","","0","","7","","","7-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Atmospheric correction is a major issue in LST retrieval using remote sensing data because the presence of the atmosphere always influences the radiation from the ground to the space sensor. Atmospheric correction of thermal infrared (TIR) data for land surface temperature retrieval is to estimate the three atmospheric parameters: transmittance, path radiance and the downward radiance. Typically the atmospheric parameters are obtained using atmospheric profiles combined with a radiative transfer model (RTM). But this approach is time-consuming and expensive, which is impractical for high-speed (near-realtime) operational atmospheric correction. An artificial neural network (NN) based atmospheric correction model for Landsat/TM thermal infrared data is proposed. The multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN) is selected, in which the atmospheric profiles (temperature, humidity and pressure), elevation and scan angle are the input variables, and the atmospheric parameters are the output variables. The MFNN is combined with the radiative transfer simulation, using MODTRAN 4.0 and the latest global assimilated data. Finally, the transmittance and path radiance derived by the MFNN-based algorithm is compared with MODTRAN4.0 results. The RMSE for both parameters are 0.0031 and 0.035 W·m<sup>-2</sup>·sr<sup>-1</sup>·μm<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.

Next, a feature vector is obtained from the histogram of the quantized DC coefficients. Then, AC coefficients in the Filter-bank are separated into three main groups indicating horizontal, vertical, and diagonal edge directions, respectively, according to their spatial-frequency properties. Each directional group creates its histogram after employing Otsu binarization technique. Finally, we project each histogram on the horizontal and vertical axes, and generate a feature vector for each group.

In this environment, since an enormous number of sensor devices join the network, it is effective to construct a P2P network for efficient retrieval of sensor data. In general, each sensor device periodically performs sensing based on the cycle set by itself. On the other hand, users often issue queries to acquire sensor data that were sensed at a specific time. In such a case, only the sensor devices (peers) that perform sensing at the specified time have to return their sensor readings. In this paper, we propose a novel P2P network construction method to achieve effective sensor data collection considering queries that specify a certain time. Our method clusters peers which perform sensing simultaneously, and constructs logical links between clusters whose peers sometimes perform sensing at a same time.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6702-0; POD:978-1-4244-6701-3","10.1109/WAINA.2010.163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480919","Cycle of sensing;Peer-to-Peer;Sensor network","Cities and towns;Conferences;Costs;Humans;Information retrieval;Information science;Network servers;Weather forecasting;Web and internet services","peer-to-peer computing;ubiquitous computing","P2P network construction method;sensing cycle;ubiquitous sensor environment","","1","","7","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

WMSNs will be a crucial component of mission-critical networks to protect the operation of strategic national infrastructure, provide support to counteract emergencies and threats, and enhance infrastructure for tactical military operations. To enable these applications, WMSNs require the sensor network paradigm to be re-thought in view of the need for mechanisms to deliver multimedia content with a pre-defined level of quality of service (QoS). In this paper, a new cross-layer communication architecture based on the time-hopping impulse radio ultra wide band technology is described, whose objective is to reliably and flexibly deliver QoS to heterogeneous applications in WMSNs, by leveraging and controlling interactions among different layers of the protocol stack according to applications requirements.

ECON finds a snippet-node by which a part of the content of news is wrapped firstly, then backtracks from the snippet-node until a summary-node is found, and the entire content of news is wrapped by the summary-node. During the process of backtracking, ECON removes noise. Experimental results showed that ECON can achieve high accuracy and fully satisfy the requirements for scalable extraction. Moreover, ECON can be applied to Web news page written in many popular languages such as Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Arabic.

We use a modified Spreading Activation algorithm to identify connections between input concepts. The main challenge in our approach lies in assessing the strength of a relation defined by a link between articles.

It greatly interferes the precision and recall results of the natural language processing(NLP) systems. Currently, TF-IDF term weight algorithm is widely applied into language models to build NLP Systems. Since term frequency is not the only discriminator which is necessary to be considered when calculating the term weight and make it suitable to indicate term importance, we are motivated to investigate other statistical characteristics of terms and found an important discriminator: term distribution. Furthermore, we found that a term with higher frequency and close to hypo-dispersion distribution should be given higher weight than one with lower frequency and close to intensive distribution. Based on this hypothesis, by leveraging the Pearson Chi-square Test Statistic, a Term Distribution based Term Weight Algorithm is put forward in this paper. Also, the experiment results at the end of this paper approve the reliability and efficiency of the algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6598-9; POD:978-1-4244-6597-2","10.1109/NSWCTC.2010.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480657","IDF;Natural Language Processing;TF;Term Weight","Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed computing;Frequency;Information retrieval;Information science;Information security;Space technology;Statistical distributions;Wireless communication","natural language processing","Pearson chi-square test statistic;natural language processing;term weight algorithm","","2","","10","","","24-25 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such it has become increasingly practical to use outsourced database solutions. However, as the service provider may not be fully trusted, XML database outsourcing introduces several security concerns that are new or more complex than those encountered in traditional database implementations. These include: data confidentiality, privacy, secure auditing, query assurance and secure and efficient storage. Of particular importance due to its relevance to most outsourced database models is query assurance - ensuring the database responds correctly to queries. In this paper, we propose the use of temporary time stamps and hash granularity to increase the efficiency of query assurance. This approach is tested against real datasets of varying type and size.

To be effective, general purpose image retrieval systems require images with comprehensive annotations describing fully the content of the image. Much research is being done on automatic image annotation schemes but few authors address the issue of spatial annotations directly. This paper begins with a brief analysis of real picture queries to librarians showing how spatial terms are used to formulate queries. The paper is then concerned with the development of an enhanced automatic image annotation system, which extracts spatial information about objects in the image. The approach uses region boundaries and region labels to generate annotations describing absolute object positions and also relative positions between pairs of objects. A domain ontology and spatial information ontology are also used to extract more complex information about the relative closeness of objects to the viewer.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5561-4; POD:978-1-4244-5560-7","10.1109/ICSIPA.2009.5478621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478621","","Application software;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Signal processing;Terminology","image enhancement;image retrieval;information filtering;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","domain ontology;enhanced automatic image annotation system;general purpose image retrieval systems;image representation;picture queries;spatial information extraction;spatial information ontology","","0","1","25","","","18-19 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve this problem, one common approach is to scan all items of all lists sequentially in parallel until one of the lists is exhausted. However, we observe that if the overlap of items across all lists is not high, such sequential access approach can be significantly improved. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, MergeSkip and MergeESkip, to solve this problem by taking the idea of skipping as many items of lists as possible. As a result, a large number of comparisons among items can be saved, and hence the efficiency can be improved.

The robust model was applied to the RADARSAT-1 SAR satellite at three different modes (Wide-3, High extended-6 and Standard-2). The results of the study were validated using real time in situ current measurements that were acquired by AWAC equipment. It is found that the velocity and direction of the current changed through the period of the study according to the changing of Doppler frequency shift. Onshore sea surface current was modeled from Wide-3 mode varied between 0.22 to 0.25 m/s, while sea surface current velocities extracted from the Extended High-6 and Standard-2 modes were ranged between 0.16 to 0.53 m/s and 0.52 to 0.65 m/s, respectively. The RMS difference between the three RADARSAT-1 SAR images is 0.136, 0.364, and 0.485 in the Standard-2, Wide-3, and Extended High-6 mode, respectively.

At each of these steps, there is a significant amount of information lost, and the resulted visual words are often not discriminative enough for large scale image retrieval applications. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-sample multi-tree approach to computing the visual word codebook. By encoding more information of the original image feature, our approach generates a much more discriminative visual word codebook that is also efficient in terms of both computation and space consumption, without losing the original repeatability of the visual features.

However, Cloud service providers charge users for these services. Specifically, to access data from their globally distributed storage edge servers, providers charge users depending on the user's location and the amount of data transferred. When deploying data-intensive applications in a Cloud computing environment, optimizing the cost of transferring data to and from these edge servers is a priority, as data play the dominant role in the application's execution. In this paper, we formulate a non-linear programming model to minimize the data retrieval and execution cost of data-intensive workflows in Clouds. Our model retrieves data from Cloud storage resources such that the amount of data transferred is inversely proportional to the communication cost. We take an example of an `intrusion detection' application workflow, where the data logs are made available from globally distributed Cloud storage servers. We construct the application as a workflow and experiment with Cloud based storage and compute resources. We compare the cost of multiple executions of the workflow given by a solution of our non-linear program against that given by Amazon CloudFront's `nearest' single data source selection. Our results show a savings of three-quarters of total cost using our model.","1550-445X;1550445X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6696-2; POD:978-1-4244-6695-5","10.1109/AINA.2010.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5474699","Cloud computing;Workflow scheduling;multi-source data retrieval;non-linear programming","Application software;Cloud computing;Computer science;Costs;Data mining;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Laboratories;Software engineering","distributed processing;minimisation;nonlinear programming;security of data","cloud computing;data retrieval minimization;execution cost minimization;globally distributed cloud services;intrusion detection application workflow;nonlinear programming model","","15","","19","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This platform exploits the properties of cluster-based peer-to-peer structured overlays together with a hybrid redundancy schema (a compound of light replication and rateless erasure coding) to guarantee durable access and integrity of data despite adversarial attacks. The triptych ""availability - storage overhead - bandwidth usage"" is evaluated, and results show that despite massive attacks and high churn, DataCube performs remarkably well. We evaluate the performance of the rateless erasure codes implemented in DataCube.

Such an approach makes efficient content distribution possible by making information retrieval host-independent and integrating into the network storage for caching information. Requests for particular content can, thus, be satisfied by any host or server holding a copy. The current security model based on host authentication is not applicable in this context. Basic security functionality must instead be attached directly to the data and its naming scheme. A naming scheme to name content and other objects that enables verification of data integrity as well as owner authentication and identification is here presented. The naming scheme is designed for flexibility and extensibility, e.g., to integrate other security properties like access control. At the same time, the naming scheme offers persistent IDs even though the content, content owner and/or owner's organizational structure, or location change. The requirements for the naming scheme and an analysis showing how the proposed scheme fulfills them are presented. Experience with prototyping the naming scheme is also discussed. The naming scheme builds the foundation for a secure information-centric network infrastructure that can also solve some of the main security problems of today's Internet.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6739-6; POD:978-1-4244-6738-9","10.1109/INFCOMW.2010.5466661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5466661","","Access control;Authentication;Content based retrieval;Context modeling;Data security;Information retrieval;Information security;Intrusion detection;Network servers;Prototypes","Internet;data integrity;information networks;information retrieval;security of data","Internet;content distribution;data integrity verification;host authentication;host independent information retrieval;information centric network infrastructure;information network;naming security","","31","1","16","","","15-19 March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
