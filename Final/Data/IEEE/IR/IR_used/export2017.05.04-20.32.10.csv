Calculating term importance is a significant and fundamental aspect of most information retrieval approaches and it is traditionally determined through inverse document frequency (IDF). We propose concept-based term weighting (CBW), a technique that is fundamentally different to IDF in that it calculates term importance by intuitively interpreting the conceptual information in ontologies. We show that when CBW is used in an approach for Web information retrieval on benchmark data, it performs comparatively to IDF, with only a 3.5% degradation in retrieval accuracy. While this small degradation has been observed the significance of this technique is that 1) unlike IDF, CBW is independent of document collection statistics, 2) it presents a new way of interpreting ontologies for retrieval and 3) it introduces an additional source of term importance information that can be used for term weighting.","","POD:0-7695-2358-7","10.1109/ICCIMA.2005.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540721","","Australia;Computational intelligence;Degradation;Equations;Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;Information technology;Ontologies;Statistics","Internet;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);vocabulary","CBW technique;Web information retrieval;concept-based term weighting;document collection statistics;inverse document frequency;ontology;term importance determination","","0","","19","","","16-18 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within a smart space supported by mobile/pervasive computing a user may request service from the surrogate through a portable SFF (small-for-factor) device (e.g. PDA). Therefore, the one-surrogate-to-many-SFF-clients relationship or asymmetric rendezvous can easily lead to surrogate reception buffer overflow during peak demand periods. In fact, the traffic of requests to a surrogate is tied in with the transient traveler traffic through the smart space, for example, an airport. Once overflow has happened the user cannot benefit from the cyber foraging supported by the infrastructure. The FLC adoptively tunes the surrogate buffer size so that the buffer length always covers the queue length by the given Î” safety margin. In this way the chance of surrogate reception buffer overflow is eliminated, and as a result the asymmetric rendezvous becomes more reliable and dependable, leading to shorter SFF-client/surrogate service roundtrip time.","1935-4908;19354908","POD:0-7695-2367-6","10.1109/ICMB.2005.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1493654","Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC);Internet traffic patterns;dependability;dynamic buffer size tuning;location-aware information retrieval;small-form-factor (SFF) devices","Airports;Buffer overflow;Fuzzy logic;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Personal digital assistants;Pervasive computing;Size control;Space exploration;Traffic control","Internet;buffer storage;client-server systems;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;information retrieval;mobile computing;telecommunication traffic","asymmetric rendezvous;dynamic buffer size tuning technique;fuzzy logic controller;location-aware information retrieval;mobile computing;pervasive computing;small-for-factor device;transient traveler traffic","","0","","12","","","11-13 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Observational analyses of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) and Precipitation Radar (PR) data show that the beam-filling error can be examined in terms of the coefficient of variation (CV, standard deviation divided by mean rain rate) that provides a measure of the spatial variability. Furthermore, the CV of surface rainfall from PR is related to its vertical structure and has some correlation with the TMI 85 GHz brightness temperature (Tb), especially at the high rain rates. Based on these findings, we exploit the 85 GHz spatial variability in the context of a Bayesian-type inversion method for rainfall retrieval. The spatial variability at various domain sizes (thus CV in a vector form) is blended with the sets of multi-channel brightness temperatures (Tb vector) for the Bayesian inversion. The a-priori databases for the inversion are constructed from the collocated TMI and PR observations at the PR resolution. Through synthetic retrievals we demonstrated that the inclusion of CV information of the Tb remarkably improved the rainfall retrieval accuracy by reducing the effect of the rainfall inhomogeneity.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294718","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294718","","Bayesian methods;Brightness temperature;Image analysis;Information retrieval;Microwave measurements;Microwave radiometry;Radar imaging;Radar measurements;Radiometers;Rain","atmospheric techniques;image resolution;image retrieval;millimetre wave imaging;radar imaging;radar resolution;radiometers;radiometry;rain;remote sensing by radar","85 GHz;Bayesian-type inversion method;Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission;beam-filling error;mean rain rate;microwave imager;multichannel brightness temperature;passive microwave radiometers;precipitation radar data;precipitation retrieval;radar resolution;radiometry;rainfall inhomogeneity;rainfall retrieval;spatial variability;standard deviation;surface rainfall;synthetic retrievals","","0","","6","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its aim is to dynamically generate a context-based measure of term significance during retrieval that can be used as an indicator of document relevancy and ultimately contribute to a documents rank score. But the optimal setting of context matching parameters is an important aspect of the technique to ensure effective retrieval. Thus, the goal of this paper is to investigate the use of an evolutionary algorithm for the optimization of context matching parameters and compare its performance to an iterative technique that exhaustively explores combinations of parameters. We show how the most effective settings for parameters are obtained efficiently through the evolutionary algorithm.

We are taking a different approach and believe that today's storage systems need to be fundamental changed to meet these challenges. In this paper, we first discuss the possible changes in storage systems. We then present the intelligence to be included in future storage systems. With the intelligence, a new architecture of storage systems can be formed. The essential concepts to be parts of the future storage systems include active storage, object-based storage, autonomic storage, and application-aware storage.

In order to allow similarities estimations and performing searches, the model is projected into a 5-dimensional space that permits to describe easily the content of multimedia documents.","","POD:0-7695-2358-7","10.1109/ICCIMA.2005.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540733","","Computational intelligence;Encoding;Fuzzy set theory;Information retrieval;Layout;MPEG 7 Standard;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Space technology;Technological innovation","fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;meta data;multimedia computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;search problems;semantic Web","MPEG-7 metadata;description scheme;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy thematic space;high performance search capability;information retrieval;multimedia document;ontology relation;semantic Web","","0","","11","","","16-18 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By partitioning the image into a series of homogeneous regions, the problem of object extraction changes from pixel based to database analysis. A region based approach has distinct advantages over pixel. In particular, it has low dimensionality, is resilient to rotation, shear, and photometric changes, preserves boundaries, gives implied segmentation, provides comprehensive description, has reduced drift, and permits detailed analysis. The method is amenable to the introduction of prior knowledge permitting the simplification of segmentation, which is otherwise an ill-posed problem. Objects are defined as collections of contiguous regions with known statistics, allowing their identification by performing correlations in the database. The interframe difference of region based sequences is high for low-motion scenes due to segmentation noise, but performs consistently better for high motion, making it suitable for tracking. When applied to tracking the method proves robust, occlusion insensitive, and unlike the other techniques, it re-establishes lost lock.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2005.854417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1542085","Image processing;image region analysis;image segmentation;image sequence analysis;object detection;tracking","Data analysis;Data mining;Image analysis;Image databases;Image segmentation;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Photometry;Pixel","feature extraction;image motion analysis;image retrieval;image segmentation;image sequences;object detection;sport;tracking","feature extraction;image processing;image region analysis;image retrieval;image segmentation;image sequence analysis;interactive sport scene;object detection;semantic object tracking","","15","1","24","","","Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our detection approach determines the odd ratio of any two documents, which makes use of the degrees of resemblance of the documents, and graphically displays the locations of similar (not necessary the same) sentences detected in the documents after (i) eliminating non-representative words in the sentences using the stopword-removal and stemming algorithms, (ii) computing the degree of similarity of sentences using a fuzzy set information retrieval approach, and (iii) matching the corresponding hierarchical content of the two documents using a simple tree matching algorithm.

The database retrieval aspect of such systems has received considerable attention, but query processing and the melodic representation have not been examined as carefully. Common methods for query processing are based on musical intuition and historical momentum rather than specific performance criteria; existing systems often employ rudimentary note segmentation or coarse quantization of note estimates. In this work, we examine several alternative query processing methods as well as quantized melodic representations. One common difficulty with designing query-by-humming systems is the coupling between system components. We address this issue by measuring the performance of the query processing system both in isolation and coupled with a retrieval system. We first measure the segmentation performance of several note estimators. We then compute the retrieval accuracy of an experimental query-by-humming system that uses the various note estimators along with varying degrees of pitch and duration quantization. The results show that more advanced query processing can improve both segmentation performance and retrieval performance, although the best segmentation performance does not necessarily yield the best retrieval performance. Further, coarsely quantizing the melodic representation generally degrades retrieval accuracy.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TSA.2005.854088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1561271","Music information retrieval;pitch;pitch quantization;query-by-example;segmentation","Audio databases;Content based retrieval;Degradation;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Natural languages;Quantization;Query processing;Speech processing","audio databases;music;quantisation (signal);query processing","database retrieval;duration quantization;historical momentum;melodic databases;melodic representation;music information retrieval;musical intuition;note segmentation;pitch;quantization;query processing methods;query-by-humming systems;sung queries","","6","","46","","","Jan. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach is to develop a set of conversion rules for XML schema definitions into RDF schema definitions, rather than interpreting the semantics of metadata schemas.

The candidate translations are expected to be both in the title and query-biased summary of searched document. Then we find the intersection substrings of different title pairs (or title-summary pairs) to fix down the possible translation. In translation selection, we determine the possible translation(s) from the candidates by combining substring frequency, inverse translation frequency and top result preferred factor to design the ranking function.

The algorithm appropriately assimilates a priori information on soil moisture content and surface roughness in order to constrain the inversion of theoretical direct models, such as the integral equation method model and the geometric optics model. The a priori information on soil moisture content is obtained through simple lumped water balance models, whereas that on soil roughness is derived by means of an empirical approach. To update prior estimates of surface parameters, when no reliable a priori information is available, a technique based solely on the use of multitemporal SAR information is proposed. The developed retrieval algorithm is assessed on the Matera site (Italy) where multitemporal ground and ASAR data were simultaneously acquired in 2003. Simulated and experimental results indicate the possibility of attaining an accuracy of approximately 5% in the retrieved volumetric soil moisture content, provided that sufficiently accurate a priori information on surface parameters (i.e., within 20% of their whole variability range) is available.

Second, it is shown how to retrieve high quality data sources in a particular subject domain. For demonstration purposes, the examples in the article are based on a user searching for hotels. Third, the author also describes how search agents are able to query and analyze the content of the retrieved pages with the aid of ontologies. In contrast to the ""wrapper"" technique which is commonly used by most of the available applications to extract data of a known Web site, ontologies offer more flexibility, adaptability and robustness. Fourth, it is shown how the results of different sources are merged and presented as valuable data to the user. Users' benefits are more accurate query definitions in a given domain, delegation of time-consuming search tasks to search agents and comparable search results of higher quality","","POD:1-4244-0049-X","10.1109/EURCON.2005.1630148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630148","categorization;ontology;text analysis;web searching","Consumer electronics;Content based retrieval;Data mining;HTML;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Robustness;Semantic Web;Text analysis;Web pages","Web sites;hypermedia markup languages;information needs;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines;semantic Web;text analysis","HTML;Web pages ontology;Web searching;Web sites;categorization;information needs;ontology-supported information retrieval;search agents;semantic Web ontology;text analysis","","1","","7","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this, a semantic refiner is proposed. This refiner acts as a specialist in information sciences and prepares, using linguistic resources, an appropriate search strategy that represents the user's information need. The semantic refinement consists on three steps. First, it guides the user for sense disambiguation of the words submitted by him. Then, it allows the user to select concepts hierarchically related to reduce the amount of documents to retrieve. Finally, it expands semantically concepts to increase the amount of documents to be retrieved.

The performance metric used in the design is energy efficiency defined as the ratio of the average number of bits reliably retrieved by the access point and the total amount of energy consumed. We demonstrate that opportunistic strategies that use channel state information may not be optimal when channel acquisition at individual sensors consumes substantial energy. We then propose a distributed opportunistic transmission protocol using a combination of carrier sensing and backoff strategy that incorporates channel state information of individual sensors. By selecting a set of sensors with the best channel states to transmit, the proposed protocol achieves the upper bound on energy efficiency when the signal propagation delay is negligible. This protocol provides a distributed solution to the general problem of finding maximum/minimum. It can also be extended to solve the problem of network lifetime maximization.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-8874-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1415797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1415797","","Access protocols;Channel state information;Computer network reliability;Costs;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Measurement;Mobile computing","access protocols;channel estimation;information retrieval;power consumption;wireless sensor networks","backoff strategy;carrier sensing;channel state information;cluster heads;distributed information retrieval;distributed opportunistic transmission protocol;energy efficient information retrieval;mobile access points;performance metric;sensor networks;signal propagation delay;upper bound","","2","","10","","","18-23 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to realize fresh information retrieval, we need not only to collect documents in a short time, but also to rank the results in the suitable order. However, conventional ranking methods are not suited for fresh information retrieval because they ignore temporal value of information. So, we have proposed the novel ranking method FTFIDF for fresh information retrieval. FTFIDF extends TF-IDF by means of using FTF (fresh term frequency) instead of TF (term frequency). FTF differs from TF because FTF decreases as time goes. The speed of decreasing FTF is determined by the dumping factor. The dumping factor is sensitive against small changes of documents. So, we use a threshold to ignore such small changes. In some papers we published, we detect the optimal threshold manually. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive calculating method in order to detect threshold automatically. In this method, the optimal value is determined by iterating to test generated thresholds.

From Web searches to text summarization good keywords are a necessity. In a typical IR system algorithms are used which require the entire document collection to be built beforehand. While some research has been done on extracting keywords from a single document, the quality of the keywords was not based on how well they perform in IR tasks. Moreover, they are designed for only one language and the applicability to other languages is unknown. As such, this paper proposes a new algorithm that is applicable to multiple languages and extracts effective keywords that, to a high degree, uniquely identify a document. It needs only a single document to extract keywords and does not rely on machine learning methods. It was tested on a Japanese-English bilingual corpus and a portion of the Reuter's corpus using a keyword search algorithm.

For this purpose, many IR systems can modify query terms by estimating the user's information need. However, because modified query terms are usually represented in a complicated form, it is difficult to judge how appropriate they are. In this research, we assume all relevant documents should contain words that correspond to concepts that the user would like to retrieve. Therefore, a Boolean query formula is one good way to represent a user's information need with high readability. To find the required concepts in a relevant document set, we have previously proposed a new IR system that calculates appropriate generalized concepts to represent the user's need.

Our model makes use of a user modeling agent (UMA), a facilitator and integrator (FACINT) module and a number of retrieval agents. UMA is responsible for creating a user profile. Actual retrieval is done by retrieval agents. FACINT is responsible for controlling and coordinating activities of various agents. It also does final ranking of the documents based on conceptual graph (CG) representation of documents. The use of CG brings semantics in making relevance judgment resulting in improved ranking.

It is shown by experiment that along with document accretion and Web site quantity increase, the obvious advantage is attained in parallel system.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526920","Information retrieval;Mobile agent;Multi agents;Parallel framework;Serial framework","Communication system control;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile agents;Mobile robots;Robotics and automation;Search engines;Space technology;Uniform resource locators","Internet;information retrieval;mobile agents;multi-agent systems;search engines","Internet;Web site;information retrieval system;information searching engine;mobile agent;multi agents;parallel system;robot searching","","1","","6","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In traditional IR approaches the relevance of the results is determined only by analysing the underlying information repository (content and hyperlink structure), which leads to the weak relevance model. On the other hand, in the ontology-based IR the querying process is supported by an ontology such that other important sources for determining the relevance of results can be considered: the structure of the underlying domain and the characteristics of the searching process. In this paper we present a novel approach for determining relevance in ontology-based searching for information, which exploits the ""full potential"" of the semantics of such a semantically-based link structure.","","POD:0-7695-2415-X","10.1109/WI.2005.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517872","","Automobiles;Data mining;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Logic;Ontologies;Performance analysis;Terminology;Uncertainty;Vocabulary","hypermedia;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","hyperlink structure;information repository;ontology-based information retrieval;ontology-based searching;querying process;semantically-based link structure","","1","","10","","","19-22 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach combines conventional full-text search with semantic retrieval methods on the basis of a learning probabilistic ontology, which abstracts and condenses an information space. New ontological concepts are generated by observing users information filing behaviour when creating bookmarks. The various access mechanisms offered are integrated into one consistent user interface. The main feature of the user interface is the visualization of the ontology. This allows browsing on a structural level, the contextualization of full-text search results by the concepts of the ontology and supports the visual construction of semantic queries for an accurate search. By using these tools, an information need can be iteratively specified more precisely. Extensive user testing shows performance advantages of the interface and attests usefulness in the application area.

There are two areas where NLP is used: in the user-MAS interaction and in the process of resource indexing and matching. These two areas map to the Q/A-agent and to the I-agents. We propose using a lightweight head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) natural language method for the Q architectural layers and qualitatively justify its applicability.

However, conventional ranking methods are not suited for fresh information retrieval because they ignore temporal value of information. So, we have proposed the novel ranking method FTF-IDF for fresh information retrieval. FTF-IDF extends TF-IDF by means of using FTF (fresh term frequency) instead of TF (term frequency). FTF differs from TF because FTF decreases as time goes. The speed of decreasing FTF is determined by the dumping factor. The dumping factor is sensitive against small changes of documents. So, we use a threshold to ignore such small changes. In some papers, we published, we detect the optimal threshold manually. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive calculating method in order to detect threshold automatically. In this method, the optimal value is determined by iterating to test generated thresholds.

In the proposed method, feature terms are first extracted from Web documents for each category in the source and target languages. Then, one or more corresponding categories in the other language are determined beforehand by comparing similarities between categories across languages. Using these category pairs, we can resolve ambiguities in simple dictionary translations. In this paper, we propose a query disambiguation method for CLIR using Web directories.

However, these retrieval methods do not consider the existence probability of target objects on a network. In this paper, we propose a new retrieval method that is flexibly adapted to the existence probability of target objects and to specified requirements of discovery probability, search time, and traffic level. This proposed method is a single query action based on an autonomous distributed network that freely changes the weight between network traffic and discovery probability according to retrieval requirements. The simulation results reveal that network traffic can be decreased by setting appropriate values for the energy and division probability of query messages with little reduction in the discovery probability of the retrieval target object.","1555-5798;15555798","POD:0-7803-9195-0","10.1109/PACRIM.2005.1517329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517329","","Information retrieval","information networks;information retrieval","autonomous distributed network;discovery probability;division probability parameters;energy control;flooding method;network administrators;network information retrieval method;network traffic reduction;query messages;retrieval target object;search time;single query action","","1","","3","","","24-26 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Improvements in this field are mainly sought at the core level of the engine's classification capabilities and by query enhancement processes. The later one became the prime interest of researchers since less progress has been made on the former one. Both make substantial use of manual interventions, which results in a less automated overall process. In this paper, we propose a new model based on the self-organizing map paradigm to discover the concepts embedded in a collection of documents. The terms of the corpus are directly classified into concepts, without manual category labelling. Then the concepts serve as a new knowledge representation for information retrieval. This model has been tested on a TREC-6 subcollection (text retrieval conference). As expected, the retrieval using the concepts representation does not outperform the corresponding full term retrieval. It is a step toward terms classification using a self-organizing map and contributes to fully automate the discovery of concepts in text collections.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9048-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556112","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556112","","Artificial neural networks;Bidirectional control;Computer science;Electronic mail;Indexing;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Labeling;Psychology;Testing","classification;information retrieval;knowledge representation;self-organising feature maps","TREC-6 subcollection;concept classification;concept representation;embedded concept discovery;information classification;information retrieval;knowledge representation;selective information recovery;self-organizing map;term classification;text document collection;text retrieval conference","","1","","18","","","31 July-4 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper focuses on the approximate information retrieval approach to solve the heterogeneity problem of both common ontologies as well as fuzzy ontologies on the semantic Web. Approximate information retrieval needs to find approximations of concepts. However, current methods cannot find the best approximations of concepts for common ontologies, and there is still no published work for fuzzy ontologies. This paper firstly proposes a method of approximate information retrieval between common ontologies. It defines multielement least upper bounds and multielement greatest lower bounds, and then simplifies the multielement bounds to remove redundancy. It provides effective algorithms to find the simplified multielement bounds, and get the best approximations of concepts from the bounds. Then for the fuzzy ontologies, the paper defines cut concepts to transform fuzzy concepts into common concepts, and then applies the proposed method for approximate information retrieval between fuzzy ontologies. The improved algorithms for fuzzy ontologies are given to make the method more feasible and effective","","POD:0-7695-2378-1","10.1109/CW.2005.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1587592","","Computer science;Computer science education;Educational technology;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Information systems;Laboratories;Ontologies;Software quality;Upper bound","approximation theory;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","fuzzy ontology;multielement greatest lower bound;multielement least upper bound;ontology heterogeneity;ontology-based information retrieval;semantic Web","","2","","10","","","23-25 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the machine knows what semantic data, not syntactic, is being provided on a Web page, then it can present the user with richer information and more accurate search results. A solution is to make use of the technologies that aim to achieve the vision of the 'the semantic Web' technology. This research is to use meta data (XML) in Web pages and manipulating it using RDF, through aids from an ontology and intelligent agents would make information content machine understandable and facilitate search facilities.","","POD:1-84600-002-5","10.1109/CSCWD.2005.194215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504122","","Hydrogen;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Keyword search;Mechanical engineering;Natural languages;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Search engines;Web pages","XML;information retrieval systems;meta data;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query formulation;semantic Web","RDF;Web page;Web surfer;XML;agent related intelligent search technology;information content machine;information retrieval system;intelligent agent;meta data;ontology;resource description framework;search query;semantic Web technology","","0","","4","","","24-26 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Probabilistic Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanism: The Model and Its Evaluation for Information Retrieval","F. Diaz-Hermida; D. E. Losada; A. Bugarin; S. Barro","Dept. of Electron. & Comput. Sci., Univ. of Santiago de Compostela","IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","20051010","2005","13","5","688","700","In this paper, we propose a new quantifier fuzzification mechanism which is deeply rooted in the theory of probability. This quantifier fuzzification mechanism skips the nested assumption, which is inherent to other probabilistic quantification methods. The new quantification approach complies with the properties required for determiner fuzzification schemes (DFS) with finite sets and, hence, its good behavior is assured. Moreover, this new approach is suitable for some application domains. In particular, the use of fuzzy quantifiers for implementing query quantified statements for information retrieval exemplifies the adequacy of the new proposal. The new quantifier fuzzification mechanism has been efficiently implemented and empirically tested for a retrieval task. This practical evaluation followed the standard methodology in the field of information retrieval and was conducted against a popular benchmark consisting of a large collection of documents. The retrieval performance evaluation made evident that: 1) the new method can work in realistic scenarios, and 2) it can overcome recent proposals for applying fuzzy quantifiers in information retrieval","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2005.856557","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1516158","Fuzzy quantification;information retrieval;quantifier fuzzification mechanisms","Benchmark testing;Database languages;Expert systems;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Helium;Hybrid intelligent systems;Information retrieval;Proposals","fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;probability;query processing","determiner fuzzification schemes;finite sets;information retrieval;probabilistic quantifier fuzzification mechanism;query quantified statements","","16","","31","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It combines the extant MACSC (model for adaptive cache size control) and the novel RTPD (real-time traffic pattern detection) capability. Similar to its MACSC predecessor, the new RTPD/MACSC tuner maintains the given cache hit ratio consistently and persistently. It, however, differs from its predecessor because it adapts itself to compensate for the ill effects on the cache hit ratio by the Internet traffic, which embeds various patterns over time. The automatic adaptation (self-tuning) capability in response to traffic pattern changes detected by the RTPD is called self-reconfiguration in the RTPD/MACSC context","","POD:0-7695-2316-1","10.1109/ICITA.2005.301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1488924","Internet traffic patterns;RTPD/MACSC;dynamic cache size tuning;hit ratio;popularity ratio","Adaptive control;Bandwidth;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Partial response channels;Programmable control;Switches;Traffic control;Tuners","Internet;cache storage;information retrieval;real-time systems;telecommunication traffic","Internet traffic;RTPD-MACSC model;cache size tuning;information retrieval;model for adaptive cache size control;real-time traffic pattern detection","","0","","13","","","4-7 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semantic indexing for instructional videos can be achieved by combining the analysis of the instructor's handwriting in the video with domain knowledge taken from course support materials such as the course textbook, syllabus, or slides. We propose such a semantic indexing method, by combining handwritten word recognition with information retrieval techniques. We first present a novel handwritten word segmentation and recognition approach for instructional videos. Then we construct a table-of-contents (TOC) structure from course materials. We use word recognition results to query the TOC, implemented as matrix operations, and spot the most likely discussed chapters and topic words for each video. We evaluate the overall approach on 12 videos of two courses, and the results are encouraging","1945-7871;19457871","POD:0-7803-9331-7","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521574","","Character recognition;Computer science;Databases;Handwriting recognition;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Text recognition;Vocabulary","database indexing;educational courses;handwritten character recognition;information retrieval;video databases","TOC;course support material;digital video retrieval;handwritten word recognition;information retrieval technique;instructional video database;instructors handwriting;matrix operation;semantic indexing;table-of-contents structure","","2","","7","","","6-6 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While these measures work well in closed-laboratory environments, they are not suitable for practical IR systems such as Web search systems. Many single-value measures were proposed to improve over the precision-recall measure, such as expected search length (ESL), average search length (ASL) and RankPower. We compare in this paper the measures of ESL, ASL, and RankPower applied to a set of real Web retrieval data. The results demonstrate that RankPower indeed is a feasible, effective, and easy-to-use single-value measure for performance of practical IR systems such as Web search engines","","POD:0-7695-2497-4","10.1109/ITNG.2006.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1611660","Web search;information retrieval;performance measurement;user preference;user studies","Computer science;Feedback;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Length measurement;Mars;Particle measurements;Performance analysis;Search engines;Web search","Internet;information analysis;information retrieval systems","RankPower;Web information retrieval;average search length;expected search length;information retrieval systems;single-value measurement","","1","","5","","","10-12 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
