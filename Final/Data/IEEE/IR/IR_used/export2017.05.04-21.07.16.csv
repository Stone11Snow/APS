A multidimensional linear Time-Frequency (TF) decomposition is used to analyze the intrinsic polarimetric behavior of different components of an urban area. A TF signal model, adapted to the case of urban areas, is proposed and studied using relevant statistical descriptors. A TF classification procedure is introduced to retrieve building location and characterize their polarimetric response, and applied to fully polarimetric SAR data acquired by the E-SAR sensor at L-band. Multiple POL-inSAR signals, acquired from different positions, are used to estimate the height of buildings using the interferometry principle. High-performance array signal processing techniques are adapted to the case multi-baseline POL-InSAR (MBPI) observations, in order to enhance the height estimation of scatterers by calculating optimal polarization combinations and determining their scattering characteristics. These multidimensional spectral estimation methods are shown to resolve the building layover problem by extracting and analyzing two components within one azimuth-range resolution cell.","","POD:978-1-4244-2688-1","10.1109/MRRS.2008.4669583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669583","","Information retrieval;Interferometry;L-band;Multidimensional systems;Remote sensing;Scattering;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spectral analysis;Time frequency analysis;Urban areas","array signal processing;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","POL-inSAR data;array signal processing techniques;azimuth-range resolution cell;multi-baseline POL-inSAR observations;multidimensional linear time-frequency decomposition;polarimetric SAR data;relevant statistical descriptors;remote sensing;spectral analysis methods;synthetic aperture radar;urban areas","","2","","13","","","22-24 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the former are based on gathering actual data in central repositories, the latter allow data to remain in the original databases. There still exist several issues to be tackled in query translation, mainly if no ad-hoc schema is described, such as problems with scalability and query processing.

Clustering is employed to achieve energy efficiency in battery powered WSNs and facilitate collaborative processing that promises to improve classification accuracy. Since clustering is an NP-hard problem, particle swarm optimization (PSO), a stochastic optimization technique emulating the behavior of a flock of birds, is used to search for the optimal cluster formation. In addition, a simple yet effective cluster number estimate technique is put forward, which takes into account the maximum communication range.

In O-VSM, ontology can be expressed in graph and the semantic correlation of terms can be measured via the ontology graph.

Among various famous pattern matching algorithms, the Aho-Corasick (AC) can match multiple pattern strings simultaneously with worst-case performance guarantee and is adopted in both Clam antivirus (ClamAV) and Snort intrusion detection open sources. The AC algorithm is based on finite automaton which can be implemented straightforwardly with a two-dimensional state transition table. However, the memory requirement prohibits such an implementation when the total length of the pattern strings is large. The ClamAV implementation limits the depth of the finite automaton and combines with linked lists to reduce memory requirement. The banded-row format is adopted to compress the state transition table and used as an alternative pattern matching machine in Snort. In this paper we present a novel implementation which requires small memory space and achieves high throughput performance. Compared with the banded-row format, our proposed scheme achieves 39.7% reduction in memory requirement for 5,000 patterns randomly selected from ClamAV signatures. Besides, the processing time of our proposed scheme is, on the average, 83.9% of that of the banded-row format for scanning various types of files. Compared with the ClamAV implementation with the same 5,000 patterns and files, our proposed scheme requires slightly more memory space but achieves 80.6% reduction in processing time on the average.","1095-2055;10952055","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2390-3; POD:978-1-4244-2389-7","10.1109/ICCCN.2008.ECP.176","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674335","","Automata;Data structures;IP networks;Information retrieval;Information security;Internet;Intrusion detection;National security;Pattern matching;Throughput","computer networks;finite automata;pattern matching;telecommunication security","Aho-Corasick algorithm;Clam antivirus;Snort intrusion detection;finite automaton;network security;pattern matching;pattern string;state transition table","","0","","12","","","3-7 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Retrieval is based on a recently proposed distance measure between probability density functions (pdfs), which can be computed in closed form for GM models. The proposed approach takes advantage of the form of this distance measure and updates it very efficiently based on the models of the user specified relevant and irrelevant images.

In this paper, we present a scalable framework for such a purpose, which is different from traditional approaches to exploring correlation among concepts in image/video annotation domain. For each concept, a model based on feature distribution is built using sample images collected from the Internet. And similarity between concepts is measured with the similarity between their models. Hereby, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is employed to model each concept and two similarity measurements are investigated. Experimental results on 13,974 images of 16 concepts collected through image search engines have demonstrated that the similarity between concepts is very close to human perception. In addition, the entropy of GMM cluster distributions can be a good indication of selecting concepts for image/video annotation.","","POD:978-1-4244-2294-4","10.1109/MMSP.2008.4665152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4665152","","Computational complexity;Content based retrieval;Entropy;Humans;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Natural language processing;Shape","Gaussian processes;content-based retrieval;multimedia systems;search engines;semantic Web;video retrieval","GMM cluster distributions;Gaussian mixture model;Internet;concept similarity;image search engines;image-video annotation domain;language modeling;multimedia information retrieval;natural language processing;semantic similarity","","2","","20","","","8-10 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are existing parallel algorithms for performing such tasks, which generally utilize multidimensional tree structures and thus are subjected to the performance of multidimensional trees.

We instrumented a network with probes. The probes collect all the data from the network into a ringbuffer and index it, making it possible to either quickly retrieve flows and packets associated to them for further analysis. Our software then extracts and visualizes causal relationships between the events. The causal relationship extraction and communication pattern detection proved to be an effective method for pinpointing the cause of network system failures, understanding security risks and managing complexity. Our research prototype demonstrates a method for making problem solving faster and more systematic.

Firstly, HSI Color moments in the original region where two corresponding SIFT feature points are detected are extracted from both the query image and the database image and then matched with each other. Secondly, color moments in both diffusion regions are extracted and matched as well.

Modern examples include address-lookup in network routers for a forwarding outgoing link, rule-matching in intrusion detection systems comparing incoming packets with a large database, etc. Hashing algorithms involve transforming a key inside each target data to a hash value hoping that the hashing would render the database a uniform distribution with respect to this new hash value. When the database are already key-wise uniformly distributed, any regular hashing algorithm would easily lead to perfectly uniform distribution after the hashing. On the other hand, if records in the database are instead not uniformly distributed, then different hashing functions would lead to different performance. This paper addresses the case when such distribution follows a natural negative linear distribution, which is found to approximate distributions in many various applications. For this distribution, we derive a general formula for calculating the distribution variance produced by any given non-overlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing function. Such a distribution variance from the hashing directly translates to performance variations in searching. In this paper, the best XOR hashing function is determined for any given key size and any given hashing target size.","","POD:1-59593-082-5","10.1145/1095890.1095919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675280","address lookup;computer networks;hashing;internet;intrusion detection;network security;packet matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Computer security;Distributed databases;IP networks;Information retrieval;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Permission;Secure storage","computer networks;file organisation;information retrieval;statistical distributions","computer network;large database search;linearly distributed address lookup;natural negative linear distribution;nonoverlapped bit-grouping XOR hashing algorithm;uniform distribution","","3","","10","","","26-28 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under this assumption, a novel recommendation technique is proposed that combines the users' item preferences and the additional taxonomic preferences together to make better quality recommendations as well as alleviate the cold-start problem. Empirical evaluations to this approach are conducted and the results show that the proposed technique outperforms other existing techniques in both recommendation quality and computation efficiency.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:978-0-7695-3440-4","10.1109/ICTAI.2008.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669763","Recommender;Taxonomy","Artificial intelligence;Australia;Collaboration;Electronic commerce;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Information technology;Permission;Recommender systems;Taxonomy","information filtering","cold-start problem;information source;item taxonomy preference;recommendation making;recommender system performance;user item preference","","9","","12","","","3-5 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent researches on multi-scale analysis, especially the curvelet research, provide good opportunity to extract more accurate texture feature for image retrieval. Curvelet was originally proposed for image denoising and has shown promising performance. In this paper, a new image feature based on curvelet transform has been proposed. We apply discrete curvelet transform on texture images and compute the low order statistics from the transformed images. Images are then represented using the extracted texture features.

All DHTs are characterized by desirable features such as scalability, fault tolerance, and self organization. Each DHT node is responsible for maintaining a subset of the stored information, which depends on the specific DHT algorithm. Many Internet-based applications strongly rely on a location service (LS), such as DNS, in order to map a URI to one or more IP addresses (and port numbers) that specify where the resource identified by the URI can actually be accessed. However, location services typically introduce centralization points into the architectures they are used in and therefore expose the overall system to possible failures. Because of their nature, DHT appear to be a perfect mean for setting up a distributed location service (DLS). In this paper we present a Java-based framework that can be used for building a DLS independent from the specific DHT algorithm and communication protocol adopted.","","CD-ROM:978-953-290-009-5; POD:978-953-6114-97-9","10.1109/SOFTCOM.2008.4669495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669495","","Buildings;Computer architecture;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Java;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Scalability;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;Java;cryptography;fault tolerance;file organisation;information retrieval;information storage;peer-to-peer computing;protocols","DHT-based distributed location service;IP addresses;Internet-based applications;Java-based framework;communication protocol;distributed hash tables;fault tolerance;information retrieval;information storage;structured peer-to-peer systems","","6","","10","","","25-27 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional CBR ranks cases according to their similarity value and returns a small number of top-ranked cases in response to the query. Since in general the retrieved cases are very well matched to the input user query, there is a high probability that they are also strongly similar to each other, and hence the range of choice offered in the retrieved list is limited. As a response to this issue, some recent research has considered methods to increase the intra-dissimilarity or diversity of the retrieved set. In this paper, we study this problem in detail. We argue that the motivation of diversity strategies is to increase the probability of retrieving unusual or novel cases and introduce a methodology that allows their performance in terms of novel case retrieval to be evaluated. Moreover, we formulate the trade-off between diversity and matching quality as a binary optimisation problem, with an input control parameter allowing explicit tuning of this trade-off. We study solution strategies to the optimisation problems and demonstrate the importance of the control parameter in obtaining desired system performance.

Clustering is the problem of partitioning a set of data using unsupervised techniques. An important characteristic of a clustering technique is the shape of the cluster it can find. Clustering methods which are capable to find simple cluster shapes are usually fast but inaccurate for complex data sets. Ones capable to find complex cluster shapes are usually not fast but accurate. In this paper, we propose a simple clustering technique named circlusters. Circlusters are circles partitioned into different radius sectors. Circlusters can be used to create hybrid approaches with density based or partitioning based methods.

Then, the indexing scheme is applied to give the video database a manageable structure. Being able to handle dynamic video clip insertions and deletions is an essential part of this solution. At the beginning, an ordinary kd-tree is created for the initial database. As new video traces are added to the database, they will be added to the indexing tree structure as well. A tree node will be split if its size exceeds a certain threshold. If the tree structure un-balance level exceeds a threshold, merging and re-splitting will be performed.

The proposed algorithm stops automatically by utilizing outlier information and adopts the concept of core group to reduce the influence of parameter on the clustering result.

The features, obtained from wavelet coefficients and their Lipschitz exponents, have the characteristics that they are independent of the directions and the scales of curves, and consist of only with 1 global fractal dimension and 2 local fractal dimensions. The atlas database, therefore, can be created with smaller capacity and the result curves can be retrieved from it quickly.

In this paper we use fibre channel RAIDs and study how to decease I/O mean response time by software pipelining, so to enable the overlapping of different phases of the operation such as fibre channel transfer and disk access. Calculations and tests show that software pipelining can decrease I/O mean response time effectively. Further, we discuss the speedup of mean response time that is mainly influenced by two parameters: concurrent I/O request number and request data size","","POD:0-7695-2581-4","10.1109/IMSCCS.2006.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4673570","","Delay;Information retrieval;Network servers;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber testing;Pipeline processing;Processor scheduling;Software testing;Storage area networks;Throughput","RAID;pipeline processing;radiofrequency identification;scheduling;storage area networks","I-O mean response time;disk access;fibre channel RAID;fibre channel transfer;software pipeline scheduling;storage area network;storage device","","0","","6","","","20-24 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scheduling the workers is hard because there are many tasks and the number of the workers is not sufficient. To tackle this problem, KT had transformed the field workers into ubiquitous workers and used work team based scheduling system. However, this approach was not sufficient to reduce frequent worker's arrival time changes and to increase operational efficiency. Therefore, we proposed individual worker scheduling system for managing the worker's schedule efficiently. We also developed an optimal worker selection algorithm based on statistical information when an operator assigns a task to the worker.","","POD:978-0-7695-3407-7","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682085","realtime;scheduling;u-Worker","Dynamic scheduling;Humans;Information retrieval;Information technology;Laboratories;Real time systems;Routing;Telecommunications;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles","human resource management;personnel;scheduling;statistical analysis;team working","U-worker scheduling system;field worker;optimal worker selection algorithm;statistical information;telecom;ubiquitous worker;work team","","0","","7","","","11-13 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also innovatively use a wavelet image enhancement algorithm to enhance original terrain texture, which obtain richer edge information and give us a more realistic effect in terrain rendering. Through the analysis of storage efficiency and rendering speed of our experiment, this dual-cache structure based method solves rendering speed and memory limit problems perfectly.","2158-2181;21582181","POD:978-1-4244-1675-2","10.1109/RAMECH.2008.4681477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4681477","Dual-cache structure;Image enhancement;Large scale texture mapping;Quadtree;Virtual reality","Frequency;Image enhancement;Image processing;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Pattern recognition;Rendering (computer graphics);Terrain mapping","image enhancement;image resolution;quadtrees;rendering (computer graphics);terrain mapping;virtual reality","dual-cache structure;image resolution;large scale texture mapping;quadtree based indexing method;real-time terrain rendering;wavelet image enhancement algorithm","","1","","11","","","21-24 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of the existing research efforts in this field only focus on using SOAP web service as an enabling technology. In this paper, we compare REST and SOAP web services for supporting ubiquitous environments. We describe our approaches to deploy an open ubiquitous computing environment using REST style services along with semantic web and mobile technologies. We also discuss an example context-aware application developed for the environment and show how REST style services can contribute in moving ubiquitous computing technologies into the real world.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3310-0","10.1109/ICWS.2008.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4670164","","Context-aware services;Information retrieval;Mobile handsets;Resource description framework;Search engines;Semantic Web;Simple object access protocol;Ubiquitous computing;Web services;World Wide Web","Web services;information retrieval;mobile computing;semantic Web","REST Web service;SOAP Web services;context information retrieval;context-aware applications;mobile technologies;open ubiquitous environment;semantic Web","","3","","33","","","23-26 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The support vector machine (SVM) is used to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantic concepts. Semantic concept vectors are defined to represent the semantics of shot and scene. The retrieval based on our video data model can be achieved at low-level feature layer and high-level semantic concept layer. The results of retrieval at difference layers can be integrated to improve the performance of retrieval.","2157-9555;21579555","POD:978-0-7695-3304-9","10.1109/ICNC.2008.531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4666977","data model;semantic;video","Bridges;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Data models;Information retrieval;Layout;Multimedia databases;Support vector machines;Video compression;Videoconference","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;support vector machines;video signal processing","content-based retrieval;high-level semantic concepts;low-level visual features;scenery documentary;semantic-based four-layer video data modeling;support vector machine","","0","","8","","","18-20 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the fast developing of World Wide Web applications, sentiment classification would have huge opportunity to help people automatic analysis of customers' opinions from the web information. Automatic opinion mining will benefit to both decision maker and ordinary people. Up to now, it is still a complicated task with great challenge. There are mainly two types of approaches for sentiment classification, machine learning methods and semantic orientation methods. Though some pioneer researches explored the approaches for English reviews classification, few jobs have been done on sentiment classification for Chinese reviews. The machine learning approach Based on string kernel for sentiment classification on reviews written in Chinese was proposed in this paper.
