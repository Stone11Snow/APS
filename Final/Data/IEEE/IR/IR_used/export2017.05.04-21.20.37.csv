The method is elaborated with the context of configuring the correct data to be programmed in the functional fuses of dual core processors. Functional fuses are device family specific and are used to configure thermal offset limits, device specifications and many other vital parameters. The challenge is to transfer the parameters obtained from one automatic test equipment (ATE) insertion to a different one for fusing. The current method stores this data in a portion of the functional fuses reserved for engineering. However, this method limits the amount of data that can be stored as well as the number of fuses available for other purposes. This paper proposes a new method to store the fuse values in a centralized database. The approach is based on querying for a particular part's previous test data stored in the central database and using the data returned to correctly program the fuse bits. This technique is extended to have flow control, segregation of parametric outliers and checksum of fused data to cater for manufacturing.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0665-X; POD:1-4244-0664-1","10.1109/EPTC.2006.342792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147321","","Application software;Data engineering;Databases;Fuses;Information retrieval;Microprocessors;Pulp manufacturing;Software performance;Testing;Time to market","automatic test equipment;electric fuses;microprocessor chips","automatic test equipment insertion;dual core processors;functional fuses;test parameters","","0","","5","","","6-8 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to retrieve the desired data, sensors are usually organized into a hierarchy and synchronize when transmitting the data towards the base station. Many scheduling schemes have been proposed with the goal of allowing sensors to sleep as much as possible and ultimately save energy. In this paper, we propose two new scheduling algorithms that assign predefined slots to each sensor. These algorithms are distributed, need very little global information and do not need knowledge about the location of sensors or the network topology. As others, we also assume that loose clock synchronization is available. The experimental results confirm our expectations.

Fourth International Conference on","20070416","2007","","","589","596","Protein function is expressed by binding to other compounds at a local portion, called an interaction site. Since the structure of its interaction site and function of a protein are closely related, retrieving similar interaction protein is effective in clarifying the function of a protein. We have proposed a method for retrieving similar interaction protein using profiles that represent the features of the interaction site binding to a certain compound. In this method, it is necessary to compare the structure between proteins and a profile, we use geometric hashing technique which is one of the popular methods for structure comparison. However, the problem of structure comparison by using the geometric hashing is that memory usage becomes too large. This paper proposes a method for arranging the geometric hashing to alleviate this problem. Firstly, only small parts of the target structures are stored in the hash table to reduce the size of the hash table. By evaluating this hash table we screen out candidates of similar structures between target proteins and query profiles. Secondly overall structures are compared for these candidates. In order to reduce the time for retrieval we evaluate the information of the origin which is not generally evaluated without increasing the size of the hash table.

Especially in information retrieval, agents can search effectively with the ability of migrating autonomously through the networks. To find better results for such applications, it is important for agents to complete their tasks on as many nodes as possible by their deadlines. However, most existing agent systems using processor sharing as scheduling disciplines do not take such time constraints into account. Therefore, agents are likely to miss their deadlines on many nodes. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust control method of agents with heterogeneous work demand under time constraint. When there are multiple agents running on a node, the mutual influence among them may cause to make the time for each agent to complete its task longer. When each agent has different work demand, the mutual influence among them is also different. The proposed method takes such different mutual influences into account to calculate the estimated value of the number of agents that can complete their tasks before their deadlines, and uses this value to control the dispatching and execution of agents. By using simulation experiments, we have proved that the proposed method can keep the fairness among all the agents and improve the number of nodes where agents can complete their tasks within their deadlines.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0569-6; POD:1-4244-0568-8","10.1109/CCE.2006.350884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4156535","","Computer networks;Control systems;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Time factors","computer networks;mobile agents;processor scheduling","agent control method;heterogeneous work demand;information retrieval;mobile agent;processor sharing;scheduling disciplines;time-constrained applications","","0","","19","","","10-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, only recently has the application of spaceborne active microwave instruments been investigated for remote sensing of snow on a global scale. This raises the question of whether a technique combining active and passive microwave data can improve the mapping of snow parameters with respect to techniques based solely on passive data. In this letter, we report results concerning the mapping of snow-covered area (SCA) in the Northern Hemisphere between the years 2000 and 2004 derived from the combination of the brightness temperatures at 19.35 and 37 GHz measured by the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Radiometer with backscatter coefficients at 13.4 GHz measured by the NASA's QuickSCAT. SCA derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used as a reference to evaluate the performance of the microwave-based techniques and their combination. Results show that, generally, the technique using passive data provides better agreement with MODIS SCA than the technique using only scatterometer data.

Nodes keep only their own virtual geographical position and require no local topological information. Each node calculates the weight of its own. Initially, this value is its relative distance to the sink. Each node decides to retransmit or to drop the packet received by comparing its own weight to the weight of the sender and the weight of the sink, i.e, destination, which are contained in the received packet. The comparison actually provides the mean for stateless routing. Although the weight parameter includes only the distance information for the time being, it may also include QoS (quality of service) parameters such as the energy left at the node. QoS will definitely help to increase the lifetime of the system. Having had the feature of being stateless, the technique is made free from the use of excessive communications to handle the routing tables. The SWR provides braided-paths if not multi-paths, naturally which is essential to improve reliability and to serve for the time-critical data. The use of thresholds in retransmissions provides the system with a flexible and energy-efficient data flow. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, the SWR is known to be the first stateless routing technique running independent of the MAC-layer underneath.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0849-0; POD:1-4244-0848-2","10.1109/WAMICON.2006.351964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4161126","","Computer networks;Data flow computing;Energy efficiency;Information retrieval;Media Access Protocol;Network topology;Routing protocols;Scalability;Time factors;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;quality of service;routing protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;distance information;quality of service;routing tables;source-initiated geographical data flow;stateless weighted routing;time-critical data;wireless sensor network","","8","","13","","","4-5 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a consequence, the need for location-management middleware is widely recognized and actively researched. Location management is frequently offered to the application through an API where the location is given in the form of coordinates. It is the opinion of the authors that a localization API should offer localized data (e.g. direction to the nearest pharmacy) directly through a transparent and integrated API. Our proposed middleware for location and context management is built on top of Mobispace. Mobispace is a distributed tuplespace made for J2me units where replication between local replicas takes place with a central server (over GPRS) or with other mobile units (using Bluetooth). Since a Bluetooth connection indicates physical proximity to another node, a set of stationary nodes may distribute locality information over Bluetooth connections, and this information may be retrieved through the ordinary tuplespace API","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0523-8; POD:1-4244-0522-X","10.1109/ISWPC.2007.342637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4147096","","Bluetooth;Distributed computing;Environmental management;GSM;Ground penetrating radar;Information retrieval;Java;Middleware;Mobile communication;Mobile computing","Bluetooth;middleware;mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio)","Bluetooth;Mobispace;application program interface;context aware computing;distributed tuplespace;location-management middleware;mobile computing","","2","","16","","","5-7 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To consider spatial and temporal characteristics of video, we introduce a new graph-based data model called spatio-temporal region graph (STRG). Unlike existing graph-based data structures which provide only spatial features, the proposed STRG further provides temporal features, which represent temporal relationships among spatial objects. The STRG is decomposed into its subgraphs object graphs (OGs) and background graphs (BGs). In addition, a new distance measure, called extended graph edit distance (EGED), is introduced in metric space for matching and indexing. Based on clustering and EGED, we propose a new indexing method STRG-index, which is faster and more accurate. We compare the STRG-Index with the M-tree, which is a popular tree-based indexing method for multimedia data. The STRG-index outperforms the M-tree in terms of cost and speed","","POD:0-7695-2746-9","10.1109/ISM.2006.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4061188","","Biomedical measurements;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data engineering;Data models;Data structures;Extraterrestrial measurements;Indexing;Information retrieval;Space technology","graph theory;image matching;indexing;spatiotemporal phenomena;video signal processing","EGED;clustering;extended graph edit distance;matching algorithm;multimedia data;spatial-temporal characteristics;video data indexing","","2","","18","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal, RFID tags issue encrypted authentication messages to the RFID reader, and the reader searches the key space to locate the tags. Due to the lack of efficient key updating algorithms, previous schemes are vulnerable to many active attacks, especially the compromising attack. In this paper, we propose a strong and lightweight RFID private authentication protocol, SPA. By designing a novel key updating method, we achieve the forward secrecy in SPA with an efficient key search algorithm. We also show that, compared with existing designs, SPA is able to effectively defend against both passive and active attacks, including compromising attacks.

Instead of such note-wise estimation, our method calculates the temporal trajectory of instrument existence probabilities for every FO and visualizes it as a spectrogram-like graphical representation, called an instrogram. This method can avoid the influence by errors of onset detection and FO estimation because it does not use them. We also present methods for MPEG-7-based instrument annotation and music information retrieval based on the similarity between instrograms.

A ""soon-to-be-congested"" satellite requests its neighboring satellites to decrease their data forwarding rates. In response, the neighboring satellites search for less congested paths that do not include the satellite in question and communicate a portion of data, primarily destined to the satellite, via the retrieved paths. By so doing, congestion, and the resulting packet drops, can be avoided. A better distribution of traffic among satellites can be guaranteed as well. The proposed scheme is dubbed ""Explicit Load Balancing"" (ELB) scheme. A set of simulations is conducted to evaluate the performance of the ELB scheme using the Network Simulator.

Two latent semantic spaces are constructed from visual and symbolic features to develop these mechanisms. These features are corresponding to lengths of some places of a face and its parts, and keywords, respectively. One latent semantic space is constructed from visual features, the other space is constructed from both features. The former space is used for retrieving similar face images to a given face image, and the latter is used for seeking keywords to the given face image. Moreover, two types of visual futures are defined. One is specified in terms of the lengths of face parts, and the other in terms of points on the outlines of a face and its parts. As an experiment, recall and precision ratios of retrieved face images are measured from the viewpoint of whether similar face images are retrieved, and the ratios of retrieved keywords are measured using two types of the visual features from the viewpoint of whether the retrieved keywords are suitable for the given face image. To evaluate efficiency, not only face images which are stored in the database of the system, but also new face images are given as queries","","POD:0-7695-2746-9","10.1109/ISM.2006.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4061267","","Face;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Indium tin oxide;Information retrieval;Information science;Space technology;Spatial databases;Visual databases","face recognition;image retrieval;indexing;visual databases","FIARS;face image retrieval;image annotation;latent semantic indexing;symbolic feature;visual feature","","3","","15","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data form many online sources do not contain enough information to accurately link the records. To link record from different data sources, any system must identify common entities from these sources. Therefore, the major challenges in record linkage are computational complexity and linkage accuracy. To reduce the number of record pairs for comparison, record linkage utilizes similarity search techniques in order to search for candidate similar records. Various searching methods have been used in record linkage systems. In this paper, we propose a record linkage framework and also focus on standardization and enhance the searching method by adopting an advanced feature of cluster-based searching method called Hierarchical Bayesian Clustering (HBC), which is not only for more efficient record pair comparison, but also for speeding up the record linkage accuracy. The purpose of this method is to place similar records into cluster that restricts the search scope for record comparison and also enhances matching accuracy.","","POD:0-7695-2806-6","10.1109/C5.2007.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144934","","Bayesian methods;Cleaning;Couplings;Data mining;Databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Military computing;Standardization","Bayes methods;Internet;computational complexity;pattern clustering;standardisation","World Wide Web;computational complexity;data sources;hierarchical Bayesian clustering;information sources;linkage accuracy;record linkage system;searching methods;standardization","","0","","19","","","24-26 Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data separation between nodes of distributed system can easily protect data privacy without requiring encrypting sensitive data. Using the relation decomposition strongly reduces the possibility of a disclosure of private information contained in data warehouse. The article presents how specified secure policy can be implemented into the data warehouse system as well as how analytical applications can retrieve protected data from the database.

For the QB scheme, a node retrieves data from another node by querying. Search efficiency deteriorates when the query success probability is small. We propose a Bloom filter based (BF) scheme to improve search efficiency. A data holder summarizes its content by a Bloom filter and broadcasts it to the data querier, which sends a query only if the requested data is available. We derive the bandwidth utilization in the single neighbor scenario and search efficiency as a function of node density in the multiple neighbors scenario. Numerical results show that the BF scheme offers significant gain in search efficiency. Our performance evaluation makes use of the M/M/oo queue to model mobility and is novel. It is useful for studying the impact of mobility in other mobile networks.","1930-529X;1930529X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0357-X; POD:1-4244-0356-1","10.1109/GLOCOM.2006.927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4151557","","Ad hoc networks;Bandwidth;Broadcasting;DH-HEMTs;Disruption tolerant networking;Filters;Information retrieval;Internet;Peer to peer computing;Portable media players","ad hoc networks;information retrieval;mobile radio;queueing theory","M-M-infin queue;ad hoc networks;bandwidth utilization;bloom filter based schemes;data retrieval;location-centric analysis;mobile networks;query based schemes;search efficiency","","0","","9","","","Nov. 27 2006-Dec. 1 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aiming at the problem mentioned above, a multilevel indexing structure (MIS) for object-based image retrieval is proposed in this paper. A three-level tree structure in the image domain is first constructed to reduce the object searching complexity. In order to further fasten the speed of scanning objects, i.e., to eliminate those unrelated images in the dataset rapidly, the clustering in the dataset domain is also conducted.

However, the throughput performance of the original AC may not be satisfactory for high speed environments because only one symbol is processed in an operation cycle. In this paper we present an extension of the AC algorithm where multiple symbols are processed in an operation cycle to improve throughput performance. In our proposed scheme, all pattern strings, and the input text string as well, are divided into K substrings, if K symbols are processed in an operation cycle.

Due to the lack of physical protection, however, sensor networks are vulnerable to attacks if deployed in hostile environments. When a sensor network is under attack, the most fundamental concern is that information communicated or stored in the network remains safe. The past research has focused on securing information in communication, but how to secure information in storage has been generally overlooked. Meanwhile, distributed data storage and retrieval have become popular for efficient data management in sensor networks, which renders the absence of schemes for securing stored information to be a more severe problem. Hence, we propose in this paper three schemes to deal with the problem. All the schemes have the following properties: (i) only authorized entities can access data stored in the sensor network; (ii) the schemes are resilient to a large number of sensor node compromises. The second and the third schemes do not involve any centralized entity except for a few initialization or renewal operations, and thus support secure, distributed data storage and retrieval. The third scheme further provides high scalability and flexibility, and hence is most suitable in real applications. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed schemes have also been verified through extensive analysis and TOSSIM-based simulations","","POD:0-7695-2787-6","10.1109/PERCOM.2007.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144764","","Cryptography;Delay;Information retrieval;Memory;Pervasive computing;Protection;Scalability;Secure storage;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","information retrieval;telecommunication security;ubiquitous computing;wireless sensor networks","access data storage;data management;distributed data storage;distributed data storage security;information security;pervasive computing;sensor network retrieval;sensor nodes","","17","","18","","","19-23 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Algorithms for similarity (range and k-nearest neighbor) queries are implemented. Results from elaborate experiments are reported which depict a low computational overhead in terms of the number of I/O and distance computations and a high relevance of query results.

Simulations on different beaches of the study area were performed to determine a relationship between the TSM concentration and the spectral response of the seawater. Based on the <i>in situ</i> measurements, empirical models were established in order to relate the seawater reflectance with the TSM concentration for TERRA/ASTER, SPOT HRVIR, and Landsat/TM. Seven images of these three sensors were calibrated and atmospherically and geometrically corrected. Single-band models, multiple regression, and ANNs were applied to the visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands of these sensors in order to estimate the TSM concentration. Statistical analysis using correlation coefficients and error estimation was employed, aiming to evaluate the most accurate methodology. The chosen methodology was further applied to the seven processed images.

Several developments such as improvement of the freezing-level (FL) retrieval, a weighted average scheme, and enhanced offset correction were implemented in this paper. As a result, rain rate uncertainties were substantially reduced and quantified. To establish error models, drop-size-distribution uncertainty, beam filling error, data calibration uncertainty, and instrument noise were taken into account. These error models were used to compute proper weights of each channel to combine the six rain rates.

The approach is tailored to the image classification task where a given image class is to be extracted from an image database containing an unknown number of classes.

The new distance can be easily computed through GLD with a complexity of O(|X| cdot |Y|) and it is a metric valued in [0, 1] under the condition that the weight function is a metric over the set of elementary edit operations with all costs of insertions/deletions having the same weight.

Due to the fact that some data will be queried more often than others, a good data synopsis should consider the use of nonuniform accuracy, e.g. provide better approximation of data that are queried the most. Although, the generation of data synopsis is a critical step to achieve a good approximation of the initial data representation, data synopsis must be updated over time when dealing with time varying data.

As each sub-partition can be reversibly decoded by RVLC, more data as well as higher error resilience can be obtained. The context modeling exploits the correlation of DCT coefficients for further compression. This modeling defines the contexts by hierarchical-dependent information.

On the other hand, at very low bitrates, lossy compression is supposed to be a strong attack to watermarking process. In this work, we attempt to integrate watermarking in wavelet-based image coding. In our study, we used three different wavelet-based compression techniques. The last two coders are respectively included in part I and part II of JPEG2000 standard. Taking advantage of the coding architecture, a watermark embedding is directly performed on the wavelet coefficients before the quantization phase. On the recovery stage, the hide information may be retrieved during the decoding or where ever we decompose the reconstructed image on its wavelet domain. Experimental results have shown that blind watermarking coupled with JPEG2000-based image coders exhibits a high robustness to compression attacks with respect to the quality of the reconstructed images.

One of the key issues in CBIR is how to construct effective organization and index to enhance image retrieval speed. Clustering is a kind of effective method. This paper presents a modified fuzzy C-means (MFCM) clustering index scheme method. In addition, in order to reduce the time of clustering, high-dimension feature space is transformed into lower-dimension space by using Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transformation.

In this paper, the impact of imperfect CSI on the performance of MIMO ZF receiver over uncorrelated Rayleigh flat fading channel is analytically assessed. In particular, tight approximation of the post-processing SNR distribution is derived and system performance in terms of outage probability and the BER of MPSK modulation is obtained in closed-form.

First, each frame of the sequence undergoes a segmentation step using extracted texture features from the gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) (Davis and Johns, 1979). Next, corresponding objects between adjacent frames are matched thus resulting in a 3-dimensional segmentation of the video into objects. Finally, color and texture features are extracted for each object in the sequence and provide the primary input in computing the quality measurement pertaining to the video. A low quality measurement may thus eliminate the possibility of the sequence being stored in a database retrieval system.

Moreover, the paper provides an embedded solution, called eEPC. The proposed design alternatives exploration allows to evaluate which eEPC implementation, running on different HW/SW platforms, better satisfies the multiple tag readings and processing architectural constraints.
