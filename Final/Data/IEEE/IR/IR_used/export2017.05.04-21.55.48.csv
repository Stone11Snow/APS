All the pages that are recognized to express the same application (sub)domain are analyzed in order to derive their common structure. This structure is formalized by an XML document, called META, which is then used to extract an XML document that contains the data of the pages and a XML Schema validating these data. The META document can describe various structures such as alternative layout and data structure for the same concept, structure multiplicity and separation between layout and informational content. XML Schemas extracted from different page types are integrated and conceptualized into a unique schema describing the domain covered by the whole Web site. Finally, this conceptual schema is used to build the database of a renovated Web site. These principles are illustrated through a case study using the tools that create the META document, extract the data and the XML Schema.","","POD:0-7695-2016-2","10.1109/WSE.2003.1234003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234003","","Cleaning;Conferences;Data mining;Databases;Design methodology;HTML;Information retrieval;Reverse engineering;Web pages;XML","Web sites;XML;data handling;reverse engineering;systems re-engineering","META document;Web site reengineering;data extraction;eXtensible Markup Language;reverse engineering","","10","8","19","","","22-22 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first part we define the information base, which is a generative framework where an ontology in combination with a concept language defines a set of well-formed concepts. Well-formed concepts is assumed to be the basis for an indexing of the information base in the sense that these concepts appear in descriptions attached to objects in the base. Subsequent and last we introduce an approach for measuring similarity in this framework. The measuring problem is divided into to continuous parts where we first narrow what concepts have in common, and secondly use this fragment, a similarity graph, for calculating the similarity between concepts. The purpose of narrowing or restricting what concepts have in common is to manage the generative aspect of the ontology, and to retain the greatest possible number of shared attributes and characteristics of the concepts being compared. Taking the similarity graphs as input we discuss what properties a similarity function need to satisfy to measure the degree of similarity proportional to how close the concepts are or how much they share.","","POD:0-7803-7918-7","10.1109/NAFIPS.2003.1226777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1226777","","Character generation;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Ontologies;Visualization","content-based retrieval;graph theory;indexing;information retrieval;query languages","concept languages;content based information retrieval;information base indexing;ontology;similarity function;similarity graph;similarity measurement;well-formed concept","","2","","8","","","24-26 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The threshold is analytically derived under the hypothesis that the channel impulse response (channel IR) estimate is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. Simulation results are presented for Universal Mobile Telecommunication System-time division duplex; they show that the proposed algorithm affords a detector performance very close to the case when the channel IR length is a priori known.","0090-6778;00906778","","10.1109/TCOMM.2003.816974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231637","","Additive white noise;Algorithm design and analysis;Baseband;Delay estimation;Demodulation;Gaussian noise;Information retrieval;Infrared detectors;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Multipath channels","3G mobile communication;AWGN;cellular radio;channel estimation;delay estimation;multipath channels;probability;time division multiplexing;transient response","UMTS-TDD;Universal Mobile Telecommunication System-time division duplex;additive white Gaussian noise;channel impulse response;false alarm probability;mobile cellular radio;multipath channel length estimation algorithm;path delay estimation;threshold comparison","","7","2","6","","","Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes a method for visualizing Web communities and their internal structures. visualization of Web communities in the form of graphs enables users to access related pages easily, and it often reflects the characteristics of the Web communities. Since related Web pages are often co-referred from the same Web page, the number of co-occurrences of references in a search engine is used for measuring the relation among pages. Two URLs are given to a search engine as keywords, and the value of the number of pages searched from both URLs divided by the number of pages searched from either URL, which is called the Jaccard coefficient, is calculated as the criteria for evaluating the relation between the two URLs. The value is used for determining the length of an edge in a graph so that vertices of related pages will be located close to each other. Our visualization system based on the method succeeds in clarifying various genres of Web communities, although the system does not interpret the contents of the pages. The method of calculating the Jaccard coefficient is easily processed by computer systems, and it is suitable for visualization using the data acquired from a search engine.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2003.817486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234432","","Data visualization;Embryo;Helium;Informatics;Information retrieval;Internet;Linux;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","Web sites;data visualisation;search engines","Jaccard coefficient;URL;Web communities structure visualisation;Web pages;information retrieval;internal structures;search engine","","8","3","25","","","Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A cluster is decomposed into several subclusters and represented as the union of the subclusters. The subclusters can be further decomposed, which isolates the most related groups within the clusters. A ClusterTree is a hierarchy of clusters and subclusters which incorporates the cluster representation into the index structure to achieve effective and efficient retrieval. Our cluster representation is highly adaptive to any kind of cluster. It is well accepted that most existing indexing techniques degrade rapidly as the dimensions increase. The ClusterTree provides a practical solution to index clustered data sets and supports the retrieval of the nearest-neighbors effectively without having to linearly scan the high-dimensional data set. We also discuss an approach to dynamically reconstruct the ClusterTree when new data is added. We present the detailed analysis of this approach and justify it extensively with experiments.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1232281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232281","","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Degradation;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Multidimensional systems;Nearest neighbor searches","database indexing;pattern clustering;tree data structures;very large databases","ClusterTree;cluster representation;clustered data sets;index structure;indexing approach;large data sets;nearest-neighbor search;retrieval;subclusters","","19","2","32","","","Sept.-Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several GI techniques are used to learn, from examples of melodies, a stochastic grammar for each of three different musical styles. Then, each of the learned grammars is used to synthesize new melodies (composition) or to classify test melodies (style identification).

Both require that information is adequately structured with interchange format and that annotation is performed, to a great extent, automatically. The video information structure must encompass both low-intermediate level video organization and event relationships that define specific highlights and situations. Analysis of the visual data of the video stream permits hints to be extracted, events identified and highlights detected.

Most of the existing systems use image-features to form the queries to the system. For the final user these features are difficult to use or do not have any meaning. The results output by the system most of the times can be unpredictable. Trying to reduce this problem, other systems use images as examples to get the results. Some others use icons. A few of them use the content to form the queries. In this note we describe a system called SISREC that falls in this category. It is able to retrieve images from a previously organized database in terms of their objects. SISREC is composed of three modules. The first module performs object training and object recognition. The second module performs image analysis and image organization. The third module allows for image retrieval.

For this purpose, 27 days of ERS-2 SAR wave mode data were processed, representing a total of 34310 imagettes of size 10 km ×5 km, available every 200 km along the satellite track. In this paper, two methods for retrieving wind speeds from SAR imagettes are presented and validated, showing the applicability of ENVISAT alike SAR wave mode data for global ocean wind retrieval. The first method is based on the well-tested empirical C-band scatterometer (SCAT) models, which describe the dependency of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) on wind speed and direction. To apply C-band models to SAR data, the NRCS needs to be accurately calibrated. This is performed by a new efficient method utilizing a subset of colocated measurements from ERS-2 SCAT and model winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). SAR wind speeds are computed from the calibrated imagettes and compared to the entire set of colocated ERS-2 SCAT and ECMWF model data. Comparison to ERS-2 SCAT winds result in a correlation of 0.95 with a bias of -0.01 m s<sup>-1</sup> and an rms error of 1.0 m s<sup>-1</sup>. The second approach is based on neural networks (NNs), which allow the retrieval of wind speeds from uncalibrated SAR imagettes. NNs are trained using the mean intensity of ERS-2 SAR imagettes and colocated wind data from the ERS-2 SCAT and ECMWF model data. Validation of the NN-retrieved SAR wind speeds to ERS-2 SCAT and ECMWF model wind data result in a correlation of 0.96 with a bias of -0.04 m s<sup>-1</sup> and an rms error of 0.93 m s<sup>-1</sup>.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.814658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1237389","","Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Oceans;Radar tracking;Remote sensing;Satellites;Synthetic aperture radar;Weather forecasting;Wind forecasting;Wind speed","atmospheric boundary layer;atmospheric techniques;meteorological radar;neural nets;ocean waves;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","C-band models;C-band scatterometer models;SAR;SCAT models;global wind speed retrieval;normalized radar cross section;synthetic aperture radar wave mode data;wind field","","57","2","25","","","Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

ISUMA 2003.","20031014","2003","","","135","140","The exchange of information between two agents over the semantic Web requires a means of translating between the ""vocabularies"" of the agents. Much research has focused on the use of ontologies for specifying an agent's knowledge and for exchanging information between agents. Effective communication between agents using different ontologies, however, requires determining the semantic interoperability, i.e., the agreement between the two agent's ontologies. Ontology matching is essential for the process of merging or aligning ontologies and for effective communication between agents. We present a survey of several proposals for ontology matching and develop a framework for the process of ontology comparison from several different levels and views.

Furthermore, the approach allows process knowledge itself to be used as a valuable resource in KM. In order to investigate whether this approach is viable and useful for supporting knowledge-intensive activities we designed and performed a comprehensive experimental evaluation.

Our work is motivated by the fact that, although the reject option proved to be useful in several pattern recognition problems, it has not yet been considered for TC tasks. Since TC tasks differ from usual pattern recognition problems in the performance measures used and in the fact that documents can belong to more than one category, we developed a specific rejection technique for TC problems. The performance improvement achievable by using the reject option was experimentally evaluated on the Reuters dataset, which is a standard benchmark for TC systems.","","POD:0-7695-1948-2","10.1109/ICIAP.2003.1234113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234113","","Indexing;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Knowledge engineering;Learning systems;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Text categorization;Web pages","information retrieval;pattern classification;statistical analysis;text analysis","Reuters dataset benchmark;classification reliability;documents;performance measures;reject option;statistical pattern recognition;text categorisation systems","","2","","14","","","17-19 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of raw document comparison we compare document footprint enhanced with concepts from the ontology (using different enhancement algorithms). The result of this process may be that documents not similar prior to the enhancement become similar (semantically on some abstraction level) after the enhancement. This is because the enhancement process may introduce in the document footprint abstract concepts from the ontology. Using the ontology we can enhance the foot-prints by adding concepts that are not present in the original document.

In this method, the query image represented by the Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) descriptor is warped to best fit the shape of the database image. The similarity between two images is determined by measuring the effort being spent in the warping process. Four similarity parameters are derived to reflect the effort spent throughout the warping process. These parameters are the Total Cumulative Change in the Position of the Control Points (TCCPCP), Total Cumulative Change in the Curvature of the Control Points (TCCCCP), Total Cumulative Voting Distance Score (TCVDS) and degree of matching, which are used to compute the similarity measure for each database image. The retrieved database images are ranked according to the computed similarity measure. A set of experiments is carried out to investigate the characteristic of each similarity parameters that influence the similarity measure computation independently. We also validate the effectiveness of the computed similarity measure for retrieving a set of database images based on the human similarity judgement. The retrieval results of the proposed method are compared with the Curvature Scale Space (CSS) method proposed by Mokhtarian. The overall experiments results show that the similarity measure derived from the NURBS-Warping method show good retrieval results in a highly similar database.","","POD:981-04-8364-3","10.1109/ICARCV.2002.1234947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234947","","Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Position measurement;Shape;Spline;Surface reconstruction;Surface topography;Voting","image matching;image representation;image retrieval;parameter estimation;visual databases","control point position;curvature scale space method;database image retrieval;human similarity judgement;image matching;measure computation;non uniform rational B-spline descriptor;query image representation;similarity measure determination;similarity parameter determination;total cumulative change;total cumulative voting distance score;warping process","","1","","18","","","2-5 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assess the performance of our new system-level exploration methodology to optimize the memory management of typical multimedia applications in an extensively used 3D image reconstruction system (Pollefeys, M. et al, 1998; Cosmas, J. et al, 2002). This methodology is based on an analysis of the number of memory accesses, normalized memory use and energy estimations for the system studied. This results in an improvement in the normalized memory footprint of up to 44.2% and in the estimated energy dissipation of up to 22.6% over conventional static memory implementations in an optimized version of the driver application. Finally, our final version is able to scale perfectly the memory consumed in the system for a wide range of input parameters, whereas the statically optimized version is unable to do this.","1520-6130;15206130","POD:0-7803-7795-8","10.1109/SIPS.2003.1235698","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235698","","Bandwidth;Embedded system;Energy dissipation;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Memory management;Multimedia systems;Optimization methods;Power system management;Runtime","digital storage;embedded systems;image reconstruction;multimedia systems;optimisation;storage allocation;storage management","3D image reconstruction system;data storage capacity;dynamic memory management;embedded systems;energy estimation;memory accesses;memory bandwidth;memory footprint;multimedia applications;normalized memory use;run-time memory management;static memory","","4","","18","","","27-29 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the moment almost all of these systems, however, rely on a number of assumptions about the nature of environment they are used in. In such an environment, a number of problems occur when trying to use ontology-based information and these are the following (1) changing information is the change in the set of information that should be accessible using an ontology; (2) changing ontologies are changes in the ontologies used to access information; and (3) changing sources or change of information sources making it impossible to establish a centralized ontology infrastructure that supports information sharing.","1080-1383;10801383","POD:0-7695-1963-6","10.1109/ENABL.2003.1231425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1231425","","Artificial intelligence;Information management;Information retrieval;Information systems;Joining processes;Knowledge management;Logic programming;Ontologies;Resource description framework;World Wide Web","Internet;information management;information retrieval systems;knowledge management;knowledge representation","WWW;World Wide Web;distributed organization;dynamic environment;information access;knowledge management;ontology based system;ontology-based information;semantic heterogeneity","","0","","4","","","9-11 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Relevance feedback-based image retrieval interface incorporating region and feature saliency patterns as visualizable image similarity criteria","Z. Stejic; Y. Takama; K.

Sci., Tokyo Inst. of Technol., Yokohama, Japan","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","20031007","2003","50","5","839","852","Region and feature saliency pattern (RFSP) is proposed as: (1) a new image similarity model; and (2) a new, visualizable representation of the image similarity criteria. RFSP, coupled with the proposed genetic-algorithm (GA)-based relevance feedback mechanism, is incorporated in the image retrieval interface. By capturing the two fundamental properties of the human visual system-region and feature saliencies-in a context-dependent sense, RFSP more accurately approximates the human similarity perception. By representing the image similarity criteria as a ""pattern of feature combinations distributed over the image regions, each having a different importance,"" RFSP enables the visualization-in a concise form-of the complex, low-level similarity criteria associated with each query image. None of the representative image similarity models captures both region and feature saliencies in a context-dependent sense. Furthermore, very few of the representative works-dealing with the relevance feedback in image retrieval-consider the visualization of the similarity criteria, as a user interface aspect. Also, this paper presents one of the first applications of GAs to the relevance feedback mechanism in the image retrieval field. The retrieval performance of the RFSP, coupled with the proposed GA-based relevance feedback mechanism, is evaluated on five test databases, with around 2500 images, covering 62 semantic categories. Compared with 11 of the representative image similarity models, including three which employ relevance feedback, RFSP brings in average between 6%-30% increase in the retrieval precision. The relevance feedback-based retrieval interface incorporating RFSP is demonstrated as well. Experiment results suggest that: (1) capturing the region and feature saliencies in a context-dependent sense improves the retrieval performance; whereas (2) visualizing the similarity criteria makes the relevance feedback-based image retrieval interface more user friendly, aiding the user in the understanding and expression of the information needs.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2003.817497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234430","","Context modeling;Feedback;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Testing;User interfaces;Visual databases;Visualization","genetic algorithms;image retrieval;relevance feedback;user interfaces;visual databases","feature saliency patterns;genetic-algorithm;human visual system;image databases;low-level similarity criteria visualisation;region saliency patterns;relevance feedback-based image retrieval interface;user interface;visualizable image similarity criteria","","18","","36","","","Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the most important similarity measures in this area is the edit distance between amino acids of two sequences. We believe this criterion should be reconsidered because protein features are probably associated more with small peptide fragments than with individual amino acids. In this paper, we design small patterns that are associated with highly conversed regions among a set of protein sequences. These patterns are used analogous to the index terms in information retrieval. Therefore, we do not consider gaps within patterns. This new similarity measure has been applied to phylogenetic tree construction, protein clustering and protein secondary structure prediction and has produced promising results.","","POD:0-7695-2000-6","10.1109/CSB.2003.1227335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1227335","","Amino acids;Clustering algorithms;Decoding;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information science;Logic;Peptides;Phylogeny;Protein sequence","biology computing;genetics;information retrieval;molecular biophysics;object-oriented methods;pattern clustering;proteins;sequential decoding;vocabulary","amino acids;edit distance;index terms;information retrieval;pattern design;peptide fragments;phylogenetic tree construction;protein clustering;protein secondary structure prediction;protein sequence analysis","","3","","17","","","11-14 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PIRCS works efficiently on cooperative Web architecture Kobayashi Aki et al. (2002), and searches take less time. The system is developed for use with search services that treat the Web as if it were simply a distributed network storage system without a central manager. We call these systems ""super-distributed"" database systems. A client of a super-distributed database retrieves information from many distant nodes, and the node information is updated autonomously. To improve the processing efficiency, the client can pass on a part of the retrieval process to other agents in the network. We aim at constructing such a super-distributed database by using the cooperative Web architecture, we developed where each Web content on an advanced Web server (AWS) knows certain linked contents, and where the AWS can pass on the link information to a client. The client, a Web browser with a search function (WBS), constructs a logical Web space for an information search with the link information. Target information is retrieved from that space by the WBS. We developed a prototype of the PIRCS super-distributed retrieval application on our cooperative Web. The WBS has an intuitional user interface, which shows the link space of the retrieved contents as a graph. In the PIRCS, the final retrieval process is done with a search engine built into the user agent (WBS). This architecture provides an optimum design for balancing the retrieval process between the server and the client. Moreover, as the retrieval is based on up-to-date information, it is more efficient than that of conventional retrieval tools, which gather content information beforehand.","","POD:0-7803-7978-0","10.1109/PACRIM.2003.1235831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1235831","","Books;Content based retrieval;Context;Databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Search engines;Service oriented architecture;Uniform resource locators;Web search","client-server systems;distributed databases;information retrieval;online front-ends;personal information systems;search engines;user interfaces","PIRCS;advanced Web server;client-server system;cooperative Web architecture;cooperative servers;distributed network storage system;link context based search;logical Web space;personal information retrieval system;super-distributed database system;target information;user interface","","0","","12","","","28-30 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pixel candidates are selected from those presenting a good coherence level in the whole set of interferograms and the resulting nonuniform mesh tessellated with the Delauney triangulation to establish connections among them. The linear component of movement and DEM error are estimated adjusting a linear model to the data only on the connections. Later on, this information, once unwrapped to retrieve the absolute values, is used to calculate the nonlinear component of movement and atmospheric artifacts with alternate filtering techniques in both the temporal and spatial domains. The method presents high flexibility with respect to the required number of images and the baselines length. However, better results are obtained with large datasets of short baseline interferograms.

A repeating pattern is a series of notes which appear more than once. Most of the repeating patterns are themes or tones for people to remember easily. A figure is defined as a melody contour of a musical segment. A sequence pattern is a melody segment that has the same figure with other melody segments. In this paper, we use the idea of interval between two adjacent notes to form quantized melody contour for representing music objects. This representation differs from existing methods that use notes to form a melody string. We also propose a method to find significant repeating figures. These figures could cover most of the repeating patterns that are in a noted melody string. In addition, the number of repeating figures found in samples of music is less than that of repeating patterns. As a result, the total execution time and memory space can be dramatically decreased.","1530-1346;15301346","POD:0-7695-1961-X","10.1109/ISCC.2003.1214255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214255","","Cities and towns;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Microphones;Multimedia databases;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Query processing;Research and development","content-based retrieval;multimedia systems;music;quantisation (signal);signal representation;signal sampling","music;music feature extraction;music indices;music object representation;music retrieval;musical segment;quantized melody contour;repeating pattern;significant repeating figure extraction","","2","","12","","","30 June-3 July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the extracted information is to be stored for each image, such methods may require a significant amount of space for storing the histogram, depending on a given image's size and content. In the method proposed, only a small number of features, called chromaticity moments, are required to capture the spectral content (chrominance) of an image. The proposed method is based on the concept of the chromaticity diagram and extracts a set of two-dimensional moments from it to characterize the shape and distribution of chromaticities of the given image. This representation is compact (only a few chromaticity moments per image are required) and constant (independent of image size and content), while its retrieval effectiveness is comparable to using the full chromaticity histogram.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1232264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232264","","Color;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Histograms;Image representation;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Pixel;Shape","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval","chromaticity moments;color features;color histogram;color processing;color spaces;image content-based retrieval;retrieval effectiveness;spectral content;two-dimensional moments","","27","2","23","","","Sept.-Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Video U-DL-A (VUDLA) is an extension to a digital library that allows for storage, indexing and annotation of multimedia documents. It functions in such way that text- and image-based queries can be issued in order to retrieve specific scenes from digital video collections. Technologies such as image and speech processing, video streaming, multimedia databases, information retrieval and graphical user interfaces are integrated to produce a novel multimedia, multimodal environment which re-evaluates text as an important medium for knowledge transmission. We have developed a fully operational testbed to explore multimedia data properties and organization possibilities as well as a wide range of practical applications.","","POD:0-7695-1915-6","10.1109/ENC.2003.1232883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232883","","Graphical user interfaces;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Multimedia databases;Software libraries;Speech processing;Streaming media;Testing","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;image processing;image retrieval;information retrieval;multimedia databases;speech processing","VUDLA;Video U-DL-A;content-based search;digital libraries;digital video collections;graphical user interfaces;image processing;image-based queries;information annotation;information indexing;information retrieval;information storage;knowledge transmission;multimedia collections;multimedia databases;multimedia document;speech processing;text-based queries;video streaming","","6","4","33","","","8-12 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A further extension to a particular switching linear dynamical system allows a representation of complex data onto multiple and even a hierarchy of plots. Using sensible approximations based on expectation propagation, the projections can be performed in essentially the same order of complexity as their static counterpart.

Most existing methods based on word-level indexing rely on the representation called ""bag of words"" which originated in the field of information retrieval. This paper presents a new representation of documents that utilizes additional information about the location of words in pages so as to improve the retrieval performance. We consider that pages are relevant to a query if they contain its terms densely. This notion is embodied as density distributions of terms calculated in the proposed method. Its performance is improved with the help of ""pseudo relevance feedback"", i.e., a method of expanding a query by analyzing pages.

We represent input images through large dimensional and usually sparse histograms which, depending on the task, are either color histograms or co-occurrence matrices. Support vector machines are trained on these sparse inputs directly, to solve problems like indoor/outdoor classification and cityscape retrieval from image databases. The experimental results indicate that the use of a kernel function derived from the computer vision literature leads to better recognition results than off the shelf kernels. According to our findings, it appears that image classification problems can be addressed with no need of explicit feature extraction or dimensionality reduction stages. We argue that this might be used as the starting point for developing image classification systems which can be easily tuned to a number of different tasks.","","POD:0-7695-1948-2","10.1109/ICIAP.2003.1234110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234110","","Histograms;Image classification;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kernel;Sparse matrices;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","computer vision;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);sparse matrices;statistical analysis;support vector machines;visual databases","cityscape retrieval;co-occurrence matrices;color histograms;computer vision;image databases;indoor/outdoor classification;kernel function;large dimensional histograms;sparse histograms;state-of-the-art image classification;statistical learning scheme;support vector machines;training","","8","","20","","","17-19 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Brokering in InfoSleuth is a matchmaking process, recommending agents that provide services to agents requesting services. This paper discusses InfoSleuth's distributed multibroker design and implementation. InfoSleuth's brokering function combines reasoning over both the syntax and semantics of agents in the domain. This means the broker must reason over explicitly advertised information about agent capabilities to determine which agent can best provide the requested services. Robustness and scalability issues dictate that brokering must be distributable across collaborating agents. Our multibroker design is a peer-to-peer system that requires brokers to advertise to and receive advertisements from other brokers. Brokers collaborate during matchmaking to give a collective response to requests initiated by nonbroker agents. This results in a robust, scalable brokering system.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1232266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1232266","","Algebra;Collaboration;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Query processing;Robustness;Scalability","computational linguistics;computer networks;distributed object management;multi-agent systems","InfoSleuth;agent capabilities;agent-based system;collaborating agents;collective response;distributed multibroker design;dynamic heterogeneous data sources;dynamic open environment;explicitly advertised information;heterogeneous systems;information agents;information discovery;information retrieval;matchmaking process;peer-to-peer system;scalable semantic brokering;semantic matching","","10","","22","","","Sept.-Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, while libraries of classes do exist, one of the challenges that still remains is to locate suitable classes and adapt them to meet the specific requirements of the software developer. Traditional approaches to library retrieval are text-based; it is therefore difficult for the developer to express their requirements in a precise and unambiguous manner. A more promising approach is specification-based retrieval, where library component interfaces and requirements are expressed using a formal specification language. In this case retrieval is based on matching formal specifications. In this paper, we describe how existing approaches to specification matching can be extended to handle object-oriented components.","","POD:0-7695-1949-0","10.1109/SEFM.2003.1236220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236220","","Computer science;Formal specifications;Information retrieval;Information technology;Software engineering;Software libraries;Specification languages","formal specification;formal verification;inheritance;object-oriented programming;query processing;software libraries;software reusability","abstraction;formal specification;information hiding;information retrieval;inheritance;library component interfaces;object-oriented components;polymorphism;redifinition;software development;software reuse;specification language;specification matching;specification-based retrieval","","4","","16","","","22-27 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, an index function, based on posture features of each motion frame, is introduced to segment the given motion capture data into indexed motion clips. Then, based on the fact that motion coherence implies index coherence, a new motion with start frame f<sub>start</sub> and end frame f<sub>end</sub> can be synthesized by finding a smooth path connecting f<sub>start</sub> to f<sub>end</sub> in the multidimensional index space. Moreover, an algorithm for finding multiple smooth paths is presented. The merit of proposed framework is that it can generate fast prototyping of desired motions with only a small amount of preprocessing time.

Instead, necessary information is directly extracted from query result representations provided by search engines, as for example ranked lists of document snippets. The system is language-independent and can easily be adapted to a number of data sources and visualisation modes.

We present a solution for content-based retrieval of 3D models that relies on a description of each model by means of a curvature map. After an initial preprocessing of the model, differential properties of points on the surface of the 3D object are evaluated; the model surface is then warped into an ellipsoid, and is mapped onto a 2D image, retaining the curvature information of the original model. Matching is performed by comparing the map of the query against the maps of database models. In particular, this approach exploits weighted walkthroughs to describe curvature maps. Experimental results reveal that this technique, initially developed to describe images, can be successfully applied to curvature maps.","","POD:0-7695-1948-2","10.1109/ICIAP.2003.1234074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234074","","Content based retrieval;Ellipsoids;Hardware;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Software standards;Software tools;Videos","content-based retrieval;image matching;image retrieval;multimedia systems","3D models;3D object retrieval;content-based retrieval;curvature maps;differential properties;model surface warping;multimedia documents;weighted walkthroughs","","1","","22","","","17-19 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One particular implementation of this strategy is the Infusion production tool. The e-learner is presented with material via download, streaming, or CD which can be accessed in a variety of ways. Often the student would like to search this material for topics over single lectures, entire courses, sets of multiple courses, multiple instructors, or a combination thereof. Since the goal of Infusion is to relieve the instructor of such time-consuming tasks as inserting hand edited meta-tags and time indices, an automated solution is desired. To this end, a procedure was formulated based on an automatic speech recognition technology referred to as word-spotting, in which arbitrary words, phrases, and Boolean combinations thereof could be used for queries.

In order to ensure usable systems we must ensure identification of appropriate requirements regarding these critical aspects of systems. There is a basic need for systematic approaches to reason, model and analyze usability from the early stages of the software development. Furthermore, it is necessary to develop a usable ontology or classification of measurable aspects of usability that can be used to aid in the specification of usability requirements. These ontologies should be represented in a way that facilitates their use as guidelines for the requirements elicitation process. We build on review of literature in the area of human-computer interaction and of usability engineering in developing a catalog of aspects of usability that can be considered during requirements gathering.

Frameworks are ""containers"" made up of common phrases surrounding specific informational items such as gene and protein names. A framework viewer has been developed that shows similar text frameworks aligned on the screen much as biosequence visualization tools do. Using the viewer, it is evident that frameworks have the power to find the types of structures needed to develop useful information retrieval systems. As a simple example, one framework was able to concisely select 45,000 nouns from a corpus of 5 million words without error. This work points the way to highly automated systems that will be able to extract and index information in biology textbanks.

As a major reason for this, the semantic gap between high-level concepts and low-level features has been identified. In this paper we describe an approach to reduce the impact of the semantic gap by deriving high level (semantic) from low-level features and using these features to improve the quality of CBIR queries. This concept is implemented for a high-level feature class that describes human world properties and evaluated in 300 queries. Results show that using those high-level features improves the quality of result sets by balancing recall and precision.","","POD:981-04-8364-3","10.1109/ICARCV.2002.1234816","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234816","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Interactive systems;MPEG 7 Standard;Prototypes;Software quality","content-based retrieval;image retrieval","balancing recall;content-based image retrieval;high-level feature class;human world features;semantic feature layers","","3","","12","","","2-5 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
