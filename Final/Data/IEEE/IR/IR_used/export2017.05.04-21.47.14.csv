"Efficient audio stream segmentation via the combined T<sup>2</sup> statistic and Bayesian information criterion","Bowen Zhou; J. H. L. Hansen","Robust Speech Process.

In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for unsupervised audio stream segmentation and clustering via the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The proposed method extends an earlier formulation by Chen and Gopalakrishnan. In our formulation, Hotelling's T<sup>2</sup>-Statistic is used to pre-select candidate segmentation boundaries followed by BIC to perform the segmentation decision. The proposed algorithm also incorporates a variable-size increasing window scheme and a skip-frame test. Our experiments show that we can improve the final algorithm speed by a factor of 100 compared to that in Chen and Gopalakrishnan's while achieving a 6.7% reduction in the acoustic boundary miss rate at the expense of a 5.7% increase in false alarm rate using DARPA Hub4 1997 evaluation data. The approach is particularly successful for short segment turns of less than 2 s in duration. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm is sufficiently effective and efficient for audio stream segmentation applications.","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/TSA.2005.845790","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453590","Audio segmentation;Bayesian information criterion;Hotelling's;spoken document retrieval","Acoustic applications;Bayesian methods;Clustering algorithms;Information retrieval;Loudspeakers;Robustness;Speech coding;Speech recognition;Statistics;Streaming media","Bayes methods;audio signal processing;statistical analysis","Bayesian information criterion;acoustic events classification;speech recognition;spoken document retrieval;unsupervised audio stream segmentation;voice coding","","46","","20","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Models for multimedia information must include representations for the structure and content of several media in a form that allows flexibility in retrieval. Content-based retrieval is the main motivation behind recent research in multimedia databases. The task of searching in video and audio content is made hard by the nature of audiovisual data where, unlike text, there is no direct syntactic channel between the object and its meaning [(R. Zhao and W. I. Grosy, 2002), (J. Chen et al., 2004), (M. Bertini et al., 2003)]. We propose a model for multimedia content storage and retrieval accounting for both context and content information and taking advantage of their dependencies for effective retrieval. We then describe a prototype multimedia database with a retrieval interface. It has been used as a workbench for testing the representation model and integrating tools for feature extraction, information interchange and retrieval. The workbench allows an easy inclusion of new tools for content analysis and new methods for context- and content-based retrieval while offering storage and access for both the actual digital content and its metadata.","","POD:0-7803-8578-0","10.1109/MMSP.2004.1436585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436585","","Assembly;Content based retrieval;Context modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia databases;Prototypes;Testing","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;meta data;multimedia databases","audio content;audiovisual data;content-based retrieval;context-based retrieval;digital content;feature extraction;metadata;multimedia content storage;multimedia database workbench;retrieval interface;video content","","1","4","15","","","Sept. 29 2004-Oct. 1 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The learning procedure automatically clusters video frames into video scenes and objects. The learning algorithm is based on a hierarchical, on-line EM algorithm. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used for rapid computations in E and M step of the EM algorithm. We use the model to: 1. perform video clustering by grouping similar (up to translation and scale) video frames into clusters; 2. robustly stabilize video by inferring translation and scale intensity for each frame. We believe that video scene modeling of this kind is essential to bridge the ""semantic gap"" in video understanding.

A notable deployment scenario is represented by limited spatial regions, such as stadiums, railway stations, and airports, with a high number of simultaneously present mobile wireless peers (dense MANETs). The provisioning of entertainment services (e.g., the distribution of news, movie trailers, songs, and game components) in dense MANETs is a challenging task, hard to achieve in a scalable way with traditional static network infrastructures. We propose lightweight autonomic dissemination of entertainment services that exploits impromptu collaborations among mobile wireless peers to replicate resources in an efficient and lazily consistent way. In particular, we have developed the REDMAN middleware to manage, retrieve, and disseminate replicas of data/service components transparently from the point of view of service developers, thus facilitating the realization of widescale entertainment services. REDMAN implements novel lightweight solutions to identify dense MANETs, maintain the desired resource replication degree, and efficiently perform resource retrieval, by exploiting the assumptions of relatively high and almost constant node density to achieve scalability and limited network overhead.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2005.1452836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1452836","","Collaboration;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Logic devices;Middleware;Mobile ad hoc networks;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Resource management;Scalability","ad hoc networks;entertainment;middleware;mobile radio;telecommunication network management;telecommunication services","MANET;entertainment service;lightweight autonomic dissemination;mobile wireless peer;network management;node density;resource retrieval;widescale wireless environment;wireless portable device","","6","","14","","","June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore we compare two different voxel representations, namely, binary denoting object and background space, and continuous after distance transformation.

Lifting scheme has such intriguing properties as convenient construction, simple structure, integer-to-integer transform, low computational complexity as well as flexible adaptivity, revealing its potentials in CBIR. In this paper, by using general lifting and its adaptive version, we decompose HSI color images into multilevel scale and wavelet coefficients, with which, we can perform image feature extraction and similarity match by means of F-norm theory.

Multidimensional arrays have become very common in scientific and business applications. Such arrays are usually very large and hence they are stored on secondary or tertiary storage systems. For processing, various parts of a multidimensional array are typically retrieved to main memory using range queries. The performance of such queries is significantly affected by the physical organization of the target array on the storage system. Previous research has proposed an approach of this physical organization by chunking, i.e. by decomposing a multidimensional array into smaller multidimensional arrays (chunks). The parameters of the chunking process are chosen based on the storage system characteristics as well as the expected access pattern of range queries. With this approach, the average time of answering a query has been improved. The research presented in this paper extends the basic approach of chunking to a multilevel version; hence the presented approach is called multilevel chunking. We show by experiment that multilevel chunking outperforms single level chunking. The approach presented here primarily targets hard disk systems.","2161-5322;21615322","POD:0-7803-8735-X","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387026","","Application software;Computer science;Filling;Fractals;Hard disks;Hilbert space;Indexing;Information retrieval;Linearization techniques;Multidimensional systems","memory architecture;query processing;storage media","hard disk systems;multidimensional arrays;multilevel chunking;storage systems","","4","","2","","","6-6 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the feature extraction stage, a sparse set of affine Harris and Laplacian regions is found in the image. Each of these regions can be thought of as a texture element having a characteristic elliptic shape and a distinctive appearance pattern. This pattern is captured in an affine-invariant fashion via a process of shape normalization followed by the computation of two novel descriptors, the spin image and the RIFT descriptor. When affine invariance is not required, the original elliptical shape serves as an additional discriminative feature for texture recognition. The proposed approach is evaluated in retrieval and classification tasks using the entire Brodatz database and a publicly available collection of 1,000 photographs of textured surfaces taken from different viewpoints.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1453514","Index Terms- Image processing and computer vision;feature measurement;pattern recognition.;texture","Detectors;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Image databases;Image recognition;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases;Surface texture","computer vision;image recognition;image representation;image texture;visual databases","Brodatz database;Laplacian regions;affine-invariant fashion;distinctive appearance pattern;elliptic shape;elliptical shape;feature extraction;local affine regions;shape normalization;sparse set;sparse texture representation;texture element;texture recognition","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Graphics;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","463","2","51","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, GPSR is designed under the assumption of symmetric links (i.e., bidirectional reachability), which is not realistic for many practical sensor networks, since wireless links in sensor networks often are asymmetric. Second, in sensor networks, packet destinations are often marked with locations instead of identifiers like IP address. Therefore, packets are routed to the home node, which is the node geographically closest to the destined location. Under GPSR, when the target location is outside the exterior perimeter of the sensor network, each packet has to visit all nodes on the boundary of the sensor network topology before it identifies the home node, which results in energy inefficiency. Third, due to the dynamic nature of sensor networks, maintaining data consistency, that is, data retrieved from the home node for a location should be consistent with the data sent to the same location, becomes a challenge when home nodes change. We propose on-demand GPSR (OD-GPSR), a data driven geographical routing protocol customized for sensor networks with solutions to the above three problems. Simulation results show that OD-GPSR performs well in terms of energy efficiency and packet delivery rate at the cost of a little bit more packet delivery delay.","","POD:0-7695-2315-3","10.1109/ITCC.2005.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1425207","Data Consistency;Energy-efficient;Geographical Routing Protocol;Link Asymmetry;Sensor Networks","Computer networks;Computer science;Costs;Delay;Energy efficiency;Hardware;Information retrieval;Network topology;Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","data integrity;radio links;routing protocols;telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor networks","bidirectional reachability;data consistency;energy efficiency;geographical routing protocol;greedy perimeter stateless routing;packet delivery rate;sensor network topology;symmetric links;wireless sensor networks","","3","","11","","","4-6 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach is based on the temporal linear prediction of the frames. For the frames in a video shot, a frame can be predicted from its previous frames. If the prediction error is high, a cut should happen. For dissolves and fades, the prediction coefficients are constants, and these kinds of gradual transitions can be detected by comparing the prediction errors of two different linear predictions. Experimental results show that our algorithm can achieve high precision even if a video contains object motion and camera motion, and is able to detect and classify cuts, dissolves and fades in real time.","","POD:0-7803-8687-6","10.1109/ISIMP.2004.1434124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434124","","Cameras;Gunshot detection systems;Image edge detection;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Motion detection;Reliability engineering;Signal analysis;Video signal processing","video signal processing","camera motion;gradual transitions;object motion;prediction coefficients;prediction error;real time scene break detection;scene cuts;scene dissolves;scene fades;temporal linear prediction;video analysis;video segmentation;video sequence edit detection","","1","","15","","","20-22 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A break-through in this field would have a significant impact on many relevant Web-based applications, such as Web information retrieval, improved access to Web services, information extraction, etc. Early approaches to WSD, based on knowledge representation techniques, have been replaced in the past few years by more robust machine learning and statistical techniques. The results of recent comparative evaluations of WSD systems, however, show that these methods have inherent limitations. On the other hand, the increasing availability of large-scale, rich lexical knowledge resources seems to provide new challenges to knowledge-based approaches. In this paper, we present a method, called structural semantic interconnections (SSI), which creates structural specifications of the possible senses for each word in a context and selects the best hypothesis according to a grammar G, describing relations between sense specifications. Sense specifications are created from several available lexical resources that we integrated in part manually, in part with the help of automatic procedures. The SSI algorithm has been applied to different semantic disambiguation problems, like automatic ontology population, disambiguation of sentences in generic texts, disambiguation of words in glossary definitions. Evaluation experiments have been performed on specific knowledge domains (e.g., tourism, computer networks, enterprise interoperability), as well as on standard disambiguation test sets.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1432741","Index Terms- Natural language processing;ontology learning;structural pattern matching;word sense disambiguation.","Availability;Data mining;Information retrieval;Knowledge representation;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Ontologies;Robustness;Terminology;Web services","computational linguistics;grammars;ontologies (artificial intelligence);word processing","AI-hard problem;Web information retrieval;Web services;Web-based applications;automatic ontology population;generic texts;glossary definitions;grammar G;information extraction;knowledge representation techniques;knowledge-based approach;large-scale rich lexical knowledge resources;robust machine learning;semantic disambiguation problems;statistical techniques;structural semantic interconnections;word sense disambiguation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Dictionaries as Topic;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Natural Language Processing;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Analysis;Vocabulary, Controlled","82","1","32","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

IM 2005.","20050613","2005","","","425","438","Management of multimedia applications is a very challenging task. This is especially true in the emerging new Internet where users use devices such as smart phones and PDAs, a considerable amount of them are connected via wireless connections, and peer to peer applications are becoming more and more popular. In this new environment, the multimedia format that should be sent to different users varies considerably and sending a media stream to a set of users often involves transcoding of formats. This paper addresses the problem of managing multicast streaming in this new environment by defining a framework in which transcoding can be done in internal network nodes, and not necessarily at the sender's or at the receivers' ends. In this framework the sender retrieves all the information regarding the transcoding abilities of the various nodes and the characteristics of the links. Then, it needs to decide how to broadcast the multimedia stream, in what formats, and where to perform the needed transcoding. We show that this algorithmic problem is NP-hard (and also hard to approximate). However, for the very practical case where the number of relevant formats is small, we present an efficient approximation scheme. We study, using simulations, the actual performance of our algorithm and compare it to transcoding at the sender's or at the receivers' ends. Our results indicate that performing transcoding in intermediate nodes is indeed efficient, and that our algorithm can find a much better streaming scheme than any known algorithm.","1573-0077;15730077","POD:0-7803-9087-3","10.1109/INM.2005.1440812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440812","","Digital multimedia broadcasting;Environmental management;Information retrieval;Internet;Multimedia communication;Peer to peer computing;Personal digital assistants;Smart phones;Streaming media;Transcoding","Internet;computer network management;multicast communication;multimedia communication;transcoding","Internet;NP-hard problem;Steiner tree;information retrieval;multicasting multimedia stream management;multicasting multimedia transcoding","","3","","25","","","15-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, texton based texture analysis has been an intensely researched topic especially using Gabor filters output as features for texton construction. The redundancy of Gabor filters makes texton based methods highly time costing. Considering the time cost reducing problem, anisotropic diffusion (AD) filters are introduced in feature extraction for texton construction. Because anisotropic diffusion makes lots of similar features effectively merge together, this method largely reduces feature vectors and time cost on the basis of reliable texton construction. Because of the nonlinearity of nonlinear diffusion, the widely used histogram comparison technique - Earth move distance (EMD) - is not effective for this framework, an appropriate method is proposed instead.

A theorem is presented to define a family of weight lists that all have the same OAT of a given weight list (and consequently the same level values). Considering the plain text to be the original weight list, a key is used to select one from the family of equivalent weight lists to be the cipher text. While finding the levels of the cipher text is easy, finding the corresponding plain text without knowledge of the key is not.

This paper tries to rely on the structural information of the drawings to perform the retrieval. In the system, feature points are extracted and the match carried out between two feature point sets. To achieve basic affine transformation invariance, we resort to a geometric hashing technique to perform the representation and similarity calculation. For the hashing scheme, the ""connection vector"" is used instead of the X-Y coordinate to index the hash table so as to make the matching less sensitive to the variance of writing. A simplification of geometric hashing and component-based matching are also adopted to speed up the retrieval.","","POD:0-7803-8687-6","10.1109/ISIMP.2004.1434164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434164","","Character recognition;Data mining;Geometrical optics;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Ink;Optical character recognition software;Optical sensors;Shape;Writing","document image processing;feature extraction;file organisation;handwritten character recognition;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;information retrieval","affine transformation invariance;component-based matching;connection vector;draft image;feature point extraction;feature point sets;freeform hand-drawn drafts;geometric hashing;handwritten document retrieval;handwritten document storage;hash table;representation;similarity calculation","","0","","6","","","20-22 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to reduce the dimension of feature vectors, a fuzzy discriminate analysis is introduced to extract the principal basis of the wavelet moment.

Cluster analysis is an important tool in a variety of scientific areas such as pattern recognition, information retrieval, microarray, data mining, and so forth. Although many clustering procedures such as hierarchical clustering, k-means or self-organizing maps, aim to construct an optimal partition on the set of objects I or, sometimes, on the set of variables J, there are other methods, called block clustering methods, which consider simultaneously the two sets and organize the data into homogeneous blocks. These methods are speedy and can process large data sets. They require much less computations than if one works on I and J separately. The mixture model is undoubtedly one of the greatest contributions to clustering. Recently we have proposed a generalized EM algorithm (GEM) to maximize a variational approximation of the likelihood. The proposed algorithm is an iterative algorithm whose steps are carried out by the application of the EM algorithm on intermediate mixture models. This paper focus on the clustering context. It deals to compare block GEM and two-way EM, i.e. EM applied separately on I and J. Results on simulated data are given, confirming that block GEM gives much better performance than two-way EM.","2161-5322;21615322","POD:0-7803-8735-X","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387029","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data mining;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition;Self organizing feature maps","approximation theory;iterative methods;maximum likelihood estimation;pattern clustering;variational techniques","block GEM;block clustering;cluster analysis;generalized EM algorithm;homogeneous blocks;intermediate mixture models;iterative algorithm;two-way EM algorithms;variational likelihood approximation","","1","","21","","","6-6 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The problem is generally referred as the ""two dimensional compressed pattern matching"" problem. We report our recent work on compressed pattern matching in JPEG-LS compressed images. The method proposed is primarily a two-pass variation of the JPEG-LS compression algorithm and the algorithm is made search-aware. Experimental results show that the two-pass compression algorithm, unlike other search-aware compression algorithms, does not sacrifice compression.

In this database, data are incomplete because information about all possible food products and all possible germs is not available; data are heterogeneous because they come from various sources (scientific bibliography, industrial data, etc); data may be imprecise because of the complexity of the underlying biological processes that are involved. To deal with heterogeneity, MIEL queries the database through several views simultaneously. To query incomplete data, MIEL proposes to use a fuzzy set, expressing the query preferences of the user. Fuzzy sets may be defined on a hierarchized domain of values, called an ontology (values of the domain are connected using the a kind of semantic link). MIEL also proposes two optional functionalities to help the user query the database: i) MIEL can use the ontology to enlarge the querying in order to retrieve the nearest data corresponding to the selection criteria; and ii) MIEL proposes fuzzy completion rules to help the user formulate his/her query.

The number of parameters of each image is then reduced using principal component analysis, obtaining a low dimensional feature space. We assume that the query is in the same form of objects in our database, and thus it can undergo the same feature extraction process.

Rapid transaction undo recovery is important for many transaction processing applications. The Wu-Fuchs method is efficient in that it eliminates the need for I/O in undoing disk updates on a transaction abort. However, it is dependent on maintaining a list of aborted transaction ID's which must be searched every time a database page is read. This can become a performance bottleneck especially if the abort list becomes very long. Although Wu and Fuchs propose a low-priority process to run in the background and prune the list of extinct transactions, in a heavily-utilized system such a low-priority process may not be scheduled frequently enough to be effective. We propose a method for systematically pruning the abort list of transaction ID's as soon as they become obsolete. Our method eliminates the dependence on a cleanup process and adds little processing overhead.","2161-5322;21615322","POD:0-7803-8735-X","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387035","","Application software;Computer science;Information retrieval;Process design;Transaction databases","system recovery;transaction processing","abort list;aborted transaction ID;database page;heavily-utilized system;low-priority process;rapid transaction undo recovery;transaction processing;twin-page method;undoing disk updates","","0","","8","","","6-6 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model is flexible, to support the moving objects spatio-temporal relations for semantic concepts description and low-level feature extraction.

The architecture of CPSRS is introduced to show how it is designed and works. Two types of plant species retrieval methods, text-based information retrieval and content-based leaf retrieval are discussed. With the text-based information retrieval method, the exact information of plant species is retrieved from the database according to the input searching criteria.

Therefore, this constructed key frame is called the ""temporally maximum occurrence frame"" (TMOF), which is an optimal representation of all the frames in a video shot. The retrieval performance of this representation scheme is further improved by considering the k pixel values with the largest probabilities of occurrence and the highest peaks at each pixel position for a video shot. The corresponding schemes are called k-TMOF and k-pTMOF, respectively.

By adjusting the system parameters such as synchronization between mobile entities and mailbox migration frequency, ARP achieves adaptability and ensures reliability. In extending ARP to group communications, we group mailboxes residing on a host and belonging to the same multicast group into a cluster, and let all mailbox clusters form a logical ring. We present a token-based algorithm and a mailbox migration algorithm to achieve atomicity and total ordering of multicast messages.

Dense MANET deployment scenarios can take advantage of high node population to replicate common-interest resources to increase their availability, by overcoming the unpredictable node exit from the dense region. The paper proposes a lightweight middleware, called REDMAN (replication in dense MANETs), to manage, retrieve and disseminate replicas of data/service components made available by cooperating nodes in a dense MANET. In particular, the paper focuses on the REDMAN original solutions to determine the nodes belonging to dense MANETs without exploiting any positioning system and also to elect dynamically a suitable replica manager node in charge of enforcing the desired resource replication degree in a lazy consistent way.

To address this issue, we propose a feedback learning strategy, which adopts relevant images and adaptively classifies relevant images to construct optimal feedback information. By performing these two processes, knowledge accumulated from previous iterations is reasonably incorporated. The selected feedback information can capture the user's intention and meet the user's needs more precisely.

In this paper, we present a method that maps XML data into relational tables. Our method is still range based, which means it can process queries with regular path expression efficiently.

A client sends a query request to inform the server of its desired data item. The server replies in the common broadcast channel. We first define a utility function that considers the client's power consumption in transmit, receive and idle modes. Specifically, utility is expressed as the number of queries that can be completed given a fixed energy source. Based on the utility function, we formulate our power aware wireless data access scheme as a non-cooperative game, called the WDA game. From our theoretical analysis, we show that clients are not always necessary to send query requests to the server. Instead, each client determines the request probability without any explicit communication with one another. Furthermore, we design and evaluate the server and client algorithms for the WDA game. Simulation results confirm that our proposed scheme, compared with a simple always-request one, increases the utility and lifetime of every client while reducing the number of requests sent, at the cost of a slightly larger average query delay.","","POD:0-7695-2342-0","10.1109/WOWMOM.2005.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1443518","Economics;Game theory;Simulations;Wireless Data Access","Algorithm design and analysis;Broadcasting;Data engineering;Energy consumption;Game theory;Information retrieval;Power engineering and energy;Power system modeling;Traffic control;Video on demand","client-server systems;delays;game theory;information retrieval;power consumption;radio networks","client-server systems;common broadcast channel;game theory;idle mode;noncooperative game;power aware wireless data access;power consumption;query delay;query request;receive mode;request probability;transmit mode;utility function","","0","","17","","","13-16 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the largest test collections provided by NTCIR for evaluating Chinese information retrieval is used. The retrieval system uses one of the best models (2-Poisson) and the robust bigram indexing strategy. If there are no syllable recognition errors, then the errors in converting spelling (called pinyin) to characters degrades the performance by 3.9% points which is not statistically significant. Otherwise, the performance dropped by 10.2% points which is statistically significant. We improved our system by merging the /n/ and /l/ phone labels and retrained the syllable-to-text conversion routines.

The information is typically in the form of tests, or questions about the system. Each test can potentially reduce our uncertainty about the system's state. The problem is to represent the information capturing the dependence between tests, their outcomes, and possible states in an efficiently navigable way to aid diagnosis. The most common such representation is a flowchart with leaf nodes corresponding to possible states, and non-leaf nodes corresponding to tests about the state. The problem with flowcharts is that they are notoriously difficult to maintain. Additional knowledge often has to be manually integrated as the system changes, making it impossible to keep track of all possible decision paths, let alone optimize the flow to maximize performance. We propose an efficient method for optimizing an existing flowchart based on a conversion to an auxiliary matrix representation. The main goal of the paper is show a synergy between the two representations in the hope that this will help practitioners choose a better strategy for their applications. We show that such a conversion suggests ways to improve both representations - ways that were not envisioned when using each representation alone. Finally, we show that the two representations are informationally equivalent in the sense that one can be transformed into the other so that if both are used as black-boxes, one would not be able to tell them apart, regardless of which state the system is in.","1573-0077;15730077","POD:0-7803-9087-3","10.1109/INM.2005.1440825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1440825","","Databases;Flowcharts;Information retrieval;Medical diagnosis;Medical tests;Navigation;Optimization methods;Performance evaluation;System testing;Uncertainty","flowcharting;program diagnostics;program testing;software management;tree data structures","auxiliary matrix representation;flowchart;nonleaf nodes;test-based diagnosis;tree representations","","2","1","11","","","15-19 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the studies, which aimed at retrieving the movement of objects, concentrate on evaluating individual movement of objects. However, this strategy is not always effective especially in case where multiple objects are in motion, and the interest of retrieval lies in the movement of multiple objects as a cluster. This paper proposes a framework of modeling abstract movement of multiple objects based on the idea of group. The movement of individual object is extracted first, and the movement is aggregated based on a specified spatiotemporal granularity. A query is evaluated for the aggregated movement of multiple objects instead of individual movement of objects. We applied this framework for analyzing the aggregated flow of soccer games as an example.","","POD:0-7803-8578-0","10.1109/MMSP.2004.1436590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1436590","","Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Digital video broadcasting;Floods;Games;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatiotemporal phenomena","feature extraction;image retrieval;image sequences;video signal processing","content based retrieval;image feature;spatiotemporal abstraction;spatiotemporal granularity;video data","","0","","5","","","29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Retrieving these kinds of compressed images typically requires processing them into the uncompressed spatial form in which features are extracted for further analysis. This approach incurs many pre-processing operations, especially for large image archives. The paper studies the common features in different compressed domains so that indexing can be done directly from their respective domains. By employing a subband filter model, filters in the block-based discrete cosine transform (BDCT) and wavelet transform (WT) can be directly compared. We have found that both filters share similar characteristics. In fact, the lowpass filters in the two transforms are the same for the Haar wavelet. Therefore, due to the filter similarity, similar features can be extracted from the BDCT and WT subband outputs. We have also studied the effect of compression on their similarity. Despite the high compression, high similarity can still be found. Both our theoretical and experimental studies confirm that common features can be extracted directly from the compressed domains, irrespective of the value of the compression ratio and the use of BDCT or WT.","","POD:0-7803-8687-6","10.1109/ISIMP.2004.1434079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1434079","","Discrete cosine transforms;Filters;Image coding;Image converters;Image retrieval;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Signal processing algorithms;Transform coding","Haar transforms;data compression;discrete cosine transforms;feature extraction;filtering theory;image classification;image coding;image retrieval;low-pass filters;wavelet transforms","Haar wavelet;JPEG-2000;block-based DCT;block-based discrete cosine transform;compressed images;compression ratio;feature extraction;image archives;indexing;lowpass filters;similarity;spatial-spectral feature analysis;subband filter model;wavelet transform","","1","","8","","","20-22 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These models are updated periodically when more images implicitly labeled by users become available through relevance feedback. In this sense, the keyword models serve the function of accumulation and memorization of knowledge learned from user-provided relevance feedback. Furthermore, two sets of effective and efficient similarity measures and relevance feedback schemes are proposed for query by keyword scenario and query by image example scenario, respectively. Keyword models are combined with visual features in these schemes. In particular, a new, entropy-based active learning strategy is introduced to improve the efficiency of relevance feedback for query by keyword. Furthermore, a new algorithm is proposed to estimate the keyword features of the search concept for query by image example. It is shown to be more appropriate than two existing relevance feedback algorithms.

The proposed FKB system is used in the intelligent fuzzy object-oriented database (IFOOD) environment, in which a fuzzy object-oriented database is used to handle large scale of complex data while the FKB system is used to handle knowledge of the application domain.

In this paper, we focus on an efficient discovery service consisting of multilevel hierarchical browsing service that enables users to navigate large sets of 3D models. For this purpose, we use shape based clustering to abstract a large set of 3D models to a small set of representative models (key models). Our service applies clustering recursively to limit the number of key models that a user views at a time. Clustering is derived from metrics that are based on a concept of compression and similarity computation using surface signatures. Signatures are the two-dimensional representations of a 3D model and they can be used to define similarity between 3D models. We integrated the proposed browsing capability with 3DLIB, (a digital library for 3D models that we are building at Old Dominion University), and evaluated the proposed browsing service using the Princeton Shape Benchmark (PSB).

We propose an indexing and searching mechanism which, given a query object, returns the set of objects in the database that are semantically related to the query. We propose an indexing scheme which clusters data such that semantically related objects are partitioned into a small set of clusters, allowing for a simple and efficient similarity search strategy. Our indexing scheme also decouples object and node locations. Our adaptive replication and randomized lookup schemes exploit this feature and ensure that the number of copies of an object is proportional to its popularity and all replicas are equally likely to serve a given query, thus achieving perfect load balancing. The techniques developed in this work are oblivious to the underlying DHT topology and can be implemented on a variety of structured overlays such as CAN, CHORD, Pastry, and Tapestry. We also present DHT-independent analytical guarantees for the performance of our algorithms in terms of search accuracy, cost, and load-balance; the experimental results from our simulations confirm the insights derived from these analytical models","1063-6927;10636927","POD:0-7695-2331-5","10.1109/ICDCS.2005.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1437096","","Analytical models;Computer science;Databases;Educational institutions;Indexing;Information retrieval;Load management;Peer to peer computing;Performance analysis;Topology","database indexing;peer-to-peer computing;query formulation;query processing","CAN;CHORD;DHT topology;Pastry;Tapestry;adaptive replication;data clustering;data indexing;load balancing;peer-to-peer databases;query object;randomized lookup;similarity query handling;similarity search strategy;similarity searching","","13","","20","","","10-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We demonstrate that a choice of a histogram type, combined with the choice of a distance function, can have a huge impact onto the clustering structure of the dataset. Such a hierarchical clustering structure visualization of database objects helps often the user to find similar objects and discover unknown patterns. In our experiments we use real data sets with large number of semantic categories, and evaluate both the reachability plots and the clustering accuracy, to show the effects of appropriate choice of fixed and/or adaptive binning in combination with various distance functions. Results show that significant clusters, along with their representatives, can be automatically extracted, which is a basis for visual data mining but even more important for nonvisual data mining.","","POD:0-7803-8643-4","10.1109/ICCIS.2004.1460430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1460430","","Clustering algorithms;Computational intelligence;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Data visualization;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Visual databases","content-based retrieval;data mining;feature extraction;image retrieval;pattern clustering;visual databases","adaptive-binned histogram;content-based image retrieval;database objects;distance function;fixed-binned histogram;hierarchical clustering structure visualization;image clustering;image feature modeling;nonvisual data mining;pattern discovery;visual data mining","","0","","20","","","1-3 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In-memory predicate caches manage data in units that are described by queries' predicates. A self-managed cache utilizes only information that it can garner from queries issued by the applications and replies from the server. We use multiple buffers in a self-managed memory predicate cache. Management of storage is performed using classification of queries based on their join predicates-each class of queries is assigned a separate buffer. We propose an allocation strategy to assign the limited memory space to the multiple buffers and evaluate the proposed scheme using the TPC-W benchmark.","","POD:0-7695-2333-1","10.1109/CNSR.2005.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1429986","Cache Evaluation;Distributed Systems;Predicate Cache;Storage Management","Buffer storage;Cache storage;Computer science;Databases;Electronic commerce;Global Positioning System;Information retrieval;Middleware;Network servers;Protocols","benchmark testing;cache storage;database management systems;file servers;query processing","DB server;TPC-W benchmark;allocation strategy;cache data retrieval;database system;distributed system;multiple buffers;network data transfer;queries prediction;self-managed memory;storage management","","0","","10","","","16-18 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two key underlying Internet technologies, efficient data delivery and hypertext, demonstrated exceptional potential as new application enablers. In this paper, we present a novel Hypermedia-Aided Design (HAD) collaboration framework that facilitates new communication and data presentation paradigms to improve the effectiveness of typical EDA applications. The framework leverages on the advantages of using semantic multicast as a communication backbone and quantized hypermedia presentations as an efficient data organization, retrieval, and presentation model. Semantic multicast is a global communication tool that relies on an internetwork of proxies to provide content discovery and semantics-based profile-driven data dissemination services. We introduce the notion of a quant, an atomic interactive multimedia information primitive with embedded hyperlinks. We demonstrate how interest-specific quant retrieval and concatenation can enable more focused collaboration. The HAD framework consists of a set of applications for student (designer)-centered CAD education (consulting), collaborative design and debugging, I-commerce, and technical support. In all applications, quant-based presentations enable that theoretical and practical components are tailored according to user's interest and performances. The conceptualized and implemented applications act in synergy with existing software, hardware, and system design tools.","0738-100X;0738100X","POD:1-58113-297-2","10.1145/378239.378536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=935543","","Application software;Debugging;Design automation;Electronic design automation and methodology;Global communication;Information retrieval;Online Communities/Technical Collaboration;Software systems;Spine;Web and internet services","Internet;computer aided instruction;electronic design automation;electronic engineering education;hypermedia","CAD consulting;CAD education;EDA applications;HAD collaboration framework;I-commerce;atomic interactive multimedia information primitive;collaborative debugging;collaborative design;content discovery;data presentation paradigms;embedded hyperlinks;global communication tool;hypermedia-aided design;interest-specific quant retrieval;profile-driven data dissemination services;quant concatenation;quant-based presentations;quantized hypermedia presentations;semantic multicast;technical support","","1","","31","","","22-22 June 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research shows that ontologies are a prominent tool for the semantic interoperability of information sources. Unfortunately, semantic interoperability is not easy to achieve, as related knowledge is most likely to be described in different terms using different assumptions and different data structures. In this paper we provide an interoperability solution based on semantic mediation permitting to define a system of sharing, retrieving and transparent access to the heterogeneous information sources. The proposed approach is based on a multi-representation ontology specified in description logics extended by stamping mechanism. This solution provides a structured and shared vocabulary of several domains. This serves as support to a semantic mediator, to localize the necessary sources, analyze the request for distributed extraction of data and recompose the results in a user answer.","2161-5322;21615322","POD:0-7803-8735-X","10.1109/AICCSA.2005.1387041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1387041","","Computer science;Data mining;Data structures;Information retrieval;Information systems;Logic;Mediation;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Vocabulary","data mining;information resources;information retrieval;information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","data structures;description logics;distributed data extraction;heterogeneous information sources;multirepresentation ontology-based information systems mediation;semantic interoperability;semantic mediation;semantic mediator;stamping mechanism","","2","","9","","","6-6 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method utilizes the radical characteristics, unique to Chinese characters, to minimize the size of compressed documents. Our method consists of two main parts. The first part is the development of a radical pattern library. The second part is to utilize the radical pattern library to match character patterns in a document.
