We show that because sources have restrictions on retrieving their information, sources not mentioned in a query can contribute to the query result by providing useful bindings. In some cases we can access sources repeatedly to retrieve bindings to answer a query, and query planning thus becomes considerably more challenging. We find all the obtainable answers to a query by translating the query and source descriptions to a simple recursive Datalog program, and evaluating the program on the source relations. This program often accesses sources that are not in the query. Some of these accesses are essential, as they provide bindings that let us query sources, which we could not do otherwise. However, some of these accesses can be proven not to add anything to the query's answer. We show in which cases these off-query accesses are useless, and prove that in these cases we can compute the complete answer to the query by using only the sources in the query. In the cases where off-query accesses are necessary, we propose an algorithm for finding all the useful sources for a query.

We present an n-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large data sets to predict the users' future requests. Since this is a prediction system, we cannot measure the recall in a traditional sense. We, therefore, present the notion of applicability to give a measure of the ability to predict the next document. Our model is based on a simple extension of existing point-based models for such predictions, but our results show for n-gram based prediction when n is greater than three, we can increase precision by 20% or more for two realistic Web logs. Also we present an efficient method that can compress our model to 30% of its original size so that the model can be loaded in main memory. Our result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the Web, including pre-sending, pre-fetching, enhancement of recommendation systems as well as Web caching policies.

To address this problem, dissemination based (or push-based) techniques can be used to allow the mobile units to share the broadcast data. This approach is very effective for very popular data. But broadcasting unpopular data repeatedly would waste the precious bandwidth severely. Therefore, the most likely mode of retrieval in wireless mobile environments is going to be mixed, i.e., the popular data objects are broadcast and other (unpopular) objects are provided on demand. To make the mixed approach work seamlessly, we need to measure which data objects are popular. However, the measurement in a wireless broadcasting environment is difficult since in passive broadcasting, users do not communicate with the server to acknowledge the usefulness of the broadcast. In this paper, we investigate an adaptive hybrid approach, in which the popularity of the data objects is determined interactively and dynamically. This information allows us to broadcast only popular data, whereas less popular data is transmitted on-demand (unicast) to conserve network bandwidth. Also, we use a novel technique to determine the amount of bandwidth to be assigned for both broadcast and unicast, in an integrated way. Our simulation results indicate that our technique outperforms recent techniques by a significant margin","","POD:0-7803-5979-8","10.1109/PCCC.2000.830339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=830339","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Computer networks;Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Mobile computing;Unicast;Wireless networks","digital simulation;mobile computing;wireless LAN","adaptive hybrid approach;adaptive hybrid data delivery;broadcasting technique;network bandwidth;pull-based data delivery;simulation results;wireless broadcasting environment;wireless mobile computing;wireless mobile network environment","","7","","14","","","Feb 2000","20 Feb 2000-22 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a method for key video object plane selection using the shape information in the MPEG-4 compressed domain.

In addition, this document presents the rationale, design and results of psychophysical experiments that were conducted to address some key issues that arose during PicHunter's development. The PicHunter project makes four primary contributions to research on CBIR. First, PicHunter represents a simple instance of a general Bayesian framework which we describe for using relevance feedback to direct a search. With an explicit model of what users would do, given the target image they want, PicHunter uses Bayes's rule to predict the target they want, given their actions. This is done via a probability distribution over possible image targets, rather than by refining a query. Second, an entropy-minimizing display algorithm is described that attempts to maximize the information obtained from a user at each iteration of the search. Third, PicHunter makes use of hidden annotation rather than a possibly inaccurate/inconsistent annotation structure that the user must learn and make queries in. Finally, PicHunter introduces two experimental paradigms to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the system, and psychophysical experiments are presented that support the theoretical claims","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/83.817596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817596","","Bayesian methods;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Predictive models;Prototypes;Psychology","Bayes methods;content-based retrieval;digital libraries;information retrieval systems;probability;psychology;relevance feedback;software performance evaluation","Bayesian image retrieval system;PicHunter;content-based image retrieval;design principles;digital libraries;directed search;entropy-minimizing display algorithm;hidden annotation;image targets;information maximization;iteration;performance;probability distribution;psychophysics;relevance feedback","","302","13","82","","","Jan 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Usually, information on the Internet is collected by autonomous search agents that send out queries to the servers that may have the information sought. From a single agent's perspective, sending out as many queries as possible maximizes the chance of achieving the information sought. However, if every agent does the same, the information sites will be overloaded and most of the agents will be dissatisfied. In general, cooperation-sending a moderate number of queries-is desired for everyone's good. In essence, the Internet search agents are caught in the n-person prisoner's dilemma game. When the number of available information sites is much larger than that of the information-seeking agents (i.e., the resource is abundant), cooperation may not be necessary since there is little incentive to cooperate. However, when the resource is scarce, cooperation will lead more agents successfully retrieving the information within reasonable time. It is, however, generally not possible to know how many information sites are available in the world and how many other agents may seek the same information sites.

Such a model allows inference on any of the discrete features, given values for the remaining features. Applications are, e.g., to medical diagnosis with multiple possible diseases, fault diagnosis, information retrieval, and imputation in databases. Bayesian networks (BNs) are versatile tools that possess this inference capability. However, BNs require explicit specification of conditional independencies, which may be difficult to assess given limited data. Alternatively, Cheeseman (1983) proposed finding the maximum entropy (ME) joint probability mass function (pmf) consistent with arbitrary lower order probability constraints. This approach is in principle powerful and does not require explicit expression of conditional independence. However, until now the huge learning complexity has severely limited the use of this approach. Here we propose an approximate ME method, which also encodes arbitrary low-order constraints but while retaining quite tractable learning. Our method uses a restriction of joint pmf support (during learning) to a subset of the feature space.

The evaluation of the quality of search engines should involve not only the resulting set of Web pages but also an estimate of the rejected set of pages. The iterative radial basis function (RBF) neural network developed by G. Meghabghab and G. Nasr (1999) was adapted to an actual evaluation of the number of rejected Web pages on four search engines, viz. Yahoo, Alta Vista, Google and Northern Light. Nine input variables were selected for the simulation. Typical stochastic simulation meta-models use regression models in response surface methods. An RBF divides the resulting set of responses to a query into accepted and rejected Web pages. The RBF meta-model was trained on 937 examples from a set of 9,000 different simulation runs on nine input variables. The results show that the number of rejected Web pages for a specific set of search queries on these four engines is very high. Also, a goodness measure of a search engine for a given set of queries can be designed which is a function of the coverage of the search engine and the normalized age of a new document in the resulting set for the query.

This flexible approach allows the profile to more accurately represent complex user interests. Although there has been significant research on user profiles, our approach is unique in that it can be tuned to trade-off profile complexity and quality. This feature, together with its incremental nature, makes our method suitable for use in large scale information filtering applications such as push based WWW page dissemination.

The data assimilation procedure demonstrated is based on the Kalman filter technique. Kalman filtering allows reconstruction of the state vector when at least part of the state variables are observed regularly. The dynamic model of the system used is based on the 1D Richards equation. The observation equation is based on the integral equation model of A. K. Fung et al. (1992) and is used to link the radar observations to surface soil moisture content. Recently, M. Mancini et al. (1999) reported about laboratory experiments investigating the use of active microwave observations to estimate surface soil moisture content. The present authors apply the data assimilation scheme to the radar measurements of these experiments to retrieve the entire soil moisture profile in the soil sample used, and compare these results with the soil moisture profile measurements (using TDR).

If some tolerance is allowed in the results, orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency can be achieved in such analysis by appropriate selective processing, without necessarily considering all the data features. To guarantee that the error introduced does not exceed the allowed limit, a certain minimum proportion of the data must be involved in the analysis. This proportion cannot be determined arbitrarily. It should be chosen based on some formal methods, with a consideration of the error inherent in the data. This paper presents some techniques for improving the retrieval efficiency in image-based information systems, with performance guarantees on the reliability of results. Using the statistical theory of occupancy, it develops a model for the formal selection of the minimal subset of image features to be involved in histogram-based similarity evaluation. This guarantees that decisions based on the minimum proportion are always the same as (or close to) the one that would have been reached by considering all the features.

We show that changes in performance depend entirely on the application: in some cases, even with large increases in data volume, the faster hardware allows improvements in response time; but in other cases, performance degrades far more than either raw hardware statistics or speed on processor-bound tasks would suggest. Overall, it appears that seek times rather than processor limitations are a crucial bottleneck and there is little likelihood of reductions in retrieval system response time without improvements in disk performance","","POD:0-7695-0518-X","10.1109/ACSC.2000.824410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824410","","Application software;Degradation;Delay;Hardware;Information retrieval;Performance gain;Search engines;Statistics;System performance;Web search","information resources;information retrieval systems;software performance evaluation","World Wide Web;data volume;experiment;information retrieval system performance;performance;response time;search engines","","0","","14","","","2000","31 Jan 2000-03 Feb 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, a probabilistic network that organizes a network of databases and manages the data in the databases is proposed. Each database is represented as a node in the probabilistic network and the affinity relations of the databases are embedded in the proposed Markov model mediator (MMM) mechanism. Probabilistic reasoning is used to formulate and derive the probability distributions for an MMM. Once the probability distributions of each MMM are generated, a stochastic process is conducted to calculate the similarity measures for pairs of databases. The similarity measures are transformed into the branch probabilities of the probabilistic network. Then, the data in the database can be managed and utilized to allow user queries for database searching and information retrieval.

The work presented focuses on two aspects: extraction of a compact representation of a frame series and of a description based on little number of features; and definition of a query language constituted by a set of predicates and facts; these last are derived by a series of features automatically extracted from the frame sequence.

Segmentation and tracking of video objects plays an important role in index creation and user request definition steps. The object is initially selected using a semi-automatic approach. For this purpose, a user-based selection is required to define roughly the object to be tracked. In this paper, we propose two different methods to allow an accurate contour definition from the user selection. The first one is based on an active contour model which progressively refines the selection by fitting the natural edges of the object while the second used a binary partition tree with a “marker and propagation” approach. The video object is thus tracked by using a hybrid structure alternately combining a hierarchical mesh for the motion estimation between two frames and a multi-resolution active contour model. This contour model is derived directly from the mesh boundaries in order to reposition the snake's nodes onto the natural edges of the object. The object-based segmentation associated with object tracking allows relevant descriptors to be built for a future matching purpose","","POD:0-7803-6536-4","10.1109/ICME.2000.871574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871574","","Active contours;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Motion estimation;Navigation;Telecommunications;Tracking","content-based retrieval;edge detection;image segmentation;indexing;motion estimation;tracking;video signal processing","accurate contour definition;active contour model;binary partition tree;content-based information retrieval;content-based video indexing;hierarchical mesh;index creation;marker and propagation approach;mesh boundaries;motion estimation;multi-resolution active contour model;natural edge fitting;object-based segmentation;semi-automatic approach;user request definition steps;user-based selection;video object segmentation;video object tracking","","1","","11","","","2000","30 Jul 2000-02 Aug 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The universality results from the choice of a single means for representing information (HTML) and a single means for delivering it (HTTP). The end-user value produced by this choice is unrivaled in the history of data communications. As great as it is today, the Web's value continues to increase as the number of suppliers and consumers of information increases (Metcalfe's law). No new technology is needed to sustain this growth, except at the transport level, where bandwidth must increase to meet our user demand. What important limitations does the Web have that new technology could remove? One limitation involves access. While the Web (thanks to the geographical reach of the Internet beneath it) has many points of access, it supports just one type of access: visual, from a PC. As our reliance on the Web increases, so does our need to access it. Especially valuable and natural, would be voice access from a phone, especially a mobile phone. The next five years (2000-2005) will see the widespread deployment of voice browsers: digital personae who converse with their users by phone, retrieve Web information (for example, flight schedules) at their user's request, and carry out transactions (for example, changing a travel itinerary) according to their user's instructions.

In the future, the level of automation would be such that work delegated to an agent could be accomplished by collaborating with other agents. Conventional financial trading systems alert the user based on the analysis of financial instruments based on user inputs. The authors take it a step further: an agent may initiate actions up to a limit defined by the user on the belief that in light of the analysis information available, the user would have taken the same action.

This usually involves segmenting the document into semantically meaningful units, classifying each unit into a predefined scene type, and indexing and summarizing the document for efficient retrieval and browsing. We review advances in using audio and visual information jointly for accomplishing the above tasks.

The classical methods of fragmentation in a distributed database system helps, to a great extent, to make the information retrieval faster and with smaller calculation efforts. This is particularly true for applications where the specifications are well known in advance at the time of the creation of the tables that compose the database, which in some form or other influenced the design and the definition of the type of fragmentation and their distribution on different sites of processing. Nevertheless, the above characteristics cannot be used in applications where the distributed management cannot do inferences that help it to know in what sites the data with the characteristics the user is looking for are located. Under these conditions the time and amount of work used by the participants in the query solution can be highly increased. In this paper the dynamic virtual fragmentation method is presented.

One impact is the increase in off-site library users who make in-person reference interviews impossible. To serve this new clientele, academic libraries are setting up electronic reference services to meet off-site information needs. This new approach requires effective human-machine connections to provide smooth reference transactions since librarian-patron contact happens solely through computers. The most challenging aspect of providing electronic reference services to off-site users is deciding when patrons need help. Pertinent information technology is needed to track Web traffic patterns and user behavior (e.g. Web mining), addressing immediately the difficulties encountered by end users. The paper focuses on human-computer connections relating to reference librarians' application of Web mining technology to transfer their experiences and skills from the reference desk to the Web environment. It examines Web mining techniques and their potential to assist different library functions. A scenario is used to conceptualize a model that can effectively apply Web mining technology to perform various functions of electronic reference services. It also proposes a methodology that librarians can adapt in offering mediation during the search at patrons' discretion. The main goal is to provide more seamless electronic reference transactions.

This paper is based on one of these systems which uses a set of heterogeneous intelligent software agents to achieve these previous tasks. Two different agents compose the system: Web agents developed to retrieve information from a specific Web source and meta Web agents developed to select the appropriated Web agent to search the necessary information.

In this work a fuzzy system that helps to classify the behavior of the Web agents is presented.

The second approach provides online, interactive capabilities for GIS data searching, visualization, mapping, and analysis; access to ancillary data; and retrieval of data (in various formats) or results of analysis of the data. Specific ongoing efforts include a WebGIS, a WMT-DODS (Web Mapping Testbed-Distributed Oceanographic Data System) server, and an Open GIS Consortium (OGC)-compliant client. These related capabilities could be variously integrated into coherent, application-driven, interoperable, data access systems, which will allow a much larger and more diverse user community to make use of GDAAC data, greatly increase the information density of the data accessed by users, and enable a greater diversity of potential applications of GDAAC data","","POD:0-7803-7031-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2001.977127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=977127","","Data analysis;Data systems;Data visualization;Geographic Information Systems;Geoscience;Information retrieval;NASA;Remote sensing;Satellites;System testing","Internet;geographic information systems;information resources;open systems;remote sensing","GIS data analysis;GIS data mapping;GIS data searching;GIS data visualization;GIS formats;GIS-compatible data distribution;NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Earth Sciences Distributed Active Archive Center;Open GIS Consortium compliant client;WMT-DODS server;Web Mapping Testbed Distributed Oceanographic Data System server;Web capabilities;WebGIS;application-driven interoperable data access systems;automated system;data access;data conversion;data interoperability;data retrieval;online interactive capabilities;remote sensing information partner network;satellite remote sensing data","","0","","5","","","2001","09 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider how database technology can offer an integrated framework for modeling and querying video data. As many concerns in video (e.g., modeling and querying) are also found in databases, databases provide an interesting angle to attack many of the problems. From a video applications perspective, database systems provide a nice basis for future video systems. More generally, database research will provide solutions to many video issues, even if these are partial or fragmented. From a database perspective, video applications provide beautiful challenges. Next generation database systems will need to provide support for multimedia data (e.g., image, video, audio). These data types require new techniques for their management (i.e., storing, modeling, querying, etc.). Hence, new solutions are significant. This paper develops a data model and a rule-based query language for video content-based indexing and retrieval. The data model is designed around the object and constraint paradigms. A video sequence is split into a set of fragments. Each fragment can be analyzed to extract the information (symbolic descriptions) of interest that can be put into a database. This database can then be searched to find information of interest. Two types of information are considered: (1) the entities (objects) of interest in the domain of a video sequence, and (2) video frames which contain these entities","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.877505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877505","","Content based retrieval;Data models;Database languages;Database systems;Image databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Video sequences","constraint handling;content-based retrieval;database indexing;knowledge based systems;object-oriented programming;query languages;video databases","content-based access;data model;database approach;database technology;integrated framework;rule-based query language;video content-based indexing and retrieval;video data indexing;video data querying;video modelling;video sequence","","21","3","73","","","Sep/Oct 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A user-based selection is required in order to initialize the process, whereas an active contour model progressively refines the selection by fitting the natural edges of the object. The video object is thus tracked by using a hybrid structure combining a hierarchical mesh for the motion estimation between two frames and a multi-resolution active contour model. This contour model is derived directly from the mesh boundaries in order to reposition the snake's nodes onto the natural edges of the object.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.899356","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899356","","Active contours;Content based retrieval;Image edge detection;Indexing;Information retrieval;Navigation;Production systems;Research and development;TV;Telecommunications","content-based retrieval;database indexing;image retrieval;image segmentation;interactive television;interactive video;motion estimation;television production;tracking;video signal processing","content-based information retrieval;content-based video indexing;hierarchical mesh;hybrid structure;interactive production systems;interactive television systems;interactive video object selection;mesh boundaries;motion estimation;multiresolution active contour model;snake nodes;user-based selection;video frames;video objects segmentation;video objects tracking","","2","","12","","","10-13 Sept. 2000","10 Sep 2000-13 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The language is also extensible to allow for the definition of higher level terms such as ""cars"", ""people"", ""buildings"", etc. on the basis of existing language constructs. Images are retrieved by deriving an abstract syntax tree form of a textual user query and probabilistically evaluating it by analysing the composition and perceptual properties of salient image regions in light of the query.

In such a framework, the concept of a “key frame” is replaced by that of a “key video object plane”. In this paper, we propose a method for key video object plane selection using the shape information in the MPEG-4 compressed domain. The shape of the video object (VO) is approximated using the shape coding modes of I, P, and B video object planes (VOPs) without decoding the shape information in the MPEG-4 bit stream. Two popular shape distance measures, the Hamming and Hausdorff distance measures, are modified to measure the similarities between the approximated shapes of the video objects. Although they feature different computational and implementation complexity tradeoffs, the corresponding algorithms achieve essentially the same performance levels in selecting key video object planes that represent efficiently the salient content of the video objects","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/6046.845016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=845016","","Code standards;Content based retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 4 Standard;Shape measurement;Streaming media;Video coding;Video compression;Video sequences","image retrieval;video coding;video databases","MPEG-4 compressed domain;key frame selection;key video object plane selection;shape distance measures;shape information;video databases;video indexing;video objects;video representation;video retrieval","","23","3","22","","","Jun 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Given these representations as feature vectors, similarity between images is measured by computing distances in the feature space. Unfortunately, these low-level features cannot always capture the high-level concept of similarity in human perception. Relevance feedback tries to improve the performance by allowing iterative retrievals where the feedback information from the user is incorporated into the database search. We present a weighted distance approach where the weights are the ratios of standard deviations of the feature values both for the whole database and also among the images selected as relevant by the user. The feedback is used for both independent and incremental updating of the weights and these weights are used to iteratively refine the effects of different features in the database search.

In such a background, the GEREQ project is targeted to address three critical aspects: (1) clustering approaches that can detect clusters of arbitrary shape of multidimensional data, which are generated from geographic images; (2) metadata model that formulates the metadata for the integrated system to direct a query to relevant databases; (3) development of theoretical foundation of database selection approaches based on the metadata; and (4) query processing approaches that integrate heterogeneous queries extracted from the content of image data. Furthermore, fundamental understanding of relationships between metadata and resource discovery on multidimensional data will be tackled.
