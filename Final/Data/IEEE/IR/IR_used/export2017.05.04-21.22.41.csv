Via experiments we show that the use of the suggested compromise-based coalition formation mechanism provides significant savings in the computation and communication complexity of coalition formation. Our results also show that when information on task relationships is used, the complexity of coalition formation is further reduced.

More specifically, we adapt a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm to take into account user specific constraints on the clustering process. Such an algorithm could be applied, e.g., for user specific clustering of Web search results, where the user's constraints on the clustering process are given by a hierarchical folder or bookmark structure.

Because the feature elements may be from heterogeneous sources and usually have different influence on similarity estimation, it is inappropriate to model the distribution as isotropic. We propose a novel boosted distance metric that not only finds the best distance metric that fits the distribution of the underlying elements but also selects the most important feature elements with respect to similarity.

Sensor networks store data in three places: external, in-network, local. In-network storage allows sensor nodes as storage nodes for sensed data in the sensor network. This form in-network storage in sensor networks is called data centric storage and is achieved by geographic hashing. Geographic hashing refers to hashing of data types to geographic locations. These hashed locations are mapped to nearest sensor nodes as storage points. One interesting observation in geographic hashing is the hashed locations are mapped to static storage nodes, and the mapping is not dependent on query traffic information. If queries are originating from far areas from the given storage node then the amount of traffic generated is high. The traffic can be decreased if the storage nodes are nearer to the query points. This observation leads us to propose a location aided storage management in which storage nodes are shifted towards the query regions. Our contribution from the traffic improvement point of view is 'shifting of storage nodes towards the query regions with new query region and storage node formation algorithms'. The improvements are decrease in query traffic and faster retrieval times.

Resultant wind vectors are validated using in situ buoy measurements and compared with wind vectors determined from a hybrid wind-retrieval model using wind directions determined by spectral analysis of wind-induced image streaks and observed by colocated QuikSCAT measurements. The hybrid wind-retrieval model consists of CMOD-IFR2 [applicable to C-band vertical-vertical (VV) polarization] and a C-band copolarization ratio according to Kirchhoff scattering.

This paper uses an approach that combines quantitative and qualitative methods in order to create high-quality clusters for a collection of data mining and knowledge discovery (DMKD) publications. The quantitative method extracts a list of noun/noun phrases from the DMKD documents and uses an optimization procedure from CLUTO toolkit to assign documents to clusters. The qualitative method uses grounded theory to identify major categories of the documents to improve the comprehensibility of resultant clusters.

Many databases include large amount of noise or irrelevant data, whose distribution often overlaps with the subsets of exceptional data containing useful knowledge. This paper addresses the problem of finding a small subset of ""minority"" data whose distribution overlaps with, but are exceptional to or inconsistent with that of the majority of the database. In such a case, conventional distance-based or density-based approaches in Outlier Detection are ineffective due to their dependence on the structure of the majority or the prerequisite of critical parameters. We formalize the task as an estimation of a model of the minority subset which provides a simple description of the subset and yet maintains divergence from that of the majority. This estimation is formalized as a minimization problem using an information theoretic framework of Rate Distortion theory. We further introduce conditions of the majority to derive an objective function which factorizes the property of the minority and dependence to the structure of the majority. The proposed method shows improvements from conventional approaches in artificial data and a promising result in document retrieval problem.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053030","","Data engineering;Data mining;Databases;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Information science;Knowledge engineering;Rate distortion theory;Rate-distortion;Unsupervised learning","data mining;information retrieval;rate distortion theory;very large databases","information retrieval;information theory;knowledge discovery;large-scale databases;minority subsets;outlier detection;rate distortion theory","","2","","26","","","18-22 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clearly, a proper patient care should take into account that information in order to check for incompatibilities, avoid unnecessary exams, and get relevant clinical history. The Heart Institute (InCor) of Satildeo Paulo, Brazil, has been committed to the goal of integrating all exams and clinical information within the institution and other hospitals. Since InCor is one of the six institutes of the University of Satildeo Paulo Medical School and each institute has its own information system, exchanging information among the institutes is also a very important aspect that has been considered. In the last few years, a system for transmission, archiving, retrieval, processing, and visualization of medical images integrated with a hospital information system has been successfully created and constitutes the InCor's electronic patient record (EPR). This work describes the experience in the effort to develop a functional and comprehensive EPR, which includes laboratory exams, images (static, dynamic, and three dimensional), clinical reports, documents, and even real-time vital signals. A security policy based on a contextual role-based access control model was implemented to regulate user's access to EPR. Currently, more than 10 TB of digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) images have been stored using the proposed architecture and the EPR stores daily more than 11 GB of integrated data. The proposed storage subsystem allows 6 months of visibility for rapid retrieval and more than two years for automatic retrieval using a jukebox.

In this paper, we propose a new mechanism, INGA, which is based on the observation that query routing in social networks is made possible by locally available knowledge about the expertise of neighbors and a semantics-based peer selection function.

In this paper, we look at hierarchical classification from an information retrieval point of view. More specifically, we consider a scenario in which a user searches a document in a topic hierarchy. This scenario gives rise to the problem of predicting an optimal entry point, that is, a topic node in which the user starts searching. The usefulness of a corresponding prediction strongly depends on the search behavior of the user, which becomes relevant if the document is not immediately found in the predicted node. Typically, users tend to browse the hierarchy in a top-down manner, i.e., they look at a few more specific subcategories but usually refuse exploring completely different branches of the search tree. From a classification point of view, this means that a prediction should be evaluated, not solely on the basis of its correctness, but rather by judging its usefulness against the background of the user behavior. The idea of this paper is to formalize hierarchical classification within a decision-theoretic framework which allows for modeling this usefulness in terms of a user-specific utility function. The prediction problem thus becomes a problem of expected utility maximization. Apart from its theoretical appeal, we provide first empirical results showing that the approach performs well in practice.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053033","","Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Utility theory;Waste materials;Web pages","classification;document handling;information retrieval;search problems","decision-theoretic framework;expected utility maximization;hierarchical classification;information retrieval;optimal entry point;search tree;user behavior;user-specific utility function","","0","","21","","","18-22 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, instead of any machine learning algorithm, we used common-sense and current-affairs as our knowledge-base with a rule based approach to assess each line of text by assigning a numerical valence and finally, natural language processing (NLP) technologies are used to perform automated categorization of news stories on the basis of emotional affinity.

Most existing video analysis techniques focus on the low level visual features of video data. However, there is a ""semantic gap"" between the machine-readable features and the high level human concepts i.e. human understanding of the video content. In this paper, an interactive platform for semantic video mining and retrieval is proposed using relevance feedback (RF), a popular technique in the area of content-based image retrieval (CBIR). By tracking semantic objects in a video and then modeling spatio-temporal events based on object trajectories and object interactions, the proposed interactive learning algorithm in the platform is able to mine the spatio-temporal data extracted from the video. An iterative learning process is involved in the proposed platform, which is guided by the user's response to the retrieved results. Although the proposed video retrieval platform is intended for general use and can be tailored to many applications, we focus on its application in traffic surveillance video database retrieval to demonstrate the design details.

In order to further refine the clustering results, we adopt the maximum flow/minimum cut theorem from graph theory to do outlier/outlier group detection. Outlier detection can help identify misclustered image segments and is used to improve the quality of clusters in this paper.

To the best of our knowledge, most model-based clustering approaches use Laplacian smoothing to prevent zero probability while most similarity-based approaches employ the heuristic TF*IDF scheme to discount the effect of ""general"" words.

Our main contribution is the proposal of a new divisive hierarchy that is based on the construction of a non-binary tree. Each node can have more than two divisive clusters by detecting a better grouping in m classes . To determine how to divide the nodes in the hierarchical tree into clusters nodes, we use K-means clustering. At each node, to determine the correct number of clusters, we use a quality criterion called Silhouette.

The three-level structure, namely moton index, moton and moton distribution, is defined to synthesize motions. To describe the continuous and nonlinear dynamics of human motion, the motion texture is modeled by a non-stationary switching linear dynamic system (NS-SLDS), which improves the switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) by non-stationary functions.

However, agents may be reluctant to reveal their services to other agents during cooperation due to the concerns to privacy, security, and difficulty of a heavy communication overhead. In this paper we present a distributed algorithm that allows agents to cooperate and form a composition in such a situation. This algorithm can be viewed as a distributed extension of the reputed centralized planning paradigm, i.e. graph planning + CSP.

We then present C-Rank: a new cluster ranking algorithm. Given a network with arbitrary pairwise similarity weights, C-Rank creates a list of overlapping clusters and ranks them by their integrated cohesion. We provide extensive theoretical and empirical analysis of C-Rank and show that it is likely to have high precision and recall. Our experiments focus on mining mailbox networks. A mailbox network is an egocentric social network, consisting of contacts with whom an individual exchanges email. Ties among contacts are represented by the frequency of their co-occurrence on message headers.

One problem with the chain code is that it lacks of the spatial information of the image content, which limits its use in image retrieval. In this paper, two novel methods, called Chain Code Coherence Vector (CCCV) and Chain Code Distribution Vector (CCDV) are presented, which not only have the advantages of being invariant to the position, rotation and scaling but also contain the spatial information of the image content. In the end, two different distance measures are presented to measure the similarity of shape information embedded in the CCCV and CCDV. Experiment demonstrates the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.","","POD:0-7695-2745-0","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2006.264973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041685","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Probability;Shape measurement;Statistical analysis;Sun","","","","2","","8","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an algorithm to find out related queries based on Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model. First, we select and estimate ARIMA model of the temporal query logs. And then each query is denoted by a sequence of coefficients. We use the correlation of ARIMA coefficients as the similarity measurement. We call it as the ARIMA Temporal Similarity (ARIMA TS). This similarity describes how strongly two time series are linearly related. On the other hand, the ARIMA model could also be treated as a dimensionality reduction procedure. It can save storage space for a large database of the query logs. In addition, ARIMA model could be used as a tool to predict the trend of a query. The experimental results on two query logs of MSN search engine 1 demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better similarity measurement efficiently.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053138","","Asia;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Databases;Euclidean distance;Frequency;Information retrieval;Predictive models;Search engines;Stochastic processes","","","","1","5","18","","","18-22 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On the Lower Bound of Local Optimums in K-Means Algorithm","Z. Zhang; B. T. Dai; A. K. h.

However, the k-means algorithm is very likely to converge to some local optimum which is much worse than the desired global optimal solution. To overcome this problem, current k-means algorithm and its variants usually run many times with different initial centers to avoid being trapped in local optimums that are of unacceptable quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to compute a lower bound on the cost of the local optimum from the current center set. After every k-means iteration, k-means algorithm can halt the procedure if the lower bound of the cost at the future local optimum is worse than the best solution that has already been computed so far. Although such a lower bound computation incurs some extra time consumption in the iterations, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets show that this method can greatly prune the unnecessary iterations and improve the efficiency of the algorithm in most of the data sets, especially with high dimensionality and large k.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053102","","Acceleration;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Computer science;Cost function;Data mining;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","iterative methods;pattern clustering","clustering method;computer science;data mining;information retrieval;k-means iteration;local optimums;machine learning","","5","","16","","","18-22 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Comparison of Descriptor Spaces for Chemical Compound Retrieval and Classification","N. Wale; G.

Many of the best-performing techniques for these tasks utilize a descriptor-based representation of the compound that captures various aspects of the underlying molecular graph's topology. In this paper we compare different set of descriptors that are currently used for chemical compound classification. In this process, we also introduce four different descriptors derived from all connected fragments present in the molecular graphs. In addition, we introduce an extension to existing vector-based kernel functions to take into account the length of the fragments present in the descriptors. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the previously introduced and the new descriptors in the context of SVM-based classification and ranked-retrieval on 28 classification and retrieval problems derived from 18 datasets. Our experiments show that for both these tasks, the new descriptors consistently and statistically outperform previously developed schemes based on the widely used fingerprint- and Maces keys-based descriptors, as well as recently introduced descriptors obtained by mining and analyzing the structure of the molecular graphs.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-2701-7","10.1109/ICDM.2006.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053093","","Chemical compounds;Cities and towns;Computer science;Data mining;Diseases;Drugs;Fingerprint recognition;Information retrieval;Kernel;Topology","chemistry computing;drugs;graph theory;information retrieval;pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM-based classification;chemical compound classification;chemical compound retrieval;descriptor fragment length;descriptor space comparison;descriptor-based representation;drug-like compound retrieval;molecular graph topology;ranked retrieval;vector-based kernel function","","6","1","34","","","18-22 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we describe our work on the detection of bloggers' interest from three kinds of important features containing in blogs. Textual features include the interest-related words. Temporal features are used to analyze bloggers' posting frequency in order to model the strength of bloggers' interest. Interactive features are represented by the comments posted by bloggers to identify the bloggers' interactivity in blogsphere. By incorporating textual, temporal, and interactive features, our system can be able to automatically identify the interest of bloggers.

Problem determination and remediation (PDR) play an important role in an autonomic computer system, especially in ambiguous and unexpected error situations due to operating environment and requirement changes. A PDR agent system that can learn and adapt to changing environments, react to existing or new error situations and predict possible problems and take actions proactively is an integral part of an autonomic system. Traditional static problem determination and remediation system becomes insufficient. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical technique called ""singular value decomposition (SVD)"" with a feedback system to enable a PDR agent to be responsive to ambiguous and undefined situations, predict possible problems and take actions proactively, and be able to adapt itself to the changing environment. This approach treats the situations-remediation actions relationship as a statistical problem. Using SVD technique, implicit higher order structure in situations and remediation actions association is modeled and extracted, coupled with a feedback system with human interactions, the agent is able to learn from new error situations and derive the corresponding remediation actions.","","POD:0-7695-2748-5","10.1109/IAT.2006.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4052931","","Computer errors;Costs;Data mining;Feedback;Filtering;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Singular value decomposition;Strontium","DP management;computer centres;singular value decomposition;software agents;user interfaces","ambiguous situations;autonomic computer system;autonomic problem determination;autonomic system;feedback system;human interactions;remediation agent;singular value decomposition;singular value decomposition technique;situations-remediation actions relationship","","0","","15","","","18-22 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
