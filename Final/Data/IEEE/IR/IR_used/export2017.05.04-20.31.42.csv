The definitions and MPEG-7 data for multimedia content instances can't be used with other metadata standards in a semantically interoperable way. As part of an attempt to build a retrieval system that uses various metadata standards such as MPEG-7 and Dublin Core in a semantic Web environment, we first developed a method for automatically converting the MPEG-7 specification into a RDF schema (RDFS) and MPEG-7 data into RDF data. Our approach is to develop a set of conversion rules for XML Schema definitions into RDF schema definitions, rather than interpreting the semantics of individual components of the MPEG-7 specification","","POD:0-7695-2504-0","10.1109/CIMCA.2005.1631240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631240","","Application software;Computer science;Data engineering;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantic Web;Standards development;XML","XML;image coding;image retrieval;meta data;multimedia computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic Web","MPEG-7 specification;RDF schema;RDFS;XML schema definition;information retrieval;metadata standard;semantic Web;semantic interoperability","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A single domain conceptualisation and semantics can be projected as a single information viewpoint over multiple information sources, targeted to answer core queries by domain expert type users. This has the advantage that it avoids the necessity of users needing to be familiar with the stored data schema and associated query interfaces. However, some users may not be familiar with the full semantic model in order to pose and refine their queries under the strict constraints of a single conceptualisation. The single conceptualisation may also not adequately capture the operational nuances, side effects and errors in answering data queries.

"Toward intelligent music information retrieval","Tao Li; M. Ogihara","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20060515","2006","8","3","564","574","Efficient and intelligent music information retrieval is a very important topic of the 21st century. With the ultimate goal of building personal music information retrieval systems, this paper studies the problem of intelligent music information retrieval. Huron points out that since the preeminent functions of music are social and psychological, the most useful characterization would be based on four types of information: genre, emotion, style,and similarity. This paper introduces Daubechies Wavelet Coefficient Histograms (DWCH)for music feature extraction for music information retrieval. The histograms are computed from the coefficients of the db<sub>8</sub> Daubechies wavelet filter applied to 3 s of music. A comparative study of sound features and classification algorithms on a dataset compiled by Tzanetakis shows that combining DWCH with timbral features (MFCC and FFT), with the use of multiclass extensions of support vector machine,achieves approximately 80% of accuracy, which is a significant improvement over the previously known result on this dataset. On another dataset the combination achieves 75% of accuracy. The paper also studies the issue of detecting emotion in music. Rating of two subjects in the three bipolar adjective pairs are used. The accuracy of around 70% was achieved in predicting emotional labeling in these adjective pairs. The paper also studies the problem of identifying groups of artists based on their lyrics and sound using a semi-supervised classification algorithm. Identification of artist groups based on the Similar Artist lists at All Music Guide is attempted. The semi-supervised learning algorithm resulted in nontrivial increases in the accuracy to more than 70%. Finally, the paper conducts a proof-of-concept experiment on similarity search using the feature set.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632041","Clustering;FFT;machine learning;music information retrieval;wavelet","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Filters;Histograms;Intelligent structures;Labeling;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Music information retrieval;Psychology;Wavelet coefficients","emotion recognition;feature extraction;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;learning (artificial intelligence);music;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","Daubechies wavelet coefficient histogram;Daubechies wavelet filter;emotion detection;intelligent music information retrieval;music feature extraction;personal music information retrieval system;semisupervised classification algorithm;support vector machine","","55","","38","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this purpose, our approach includes an ontology-based scheme for the semiautomatic annotation of documents and a retrieval system. The retrieval model is based on an adaptation of the classic vector-space model, including an annotation weighting algorithm, and a ranking algorithm.

Recent years have witnessed significant advances in techniques for indexing and querying Web data. However, in the same period, limited advancements have been made in developing paradigms and researching algorithmic issues associated with the design of interfaces for Web-search. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for enabling multiple-perspective query and interaction in Web search. Underlying the proposed metaphor are information and pattern analysis techniques that help determine semantic correlations between Web pages, identify and extract information critical for intuitive understanding and hypothesis generation, and support effective and multiple-perspective interactions between users and the data. We provide a comprehensive study on the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach in query-retrieval scenarios involving complex information goals.

In the paper, we propose a ""Kid's Lifestyle Ontology"" so that the system can infer what they would like to search for to resolve ambiguities. The retrieval system can identify appropriate keywords that have strong relationships with concepts common to their lifestyles, and then the related search keywords can be ranked above other keywords. This is based on the episodic memories of children that help them discover other keywords. As a result, children can rejne their queries gradually.

The main parameter of interest in a PIR scheme is its communication complexity, namely the number of bits exchanged by the user and the servers. A large amount of effort has been invested by researchers over the last decade in search for efficient PIR schemes. A number of different schemes ((B. Chor. O. Goldreich. E. Kushilevitz. and M. Sudan, 1998), (A. Beimel and Y. Ishai, 2001) ,(D. Woodruff and S. Yekhanin, 2005)) have been proposed, however all of them ended up with the same communication complexity of O(n<sup>1/3</sup>). The best known lower bound to date is 5 log n by (S. Wehner and R. de Wolf, 2005) . The tremendous gap between upper and lower bounds is the focus of our paper. We show an Omega(n<sup>1/3</sup>) lower bound in a restricted model that nevertheless captures all known upper bound techniques. Our lower bound applies to bilinear group based PIR schemes. A bilinear PIR scheme is a one round PIR scheme, where user computes the dot product of servers' responses to obtain the desired value of the i-th bit. Every linear scheme can be turned into a bilinear one with an asymptotically negligible communication overhead. A group based PIR scheme is a PIR scheme that involves servers representing database by a function on a certain finite group G, and allows user to retrieve the value of this function at any group element using the natural secret sharing scheme based on G.

We find that the use of frequency table to conduct the search can improve or degrade the performance, depending on the search algorithm used. While the use of a frequency table improves the efficiency of Interpolation search, it degrades the efficiency of Binary search. Further, we find that the array size and the number of classes in the frequency table affect the extent of reduction (increase) in the efficiency for the Interpolation (Binary) search when the frequency table is used. However, the shape of the data distribution does not have any effect on the search efficiency.

This paper proposes the use of qualitative spatial reasoning as a tool to support the development of a geo-ontology management system. Spatial integrity rules based on uniform and hybrid spatial reasoning are proposed for the automatic derivation of spatial relationships and for maintaining the spatial consistency of the geographic data. A framework for the representation of and reasoning over geo-ontologies is presented using the Web ontology language OWL and its associated reasoning tools. Spatial reasoning and integrity rules are represented using a spatial rule engine extension to the reasoning tools associated with OWL. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a case study showing a prototype geo-ontology and the implementation of the spatial reasoning engine is presented.

Context aware information retrieval involves, either, building refined queries that can retrieve most relevant and precise information or refining retrieved results to match user's needs. Currently most of the queries processed on the web do not return the desired results because they fail to take into account the user's context, query relevance, user's intent, current location, time, and other user's preferences in combination. This leads to high recall and low relevance. Different architectures have been proposed in this field. However, there is still lot more to be done to achieve the results in the areas of query refinement, context retrieval and result refinement. Our approach is based on a proposed concept of 'role ontology' and 'query schemas', incorporating user's profile, context, history, ontology's and user feedback.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0795-8; POD:1-4244-0794-X","10.1109/INMIC.2006.358171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196414","","Computer science;Context awareness;Context modeling;Data mining;Feedback;History;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Search engines;Semantic Web","ontologies (artificial intelligence);query formulation;query processing;semantic Web","context aware information retrieval;query refinement;query relevance;query schemas;result refinement;role ontology;semantic Web;user feedback;user profile","","0","","19","","","23-24 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Active wireless sensing for rapid information retrieval in sensor networks","T. Sivanadyan; A. Sayeed","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

In this paper, we propose a viable alternative-active wireless sensing (AWS)-in which a wireless information retriever (WIR) queries a select ensemble of nodes to obtain desired information in a rapid and energy-efficient manner. AWS has two primary attributes: i) the sensor nodes are ""dumb"" in that they have limited computational ability, and ii) the WIR, is computationally powerful, is equipped with an antenna array, and directly interrogates the sensor ensemble with wideband space-time waveforms. AWS is inspired by an intimate connection with communication over multipath channels: the sensor nodes act as active scatterers and produce a multipath response to the WIR's interrogation signals. We develop the basic communication architecture in AWS and explore various signaling and reception strategies at the WIR, and encoding strategies at the sensors. The basic communication architecture is quite flexible and can cater to a variety of information retrieval tasks. In particular, we illustrate the framework in two extreme information retrieval tasks: high-rate information retrieval corresponding to distributed independent sensor measurements, and low-rate retrieval corresponding to localized correlated measurements. A low-complexity interference suppression technique is proposed for significantly increasing the capacity and reliability of high-rate information retrieval. Performance analysis reveals a fundamental rate versus reliability tradeoff in AWS and is illustrated with accompanying simulation results","","POD:1-59593-334-4","10.1145/1127777.1127794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662444","","Broadband antennas;Data mining;Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Information retrieval;Particle measurements;Routing;Sensor arrays;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless sensor networks","encoding;information retrieval;interference suppression;multipath channels;signal processing;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","AWS;WIR;WIR interrogation signal;active wireless sensing;antenna array;encoding strategy;information extraction scheme;information routing;multipath channel;network processing;sensor network;suppression technique;wideband space-time waveform;wireless information retriever","","2","","12","","","19-21 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently IR projects must be integrated in the back-end using, at best, a general-purpose language-independent API. This architecture limits and precludes the rapid prototyping. In this paper we present a new approach, a very simple architecture, towards the development of a general purpose full-text database. We implemented a standard inverted file index, providing various extra capabilities. For each document stored we simply added a set of qualifiers, MD5 hashes and keywords, algorithmic ally unrelated to the document content. This allows to hierarchically control access to the document, iteratively improve document categorization, add and delete annotations, and document versions. All transactions are done through a standard Web service interface. This feature facilitates system integration, and testing. We describe a set of applications where our concept can be useful. The universe of applications for our concept encompass those areas where document annotations are relevant. Once stored and annotated (with qualifiers), the documents can be retrieved by a combination of qualifiers and document content.

To address these issues, we have developed WordBars, an interactive tool for Web information retrieval. WordBars visually represents the frequencies of the terms found in the first 100 document surrogates returned from the initial query. This system allows the users to interactively re-sort the search results based on the frequencies of the selected terms within the document surrogates, as well as to add and remove terms from the query, generating a new set of search results.

The mobile RFID network exploits the existing cellular network infrastructure and offers RFID-related information services to the subscribers with cellular phones which RFID reader chips are built in. However, in current cellular network environment, contents are usually represented in WML and delivered by WAP protocol, due to the limitations such as narrow network bandwidth, constraints in display resolution, processing power, and memory space for hand-held phones. Inherently, these bring the problems in information exchange between EPC network and mobile RFID network. In this paper, we investigate and suggest a framework to allow EPC network as well as mobile RFID users to seamless access the information located in the other network. Firstly, we propose an application level gateway which transforms the protocols and contents formats used in EPC network into those specially used in mobile RFID network, and vice versa. The transformation rules may be derived by name resolution at the local ONS installed in mobile RFID network. Moreover, it is suggested that the transformation rules may be automatically derived and transparently accomplished by writing well-formed pair of NAPTR resource records for the local ONS of mobile network, regardless of user's location. Finally, an module concept for RFID applications is proposed not only to lighten the workload of cellular phone equipped with RFID reader and save bandwidth, but also to accommodate the heterogeneity and evolution of cellular phone capabilities.","","POD:0-7695-2687-X","10.1109/CIT.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019906","","Bandwidth;Cellular phones;Communication standards;IP networks;Information retrieval;Land mobile radio cellular systems;Mobile communication;Radiofrequency identification;Simple object access protocol;Web and internet services","","","","6","","9","","","20-22 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also find that a set of low-level feature subspaces may correspond to one high-level semantic concept. Unlike most unsupervised subspace learning techniques, we propose to intelligently use the semantic similarity and dissimilarity information provided by user in discovering the discriminant structure of image subspaces in respect to classification.

Our proposed solution consists of a system that can accept a user's document and favorite Web pages. These documents can then be parsed and their words added to the ASR engine's lexicon. Next, it uses those documents to start an ASR training session. The training can completed automatically by using a high quality text-to-speech (TTS) natural voice. In order to overcome the problem of the limited number of high quality natural TTS voices available, we propose to integrate voice pitch variation during the training phase of AUPB&T, which can cover a broader range of user variability.

In this paper, we propose a simple new model for information retrieval agents based on many terms or keywords distribution in a document or distributed database. For the key paragraph extraction we use meaningful term's frequency and the key word distribution characteristics in a document, and those terms are selected by using stemming, filtering stop-lists, synonym for search meaningful terms in a document. The agent receives a Web client's information retrieval request and extracts key paragraph with frequency and distribution using the keywords of the client, and then the agent constructs profile of the documents with the keywords, key paragraph, address of the document browsing.

Contemporary approaches to managing collections of documents typically lack support for flexible metadata definition, browsing and ultimately use for document retrieval. Users are forced to resort to keyword searching without knowing which keywords exist in the domain and which were used by other searchers. This work demonstrates how the usage of metadata linked into the ontological structure for tasks of supporting information retrieval, offers an advantage over the traditional full text searching techniques. The ""à la"" system introduces a novel approach to metadata linking by using ontological zzstructures and ZigZag linking. It makes use of a metadata network for document retrieval, introducing a ""Query by association"" approach. Also, browsing metadata connected in a ZigZag fashion could benefit the knowledge engineers in their first step towards building a formal organisational ontology. It is concluded that the ""à la"" method has the potential to be applicable towards establishing principles of the Semantic Web within a corporate environment.","","POD:0-7695-2743-4","10.1109/EDOCW.2006.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031318","","Cloning;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Joining processes;Keyword search;Knowledge engineering;Multimedia systems;Ontologies;Project management;Semantic Web","","","","0","","17","","","16-20 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using these underpinnings, we have developed techniques for complex queries that merge information from heterogeneous geospatial databases, retrievals of objects based on shape and visual characteristics, analysis of multiobject relationships for the retrieval of objects in specific spatial configurations, and semantic models to link low-level image features with high-level visual descriptors. GeoIRIS brings this diverse set of technologies together into a coherent system with an aim of allowing image analysts to more rapidly identify relevant imagery.

However, building huge term indexes, as required for IR-style keyword search, are impractical with plain DHTs. Due to the large sizes of document term vocabularies, joining peers cause huge amounts of key inserts, and subsequently large numbers of index maintenance messages. Thus, the key to exploiting DHTs for distributed information retrieval is to reduce index maintenance. We show that this can be achieved by combining DHTs with peer clustering. Peers are first clustered into communities, each of the communities having a representative super-peer. Then all occurrences of a term in a community are published to the global DHT in a batch by the representative super-peer. Our evaluation shows that this reduces index maintenance cost by an order of magnitude, while still keeping a complete and correct term index for query processing.","1550-445X;1550445X","POD:0-7695-2846-5","10.1109/AINA.2007.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4220880","","Costs;Indexing;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Peer to peer computing;Performance gain;Publishing;Query processing;Scalability;Vocabulary","file organisation;indexing;peer-to-peer computing;query processing;workstation clusters","DHT;IR-style keyword search;distributed hash tables;distributed information retrieval;document term vocabularies;index maintenance;peer clusters;query processing","","0","","24","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Active wireless sensing has two primary attributes: i) the sensor nodes are ""dumb"" in that they have limited computational ability, and ii) the WIR is computationally powerful, is equipped with an antenna array, and directly interrogates the sensor ensemble with wideband space-time waveforms. Our approach is based on an intimate connection between active wireless sensing and wideband multi-antenna wireless channels in multipath propagation environments: the sensor nodes play the role of active scatterers and generate a multipath response to WIR's interrogation signals.

"An effective music information retrieval method using three-dimensional continuous DP","S. P. Heo; M. Suzuki; A. Ito; S. Makino","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20060515","2006","8","3","633","639","This paper describes a music information retrieval system that uses humming as the key for retrieval. Humming is an easy way for a user to input a melody. However, there are several problems with humming that degrade the retrieval of information. One problem is the human factor. Sometimes, people do not sing accurately, especially if they are inexperienced or unaccompanied. Another problem arises from signal processing. Therefore, a music information retrieval method should be sufficiently robust to surmount various humming errors and signal processing problems. A retrieval system has to extract the pitch from the user's humming. However, pitch extraction is not perfect. It often captures half or double pitches, which are harmonic frequencies of the true pitch, even if the extraction algorithms take the continuity of the pitch into account. Considering these problems, we propose a system that takes multiple pitch candidates into account. In addition to the frequencies of the pitch candidates, the confidence measures obtained from their powers are taken into consideration as well. We also propose the use of an algorithm with three dimensions that is an extension of the conventional Dynamic Programming (DP)algorithm, so that multiple pitch candidates can be treated. Moreover, in the proposed algorithm, DP paths are changed dynamically to take deltaPitches and IOIratios (inter-onset-interval) of input and reference notes into account in order to treat notes being split or unified. We carried out an evaluation experiment to compare the proposed system with a conventional system . When using three-pitch candidates with conference measure and IOI features, the top-ten retrieval accuracy was 94.1%. Thus, the proposed method gave a better retrieval performance than the conventional system.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870717","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632049","Continuous DP;dynamic melody representation;humming;multiple pitch candidates;music information retrieval","Data mining;Degradation;Dynamic programming;Frequency measurement;Human factors;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Robustness;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms","dynamic programming;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;music","dynamic melody representation;dynamic programming algorithm;humming errors;music information retrieval system;pitch extraction","","8","","25","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, there is a great need for providing applications and interfaces in one's own language to tap into this vast knowledge reserve. In addition, access to the Internet is still a major problem in developing countries because of the ""digital divide"" and hand held devices such as PDAs and Mobile Phones are seen as enablers in bridging this gap. However, displaying cross-lingual content on these mobile devices is a non trivial task and there is a great need for robust mechanisms and infrastructure for content delivery in different languages on the fly. This paper presents an overall approach for cross-lingual content specification and delivery for computing/mobile devices. It helps mitigate the language barrier by providing cross-lingual search and retrieval capabilities for accessing the Web content.","","POD:1-4244-0682-X","10.1109/ICDIM.2007.369217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221909","","Content based retrieval;Dictionaries;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile computing;Natural languages;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Search engines","Internet;content management;content-based retrieval;information retrieval;natural language interfaces","Internet;Web content delivery;community mobile networks;computing devices;cross-lingual content specification;cross-lingual information retrieval;cross-lingual retrieval;cross-lingual search;language barrier;mobile devices","","0","","22","","","6-6 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The capability of document image retrieval algorithm depends much on suitable abstraction of statistical feature and the selection of classifier. To this problem, the normalized generalized picture information measurement (NPIM<sub>K</sub>) is introduced as the statistical feature. Meanwhile, an improved KNN classifier based on model is used to identify to which species one image belongs. Experimental results show that the document image retrieval algorithm based on NPIMK and mode-KNN is effective","2164-5221;21645221","CD-ROM:0-7803-9737-1; POD:0-7803-9736-3","10.1109/ICOSP.2006.345671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4129152","","Classification algorithms;Histograms;Image databases;Image processing;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information science;Information technology;Internet","document image processing;image retrieval","K-nearest neighbor;computer technology;document image retrieval algorithm;normalized generalized picture information measurement;text image retrieval","","0","","6","","","16-20 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the research described in this paper, we developed two different use-case scenarios addressing the two requirements, and then showed how the requirements can be met by implementing a grid information retrieval (GIR) system prototype. The dynamic nature of VO applies not only to increasing and decreasing number of users, but also to the dynamically changing requirement of computing power among the different subcomponents that consist in overall system configuration. This implies that a request to increase computing power by a certain subcomponent can be satisfied by other idling subcomponents taking advantage of overall system flexibility. This paper describes how we implemented a grid IR system using VO and security mechanisms provided by Globus toolkit 3.0, and shows how GIR system scalability and security can be improved for dynamic VOs. In order to manage different VOs, we implemented VO management service (VOMS), and registered it to Globus as an additional service","2160-4908;21604908","POD:0-7695-2694-2","10.1109/GCC.2006.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031472","","Computer architecture;Grid computing;Humans;Information management;Information retrieval;Information security;Optical computing;Power system security;Prototypes;Scalability","grid computing;information retrieval systems;security of data;virtual enterprises","Globus toolkit 3.0;VO management service;dynamically reconfigurable virtual organization;grid computing;grid information retrieval management system;use-case scenarios","","1","","14","","","Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
