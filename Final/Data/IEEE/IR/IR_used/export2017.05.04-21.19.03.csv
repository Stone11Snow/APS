Filter increments (i.e. discrete additions or subtractions of water suggested by the filter) are then compared to antecedent precipitation errors determined using higher quality rain gauge observations. Given the inherent difficulty of directly validating remotely-sensed soil moisture products using ground-based soil moisture observations, this assimilation-based proxy provides a valuable tool for efforts to improve soil moisture retrieval strategies and quantify the novel information content of remotely sensed soil moisture retrievals for land surface modeling applications.

The availability of useful models (encompassing procedural know-how and/or how-to documents) is frequently limited. In current models, strategic aspects, risk assessments and process-based cause-and-effect chains are treated as secondary considerations. As a result, deficiencies in the process flow persist past the introduction of RFID technology and desired synergy effects fail to materialize.

A critical aspect is the long computational time that is required to run the forward model, which hampers the creation of large training databases or iterative simulations within retrieval algorithms. To tackle this problem, a neural network (NN) technique is proposed in this paper. In particular, we have adopted NNs to emulate a simulator named SEAWIND, which implements the two-scale model and was validated in previous works. Two training algorithms, including a regularized approach, have been considered and compared. The assessment of the proposed approach has been carried out by statistically comparing neural-network-derived simulations with SEAWIND-derived ones for two validation data sets comprising different climatic conditions, as well as by computing the azimuthal Fourier harmonic coefficients versus wind speed and atmospheric transmittance. Regressive model functions have also been used as benchmarks.

Here, a multivariate autoregressive feature model is proposed to solve this problem for music genre classification. This model gives two different feature sets, the diagonal autoregressive (DAR) and multivariate autoregressive (MAR) features which are compared against the baseline mean-variance as well as two other temporal feature integration techniques. Reproducibility in performance ranking of temporal feature integration methods were demonstrated using two data sets with five and eleven music genres, and by using four different classification schemes.

The atmospheric aerosol products have been derived operationally from multi-channel imaging data collected with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometers (MODIS) on board the NASA Terra and aqua spacecrafts. Through analysis of several years' MODIS aerosol products (Collection 4), we have found that the aerosol products over land are slightly contaminated by snow and ice during the springtime snow-melting season. We have developed an empirical technique using MODIS channels centered near 0.66, 0.86 and 1.24 mum and a thermal emission channel near 11 mum to mask out these snow-contaminated pixels over land.

The seasonal pattern of microwave emission and relative accuracy of the soil temperature retrievals are influenced strongly by landscape properties, including the presence of open water, vegetation type and seasonal phenology, snow cover, and freeze-thaw transitions. The retrieval of soil temperature is similar for the two methods with an overall root-mean-square error of 3.1-3.9 K during summer thawed conditions, with a larger error occurring in winter during periods of dynamic snow cover and freeze-thaw state. These results indicate that at high latitudes, the influence of the atmosphere may be less important than that of surface conditions in determining the relative accuracy of the estimated soil temperature.

A coherence map over the forest area was made from two flight data, whose observation interval was about 30 minutes. The coherence in this site are ranging from 0.5 to 0.8. High coherence values of 0.7 ~ 0.8 were appeared at the young stands. On the other hands, some stands with high biomass also show high coherence value. Since the coherence values are weakly correlated with sigma<sup>0</sup> <sub>HH</sub> and sigma<sup>0</sup> <sub>HV</sub> at the stands with high biomass, the high coherence value and the high sigma<sup>0</sup> value are considered to be the same origin. The regression curve between the coherence and a stem volume derived in this analysis shows higher coherence value than the other two JERS-1 (L-band) 44-day pair data and one ERS 1/2 C-band 1-day pair data.

In some cases, thanks to the availability of near-real-time data, tools and applications have been developed and implemented in the fields of precision agriculture, water resources monitoring and management. So far, empirical approaches based on vegetation indices (Vis) have been successfully applied. They may provide a satisfactory level of accuracy in the estimation of important vegetation biophysical parameters (e.g. LAI, fractional ground cover, biomass, etc). Such methods, however, require a reliable reference data-set to calibrate empirical formulas on different vegetation types; furthermore, they are generally based on a few spectral bands, with a consistent under-exploitation of the full spectral range available in new generation sensors. Alternative approaches based on inversion of radiative transfer models of vegetation represent a challenging opportunity for the estimation of vegetation parameters from data with high dimensionality. This work evaluates the effectiveness, in terms of accuracy and computational complexity, for retrieving the Leaf Area Index, on one hand, by means of empirical relationships, such as the simple CLAIR model proposed by Clevers (1989) and based on the Weighted Differences Vegetation Index (WDVI), and, on the other hand, by means of mathematical inversion of the combined radiative transfer model PROSPECT and SAILH (PSH). Both approaches, i.e. empirical relationship LAI (WDVI) and radiative transfer model inversion, have been tested by using super- spectral and multi-angular data in the solar domain from the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the PROBA experimental satellite.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241651","","Agriculture;Availability;Earth;Information retrieval;Land surface;Mathematical model;Remote monitoring;Remote sensing;Vegetation mapping;Water resources","remote sensing;vegetation","CLAIR model;Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer;Earth Observation data;Leaf Area Index;PROBA experimental satellite;PROSPECT model;SAILH model;Weighted Differences Vegetation Index;agriculture;biomass;fractional ground cover;radiative transfer model inversion;remote sensing data;vegetation biophysical parameters;vegetation types;water management;water resources monitoring","","3","","22","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using various attributes of precipitation derived from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data, the GSMaP has implemented hydrometeor profiles derived from Precipitation Radar (PR), statistical rain/no-rain classification, and scattering algorithms using polarization-corrected temperatures (PCTs) at 85.5 and 37 GHz. Combined scattering-based surface rainfalls are computed depending on rainfall intensities. PCT85 is not used for stronger rainfalls, because strong depressions of PCT85 are related to tall precipitation-top heights. Therefore, for stronger rainfalls, PCT37 is used, with PCT85 used for weaker rainfalls. With the suspiciously strong rainfalls retrieved from PCT85 deleted, the combined rainfalls correspond well to the PR rain rates over land. The GSMaP algorithm for the TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is validated using the TRMM PR, ground radar [Kwajalein (KWAJ) radar and COBRA], and Radar Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMeDAS) precipitation analysis (RA). Monthly surface rainfalls retrieved from six microwave radiometers (GSMaP_MWR) are compared with the gauge-based dataset. Rain rates retrieved from the TMI (GSMaP_TMI) are in better agreement with the PR estimates over land everywhere except over tropical Africa in the boreal summer. Validation results of the KWAJ radar and COBRA show a good linear relationship for instantaneous rainfall rates, while validation around Japan using the RA shows a good relationship in the warm season.

This enables high-density scanning for high-resolution modeling, the successive 3D model manipulation for shape modification and restoration, and also enables the color image mapping onto the modeled surfaces. A face array listing (topology), which defines the vertex (mesh point) connectivity and the shape of the mesh, is pre-assigned to meet the desired meshing. Stable and organized meshing, and hence, an accurate approximation, free from the shape ambiguity unavoidable in the widely used ""retrieving topology from ranged geometry"" procedures based on, for instance, the Delaunay tessellations, is then accomplished. This proposal is practicable for all kinds of objects, automating the current manual and time-consuming reconstruction procedure, eliminating rework requirement modeling and producing a versatile successive 3D shape manipulation.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0726-5; POD:1-4244-0725-7","10.1109/ICIT.2006.372341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4237663","","Cultural differences;Deformable models;Geometry;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Proposals;Sampling methods;Shape;Solid modeling;Topology","image colour analysis;image resolution;image restoration","Cultural Heritage Artifacts;Delaunay tessellations;archeological artifacts;color image mapping;face array listing;high-density scanning;high-resolution modeling;ranging-error resistive shape modeling procedure;shape modification;shape restoration","","0","","12","","","15-17 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we mainly present our experience on a practical P2P-based live video- streaming system called GridMedia, which was employed to broadcast live the Chinese Spring Festival Gala show over the Internet. Benefiting from two sets of flush-crowd traces with about 15,239 and 224,453 concurrent users in a 300 kb/s streaming session in 2005 and 2006, we perform a trace study to understand the service capacity, quality of streaming service, connection heterogeneity, user geographic distribution, and request and online duration characteristics.

The object management group (OMG) defines a four layered modelling architecture, the model driven architecture (MDA), which provides mechanisms for rapid development of modelling languages addressing domain problems using the meta object facility (MOF). MOF incorporates object oriented concepts and is a subset of UML. Furthermore, as users typically don't know how to make requests, the system has to be tolerant. The Query Metamodel Language (QML) is a language that exploits the Object Constraint Language (OCL) (which is very closely associated with UML and therefore MOF) to provide powerful query support on model repositories. This paper presents the motivation for QML along with its abstract syntax. It also introduces the framework for QML processing that incorporates information retrieval functionality and is used to formulate fuzzy queries using the extended boolean model. It describes how QML is integrated in the MOF architecture and how semantic expansion of queries and evaluation can be done in an effective way.","2150-4938;21504938","CD-ROM:1-4244-0470-3; POD:1-4244-0467-3","10.1109/DEST.2007.372001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4233735","MOF;Query Language;Semantic Discovery;modelling","Context modeling;Context-aware services;Database languages;Ecosystems;Information retrieval;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Power system modeling;Standards development;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;business data processing;meta data;object-oriented programming;query languages;query processing;software architecture","MOF repository;Query Metamodel Language;UML;Unified Modeling Language;digital business ecosystem;fuzzy query;information retrieval;meta object facility;model driven architecture;object management group;object oriented concept","","1","3","18","","","21-23 Feb. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The required backscatter data is obtained through the use of numerical electromagnetic scattering codes. The simulations compute backscatter at multiple frequencies in each time step, so that range-resolved radar cross sections are obtained after an FFT operation. Profile retrievals are obtained through a simple ""tilted Bragg"" assumption, which allows local incidence angles on the surface to be directly determined from RCS data. These local incidence angles are then translated into surface slopes, and further integrated to construct the estimated profile. Initial results from this process are reported in this paper; further studies are in progress to quantify the overall accuracy achieved as a function of various surface and sensor parameters.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241492","","Backscatter;Computational modeling;Electromagnetic scattering;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Oceans;Radar cross section;Radar scattering;Sea surface;Surface waves","backscatter;oceanographic techniques;oceanography;radar cross-sections;remote sensing by radar","FFT;S band radar backscattering;X band radar backscattering;electromagnetic scattering code;ocean surface profile retrieval;range-resolved radar cross section;simulated LGA radar data;tilted Bragg assumption","","1","","11","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The procedure is widely used; however, topology is ranging error sensitive. Especially, when high-density scanning is required, error problems become fatal and the procedure is not practical. To overcome the problem, a topology pre-assigned high-resolution modeling procedure is proposed. This procedure enables one to construct a complete reproduction of fine arts and documents in shape and color, to manipulate the shape of the resulting model and to make counterfeit detectable. Our detection is based on the three-layered model. The first layer is the conventional skin surface or the external color image layer. The second layer is a terrain model of the object of, for example, i in pastes of oil paintings or toner mountain ranges on the paper. The third layer is a terrain model of the basement of, for example, the canvas of an oil painting or a sheet of papyrus or paper. If the canvas is fully painted, the second layer masks the third. Only the image layer is involved in the counterfeit detection so far. In our modeling, the 3D terrain models of the second and/or third layer are additionally and mutually combined. The inter-layer relations are synergistic. We expect the multilayer models to be highly detectable in a counterfeit.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-1076-2; POD:1-4244-1075-4","10.1109/ICNSC.2007.372811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4239024","","Art;Clouds;Counterfeiting;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Painting;Petroleum;Shape;Surface reconstruction;Topology","computational geometry;document image processing;image coding;image colour analysis;image reconstruction;image retrieval;painting;solid modelling;surface reconstruction;watermarking","3D terrain models;Delaunay tessellations;basement model;canvas;complete documents reproduction;complete fine arts reproduction;conventional skin surface;counterfeit detection;external color image layer;high-density scanning;high-density surface reconstruction;multilayer model;object model;oil paintings;papyrus;scanned cloud points;shape manipulation;surface models;surface topology;three-layered model;toner mountain ranges;topology preassigned high-resolution modeling procedure;unorganized triangular meshes;watermarking","","2","","15","","","15-17 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For more than a decade the European satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 have acquired SAR data over the open ocean operating in wave mode. The ERS acquisitions are currently continued by the ENVISAT ASAR wave mode. It is well known that the derivation of ocean wave parameters from SAR data is not straightforward and different approaches have been proposed. It this study we present a new technique, which is based on an empirical SAR imaging model. The method has the calibrated SAR image as the only input. A data set of 6000 globally distributed ERS-2 wave mode image spectra and collocated ocean wave spectra computed with the numerical model WAM are used to fit a linear model, which relates the SAR spectrum to integral wave parameters like, e.g., the significant wave height. This model is then used for ocean wave parameter retrieval. The radar cross section and the azimuthal cut-off wavelength estimated from the wave mode images are used as additional input variables. The method takes into account the coupling of the different parameters and is based on a least-square minimisation approach. The resulting coupled linear system of equations is solved using a singular value decomposition technique. Disjunct subsets of the collocated data set are used for fitting the model and retrieving ocean wave parameters. Scatterplots and global maps with the derived parameters are presented. It is shown that the standard deviation of the retrieved significant waveheight with respect to the WAM waveheight is in the order of 0.62 m. Other wave parameters, which are of practical relevance like mean wave periods are investigated as well.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241631","","Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Instruments;Numerical models;Ocean waves;Radar polarimetry;Satellites;Sea measurements;Synthetic aperture radar;Two dimensional displays","geophysical signal processing;numerical analysis;ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;singular value decomposition;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","ENVISAT ASAR wave mode;ERS-1 satellite;ERS-2 satellite;WAM numerical model;calibrated SAR image input;coupled linear equation system;empirical SAR imaging model;global 2D ocean wave measurements;ocean wave parameter retrieval;singular value decomposition technique;spacebore SAR data;synthetic aperture radar;wave height;wave period","","0","","8","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the development and certification of a simple but realistic thread library. The thread library provides common multi-threading features such as dynamic thread creation, termination and joining as well. This li- brary also carries machine-checkable proof which guaran- tees the library does not violate the safety policies. This paper also presents an approach to link the library to exist- ing certified multithreaded user programs to form an inte- grated foundational proof-carrying code (FPCC) package. Comparing with the uncertified libraries, our work makes multithreaded applications much more reliable.","","POD:0-7695-2856-2","10.1109/TASE.2007.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4239956","","Application software;Certification;Computer science;Information retrieval;Logic;Packaging machines;Runtime library;Software libraries;Software safety;Yarn","multi-threading;software libraries","certified thread library;concurrent programs;foundational proof-carrying code;machine-checkable proof;multithreaded software safety;multithreaded user programs","","1","","26","","","6-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In practice, applications that require these operations usually provide numerous candidate attributes, whereas, depending on their interests, users may issue queries regarding different subsets of the dimensions. The existing algorithms are inadequate for subspace skyline/top-k search because they have at least one of the following defects: 1) they require scanning the entire database at least once, 2) they are optimized for one subspace but incur significant overhead for other subspaces, or 3) they demand expensive maintenance cost or space consumption. In this paper, we propose a technique SUBSKY, which settles both types of queries by using purely relational technologies. The core of SUBSKY is a transformation that converts multidimensional data to one-dimensional (1D) values. These values are indexed by a simple B-tree, which allows us to answer subspace queries by accessing a fraction of the database. SUBSKY entails low maintenance overhead, which equals the cost of updating a traditional B-tree. Extensive experiments with real data confirm that our technique outperforms alternative solutions significantly in both efficiency and scalability.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4262537","B-tree.;Skyline;subspace;top-k","Cities and towns;Cost function;Data security;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Relational databases;Scalability;Space technology","query processing;relational databases;tree data structures","B-tree;SUBSKY technique;skyline queries;top-k retrieval","","43","","31","","","Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nonetheless, depending on environmental conditions and forest stand properties (e.g. size, structure) the retrieval accuracy can change significantly. For this reason methods are required for the identification of forest stands for which high retrieval accuracy can be obtained. From an analysis of multi-temporal coherence datasets at several test sites in Scandinavia and Siberia, we can conclude that optimal conditions for the retrieval are represented by stable winter frozen conditions with an at least moderate breeze. For such conditions, the retrieval accuracy increases if only stands larger than a few hectares and with a certain degree of homogeneity are considered. For such stands, the effective stem volume retrieval error that can be obtained in boreal forests ranges between 15 and 25%.To overcome the necessity of falling back on inventory data to identify such stands, multi-temporal consistency of coherence, of stem volume estimates and stand size can be used as stand selection criteria.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241718","","Biomass;Coherence;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Radio interferometry;Remote sensing;Snow;Space technology;Testing;Volume measurement","remote sensing;vegetation","ERS-1/2 multitemporal coherence;Eurasian boreal forests;Scandinavia;Siberia;forest biophysical properties;forest stand properties;multi-temporal coherence datasets analysis;stem volume retrieval assessment","","0","","8","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is expected that SAR will provide all-day and all-weather wind parameters with high spatial resolution and high accuracy, which would provide valuable data to marine weather forecasters and SAR model designers. However, the methodology for retrieving wind fields from SAR is far from complete. Present procedures require that a prior wind direction must be available in order to get wind speed information from SAR images. Errors in wind direction can result in significant biases in the SAR-retrieved wind speed. The prior wind direction can be acquired from measurements of other instruments (scatterometer, buoys etc.), from meteorological model outputs, or from wind-induced slicks if evident in the SAR images. The latter method may be limited by the image; many SAR images don't have any obvious wind-induced slicks. He et al. [2005] developed a new gradient method model (GM), which can retrieve wind directions from SAR images without trying to infer slicks. However, thus far, this method can only be used in relatively uniform wind field situations. In this paper, two modifications to the GM method have been developed by introducing an optimal analysis method. Wind speed and direction (with ambiguity) can be retrieved directly. In this method, sigma<sup>0</sup> from two overlapped sub-blocks of the SAR image are used to retrieve wind parameters, which would violate the original GM method, because it cannot be used in highly varied winds, such as hurricanes. The chief advantage of this method is that wind speed can be retrieved without additional reference wind directional information. The wind direction ambiguity can be removed by background geophysical information of the SAR image or by in-situ measurements. Two cases are considered to illustrate this new method. One is a simulated image with relatively uniform w- - ind field, and the other is a Radarsat-1 image which captures the eye of hurricane Isabel before it made landfall in North Carolina in 2003 as a category 2 storm. In both cases, the retrieved wind result is shown to compare well with Quickscat measurements and <i>in-situ</i> data. However, error exists for highly-varied wind field, especially for the retrieved wind direction. Future investigation will focus on this limitation, and also conduct further comparisons.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241723","","Geophysical measurements;Hurricanes;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Oceans;Sea surface;Synthetic aperture radar;Weather forecasting;Wind forecasting;Wind speed","atmospheric techniques;geophysical signal processing;gradient methods;meteorological radar;oceanographic techniques;radar signal processing;remote sensing by radar;storms;wind","AD 2003;North Carolina;Quickscat measurements;Radarsat-1 wind field image;SAR images;category 2 storm;hurricane Isabel;modified gradient method model;ocean surface wind;optimal analysis method;simulated wind field image;synthetic aperture radar;wind direction ambiguity errors;wind field retrieval;wind speed;wind vector determination","","1","","11","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key to this capability is developing techniques for crafting an understanding of the content and context of an information resource, and ultimately reconstructing the meaning and intent of the resource. Our approach to inferring meaning and intent is to gather the implicit semantics available in data source schemas, to build associations between the contents of the data source and the semantics described and defined in ontologies, and to glean additional semantic clues captured from an analysis of a set of queries submitted to the data source.","","Electronic:1-4244-1329-X","10.1109/ISI.2007.379476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258702","","Costs;Information analysis;Information filtering;Information filters;Information resources;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Performance analysis;Physics;Relational databases","data mining;information resources;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing","data source intent inference;data source meaning inference;data source schemas;information resource retrieval;ontologies;relational databases","","1","","12","","","23-24 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Landsat5 TM data with a higher spatial resolution thermal infrared band of 120 m was often used to retrieve land surface temperature. However, the fact that Landsat 5 possesses only one thermal infrared band is also a critical limitation for LST retrieval, which does not allow applying a split-window method. LST retrieval from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data is often not practical because of the scarcity of in situ radiosounding data. Therefore in most cases, only at-satellite brightness temperature was obtained from TM6 data, which is far different from the land surface temperature. Hence the precision of land surface temperature retrieval was actually not so satisfied. While the proposal of the generalized single-channel algorithm in 2003 makes it possible to figure out land surface temperature from TM6 data with high precision. Based on this algorithm, a test for land surface temperature retrieval of Beijing region was carried out with Landsat5 TM data acquired on 6 May 2005. MODIS data received on the same date was used to compute the total atmospheric water vapor content which is necessary for the algorithm. Furthermore, the retrieving result has been validated using simultaneously measured in situ data. A significantly high precision with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 1.67 K has been achieved by the approach introduced in this paper, which shows the advantages of synthetically utilizing multi-satellite data.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241429","","Cities and towns;Equations;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;MODIS;Remote sensing;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Temperature sensors","atmospheric humidity;data acquisition;geophysical techniques;land surface temperature;radiative transfer;remote sensing","AD 2003;AD 2005 07 06;Beijing city;Landsat TM data;MODIS data;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;Thematic Mapper;atmospheric water vapor content;data acquisition;generalized single-channel algorithm;in situ radiosounding data;land surface temperature retrieval;radiative transfer equation;root mean square deviation;thermal infrared remote sensing","","0","","5","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Policy- based validation has been proposed earlier as a solution to this configuration problem. We propose a light-weight, SQL-based solution that uses existing well-known technologies to implement such a validation system. Our approach is based on a relational database which stores configuration data extracted from the system via a WBEM standard interface. In contrast to other approaches, we use SQL to define our policy rules as executable checks on these configuration data. Each rule is embedded in a test case, defined by an XML schema, which combines each check with an explanation component and an action component. These components retrieve information about the SAN components that cause the check to fail and provide methods that will be invoked on a success or a failure of the test. Although the approach is more general, we focus on the application for Storage Area Networks. We also give some example policies for SAN configuration and their implementations and show how in addition all policy types presented by Agrawal et al.

The Maintenance Free Operating Period (MFOP) initiative implemented as part of the sonar system deployed on US Navy submarines is leveraging the enhancement and automation. Off-hull data transfer from fielded MFOP sonar systems currently exists. Data is sent back to the system Life Cycle Integrator (LCI) as an e-mail attachment for manual analyses and response. Advancement in Remote Off-Hull Maintenance Support (ROHMS) and Autonomic Logistics (AL) analysis has transformed data transfer, analysis and response to be more automated vs. a manual procedural based approach. ROHMS is a WEB application with communication protocol links to MFOP system agents that retrieve data and transmit it back to the LCI. Data is then analyzed at the LCI by predetermined intelligent agents and logistics process triggers. Data transfer advancements paralleled by autonomic logistics analysis results in optimum support responses for improved System A<sub>o</sub>. This concept of maintenance could also be applied to electric ship technologies.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0947-0; POD:1-4244-0946-2","10.1109/ESTS.2007.372069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4233805","","Automation;Availability;Data analysis;Information retrieval;Logistics;Performance analysis;Protocols;Sonar;System performance;Underwater vehicles","electric vehicles;information retrieval;maintenance engineering;naval engineering computing;power engineering computing;ships;underwater vehicles","US Navy submarines;autonomic logistics;autonomous data transfer;commercial off the shelf systems;data retrieval;e-mail attachment;electric ship technologies;fielded open architecture;intelligent agents;life cycle integrator;logistics process triggers;maintenance free operating period;procedural based approach;remote off-hull maintenance support;sonar systems;subsequent analysis;system operational availability","","0","","","","","21-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We also analyze the emissivity characteristics of common objects about 160 kinds provided by JPL spectral database between thermal band 11, 12, 13, 14 and find that there is approximate linear relationship between them. For common 80 kinds terrors, the average emissivities error of band 11 and 14 are all under 0.01, the max emissivity error is under 0.0097 for band 11 and 14. So we can obtain six equations and six unknown parameters. In order to improve the accuracy, we can make some classification before retrieving land surface temperature. We can use three methods to resolve the equations. The first is that we make classification for image and get different equation, then resolve the equation. The second is Least-squares. The third is that, we can simulate database according to the characteristics of objects and utilize the neural network to resolve equations.

In this contribution we identify major business metrics which are influenced by mobile tool integration into mobile business processes. Therefore a mobile workforce solution for IT-service technicians has been implemented and usability tested. The deployment of the mobile workforce solution has been investigated in two industrial case studies in two different companies. Additionally mobile tool deployment of different systems in three technical customer service companies has been investigated through exploratory case study research. The results show that (a) same archetypical business process metrics are affected after mobile tool deployment and (b) user involvement in business process reengineering and tool development fosters tool acceptance and usage.","","POD:1-4244-1295-1","10.1109/BDIM.2007.375020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261109","Business Process Improvement;Mobile Business Processes;Mobile Information and Communication Technology","Application specific processors;Business communication;Business process re-engineering;Communication channels;Communications technology;Companies;Customer service;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Resource management","DP management;business process re-engineering;mobile computing","IT management;IT-service technicians;business process metrics;business process reengineering;corporate IT-systems;customer service companies;mobile tool deployment;mobile workforce solution;mobile-integrated business processes;user involvement","","0","","5","","","21-21 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large rainfall dataset that is derived from an operational C-band dual-polarized radar, which is placed in S. Pietro Capoflume near Bologna (Italy), has been collected and analyzed for this purpose. Different models of convective rainy horizontal structures are described and compared. Special attention is devoted to the consolidated unimodal models (or unimodal patterns) like Gaucell with a Gaussian rain-rate profile and Excell with an exponential rain-rate profile, and the hybrid models like Hycell and Dexcell based on a proper combination of the previous unimodal models. The new hybrid model Dexell, which is introduced here, is an extension of the Hycell model, which is previously proposed in literature. A pixel-by-pixel model numerical integration is carried out in order to perform a homogeneous comparison between the rain-cell model and the measured features such as peak, average, root mean square, gradient average, and gradient deviation of rain rate. A maximum-likelihood algorithm, which is expressed in terms of the principal component of the previous rain-cell features, is introduced to estimate rain-cell pattern parameters from the available radar data. A detailed sensitivity analysis, which is devoted to find the best behavior in terms of root-mean-square error and correlation coefficient between the modeled and measured rain-cell features, is finally carried out.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.896551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261070","Convective systems;radar meteorology;radar retrieval;rain modeling;rainfall","Information retrieval;Maximum likelihood estimation;Meteorological radar;Numerical models;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Radar measurements;Rain;Root mean square;Shape measurement","geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;maximum likelihood estimation;meteorological radar;principal component analysis;rain;sensitivity analysis","Bologna;C-band weather radar data;Dexcell;Excell;Gaussian rain rate profile;Hycell;Italy;S.

The current approach to terrain correction calculates the pierce point of the center of each observation with a digital terrain model. With the recent Shuttle Radar Terrain Mapping Mission (SRTM) terrain model data, which has a higher spatial resolution and better accuracy than previous global terrain models, there is an opportunity to improve geolocation accuracy in rough terrain by using more advanced techniques to compute geolocations that are more representative of the centroid of each observation. The authors evaluate whether calculating geolocation using an observation weighting approach is significantly better than calculating the pierce point geolocation and if so under what conditions. The relative additional computational cost of an approximate technique is weighed against the possible increase in geolocation accuracy.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241437","","Digital elevation models;Earth Observing System;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Instruments;MODIS;Satellites;Spaceborne radar;Terrain mapping","geophysical techniques;remote sensing","EOS Aqua satellite;EOS Terra satellite;Earth Observing System;Earth terrain correction;MODIS;NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;SRTM terrain model data;Shuttle Radar Terrain Mapping Mission;geolocation accuracy;geophysical parameters;observation weighting approach","","2","","3","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model was developed using a long-term dataset acquired over the bare soil in the framework of the Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment (SMOSREX). It is shown that the roughness effects are different depending on the measurement configuration, in terms of incidence angle and polarization. However, in this paper, a simple parameterization that is based on a single roughness parameter was calibrated in order to account for this angular and polarization dependencies. This parameter was found to be dependent on soil moisture: drier conditions were associated to higher ldquoroughnessrdquo conditions. The root-mean-square error between the measured and modeled reflectivities on days when no precipitation events were detected at vertical polarization (V-pol) is 0.0275, and at horizontal polarization (H-pol), the rmse is 0.0237; all incidence angles were considered. When all data are considered, the rmsd for V-pol is 0.0350, and for H-pol, the rmse is 0.0373. This new simple model is suitable for soil moisture retrieval from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity data. By means of this simple parameterization, almost two years of soil moisture data were retrieved with a good accuracy. The SMOSREX dataset allowed to ensure a long-term suitability of the proposed parameterization.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.894935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261052","Bare soil;L-band radiometry;emissivity;soil moisture;surface roughness","Information retrieval;L-band;Polarization;Reflectivity;Rough surfaces;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Soil measurements;Soil moisture;Surface roughness","geophysical techniques;microwave reflectometry;moisture;radiometry;soil","L-band emission;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity data;Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment SMOSREX;bare soil microwave emission model;parameterization;reflectivity model;soil moisture;soil roughness","","63","","22","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Issues About Retrieving Sea Surface Salinity in Coastal Areas From SMOS Data","S. Zine; J. Boutin; P. Waldteufel; J. L. Vergely; T. Pellarin; P. Lazure","Univ.

These areas are characterized by strong and variable SSS gradients [several practical salinity units (psu)] on relatively small scales: the extent of river plumes is highly variable, typically at kilometric and daily scales. Monitoring this variability from SMOS measurements is particularly challenging because of their resolution (typically 30-100 km) and because of the contamination by the nearby land. A set of academic tests was conducted with a linear coastline and constant geophysical parameters, and more realistic tests were conducted over the Bay of Biscay. The bias of the retrieved SSS has been analyzed, as well as the root mean square (rms) of the bias, and the retrieved SSS compared to a numerical hydrodynamic model in the semirealistic case. The academic study showed that the Blackman apodization window provides the best compromise in terms of magnitude and fluctuations of the bias of the retrieved SSS. Whatever the type of vegetation cover, a strong negative bias, greater than 1 psu, was found when nearer than 36 km from the coast. Between 44 and 80 km, the type of vegetation cover has an impact of less than a factor 2 on the bias, and no influence further than 80 km from the coast. The semirealistic study conducted in the Bay of Biscay showed a bias over ten days lower than 0.2 psu for distances greater than 47 km, due to an averaging over various geometries (coastline orientation, swath orientation, etc.). The bias showed a weak dependence on the location of the grid point within the swath. Despite the noise on the retrieved SSS, contrasts due to the plume of the Loire River and the Gironde estuary remained detectable on ten-day averaged maps with an rms of 0.57 psu. Finally, imposing thresholds on the major axis of the measurements brought little improvement to the bias, whereas it increased the rms an- could lead to strong swath restriction: a 49-km threshold on the major axis resulted in an effective swath of 800-900 km instead of 1200 km.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.894934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4261087","<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex>$L$</tex></formula>-band radiometry;Coastal areas;Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission;sea surface salinity (SSS) retrieval","Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Pollution measurement;Rivers;SMOS mission;Sea measurements;Sea surface salinity;Testing;Vegetation mapping","oceanographic techniques;oceanography;remote sensing;rivers","Bay of Biscay;Blackman apodization window;Gironde estuary;Loire River;SMOS data;coastal areas;coastline orientation;constant geophysical parameters;distance 44 km to 80 km;linear coastline parameters;numerical hydrodynamic model;ocean salinity;river plume;sea surface salinity;soil moisture;swath orientation;vegetation cover","","27","","19","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
