However, geographical information in Web documents is rarely supplied in a machine-readable way and therefore not easily discoverable. As a consequence, it is necessary to extract geographical keywords from Web documents and to associate locations with them. This method is called location tagging. In this paper we present a location tagging approach for unstructured documents which utilizes multiple external location providers. Detected locations are ranked according to their relevance for the document, in order to identify a document's geographical focus, which is its most representative location.

It has changed the way of utilizing the IT resources but at the compromised cost of security breaches as well such as phishing attacks, impersonation, lack of confidentiality and integrity. Thus this research work deals with the core problem of providing absolute security to the mobile consumers of public cloud to improve the mobility of user's, accessing data stored on public cloud securely using tokens without depending upon the third party to generate them. This paper presents the approach of simplifying the process of authenticating and authorizing the mobile user's by implementing middleware-centric framework called MiLAMob model with the huge online data storage system i.e. HDFS. It allows the consumer's to access the data from HDFS via mobiles or through the social networking sites eg. facebook, gmail, yahoo etc using OAuth 2.0 protocol. For authentication, the tokens are generated using one-time password generation technique and then encrypting them using AES method. By implementing the flexible user based policies and standards, this model improves the authorization process.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2695-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-2696-1; POD:978-1-4799-2697-8","10.1109/ICCCNT.2014.6963051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963051","Authentication;Authorization;Computing;HDFS;MiLAMob;OAuth 2.0;Security;Token","Authentication;Cloud computing;Data models;Mobile communication;Permission;Social network services","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;information retrieval;middleware;mobile computing;protocols;social networking (online);storage management","AES method;Facebook;Gmail;HDFS data access;IT resources;MiLAMob model;OAuth 2.0 protocol;Yahoo;authorization process;cloud computing;encryption;flexible user based policies;middleware-centric framework;middleware-layer framework;mobile consumers;one-time password generation technique;online data storage system;online stored data;public cloud;security mechanism;social networking sites;tokens","","0","","6","","","11-13 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, many approaches for data extraction from web pages have been proposed and each having their own merits and limitations. This paper provides a simple but effective approach, named layout based detachment approach (LBDA). The proposed approach extracts the main content from the web page and removes the irrelevant information like header, footer contents, navigation bars, advertisements and other noisy images. The proposed methodology uses the following techniques: tag tree parsing to get the analysis structure, block acquiring page segmentation method to remove unwanted tags, and data extraction to retrieve the necessary contents. It can eliminate noise and extract the main content blocks from web page effectively and display the essential content to the users. The performance is evaluated based on the following metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, execution time and memory usage. The implementation results obviously show that our proposed LBDA approach is performed better than the existing heuristic approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3506-2; POD:978-1-4799-3507-9","10.1109/ICACCS.2013.6938748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6938748","DOM tree analysis;Web mining;Web page content extraction;Web structure mining","Data mining;HTML;Layout;Noise;Visualization;Web pages","Internet;information retrieval","LBDA approach;Web page;accuracy metric;block acquiring page segmentation method;content extraction;content retrieval;data extraction;execution time metric;layout based detachment approach;memory usage metric;precision metric;recall metric;tag tree parsing technique","","0","","18","","","19-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Particles represent geographic regions which are moving in the map space to find a region most relevant with respect to user's query. The characterization of geographic regions is based on the multi-criteria distribution of geo-located facilities or landscape structure from the Open Street Map data source.

CBF is a small array of element addresses that are connected to the array through a hashing mechanism. Counting bloom filter is used for increasing the speed of the set membership tests. If the string is a member of counting bloom filter it is encrypted using Data Encryption Standard, else the string is transmitted without encryption.

In this paper, we present a stochastic model for budget distribution over a series of sequential temporal slots under a finite time horizon, assuming that the best budget is a random variable. We study some properties and feasible solutions for our model, taking the best budget being characterized by either normal distribution or uniform distribution, respectively. Furthermore, we also make some experiments to evaluate our model and identify strategies with the real-world data collected from practical advertising campaigns. Experimental results show that a) our strategies outperform the baseline strategy that is commonly used in practice; b) the optimal budget is more likely to be normally distributed than uniformly distributed.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6058-3; POD:978-1-4799-6059-0; USB:978-1-4799-6057-6","10.1109/SOLI.2014.6960713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6960713","budget constraint;budget distribution;optimal budget;search advertisement;stochastic programming","Gaussian distribution;Programming","advertising;information retrieval;stochastic processes","allocation strategy;budget distribution;finite time horizon;normal distribution;optimal budget;search advertisements;search advertising markets;sequential temporal slots;stochastic model;temporal slot;uniform distribution","","0","","8","","","8-10 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While considerable progress has been made to recognize musical genres and instruments, relatively little attention has been paid to modeling playing techniques, which affect timbre in more subtle ways. In this paper, we contribute to this area of research by systematically evaluating various audio features and processing methods for multi-class playing technique classification, considering up to nine distinct playing techniques of bowed string instruments. Specifically, a collection of 6,759 chamber-recorded single notes of four bowed string instruments and a collection of 33 real-world solo violin recordings are used in the evaluation. Our evaluation shows that using sparse features extracted from the magnitude spectra and phase derivatives including group delay function (GDF) and instantaneous frequency deviation (IFD) leads to significantly better performance than using a combination of state-of-the-art temporal, spectral, cepstral and harmonic feature descriptors. For playing technique classification of violin singe notes, the former approach attains 0.915 macro-average F-score under a tenfold cross validation setting, while the latter only attains 0.835. Moreover, sparse modeling of magnitude and phase-derived spectra also performs well for single-note joint instrument-technique classification (F-score 0.770) and for playing technique classification of real-world violin solos (F-score 0.547). We find that phase information is particularly important in discriminating playing techniques with subtle differences, such as playing with different bowing positions (i.e., normal, sul tasto, and sul ponticello). A systematic investigation of the effect of parameters such as window sizes, hop factors, window types for phase-derived features is also reported to provide more insights.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2362006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918444","Group delay function;instantaneous frequency deviation;phase;playing technique classification;sparse coding","Encoding;Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;Instruments;Timbre;Time-frequency analysis","information retrieval;music;musical instruments","GDF;IFD;audio features methods;audio processing methods;bowed string instruments;computational modeling;group delay function;hop factors;instantaneous frequency deviation;magnitude derived spectra;magnitude spectra;multiclass playing technique classification;music information retrieval applications;musical genres;musical instruments;musical timbre;phase derivatives;phase derived features;phase derived spectra;phase information;playing technique classification;real-world violin solos;sparse feature extraction;sparse modeling;violin singe notes;window sizes;window types","","1","","53","","20141008","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

New data is constantly added, rarely updated or deleted, and every stored byte might be read at any time - a common pattern for digital archives or big data scenarios. We present the LoneStar Stack, a disk based archival storage system building block that is optimized for high reliability and energy efficiency. It provides a POSIX file system interface that uses flash based storage for write-offloading and metadata and the disk-based LoneStar RAID for user data storage. The RAID attempts to spin down disks as soon and as long as possible. For reads, only a single disk is accessed, while writes require 3 additional parity disks to be spun up. The cache aggregates new files and a semantic data placement engine decides how they are persisted to the RAID. Asynchronous data movers then persist the data. The system provides an end-to-end data integrity, an elastic fault tolerance that can at least recover from all 3-disk failures, and provides multiple paths for data integrity checking and recovery. The system can use 70% of the raw disk capacity and is optimized for fast reads with a minimum number of powered on disk drives.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4087-5; POD:978-1-4799-4086-8","10.1109/NAS.2014.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923178","Archival Storage;Disk;Energy-efficient;MAID","Ash;Databases;Disk drives;Nonvolatile memory;Random access memory;Reliability;Spinning","RAID;Unix;cache storage;data integrity;disc drives;fault tolerance;flash memories;information retrieval systems;memory architecture;meta data","3-disk failures;LoneStar Stack;POSIX file system interface;asynchronous data movers;cache;data integrity checking;data integrity recovery;disk based archival storage system;disk capacity;disk drives;disk-based LoneStar RAID;disk-based archival system architecture;elastic fault tolerance;end-to-end data integrity;energy efficiency;flash based storage;huge storage systems;metadata;parity disks;reliability;semantic data placement engine;single disk;user data storage;write once read sometimes workloads;write-offloading","","1","","29","","","6-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To implement such a tool, there exist a multitude of different approaches within the field of information retrieval, but they have to be used and combined on an individual basis to fit the requirements of a particular task.

With heaps of information flowing in the network, a service for caching preferential posts will be helpful. Understanding the profile of an individual in a social network will help determine the relationship value with respect to other individuals in the network. Similarly a post in a social network can have contexts associated with it. If these contexts are a priority to the user, they can be one of the deciding factors for pre-fetching. In summary, these values called the profile similarity value and context priority values can be used to determine strengths between individuals and their preference. Getting a uniform bandwidth is always a challenge due to the mobility of the device. In this context pre-fetching of posts most related to the user can be beneficial in increasing the social network experience on mobile devices. The value addition is that the cached data apart from being personalised it can also be consumed later and helps when the individual moves to a place with no bandwidth or even a narrow bandwidth. This paper considers the personal similarity value as social network strength coupled with context priority of the post determined by the user, to evaluate what posts could be cached.","2329-6429;23296429","Electronic:978-1-4799-5060-7; POD:978-1-4799-5061-4","10.1109/MobServ.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924291","Interest Aware;Mobile Caching;Profile Similarity","Bandwidth;Context;Facebook;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Servers","cache storage;data handling;information retrieval;mobile computing;social networking (online)","caching preferential post;context prefetching;context priority;context priority value;data handling;information flow;interest aware caching scheme;mobile device;mobile services;personal similarity value;profile similarity value;social network strength","","0","","23","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So, it is very easy to copy and access those documents on the internet. When we copy someone's content or idea without permission or citation then plagiarism occurs. This is a very big problem, as it violates the sharing of important information among valid users. According to this paper, we developed a system to detect piracy or copies regarding documents using position based weighted scheme. This scheme firstly extracts all keywords from all the sentences and then applies weighting for each keyword. And, to cover the whole sentence, we used first and last position based scheme on all extracted keywords. Thereafter, assign the weight of all extracted keywords to related synonyms or antonyms of that extracted keyword with the help of Word Net dataset 2.0. Finally, we apply the cosine similarity measure for similarity detection between two documents by considering a static database. After performing experiments on Pan Plagiarism Corpus-9 datasets, the results represent better time efficiency and best performance in comparison of existing copy detection mechanisms on the basis of Precision, Recall, and F-measure.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4237-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-4236-7; POD:978-1-4799-4235-0","10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2014.6949382","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949382","Copy detection mechanism;keyword extraction;similarity measure;weighted scheme","Databases;Feature extraction;Information technology;Next generation networking;Plagiarism;Pragmatics;Semantics","Internet;computer crime;copy protection;information retrieval;text analysis","F-measure;Internet;Pan Plagiarism Corpus-9 datasets;Word Net dataset 2.0;antonyms;copy detection mechanism;cosine similarity measure;digital form;documents access;documents copy;information sharing;keywords extraction;piracy detection;plagiarism;position based weighted scheme;sentences;similarity detection;static database;synonyms","","0","","17","","","25-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These studies mainly focus on how users feel while using such applications. In this paper, we focus on how users behave and react to communication network quality. We analyze the telecom traffic of smartphones passively monitored from 3G mobile network and show the effect of network quality on the users' web behavior. In particular, we investigate user behavior as a series of multiple actions in a flow of web browsing. We show that the observed results coincide with the MOS obtained through subjective analysis: The condition of network quality where the users' web behavior changes matches with the condition where the MOS starts to degrade. In addition, the obtained results illustrate that the users perform various reactive actions depending on the perceived network quality. Specifically, users generate more web traffic and transactions when the qualities of the network are both good and poor.","","Electronic:978-0-9883045-0-5; POD:978-1-4799-5599-2","10.1109/ITC.2014.6932954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6932954","QoE;mobile traffic;network quality;passive monitoring;web behavior","Correlation;Delays;Mobile computing;Monitoring;Quality of service;Smart phones;Throughput","3G mobile communication;Internet;human factors;information retrieval;mobile computing;quality of experience;smart phones;telecommunication traffic","3G mobile network;MOS;QoE;Web browsing;communication network quality;mean opinion score;quality of experience;smart phone telecom traffic;user reaction","","0","","24","","","9-11 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Major challenges of Healthcare Information Exchange result from patient's medical records being kept in several healthcare provider offices, clinics and hospitals in different formats. There are two major problems with healthcare information retrieval. The first problem is lack of visibility and knowledge as to where patient's medical records reside. The second problem is lack of access to information and also incompatibility of data formats. A considerable coverage of Electronic Information Exchange among Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems remains to be implemented despite extensive standardization efforts toward providing solutions. The adoption pace of available standards and solutions has been slow with the exception of some public/government entities. This paper describes a comprehensive and practical solution based on a distributed system with independent subsystems that control and manage processes and data flow of information exchange. The Registrar Subsystem creates a directory of healthcare providers and patients. The Security Subsystem provides authentication and authorization services across all subsystems. The Locators address patient and medical location lookup. The Agents act on behalf of healthcare providers to communicate with other subsystems. The Mediators facilitate information retrieval. The Solution comprises of three levels of participation that allows healthcare providers to join the system easily by starting from basic semi-manual information exchange level and then migrating to a fully electronic and automated information exchange. The Solution is modeled based on variety of standards and protocols used in Internet and other application fields as well as healthcare specific standards and proposals.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4244-7929-0; POD:978-1-4244-7927-6","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6943852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6943852","","Authorization;Computer architecture;Information exchange;Medical services;Protocols;Standards","Internet;authorisation;electronic health records;health care;information retrieval","EHR systems;Internet;authentication services;authorization services;automated information exchange;data flow;distributed system;electronic based systems;electronic health record system;electronic information exchange;healthcare cost;healthcare information exchange system;healthcare information retrieval;healthcare providers;hybrid central-federated model;independent subsystems;locators;mediators;medical location lookup;patient medical records;protocols;registrar subsystem;security subsystem;semimanual information exchange level;solution modelling","","0","","23","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research focuses on evaluating the paraphrase between the sentences. In this paper, an approach for detecting paraphrase is tested by counting tokens. It processes token matching with the help of synonym of tokens, and produces the result with SVM classifier using Plagiarism detection corpus (PAN). Thus the SVM produces the output as +1 if the given text is paraphrased, - 1 if the given text is not paraphrased.

However, the storage, preprocessing, and analysis of experimental data are becoming a main bottleneck in the pharmacogenomics analysis pipeline, due to the increasing number of genes and patients investigated.

Therefore, many traditional community detection techniques do not apply directly. In this paper, we propose an empirical approach for extracting data from Q&A sites suitable to apply community detection methods.

Data storage and retrieval services need to be modernized for secure communication in the cloud. So, in this paper, user centric personalization and prediction based searching techniques have been proposed to improve the data storage and retrieval services in cloud. Personalization is the concept of categorizing the data based on the user needs and prediction, where the relevant files needed by a user are retrieved based on the user requirement. Personalization is achieved by categorizing the user's files storage. The middleware is used as a support to the data owner, to perform all the necessary encryption and hashing required for secure storage. The data in the cloud server is partitioned into clusters based on the category and similarity. When a user requests for a file, the middleware receives a set of similar files from the cloud server from which the most relevant file is predicted and returned to the user based on the search log and access rights of the user by boosting and bagging techniques. The performance of the EDSRPPC system is measured based on the rate of relevancy of the returned files and also the time required for retrieval of the files from the cloud storage. The experimental result proves that EDSRPPC system as an efficient personalization and prediction framework for data storage and retrieval.","2377-6927;23776927","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3447-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-3448-5; POD:978-1-4799-3449-2","10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6921986","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921986","Bagging;Boosting;Cloud computing;Personalization;Prediction","Barium;Cryptography;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;information retrieval;middleware;network servers;telecommunication security;user centred design","EDSRPPC system;bagging techniques;boosting techniques;cloud computing;cloud personalization;cloud server;data storage and retrieval;file retrieval;middleware;necessary encryption;prediction based searching techniques;remote based massive and scalable data storage services;secure communication;user centric personalization;user file storage;user needs;user prediction","","0","","22","","","18-20 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of singer identification is to identify the singer independent of training data. The training and testing phase are done for direct film song (vocal with background) for 10 singers. In training phase 15 film songs of a singer is taken as input. The input songs are made to undergo a set of pre-processing steps. The three stages of preprocessing are pre-emphasis, frame blocking and windowing. The Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) features are extracted from each frames of pre-processed signal. The singer model is developed by K-means clustering algorithm for each singer. In clustering method, the cluster centroids are obtained for cluster size of 256 and stored. One model is created for each singer by performing training and testing on the songs considered directly. Mean of minimum distances is computed for each model. Singer is classified based on selection of the model which produces minimum of average. The singer information is main factor in organizing and exploring music data. Singer identification also extends its application in music indexing and retrieval.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3356-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-3358-7; POD:978-1-4799-3359-4","10.1109/ICCSP.2014.6950180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950180","Clustering Algorithm;PLP;Singer identification","Clustering algorithms;Indexes","cepstral analysis;feature extraction;indexing;information retrieval;speaker recognition","K-means clustering algorithm;PLP;cluster centroids;feature extraction;frame blocking;music indexing;music retrieval;perceptual linear prediction;singer identification;singer model;training data","","0","","8","","","3-5 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The increased usage of internet and the exchange of user opinions through social media and public forums on the web has become the motivation for sentiment analysis. Due to the infinite amount of user opinions available throughout the web it is necessary to automatically analyze and classify sentiment expressed in opinions. The basic task of sentiment analysis or opinion mining is sentiment classification which classifies the content as positive, negative and irrelevant. This paper discusses an approach where an exposed stream of tweets from the Twitter micro blogging site are preprocessed and classified based on their sentiments. In sentiment classification system the concept of opinion subjectivity has been accounted. In this paper, we present opinion detection and organization subsystem, which have already been integrated into our larger question-answering system. The subjectivity classification system uses Genetic-Based Machine Learning (GBML) technique that considers subjectivity as a semantic problem. The classification of a review is predicted through the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs. Experimental results of the proposed techniques are efficient and generate eminent evaluations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4982-3; POD:978-1-4799-4981-6","10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6921417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921417","Genetic algorithm;Semantic orientation;Sentiment Classification;Sentiment analysis","Blogs;Feature extraction;Semantics;Sentiment analysis;Sociology;Speech;Twitter","Internet;data mining;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);question answering (information retrieval);social networking (online);user interfaces","GBML technique;Internet;Twitter;World Wide Web;decision making;genetic-based machine learning;micro blogging site;opinion mining;public forums;question-answering system;semantic orientation;sentiment analysis;sentiment classification;social media;user opinions","","2","","17","","","6-8 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Developed countries are concerned that unequal protection of IPRs may result in a significant loss through unauthorized imitation in other countries while developing countries think that stronger IPRs would increase the costs of technology acquirement and raise the price of consumer products. The differences in IPR policies have led to significant disputes in international trade. Over the past four decades many researchers have investigated various issues regarding the protection of intellectual property rights. This paper adopts a unique approach to review the development trajectories of IPR research over the past four decades. We use ISI web of science (WOS) as the data source to retrieve the related literature and their citation data, and then apply the main path analysis on the citation data to identify the key-route main paths of the citation-based network. A total of 3184 papers and their citation data were retrieved and analyzed.

In this study, we addressed the problem of identifying questions as being hard or easy by means of a probability model. In addition, we observed the phenomenon called knowledge gap that is related to the habit of users and used a knowledge gap diagram to illustrate how much of a knowledge gap exists in different categories. To this end, we proposed an approach called the knowledge-gap-based difficulty rank (KG-DRank) algorithm, which combines the user-user network and the architecture of the CQA service to find hard questions.

An information-fusion algorithm is developed based on Dempster-Shafer theory to merge the information from various sources with different reliabilities and generate the strength of support for each possible cause. A dynamic reference network is created and updated to record all information obtained during the interleaved search and reasoning process. Ihands performs a bi-directional search: from symptoms to possible causes and also from possible causes to most likely symptoms and risk factors. Bayesian inference mechanism is used to identify the confidence level for each possible cause given the user's symptoms and EHR. When needed, an iterative broaden search will be conducted to increase the confidence level to exceed a pre-set threshold or to further distinguish a few possible causes with very close confidence levels.

What is the use of ratings of affect for the study of affective computing and how should we treat them? These are the key questions this paper attempts to address by investigating the impact of dissimilar representations of annotated affect on the efficacy of affect modelling. In particular, we compare several different binary-class and pairwise preference representations for automatically learning from ratings of affect. The representations are compared and tested on three datasets: one synthetic dataset (testing “in vitro ”) and two affective datasets (testing “in vivo”). The synthetic dataset couples a number of attributes with generated rating values. The two affective datasets contain physiological and contextual user attributes, and speech attributes, respectively; these attributes are coupled with ratings of various affective and cognitive states. The main results of the paper suggest that ratings (when used) should be naturally transformed to ordinal (ranked) representations for obtaining more reliable and generalisable models of affect.

With overwhelming amount of information available in social media today, it becomes also impossible to search for information that is time and location-relevant. Therefore, we see a need to create a mobile application that can provide users interesting and relevant information based on user's preferences, location and time and thus develops a mobile application, namely OPLITOP. We hope that the developed application could serve as a localized broadcast media that can notify users of critical and dangerous situations that may be relevant to the users. OPLITOP is first developed on the Android operating system and it uses several software tools such as Google maps, phpMyAdmin web server and Eclipse for implementation.

Decision makers including academics, program managers, venture capital investors, industry leaders and funding agencies not only need to be abreast of latest developments but also be able to assess the effect of growth in certain areas on their core business. Though analyst agencies like Gartner, McKinsey etc. Provide such reports for some areas, thought leaders of all organisations still need to amass data from heterogeneous collections like research publications, analyst reports, patent applications, competitor information etc. To help them finalize their own strategies. Text mining and data analytics researchers have been looking at integrating statistics, text analytics and information visualization to aid the process of retrieval and analytics. In this paper, we present our work on automated topical analysis and insight generation from large heterogeneous text collections of publications and patents. While most of the earlier work in this area provides search-based platforms, ours is an integrated platform for search and analysis. We have presented several methods and techniques that help in analysis and better comprehension of search results. We have also presented methods for generating insights about emerging and popular trends in research along with contextual differences between academic research and patenting profiles. We also present novel techniques to present topic evolution that helps users understand how a particular area has evolved over time.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927531","analyzing research trends;mining patent databases;mining publications","Context;Data mining;Data visualization;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Market research;Patents","data analysis;information retrieval;patents;text analysis","academic research;automated topical analysis;heterogeneous document collections;insight generation;large heterogeneous text collections;patenting profiles;publications;topic evolution","","1","","14","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Ranking Linked-Entities in a Sentiment Graph","F. Peleja; J. Santos; J. Magalhães","Dept. Comput. Sci., Univ.

This analysis leverages on a sentiment lexicon that includes general sentiment words that characterize the general sentiment towards the targeted named-entity. However, in most cases, target entities are themselves part of the sentiment lexicon, creating a loop from which it is difficult to infer an entity reputation. Sometimes, the entity became a reference in the domain and is vastly cited as an example of a highly reputable entity. For example, in the movies domain it is not uncommon to see reviews citing Batman or Anthony Hopkins as esteemed references. In this paper we describe a three-step procedure to perform reputation analysis of linked entities. First, our method jointly extracts named entities reputation and a domain specific sentiment lexicon. Second, an entities graph is created by analyzing cross-citations in subjective sentences. Third, the entities reputation are updated through an iterative optimization that exploits the graph of the linked-entities. The proposed approach closely models real-world domains, where domain specific jargon is common and entities are so popular that they become widely used as sentiment references. The evaluation on a graph with 12,687 vertices, of which 3,177 are linked entities and 9,510 are sentiment words, shows that our approach can improve the correct detection of an entity's reputation.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927615","LDA;Reputation analysis;sentiment lexicons","Computational modeling;Computer science;Dictionaries;Markov random fields;Motion pictures;Sentiment analysis;Twitter","graph theory;information retrieval systems;iterative methods;natural language processing;optimisation","cross-citation analysis;domain specific sentiment lexicon extraction;entities graph;entity reputation detection;general sentiment words;information retrieval system;iterative optimization;linked entities;linked-entity ranking;movies domain;named entities reputation extraction;named-entities;reputable entity;reputation analysis;sentiment analysis task;sentiment graph;subjective sentences;vertices","","0","","32","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Summarization is such an important data analysis technique which can be broadly classified into two categories as semantic and syntactic methods. Syntactic methods consider a dataset as a sequence of bytes whereas semantic methods convert large dataset into a much smaller one yet maintaining low information loss. Clustering algorithms are widely used for semantic summarization such as basic k-means. Existing clustering based summarization techniques assume that a summary is represented using the cluster centroids. However, the centroids might not represent the actual data points in summary. In addition, many clustering algorithms, such as the most popular k-means algorithm requires the number of clusters as an input, which is not available for unsupervised summarization of unlabeled data. To address these issues, we propose a clustering based semantic summarization using a combination of x-means and k-medoid clustering algorithms. Our experimental analysis shows that, the proposed algorithm outperforms k-means based summarization techniques.","2156-2318;21562318","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4316-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4315-9; POD:978-1-4799-4314-2","10.1109/ICIEA.2014.6931456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6931456","Clustering;Data Summarization","Conferences;Decision support systems;Industrial electronics","data analysis;data mining;information retrieval;pattern clustering","bytes sequence;cluster centroids;clustering based semantic data summarization technique;data analysis technique;data mining techniques;data repositories;information extraction;information loss;k-means algorithm;k-medoid clustering algorithms;large dataset;semantic methods;syntactic methods;x-means clustering algorithms","","1","","14","","","9-11 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features of web pages like images, videos etc., are extracted by crawling them and the user's general interest in those features are learnt from past queries made and clicks on particular results. Using the degree to which each feature is present and the corresponding interest of the user, the user's interest in a particular search result is predicted and consequently the results are re-ranked in such a way that it augments the efficiency and effectiveness of conventional intent / meaning driven semantic search concept.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6715-5; POD:978-1-4799-6716-2","10.1109/SKG.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6964667","Search engine ranking;re-ranking of search results;semantic search;user interests;webpage features","Feature extraction;Search engines;Semantics;Vectors;Videos;Web pages;Web search","Internet;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","Web page feature extraction;adaptive semantic search;implicit learning;link structure;semantic algorithms;semantic search concept;user clicks;user interests","","0","","18","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when data updates are allowed, it is a great challenge to simultaneously improve performance and reliability while ensuring data consistency of such huge and widely distributed data. In this paper, we address this problem. We propose a new quorum-based data replication protocol with the objectives of minimizing the data update cost, providing high availability and data consistency.

Generally, the experts' answers are more likely to be the best answers. Existing studies considered that user expertise is reflected by the voting scores of both answers and questions. However, voting scores of questions are not really related to user expertise. In this paper, we proposed a new probabilistic model to depict users' expertise based on answers and their descriptive ability based on questions.

Researchers in the field use this databases to extract new knowledge and also share their own discoveries. However, when these researchers need to find relevant information in the data, they still rely on the traditional search approach, based on text matching, that is not appropriate to be used in these large amounts of heterogeneous biodiversity's data, leading to search results with low precision and recall. We present a new architecture that tackle this problem using a semantic search system for biodiversity data. Semantic search aims to improve search accuracy by using ontologies to understand user objectives and the contextual meaning of terms used in the search to generate more relevant results. Biodiversity data is mapped to terms from relevant ontologies, such as Darwin Core, DBpedia, Ontobio and Catalogue of Life, stored using semantic web formats and queried using semantic web tools (such as triple stores). A prototype semantic search tool was successfully implemented and evaluated by users from the National Research Institute for the Amazon (INPA). Our results show that the semantic search approach has a better precision (28% improvement) and recall (25% improvement) when compared to keyword based search, when used in a big set of representative biodiversity data (206,000 records) from INPA and the Emilio Gueldi Museum in Pará (MPEG). We also show that, because the biodiversity data is now in semantic web format and mapped to ontology terms, it is easy to enhance it with information from other sources, an example using deforestation data (from the National Institute of Space Research - INPE) to enrich collection data is shown.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927553","Biodiversity;Data Integration;Ontology;Semantic Search;Semantic Web","Biodiversity;Bioinformatics;OWL;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Search problems;Semantics","data integration;database management systems;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Catalogue of Life;DBpedia;Darwin Core;Emilio Gueldi Museum in Pará;INPA;INPE;MPEG;National Institute of Space Research;National Research Institute for the Amazon;Ontobio;biodiversity data retrieval;databases;deforestation data;heterogeneous biodiversity data;keyword based search;ontologies;representative biodiversity data;semantic Web formats;semantic Web tools;semantic search system;text matching search approach","","3","","15","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, problems occur in assessing semantic similarity over genetic aspects that are represented independently in different schemas when, in reality, they are not. This paper presents a framework that integrates heterogeneous knowledge from different resources (i.e. ontologies, texts, expert classifications) for capturing information about how a set of genes work together in targeting a biological process. Our approach grounds on the ontological annotation of gene summaries. Given the analogy between these annotations and the representation of documents in information retrieval, we apply techniques used in text mining to evaluate the semantic similarity of summaries within a gene set. To determine if our framework makes sense in a biological context, we conducted experiments on popular gene sets and compared results with what asserted by domain experts. Our approach provides an empirical basis for capturing complementary information about how genes interact and could be used in conjunction with other similarity methods or bioinformatic tools.","1524-4547;15244547","Electronic:978-1-4799-4249-7; POD:978-1-4799-4248-0","10.1109/WETICE.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927094","Bio-organizations;Gene summaries;Ontologies;Semantic annotation","Biomedical measurement;Ontologies;Organizations;Protein engineering;Proteins;Semantics","bioinformatics;data mining;genetics;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);text analysis","bioinformatic tools;biological ontologies;biological process;documents representation;gene information;gene set;gene summaries;genetic aspects;heterogeneous knowledge;information retrieval;ontological annotation;ontological information;semantic similarity;similarity methods;text mining","","3","","16","","","23-25 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"SoK: Introspections on Trust and the Semantic Gap","B. Jain; M. B. Baig; D. Zhang; D. E. Porter; R. Sion","","2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","20141120","2014","","","605","620","An essential goal of Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) is assuring security policy enforcement and overall functionality in the presence of an untrustworthy OS. A fundamental obstacle to this goal is the difficulty in accurately extracting semantic meaning from the hypervisor's hardware level view of a guest OS, called the semantic gap. Over the twelve years since the semantic gap was identified, immense progress has been made in developing powerful VMI tools. Unfortunately, much of this progress has been made at the cost of reintroducing trust into the guest OS, often in direct contradiction to the underlying threat model motivating the introspection. Although this choice is reasonable in some contexts and has facilitated progress, the ultimate goal of reducing the trusted computing base of software systems is best served by a fresh look at the VMI design space. This paper organizes previous work based on the essential design considerations when building a VMI system, and then explains how these design choices dictate the trust model and security properties of the overall system. The paper then observes portions of the VMI design space which have been under-explored, as well as potential adaptations of existing techniques to bridge the semantic gap without trusting the guest OS. Overall, this paper aims to create an essential checkpoint in the broader quest for meaningful trust in virtualized environments through VM introspection.","1081-6011;10816011","Electronic:978-1-4799-4686-0; POD:978-1-4799-4685-3","10.1109/SP.2014.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6956590","VM Introspection;semantic gap;trust","Data structures;Kernel;Linux;Monitoring;Security;Semantics;Virtual machine monitors","information retrieval;security of data;trusted computing;virtual machines;virtualisation","VMI system;semantic gap;semantic meaning extraction;system security;trusted computing base;virtual machine introspection;virtualized environments","","12","","94","","","18-21 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With increased availability of information through WWW, it is very difficult to read all documents to retrieve the desired results; therefore there is a need of summarization methods which can help in providing contents of a given document in a precise manner. Keywords of a document may provide a compact representation of a document's content. As a result various algorithms and systems intended to carry out automatic keywords extraction have been proposed in the recent past. However, the existing solutions require either training models or domain specific information for automatic keyword extraction. To cater to these shortcomings an innovative hybrid approach for automatic keyword extraction using statistical and linguistic features of a document has been proposed. This statistical and linguistic technique based keyword extraction works on an individual document without any prior parameter change and takes full advantage of all the features of the document to extract the keywords. The extracted keywords can than assist in domain specific indexing. The performance of the proposed method as compared to existing Keyword Extraction tools such as Dream web design etc. in terms of Precision and Recall are also presented in this paper.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2981-8; POD:978-1-4799-2982-5","10.1109/ICISCON.2014.6965218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6965218","Domain ontology;Extractor;Key-phrase;Linguistic technique;Statistical technique;Unsupervised-approach","Data mining;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Ontologies;Pragmatics;Web pages","Internet;computational linguistics;indexing;information resources;information retrieval;statistical analysis","World Wide Web;automatic keywords extraction;document retrieval;domain specific indexing;information resource;keyword extraction;linguistic features;statistical features","","1","","8","","","1-2 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, from the psychological perspective, customers like to use their name as their identity, not a customer number or ID number. Unfortunately in current CRM systems, customers are not often recognized by their personal names only. The task of customer recognition is made more difficult by the common occurrence of many popular names. Also, as they have access to different communication channels, CRM systems keep in touch by various means. In the present paper, an intelligent online customer recognition (IOCR) framework is proposed which takes into consideration the presence of the more common or popular personal names of its customers.

Its size does not stop growing day by day. Web page classification becomes crucial due to this overwhelming amount of data. Web pages contain many noisy contents that bias textual classifiers and lead them to lose focus on their main subject. Web pages are related to each other either implicitly by users' intuitive judgments or explicitly by hyperlinks. Thus, the use of those links in order to correct a class assigned by textual classifier to a web page can be beneficial. In this paper, we propose a post classification corrective approach called Clique Based Correction (CBC) that uses the query-log to build an implicit neighborhood, and collectively corrects classes assigned by a textual classifier to web pages of that neighborhood. This correction helps improve text classifier's results by correcting wrongly assigned categories. When two web pages are linked to each other, they may share the same topic, but when more web pages (three for example) are all related to each other, the probability that those web pages share the same subject becomes stronger. The proposed method operates in four steps. In the first step, it builds a graph called implicit graph, whose vertices are web pages and edges are implicit links. In the second step, it uses a text classifier to determine classes of all web pages represented by vertices in the implicit graph. In the third step, it extracts cliques of web pages from the implicit graph. In the fourth step, it assigns a class to every clique using a voting process. Each web page will be labeled using the class of its clique. This adjustment leads to improvements of results provided by the text classifier. We conduct our experiments using three classifiers: SVM (Support Vector Machine), NB (Naïve Bayes) and KNN (K Nearest Neighbors), on two subsets of ODP (Open Directory Project). Results show that: (1) when applied after SVM, NB or KNN, CBC helps bringing improvements on r- sults. (2) The number of unrelated web pages must be low in order to have significant improvement.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927662","correction;maximum clique;query-log;semantic web;web page classification","Art;Classification algorithms;Computers;Niobium;Support vector machines;Text categorization;Web pages","Bayes methods;Internet;classification;graph theory;information retrieval;support vector machines","K nearest neighbor;KNN;Naïve Bayes;ODP;SVM;Web page classification corrective approach;World Wide Web;clique based correction;implicit graph;open directory project;query-log;support vector machine;textual classifier","","0","","24","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With advances in social media and the Web, Q&A sites have become a major source of information for Internet users. Response time of a question is an important aspect in these sites as it is associated with the users' satisfaction and engagement, and thus the lifespan of these online communities. In this paper we study and estimate response time for questions in StackOverflow, a popular online Q&A forum where software developers post and answer questions related to programming. We analyze a long list of factors in the data and identify those that have clear relation with response time. Our key finding is that tag-related factors, such as their “popularity” (how often the tag is used) and the number of their “subscribers” (how many users can answer questions containing the tag), provide much stronger evidence than factors not related to tags. Finally, we learn models using the identified evidential features for predicting the response time of questions, which also demonstrate the significance of tags chosen by the question asker.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5877-1; POD:978-1-4799-5878-8; USB:978-1-4799-5876-4","10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921605","collective intelligence;evidential feature analysis;human behavior;online communities;question answering sites;question response time;user engagement","Conferences;Correlation;Internet;Predictive models;Programming;Social network services;Time factors","Web sites;question answering (information retrieval)","Internet users;StackOverflow;online communities;popular online Q&A forum;question and answer site;social media","","6","","18","","","17-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, because multi-core systems use shared memory, the bottleneck for speedup lies in the memory I/O. The only way to fully utilize multiple cores is to increase parallelism and concurrency. This paper proposes a new collision array based workload assignment to increase data request cancellation. Through a task flow partitioning algorithm, we minimize sequential data access and then dynamically schedule tasks while increasing the data request cancellations. We have shown experimentally that this method can boost general system throughput by 3 times and reduce the execution time by an average of 27.6%. For a 3×3 multi-core system, if all nine cores are utilized, the speedup can reach 5.0 times. If only three cores are utilized to reduce communication and power, the proposed method can obtain 2.3 times speedup.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3195-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-3197-2; POD:978-1-4799-3198-9","10.1109/InfoSEEE.2014.6947862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6947862","collision array;concurrent;multi-core system;workload assignment","Arrays;Dynamic scheduling;Multicore processing;Parallel processing;Partitioning algorithms;Throughput","data structures;information retrieval;shared memory systems","collision array;data request cancellation;execution time;memory I-O;multicore systems;sequential data access;shared memory;single core systems;task flow partitioning algorithm;workload assignment","","0","","16","","","26-28 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most glossing tools are still developed following a monolithic approach for a specific system or language due to its complexity. As e-Learning platforms are moving from monolithic applications to service based platforms suitable for Cloud environments, the tools as well should be designed following Service-Oriented principles. This work focuses on the design of automatic glossing services suitable for Cloud environments. The development follows an original Virtual-Model-View-Controller design pattern for the creation of loosely coupled components. The services are assembled in a web-based tool called Wiki Gloss. Wikipedia Miner is used to extract the content to feed the glosses from Wikipedia, taking advantage of the vast content and diversity of topics that are already available, as well as languages.

As a result, IR (Information Retrieval) tool has been developed, it provides a more effective ways for users to categorize relevant data. Most of the clustering algorithm like Vector Space Model considers only single words but it is not incremental so it can't be applied on-line and another algorithm, STC, involves `trie' concept to identify shared phrases suitable to apply on-line, but the main problem is, it doesn't work for large number of data set. In this paper, we have introduced DIGE clustering algorithm which generates the clusters based on the common phrases and also on the single terms. DIGE clustering algorithm based on the DIG model for the representation of documents. The construction of DIG model is incremental, so DIGE is also capable to produce cluster using online document and also it doesn't occupy much memory, so also applicable for offline.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4674-7; POD:978-1-4799-4673-0","10.1109/ICDMIC.2014.6954222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6954222","Clustering;Document Index Graph;Incremental Algorithm;Phrase Cluster;Suffix Tree Clustering;Web-Snippets","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Indexes;Merging;Rivers;Search engines;Vectors","Internet;document handling;graph theory;information retrieval;pattern clustering","DIG model;DIGE clustering algorithm;IR tool;document index graph;document representation;information retrieval tool;online document;real time clustering method;search engine","","0","","21","","","5-6 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then trained for each tag. The test tracks are tagged by the output probability of GMMs. To evaluate the quality of the proposed music auto-tagging system, the per-tag precision and recall rates and F-score are measured. Experiment results indicate that the performance of the models trained with the original feature sets is comparable with those trained with MFCC.

A regularization method is proposed based on sparsity constraints and it is compared to other well-known deconvolution methods.

As a result, content becomes directly accessible and routable within the network. In this data-centric paradigm, techniques for maintaining content confidentiality and privacy typically rely on cryptographic techniques similar to those used in modern digital rights management (DRM) applications, which often require multiple consumer-to-producer (end-to-end) messages to be transmitted to establish identities, acquire licenses, and access encrypted content. In this paper, we present a secure content distribution architecture for CCN that is based on proxy re-encryption. Our design provides strong end-to-end content security and reduces the number of protocol messages required for user authentication and key retrieval. Unlike widely-deployed solutions, our solution is also capable of utilizing the opportunistic in-network caches in CCN. We also experimentally compare two proxy re-encryption schemes that can be used to implement the architecture, and describe the proof of concept application we developed over CCNx.","2331-9852;23319852","Electronic:978-1-4799-2355-7; POD:978-1-4799-2357-1","10.1109/CCNC.2014.6940528","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6940528","","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Encryption;Identity-based encryption","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;digital rights management;information retrieval;internetworking","CCN;DRM applications;ICN;consumer-to-producer end-to-end messages;content confidentiality maintenance;content privacy maintenance;content-centric networking;cryptographic techniques;data decoupling;data source;data-centric paradigm;digital rights management applications;end-to-end content security;flexible end-to-end content security;information hosts;information interfaces;information-centric networking;key retrieval;opportunistic in-network caches;protocol messages;proxy re-encryption;secure content distribution architecture;user authentication","","2","16","21","","","10-13 Jan. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the growth of the world's population, there is a pressing need to improve the productivity of agricultural crops, which hinges on different factors such as geographical location, soil type, weather condition and particular attributes of the crops to plant. In many regions of the world, information about those factors is not readily accessible and dispersed across a multitude of different sources. One of those regions is Nepal, in which the lack of access to this knowledge poses a significant burden for agricultural planning and decision making. Making such knowledge more accessible can boot up a farmer's living standard and increase their competitiveness on national and global markets. In this article, we show how we converted several available, although not easily accessible, datasets to RDF, thereby lowering the barrier for data re-usage and integration. We describe the conversion, linking, and publication process as well as use cases, which can be implemented using the farming datasets in Nepal.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927641","","Agriculture;Meteorology;Ontologies;Production;Resource description framework;Shape;Soil","data integration;farming;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Nepal;RDF;data conversion;data integration;data linking;data publication process;data re-use;farming effectiveness;ontology based data access","","1","","19","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a corpus is of interest for a wide range of contexts, from automatic speech recognition to speech therapy. We evaluated this method by building phonetically-rich corpora for Brazilian Portuguese. The data employed comes from Wikipedia's dumps, which were converted into plain text, segmented and phonetically transcribed. The method consists of comparing the distance between the triphone distribution of the available sentences to an ideal uniform distribution, with equiprobable triphones. A greedy algorithm was implemented to recognize and evaluate the distance among sentences. A heuristic metric is proposed for pre-selecting sentences for the algorithm, in order to quicken its execution. The results show that, by applying the proposed metric, one can build corpora with more uniform triphone distributions.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3743-1; POD:978-1-4799-3744-8","10.1109/ITS.2014.6947957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6947957","","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Measurement;Speech;Speech recognition","greedy algorithms;information retrieval;natural language processing;speech recognition;speech synthesis;text analysis","Brazilian Portuguese;Wikipedia dumps;automatic speech recognition;corpus compiling;distance evaluate;equiprobable triphones;greedy algorithm;heuristic metric;phonetically-rich triphone sentence extraction;sentences preselection;speech technology;speech therapy;text-to-speech systems;triphone distribution","","1","","25","","","17-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
