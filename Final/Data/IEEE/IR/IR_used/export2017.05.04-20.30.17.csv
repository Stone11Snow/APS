In order to avoid the interference brought by the multi-topics problem, this paper focuses on the domain specific Information Retrieval (IR). In domain specific IR, different terms are considered to take different contribution degrees to the final query result. So the terms in a document can be divided into different categories according to their contribution degrees. And the statistical information of a term, mainly its probabilities, is computed by different methods and smooth strategies according to its category. This paper proposed an improved hybrid statistical language model used in the Domain Specific IR. This new model has about 9%~10% performance increment in the experimental result. In the end, some challenges and research orientation of the statistical language model research are presented.","","POD:978-0-7695-3305-6","10.1109/FSKD.2008.240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4666069","","Computer science;Fuzzy systems;Handwriting recognition;Information retrieval;Interference;Natural languages;Probability distribution;Space technology;Speech recognition;Statistics","information retrieval;probability;query languages;statistical analysis","domain specific information retrieval;multitopics document corpus;probability;query language;smooth strategy;statistical information;statistical language model","","0","","16","","","18-20 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several approaches proposed in the literature blur the user's location in a region by increasing its spatial extent or anonymizing the user among several other users. Such approaches in nature require users to communicate through a trusted anonymizer for all of their queries which can impose unrealistic overall communication/computation overhead between the server and the anonymizer for users with more stringent privacy requirements. We revisit the location privacy problem with the objective of providing significantly more stringent privacy guarantees and propose SPIRAL, a scalable private information retrieval approach to location privacy, which is to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to utilize practical private information retrieval (PIR) as a more fundamental approach to enable blind evaluation of range queries.

The absence of word boundaries in Chinese language makes Chinese information retrieval (IR) different to European IR. In order to apply traditional IR approaches to Chinese language, sentences have to be segmented into words first. Word segmentation is playing a key role in Chinese IR. As word segmentation is not straightforward and the results are sometime ambiguous, n-grams are used as an alternative. Several experimental studies have been conducted to compare words and n-grams, word segmentation and its effect on information retrieval. These studies show that using either words or n-grams leads to comparable performances. Higher word segmentation accuracy does not necessarily result in better retrieval performance.

Before the tree structure construction, principle component analysis (PCA) is applied for data analysis and transforming the raw composite features into a new feature space sorted by the importance of acoustic features. The PCA transformed data and reduced dimensions in the upper levels can alleviate suffering from dimensionality curse. To accurately mimic human perception, an extension called QUC +-tree is proposed, which further applies multivariate regression and EM based algorithm to estimate the weight of each individual feature.

Disruption tolerant network (DTN) technologies are designed to enable nodes in such environments to communicate with one another. In an earlier work, we studied information retrieval schemes for single-attribute queries in DTNs. Our schemes disseminate replicated data copies and queries to local-neighborhood. However, data items often have multiple attributes and not every node can be trusted to store replicated data or queries. Thus, in this paper, we study the scenario where the queries have multiple attributes. In addition, we compare the effectiveness of using opportunistically encountered nodes or specially deployed index and storage points (ISPs) for storing replicated data items or indices of the data items. Specifically, we conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate three information retrieval schemes namely (a) the pre-determined ISP advertisement (PISA) scheme where ISPs advertise indices of data items with attribute values that fall within some pre-determined ranges, (b) the opportunistic regular node advertisement with index duplication (ORNA-ID) scheme which uses opportunistically encountered nodes for advertising replicated indices, and (c) the opportunistic regular node advertisement with data duplication (ORNA-DD) scheme which uses opportunistically encountered nodes for storing replicated data items. Our results indicate that the ORNA-ID scheme and the PISA scheme achieve similar performance. This shows that either architecture can be used. In addition, the ORNA-DD scheme provides 91% more query success rate and 128% more overall success rate in the sparsest network scenario (40 nodes distributed over 4000times4000 m<sup>2</sup>).","2155-7578;21557578","POD:978-1-4244-2676-8","10.1109/MILCOM.2008.4753337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4753337","content-based routing;disruption tolerant networking;information retrieval;multi-attribute queries","Ad hoc networks;Advertising;Bandwidth;Batteries;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Disruption tolerant networking;Energy storage;Information retrieval;Routing","ad hoc networks;fault tolerance;information retrieval;mobile radio;telecommunication network reliability","DTN;disruption tolerant network;index and storage points;information retrieval schemes;mobile ad hoc networks;multiattribute queries;opportunistic regular node advertisement with data duplication;opportunistic regular node advertisement with index duplication","","3","","18","","","16-19 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As visual words are useful for object representation, unstable visual words generally appear in the frame sequence of a shot. Using the appearance frequency of the visual words in a sliding window over the query term-related stories, the appearance pattern of a visual word is adopted to characterize the visual word. Based on the appearance pattern of a visual word, the mutual information between two visual words can be estimated over all of the extracted stories. The mutual information is then used to construct a visual word relation graph. Visual phrases are then extracted by discovering the complete sub-graphs from the visual word relation graph for news video retrieval. Experiments were conducted on the MATBN news video database and the experimental results show that a good precision rate for video news retrieval can be achieved.","0271-4302;02714302","POD:978-1-4244-3827-3","10.1109/ISCAS.2009.5117852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5117852","","Cameras;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Information retrieval;Mutual information;Object recognition;Robustness;Solids;Visual databases","database management systems;feature extraction;graph theory;query processing;video retrieval;video signal processing","MATBN news video database;mutual information;object representation;object-based news video retrieval;query term-related visual phrase extraction;subgraphs;word relation graph","","3","","10","","","24-27 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This technique strengthens the simple relationships between terms in the following two ways:(1) terms in a clique express a similar concept and will be added into query expansion, so that it is effective to expanded into some terms with low similar to query terms but highly related to query topic; (2) query term dependencies are used to select concept cliques as candidates. The selection of concept cliques based on a connected graph is effective to avoid topic drift during expanding polysemous query terms.

In these methods we face with the problem of translation ambiguity in which a single word in one language has more than one translation in the other language. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach to retrieve English documents relevant to Persian queries. In this approach we exploit a combination of phrase reorganization, pattern based phrase translation and query expansion before and after translation to improve the dictionary-based query translation. We also propose an improved probabilistic algorithm to choose the best translation of words and phrases. Finally, the documents will be ranked according to statistical language model with some translation steps.

How to manipulate, analyze and understand large quantities of complex data becomes extremely important. Over the past decades, significant progress has been made in IR. However, many challenges remain. First, most Web search engines take a short text query as input and output a ranked list of documents. The retrieval decision is made primarily based on the current query and document collection. Web search engines generally treat search requests in isolation. The results for a given query are identical, independent of the user or the context in which the user makes the request. However, it is unlikely that different users are so similar in their interests that one standardized way of retrieving information fits all needs. Different users may have different information needs. They may use the same query to search for different kinds of information. Moreover, even the same user may use identical queries to express different information needs. For example, a person may use ldquoIRIXrdquo to mean information retrieval in context at one time, but IRIX operating systems at another time. It is impossible for the current Web search engines to distinguish these two cases because the userpsilas search context is not considered. Second, IR is, in general, an interactive process. A userpsilas information need is rarely satisfied with just one iteration of search. With the current document-centered retrieval paradigm, interactive retrieval is treated as a sequence of independent simple retrieval decision-making steps. The information about search history is ignored, which makes the retrieval performance of existing IR systems inherently non-optimal. However, it has been brought into attention that analysis of task-oriented user sessions provides useful insight- - into the query behavior of the users. Third, most of present IR systems including general search engines (e.g. Google and Yahoo) and scientific literature search engines (e.g. PubMed and ACM Digital Library) use keywords to query and index documents. However, this traditional keyword-based IR model provides little semantic context for the understanding of user information needs. For example, a keyword usually has several senses and its meaning is ambiguous without context. In addition, one meaning can be expressed by many keywords. Thus, the integration of semantic context according to the userpsilas information need and the userpsilas understanding of the documents in the collection into IR systems will definitely improve the IR performance.","","POD:978-1-4244-2512-9","10.1109/GRC.2008.4664796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664796","","Biomedical informatics;Decision making;History;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Medical services;Operating systems;Search engines;Software libraries;Web search","data analysis;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;query formulation;search engines","Web search engines;data analysis;decision-making steps;document collection;document-centered retrieval paradigm;health care;information retrieval systems;literature search engines;machine learning;medical informatics","","0","","","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fuzzy semantic query expansion is constructed by order relation, equivalence relation, inclusion relation and complement relation between fuzzy concepts defined in fuzzy linguistic variable ontologies.

It can be employed to retrieve the measures of physical quantities, such as temperature, humidity, and vibrations intensity (physical information) together with the geographical position where the measures are taken (position information). The telecommunication network supporting the EMS is composed of: a network of sensors, a group of earth stations called Sinks, a satellite backbone, and a destination. Each sensor collects physical and position information, encapsulates it into packets and conveys it towards the sinks which give access to the satellite backbone that connects the sinks to the destination. A single sensor transmits the information to all sinks but only one sink transmits it over the satellite channel. Even if the redundant transmission of the same data from more than one sink would increase the safety of the system, it would increase also the costs of it. The selection of the sink which forwards the information of a sensor to the destination is important to increase the performance of the EMS. This paper introduces specific performance metrics to evaluate the functionality of the whole EMS in terms of reliability, reactivity, and spent energy. The reference metrics are packet loss rate, average packet delay, and energy consumption. Then the paper presents an algorithm to select the transmitting sink for each sensor, which is aimed at maximizing the performance in terms of the mentioned metrics. The algorithm is tested through simulation.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2008.2004850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4682612","Monitoring system;multi-attribute programming;performance evaluation;satellite infrastructures;sensor networks and sink selection","","information retrieval;wireless sensor networks","environmental monitoring system;information retrieval;multi-attribute programming;redundant transmission;satellite channel;satellite infrastructures;satellite-based sensor networks;sink selection","","22","","10","","20081118","Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To improve retrieval performance, the scheme of relevance feedback is adopted by adjusting the query language model using the information feedback from the retrieved documents. This study presents a new Bayesian learning approach to instantaneous and unsupervised adaptation of language model for adaptive information retrieval. We aim to compensate the domain mismatch between query and documents by adapting the query language model to meet the domains of collected documents. The maximum a posteriori adaptation is executed solely by using the input query without additional collection of adaptation data. The retrieved top N documents are utilized as relevant documents and referred as feedback to estimate mixture of language models for Bayesian document retrieval.

In this paper, we develop an alternative and complementary single-hop approach - active wireless sensing (AWS) - in which a wireless information retriever (WIR) queries a select ensemble of nodes to obtain desired information in a rapid and energy-efficient manner. The basic architecture in AWS consists of:(i) a WIR, equipped with an antenna array, interrogates the wireless sensors with wideband space-time waveforms, (ii) the sensors modulate the acquired waveforms with their (possibly encoded) measured data and generate an ensemble response to the WIR's interrogation signal, and (iii) the WIR extracts the sensor data by exploiting the space-time characteristics of the resulting multipath sensing channel. To facilitate analysis, we propose a canonical family of sensing configurations that represent a simple abstraction of spatial correlation in the signal field or the nature of local cooperation in the network. The concept of source-channel matching is introduced in which the spatio-temporal resolution is adapted to the spatial scale of node correlation in the sensing configurations. Signaling strategies and associated receiver structures at the WIR are developed for different source-channel matching configurations. The performance of AWS is analyzed in different configurations both in terms of reliability and capacity of information retrieval.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2008.2010637","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4703212","Agile transceivers;sensing configurations;sensor networks;wideband sensors;wireless information retrieval","","antenna arrays;correlation methods;information retrieval;multipath channels;telecommunication network routing;wireless sensor networks","WIRs interrogation signal;antenna array;information routing;multihop in-network algorithm;multipath sensing channel;source-channel matching;space-time waveform;spatio-temporal resolution;wireless information retrieval;wireless sensor network","","3","","38","","20081209","April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper reformats the clustering problem as a salient phrase ranking problem. Given a query and its related ranked list of documents (typically a list of titles and snippets) returned from a certain Web search engine, this method first extracts and ranks salient phrases as candidate cluster theme, based on regression model of SVR (support vector regression) learned from human labeled training data. The documents are assigned to relevant salient phrases to form candidate clusters, and the final clusters are generated by merging these candidate clusters. This paper also searches for a reasonable format to display the final themes of clusters, in order to help users to find the interesting documents easily.

In this paper, an approach with the capability of matching partial word images to address two issues in document image retrieval: word spotting and similarity measurement between documents has been proposed. Initially, each word image is represented by a primitive string. Then, an inexact string matching technique is utilized to measure the similarity between the string generated of the query word with the word string generated from the document. Based on the similarity, we can find out how a word image is relevant to the other and, can be decided whether one is a portion of the other. In order to deal with various character fonts, a primitive string which is tolerant to serif and font differences to represent a word image has been used. Using this technique of inexact string matching, our method is able to successfully handle the problem of heavily touching characters. From the experimental results on a variety of document image databases it is confirmed that the proposed approach is feasible, valid, and efficient in document image retrieval.","","POD:978-1-4244-2927-1","10.1109/IADCC.2009.4809071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4809071","Document image retrieval;partial word image matching;primitive string;word searching","Electronics packaging;Image converters;Image databases;Image matching;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Internet;Optical character recognition software;Software libraries","document image processing;image matching;information retrieval;string matching;visual databases","document image databases;heavily touching characters;inexact string matching technique;information retrieval;partial word image matching technique;query word;similarity measurement;word spotting;word string","","0","","10","","","6-7 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

London, London","2009 International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops","20090626","2009","","","697","702","Searching very large collections can be costly in both computation and storage. To reduce this cost, recent research has focused on reducing the size (pruning) of the inverted index. The inverted index represents a table, the rows and columns of which are terms in the lexicon and documents in the collection, respectively. A non-zero entry in the table, known as a posting, indicates that the corresponding document contains the term. Previous researches on static index pruning was either (i) posting-oriented, in which less important postings are removed from the table, or (ii) term-oriented, in which less important terms are removed from the table. In this paper, we investigate a new, document-oriented pruning strategy that removes entire columns of the table, i.e. removes less important documents from the collection. Three methods for estimating the importance of a document are proposed. Methods 1 and 2 are dependent on the score function of the retrieval system (e.g. Okapi BM25), while Method 3 is independent of the retrieval system. Experimental results compare the three proposed methods with Carmel et al.'s posting-oriented approach, using both the FT and LA Times collections and using both ordinary and difficult queries. Based on mean average precision and precision at 10, experimental results show that Method 3 generally performs best on the FT collection for pruned indexes down to 35% of the original size. However, for more severe pruning, Carmel et al.'s algorithm is better. For the LA Times collection, the performance of Method 3 and that of Carmel et al. are reversed. This variation in performance across collections has not been previously reported.","","POD:978-1-4244-3999-7","10.1109/WAINA.2009.147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5136730","","Advertising;Computer networks;Costs;Data structures;Educational institutions;Indexing;Information retrieval;Search engines;Vocabulary;Web search","information retrieval;very large databases","document-oriented pruning;information retrieval systems;inverted index;nonzero entry;posting-oriented approach;very large collections","","3","4","14","","","26-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bayesian networks are used as an inference tool, which can be automatically constructed by learning from the multi-feature similarities and a small amount of training data. The idea is to model potential semantic descriptions of basic semantic concepts in the visual content, the dependencies between them, and the conditional probabilities involved in those dependencies. This information is then used to calculate the probabilities of the effects that those concepts have on each other in order to obtain more precise and meaningful semantic labels for the visual content. However, the proposed method is not restricted to the specific multi-feature based visual information retrieval framework used in this paper.

The character recognition engine receives real-time digital pen generated data, and produces segmented-recognition result. The query retrieval engine, resolves the index / query requests from the users for possible information update / retrieval. In case of a handwritten query, the query retrieval engine interacts with the recognition engine to create / update the inverted index table with recognized word labels with annotation indices.

The framework includes three parts: concepts, properties of concepts and values of properties, in which property's value can be either standard data type or linguistic values (i.e. fuzzy concepts). The semantic query expansion is constructed by order relation, equivalence relation, inclusion relation and complement relation between fuzzy concepts defined in fuzzy linguistic variable ontologies. The application to retrieve traffic accident information shows that the framework can overcome the localization of other fuzzy ontology models, and this research facilitates the semantic retrieval of traffic information through fuzzy concepts in ITS on the semantic Web.","1062-922X;1062922X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2384-2; POD:978-1-4244-2383-5","10.1109/ICSMC.2008.4811639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4811639","Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS);fuzzy ontology;ontology;semantic information retrieval;the Semantic Web","Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Information retrieval;Intelligent transportation systems;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Traffic control;Uncertainty","automated highways;control engineering computing;fuzzy control;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;semantic Web","fuzzy linguistic variable ontologies;intelligent transportation systems;linguistic values;ontology-based semantic information retrieval;order relation;semantic Web;semantic query expansion;traffic information service","","6","","17","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One important aspect of our approach is the combination of an authoritatively supplied taxonomy by the colleges, with the data driven extraction (via clustering) of a taxonomy from the documents themselves, thus making it easier to adapt to different learning platforms, and making it easier to evolve with the document/lecture collection. Our experimental results show that the learner's context can be effectively used for improving the precision and recall in e-learning content retrieval, particularly by re-ranking the search results based on the learner's past activities.","1082-3409;10823409","POD:978-0-7695-3440-4","10.1109/ICTAI.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4669712","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information retrieval;Knowledge engineering;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Taxonomy;Web mining","computer aided instruction;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","data driven extraction;e-learning content retrieval;ontologies;personalized e-learning;personalized retrieval;semantic Web;semantic information retrieval","","16","","8","","","3-5 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Queries are formal statements of information needs, for example search strings in Web search engines. In IR a query does not uniquely identify a single object in the collection. Instead, several objects may match the query, perhaps with different degrees of relevancy.An object is an entity which keeps or stores information in a database. User queries are matched to objects stored in the database. Depending on the application the data objects may be, for example, text documents, images or videos. The documents themselves are not kept or stored directly in the IR system, but are instead represented in the system by document surrogates.Most IR systems compute a numeric score on how well each object in the database match the query, and rank the objects according to this value. The top ranking objects are then shown to the user. The process may then be iterated if the user wishes to refine the query.In this paper we try to explain IR methods and asses them from two view points and finally propose a simple method for ranking terms and documents on IR and implement the method and check the result.","","POD:978-0-7695-3595-1","10.1109/ICIME.2009.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077062","Data Mining;Information Retrieval;Ranking;Search Engine","Data mining;Image databases;Information management;Information retrieval;Manufacturing processes;Optical computing;Search engines;Videos;Virtual manufacturing;Web search","Internet;information retrieval;search engines","Boolean model;Web search engines;information retrieval;text documents","","6","","18","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the problems,faced in automatic word sense discovery, is the number of different senses a word can have. Often, senses are dominated by some other, more frequent ones. Discovering such dominated meanings can significantly improve quality of many text-related algorithms. In particular, Web search quality can be leveraged. In the paper, we present a novel approach for discovering word senses. The method is based on concise representations of frequent patterns. The method attempts to discover not only word senses that are dominating, but also senses that are dominated and under represented in the repository.","2375-9232;23759232","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3503-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4733945","text mining;word sense discovery","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Conferences;Data mining;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Ontologies;Text categorization;Web search","Internet;data mining;information retrieval","Web information retrieval;Web search quality;word meaning disambiguation;word sense discovery","","2","1","20","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There a lot of fuzzy traffic information derived from human factor. To achieve fuzzy semantic retrieval, this paper proposes an approach using resource description framework (RDF) and fuzzy ontology. First, we apply RDF data model to represent traffic information on the semantic Web. Then we present fuzzy linguistic variable ontology models and its formal representation with RDF. Introducing new data type referred as fuzzy linguistic variables to RDF data model, the semantic query expansion in SeRQL query language is constructed by order relation, equivalence relation, inclusion relation, and complement relation between fuzzy concepts defined in linguistic variable ontologies.

The motive behind identifying the singer is to extend this work for efficient music information retrieval of Carnatic music song based on singer identification. In this work, a new set of features that can be used in the process of Carnatic music singer identification is proposed and implemented. The features are based on Carnatic music characteristics like just tempered, varying pitch, varying interval of the octave, etc. The coefficients are called as Carnatic interval cepstral coefficients (CICC) since they are based on Carnatic music's octave interval. The input signal is segmented and frequency of each segment is determined which is followed by determining of the Carnatic interval cepstral coefficients. These coefficients are used to construct a GMM model which forms the basis for singer identification. We have compared our proposed coefficients, CICC with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients for the task of Carnatic singer identification.","","POD:978-0-7695-3504-3","10.1109/ICCEE.2008.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4741017","Carnatic music;singer identification","Cepstral analysis;Cutoff frequency;Human voice;Indexing;Instruments;Internet;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Speech recognition","feature extraction;image segmentation;information retrieval","Carnatic interval cepstral coefficients;Carnatic music octave interval;Carnatic music singer identification;GMM model;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;music information retrieval","","1","","13","","","20-22 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
