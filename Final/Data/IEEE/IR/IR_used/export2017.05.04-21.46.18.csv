By exploiting in-band spatial dependencies, the distribution of the coefficients in each subband, which is modeled as a Gaussian mixture, is estimated using a directional hidden Markov model.

The overall objective of this paper is to propose a semi-empirical calibration of the Integral Equation Model (IEM) so as to better reproduce the backscattering coefficient measured from SAR images over bare soils. As correlation length is not only the least accurate parameter but also the most difficult to measure, we propose its empirical estimation from an experimental data set of SAR images and soil parameter measurements. Based on a first data set, relationships between optimal correlation length and rms height were found for each radar configuration. The IEM was then tested on another set of measured data in order to validate the calibration procedure. The new calibrated version of the IEM, corresponding to the original IEM (Fung, 1994) with a coupling of the empirical function of correlation length, shows a very good agreement with the backscattering measurements provided by spaceborne SAR systems.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026729","","Backscatter;Calibration;Information retrieval;Integral equations;Length measurement;Radar imaging;Rough surfaces;Soil measurements;Spaceborne radar;Surface roughness","backscatter;geophysical techniques;hydrological techniques;radar cross-sections;radar theory;remote sensing by radar;soil;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","SAR;backscattering coefficient;bare soils;correlation length;empirical calibration;empirical function;geophysical measurement technique;hydrology;integral equation model;land surface;radar remote sensing;radar scattering;semi-empirical calibration;soil;soil moisture;soil parameters;surface parameters;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","","4","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recommender systems have then become valuable resources for users seeking intelligent ways to search through the enormous volume of information available to them. In this paper we propose a new framework based on Web logs mining for building a personalized recommender system. At the core of personalization is the task of building a profile of the user. We have developed an approach that user's information learned from user's Web logs data to construct accurate comprehensive individual profiles.

In this paper, we present a one-server private information retrieval (PIR) electronic voting scheme with secure coprocessor (SC). In the scheme, we not only protect personal privacy but also increase the security of the voting procedure. Besides, using only one server can lower the cost.

It is based on the combination of the Vegetation Cover Method (VCM) and the Normalized Emissivity Method (NEM). NEM uses a first guess for emissivity, ε<sub>NEM</sub>, which is constant for all channels and pixels. The method provides accurate relative emissivity variations, but the accuracy of absolute emissivity depends on the closeness of ε<sub>NEM</sub> to the actual maximum emissivity value. The concept in the new methodology is to adjust ε<sub>NEM</sub> initially by estimating channel emissivities in a pixel-by-pixel basis accounting for the spatial variation of emissivity with vegetation cover. This estimation can be done with the VCM, using coefficients adapted to each band. ε<sub>NEM</sub> is taken as the maximum emissivity value obtained for each pixel, which is then introduced into the NEM algorithm, ANEM was applied to a series of scenes recorded by the Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (DAIS), which was flown over the test site of Barrax, Spain, during the DAISEX campaigns in 1998-2000. Retrieved temperatures and emissivities were validated with ground measurements carried out coincidentally to the DAIS flights. The results showed good agreement between retrieved and measured values, and demonstrated the capability of the method to achieve nearly unbiased temperatures with uncertainties within ±0.8 K, and emissivities with errors mostly within ±0.01.","","POD:0-7803-7929-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2003.1294692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1294692","","Atmospheric measurements;Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Layout;Spectroscopy;Temperature sensors;Testing;Vegetation mapping","emissivity;vegetation mapping","AD 1998 to 2000;ANEM;Adjusted Normalized Emissivity Method;Barrax;DAIS;DAIS flights;Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer;NEM;NEM algorithm;Spain;VCM;Vegetation Cover Method;ground measurements;land surface temperature;pixels;thermal infrared data","","3","","8","","","2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique can be applied to information retrieval, information extraction, and data mining. Our specific target is search in recorded conversations in the office/information-worker scenario-teleconferences, meetings, presentations, and voice mails. The focus of this paper is on how to index phonetic lattices. We will show that an index should provide expected term frequencies (ETFs) of query terms. Since, at indexing time, it is unknown which phoneme sequences constitute valid query terms, we will introduce an approximation of ETFs of a query's phoneme sequence by M-gram phoneme language models, which are estimated on lattices and organized in an inverted index-like structure for fast access. We will discuss ranking, estimation, and integration of phoneme/word hybrid approaches. Compared with an unindexed baseline without approximation, our approximation leads only to a 3.4% relative loss of search accuracy on the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) voicemail task. We also propose a two-stage method for locating individual keyword occurrences using the above method as a fast match.

The measurement is performed using a parametric retrieval scheme, which makes use of prior information taken from numerical wave models. The Partition Rescale and Shift algorithm (PARSA) is based on a partitioning technique, which splits an a prior wave spectrum into its wave system components. Integral parameters of these systems, such as mean direction, mean wavelength, waveheight, and directional spreading are then adjusted iteratively to improve the consistency with the SAR observation. The method takes into account the full nonlinear SAR imaging process and uses a maximum a posteriori approach, which is based on statistical model quantifying the errors of the SAR imaging model, the SAR measurement, and the prior wave spectra. The method is applied to a global data set of ENVISAT ASAR data acquired during the CAL/VAL phase.

Error detection is the precursor of error correction. Developing effective techniques for error detection can thus lead to improved error correction. Current research on error detection has focused mainly on transcription and/or domain-specific speech. Error detection in DSR has been studied less. We propose data mining models for detecting errors in DSR. Instead of relying on internal parameters from DSR systems, we propose a loosely coupled approach to error detection based on features extracted from the DSR output. The features mainly came from two sources: confidence scores and linguistics parsing. Link grammar was innovatively applied to error detection. Three data mining techniques, including NaÏve Bayes, neural networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), were evaluated on 5M DSR corpora. The experimental results showed that significant performance was achieved in that F-measures for error detection ranged from 55.3% to 62.5%.

The core operations in DONet are very simple: every node periodically exchanges data availability information with a set of partners, and retrieves unavailable data from one or more partners, or supplies available data to partners. We emphasize three salient features of this data-driven design: 1) easy to implement, as it does not have to construct and maintain a complex global structure; 2) efficient, as data forwarding is dynamically determined according to data availability while not restricted by specific directions; and 3) robust and resilient, as the partnerships enable adaptive and quick switching among multi-suppliers. We show through analysis that DONet is scalable with bounded delay. We also address a set of practical challenges for realizing DONet, and propose an efficient member and partnership management algorithm, together with an intelligent scheduling algorithm that achieves real-time and continuous distribution of streaming contents. We have extensively evaluated the performance of DONet over the PlanetLab. Our experiments, involving almost all the active PlanetLab nodes, demonstrate that DONet achieves quite good streaming quality even under formidable network conditions. Moreover, its control overhead and transmission delay are both kept at low levels. An Internet-based DONet implementation, called CoolStreaming v.0.9, was released on May 30, 2004, which has attracted over 30000 distinct users with more than 4000 simultaneously being online at some peak times. We discuss the key issues toward designing CoolStreaming in this paper, and present several interesting observations from these large-scale tests; in particular, the larger the overlay size, the better the streaming quality it can deliver.","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:0-7803-8968-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2005.1498486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1498486","","Availability;Content management;Delay;Information retrieval;Internet;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Scheduling algorithm;Streaming media","Internet;computer network management;delays;multimedia communication;peer-to-peer computing;scheduling","CoolStreaming;Internet;PlanetLab;control overhead delay;data-driven overlay network;intelligent scheduling algorithm;member management algorithm;partnership management algorithm;peer-to-peer live media streaming;streaming quality;transmission delay","","434","28","31","","","13-17 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reagan et al. (2004, 2005) addressed a revised table look-up approach that incorporated two notable revisions for improved S<sub>a</sub> selection, which, as a consequence, enable more bounded aerosol retrievals. One is a refined, more bounded set of S<sub>a</sub> values, both for 532 nm and 1064 nm, representative of a definitive set of aerosol types/models determined from an extensive analysis of the AERONET database. The other is an accompanying set of key spectral ratio parameters (i.e., dual wavelength, 532 nm to 1064 nm, ratios of backscatter, extinction and S<sub>a</sub>) also derived from the AERONET data which offer additional ways to bound the lidar aerosol retrievals. Thus, aerosol retrievals can be obtained subject to the constraints that the lidar data yield retrievals with spectral ratio parameters consistent with a given aerosol model (or models), to confirm the model choice and better bound the retrievals. This paper presents the simulation results made by assuming different models in support of the two-wavelength lidar constrained ratio aerosol model-fit (CRAM) retrieval approach. In addition, a performance function and multiple scattering corrections based on LITE signals are also investigated.","","Electronic:0-7803-9110-1; POD:0-7803-9109-8","10.1109/AERSOL.2005.1494147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1494147","","Aerosols;Backscatter;Calibration;Extinction coefficients;Information retrieval;Laser radar;Optical scattering;Optical sensors;Rayleigh scattering;Satellites","aerosols;atmospheric spectra;atmospheric techniques;backscatter;data acquisition;geophysical signal processing;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;spaceborne radar;table lookup","1064 nm;532 nm;AERONET database;CALIPSO satellite;CRAM retrieval;GLAS;LITE signals;aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio;aerosol lidar ratio;aerosol model constraints;aerosol types;climatology;lidar missions;performance function;scattering correction;spaceborne lidar aerosol retrieval;spectral ratio parameter;table look up;two-wavelength lidar constrained ratio aerosol model-fit","","0","","10","","","5-6 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed feedback technique is based on the Bayesian learning method and incorporates a time-varying user model into the formulation. We define the user model with two terms: a target query and a user conception. The target query is aimed to learn the common features from relevant images so as to specify the user's ideal query. The user conception is aimed to learn a parameter set to determine the time-varying matching criterion. Therefore, at each feedback step, the learning process updates not only the target distribution, but also the target query and the matching criterion. In addition, another objective of this paper is to conduct the relevance feedback on images represented in region level. We formulate the matching criterion using a weighting scheme and proposed a region clustering technique to determine the region correspondence between relevant images. With the proposed region clustering technique, we derive a representation in region level to characterize the target query. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method combined with time-varying user model indeed achieves satisfactory results and our proposed region-based techniques further improve the retrieval accuracy.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2005.852202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510695","Bayesian learning;content-based image retrieval (CBIR);region clustering;region correspondence;relevance feedback;target query;user conception","Bayesian methods;Content based retrieval;Displays;Feedback;Image databases;Image matching;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Probability distribution","belief networks;content-based retrieval;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern clustering;relevance feedback;visual databases","content-based image retrieval;generalized Bayesian framework;image representation;region clustering technique;region-based optimization learning;relevance feedback;target query;time-varying matching criterion;time-varying user model;user conception;weighting scheme","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Feedback;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated","13","","30","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To validate the performance of the CDN, an exact placement ILP formulation and various RPA heuristics are implemented and simulated.","1530-1346;15301346","POD:0-7695-2373-0","10.1109/ISCC.2005.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1493788","","Bandwidth;Content based retrieval;Current measurement;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Network servers;Quality of service;Robustness;Telecommunication traffic;Videos","monitoring;multimedia communication;telecommunication services;telecommunication traffic","content delivery service;content distribution network;content placement algorithm;content retrieval algorithms;flash crowds;high quality multimedia content;network monitoring;replica placement algorithm;traffic engineering","","1","","16","","","27-30 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although the system is optimized for depth retrieval, there is much more than depth information since the data stream (waveform) includes backscatter from the water surface and water column as well as the bottom return. This paper uses the amplitude of the bottom return signal to characterize the illuminated bottom materials. It is found that, while there are changes in the bottom return that clearly correlate with changes in bottom type, the bottom slope and surface waves have significant effects on the bottom return. These factors can distort the recorded waveforms and alter the apparent reflectance of illuminated materials, and must be accounted for if changes in bottom type are to be detected.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1026743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1026743","","Backscatter;Distortion measurement;Information retrieval;Laser radar;Optical losses;Optical receivers;Optical refraction;Optical transmitters;Reflectivity;Surface waves","geophysical techniques;oceanographic techniques;optical radar;remote sensing by laser beam;seafloor phenomena;sediments","SHOALS;Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey;bottom material change;bottom return;bottom type;geophysical measurement technique;laser remote sensing;lidar;marine sediment;seabed;seafloor geology","","0","","5","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we analyze the characteristics of the words (or terms) appearing on the Web page in order to build a term weighting formula. Based on these term weight values we employ the similarity formula to calculate the semantic similar degree between each two SPs. Finally, we consider the balance point of precision and recall as the reference value of the similarity - threshold.

It has been proposed for AMSR that these parameters-will be estimated through 'tuning' of soil moisture retrieval algorithm during the calibration-validation phase. In the case of NPOESS/CMIS, which has also proposed an AMSR-type retrieval technique for soil moisture estimation, 'tuning' processes to obtain vegetation optical depth and soil roughness introduces uncertainty and risk to the soil moisture data product for the operational program.

However, increased pixel size does increase the error in AOD retrieval as a result of clouds. High-resolution sensors like MTI are able to avoid most clouds, but as the pixel size increases, subpixel clouds avoid the cloud mask, creep into selected pixels, and add a positive bias to the retrieved value of AOD. In accompanying work, we show that increasing pixel size has a small but noticeable impact on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2.2-/spl mu/m reflectance, both used in the retrieval algorithm. We also examine the uniformity of the aerosol layer and show that the AOD varies by less than 0.02 in optical depth units over a 2.3/spl times/3.8 km/sup 2/ area.

The relevance feedback techniques have been studied in the field of document retrieval, aiming to generate appropriate queries for users' information needs. Although this approach is effective when the assumption that a user has concrete criteria on the relevance of retrieved documents is valid, it is expected that this assumption cannot always hold when searching Blog, which consists of vast number of short articles about various topics. In particular, it is assumed that a user is exploring the Blog space while having multiple interests at the same time. In this paper, keyword map-based relevance feedback is applied to interactive Blog search.

A query comprises of a number of search terms in which multiple queries use the same search terms. The re-occurring search terms and associated results are indexed and easily accessible for retrieval. The individual results of the search terms are merged during the query processing stage and return the best combined results. Hence, the queries are observed as independent events but should be viewed in tandem. We present a lattice framework that groups frequently requested search terms and corresponding results in a cache. The stored results provide a reduction in database accesses while minimally affecting the performance. We compare the aggregate ranking (from the actual rankings) to the lattice-based aggregate ranking (using at least one stored result). We perform an empirical study of our proposed framework in which we analyze its benefits and drawbacks to the conventional method.","","POD:0-7803-9093-8","10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506446","","Aggregates;Application software;Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Internet;Lattices;Performance analysis;Query processing;Search engines","information retrieval;vocabulary","frequently requested search terms grouping;index terms;information retrieval;lattice-based aggregate ranking;query processing;reoccurring search terms;top-k query results reuse","","0","1","15","","","15-17 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal of inductive databases is to assist the deployment of the KDD process and integrate several heterogeneous data mining and data analysis tools.

Hence, the authors set out to create a novel framework that would be suitable for the aims of the course, for the level of computing skills of the intended group of students, and for the size of this group of students. The content of the introductory AI course in question is a set of assignments that requires the students to use intelligent agents and other AI techniques to monitor, filter, and retrieve relevant information from the World Wide Web. It represents, therefore, a synthesis of the traditional objectivist approach and a real-world-oriented, constructivist approach to teaching programming to novices. The main aim of implementing such a pedagogy was to engage the students in learning to which they personally relate while attaining intellectual rigor. Classroom experience indicates that students learn more effectively when the traditional objectivist approach is combined with a constructivist approach than when this orthodox approach to teaching programming to novices is used alone.","0018-9359;00189359","","10.1109/TE.2004.842906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1495645","Agent framework;Java;World Wide Web search;artificial intelligence (AI) course;intelligent agents;introductory engineering course;rule-based reasoning;semantic network","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Education;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Intelligent agent;Java;Monitoring","Internet;artificial intelligence;computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;information filtering;software agents;teaching","Java;World Wide Web;artificial intelligence;information filter;information monitoring;information retrieval;intelligent agents;introductory AI course;simple agent framework;teaching programming","","9","","17","","","Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advantage is providing the user with the flexibility of browsing the video at arbitrary levels of detail. For performance evaluation, we show the indexing results on two test videos, which are very close to the ground truth.

Wallace","Dept. of Eng., Cambridge Univ., UK","Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design, 2005.","20050906","2005","1","","10 Vol. 1","","Summary form only given. The industrial world is changing rapidly and engineering organisations must adapt to remain competitive. Some of the pressures faced by these organisations include: (1) the increasing commercial competition that demands continual improvements in quality, shorter lead times and reduced costs; (2) the increasing complexity of both products and processes; (3) the problems of retaining and retrieving knowledge and experience; and (4) the trend towards globalisation with increasingly distributed design and manufacturing teams. In order to progress their designs, designers need to acquire the appropriate knowledge. Research has shown that up to a quarter of the working day can be spent by designers on knowledge acquisition. Providing effective computer-based information retrieval systems is therefore a key factor in contributing to the future commercial success of an engineering organisation. Traditionally design knowledge and experience have been retained in the heads of individuals. It is known that in the majority of cases when seeking information designers prefer to ask a colleague rather than search through a document or a database. It is also known that designers frequently do not know what information they are looking for and need to discover it, that is, they do not know what questions to ask. Because industrial organisations are becoming more transient and distributed, and workforces more mobile, the opportunities to talk to experts, particularly face to face, are diminishing. For some time many companies have been experiencing a significant loss of knowledge and experience due to 'knowledge carriers' moving to another company or retiring. Therefore a key question is: How is design knowledge to be acquired when it may not be possible to consult colleagues? The presentation will discuss issues surrounding this question, including the capture, storage and retrieval of design information. It will draw e- tensively on a series of empirical studies that have been undertaken in the aerospace industry during the past 15 years.","","POD:1-84600-002-5","10.1109/CSCWD.2005.194136","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504042","","Aerospace industry;Costs;Databases;Design engineering;Globalization;Information retrieval;Knowledge engineering;Lead time reduction;Manufacturing processes","aerospace industry;design engineering;groupware;information retrieval systems;knowledge acquisition;manufacturing data processing","aerospace industry;computer-based information retrieval system;distributed design;engineering design;knowledge acquisition;knowledge capture;knowledge retrieval;manufacturing teams","","1","","","","","24-26 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using syntactic and semantic constraints and a domain ontology containing the relevant terms, we obtain high accuracy (high 80's to low 90's). Using concept categories (or semantic roles) to validate sensicality of an index term is a novel approach in semantic indexing. Resulting low-cost navigational structure can add value to businesses relying on accurate automatic document indexing (e.g. mobile news providers) or dealing with a critical learn-to-do requirement for their employees or clients (e.g. airplane maintenance).

To date, the primary driver of this research has been multimedia applications, where similarity functions are often Euclidean norms on high dimensional feature vectors. We develop results showing that the character of these biological workloads is different from multimedia workloads. In particular, they are not intrinsically very high dimensional, and deserving different optimization heuristics.

"An adaptive and fault-tolerant scheme for gateway assignment in sensor networks","W. Su","Boeing Co., Anaheim, CA, USA","IEEE MILCOM 2004. Military Communications Conference, 2004.","20050815","2004","2","","642","648 Vol. 2","Gateways are important elements in a sensor network since they provide the ability to establish long range reachback communication for the purpose of retrieving critical data from remote locations. However, gateways are prone to failures just like regular sensors, and they also consume significantly more energy since they transmit over longer distance compared to sensor-to-sensor links. In this paper an adaptive and fault-tolerant method for gateway assignment in sensor networks is introduced. The proposed approach is fully distributed and it achieves the following objectives: (1) it allows surviving gateways to recover for other gateways that have failed; (2) it distributes energy usage and traffic load incurred by gateway nodes within the sensor network among several regional gateway nodes, while each gateway adaptively controls its own region of influence based on local conditions such as energy and traffic load. This methodology was evaluated via simulation using a realistic network model containing 400 sensors with virtual targets. The simulation results indicate that the scheme recovers quite well when gateways fail. Moreover, during periods when no gateway failures are present, the scheme also balances the traffic load among gateways.","","POD:0-7803-8847-X","10.1109/MILCOM.2004.1494866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1494866","","Ad hoc networks;Chemical sensors;Energy resources;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Relays;Telecommunication traffic;Tires;Unmanned aerial vehicles","adaptive control;fault tolerant computing;internetworking;military communication;mobile computing;telecommunication control;wireless sensor networks","adaptive fault-tolerant scheme;energy usage;gateway assignment;long range reachback communication;military communication;sensor networks;traffic load balancing","","1","","13","","","31 Oct.-3 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on two levels of contextual DQ and two levels of task complexity, this study had a 2×2 factorial design. The dependent variables were problem-solving accuracy and time. The results demonstrated that the effects of contextual DQ on decision performance were significant. The findings suggest that decision makers can expect to improve their decision performance by enhancing contextual DQ.

In this paper an approach for grouping data sets that are indexed in the space is proposed. It is based on the k-means algorithm and grid clustering. The former is the simplest and most commonly used clustering technique. A major problem with this algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial partition. The latter is commonly used for grouping data that are indexed in the space. The goal in this paper is to overcome the high sensitivity of the k-means algorithm to the starting conditions by using the available spatial information. A semivariogram-based grid clustering is introduced. It uses the spatial correlation for determining the bin size. Since the bins are constrained to regular blocks while the spatial distribution of objects is not regular, we propose to combine this technique with a conventional k-means algorithm. By using the semivariogram an excellent initialization of the k-means is provided. Experimental results show that the final partition preserves the spatial distribution of the objects","","POD:953-7044-01-4","10.1109/ELMAR.2005.193628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1505629","","Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Data engineering;Data mining;Electronic mail;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern classification","pattern clustering;statistical analysis","bin size;data set grouping;k-means;semivariogram-based grid clustering;spatial correlation;spatial distribution","","2","","14","","","8-10 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of texture energy is introduced to define both global and local features of a palmprint, which are characterized with high convergence of inner-palm similarities and good dispersion of inter-palm discrimination. The searching is carried out in a layered fashion: the global features are first used to guide the fast selection of a small set of similar candidates from the database and then the local features are applied to determine the final output from the selected set of similar candidates.

Various integration schemes are presented and a long-term shared memory is used to exploit the retrieval experience from multiple users. Also, a concept digesting method is proposed to reduce the complexity of storage demand. The experimental results manifest that the integration of multiple RF approaches gives better retrieval performance than using one RF technique alone, and that the sharing of relevance knowledge between multiple query sessions significantly improves the performance. Further, the storage demand is significantly reduced by the concept digesting technique.

This is important because it can improve resource usage, minimize network latencies and reduce the volume of unnecessary traffic incurred in large-scale P2P systems. In this paper we present a technique for fair resource allocation in unstructured peer-to-peer systems. Our technique uses the fairness index of a distribution as a measure of fairness and shows how to optimize the fairness of the distribution using only local decisions.

Write operations on the shared communication medium must be coordinated and collision-avoidance schemes are one technique to achieve this; for example time-division multiple access (TDMA). Common solutions for TDMA include descriptive tables or algorithm-based client/server mechanisms. Yet, they are all limited in their expressiveness: at the beginning of the communication period at most one write operation can be scheduled for a specific time slot. In this work, we propose a system that allows for scheduling several write operations for the same time slot but guarantee that at most one will be performed though. It does not deal with scheduling algorithms per se, it deals with describing and implementing a computed schedule. The consequences of this added expressiveness allow for parallel and stateful communication schedules merged and serialized in an ad-hoc way.

Users not only expect high quality and relevant information, but also wish that the information he presented in an as efficient way as possible. The traditional filtering methods, however, only consider the relevant values of document. These conventional methods fail to consider the efficiency of documents retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to calculate an index called document similarity score based on elements of the document. Using the index, document profile is derived. Any documents with the similarity score above a given threshold is clustered. Using these pre-clustered documents, information filtering and retrieval can be made more efficient. Experimental results clearly show our proposed method tremendously improves the efficiency of information filtering and retrieval. We also give an example application of our proposed method in business processes.","","POD:0-7803-8680-9","10.1109/INMIC.2004.1492988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1492988","","Australia;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Crawlers;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Web sites","electronic commerce;information filtering","business processes;document profile;document similarity score;information filtering;information retrieval;preclustered documents","","1","","9","","","24-26 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the reasons is that histogram-based systems only support some form of global similarity using the whole color histogram as one vector. Meanwhile there is more information in a histogram than the distribution of samples resp. colors. In this paper, we first introduce some generic similarity search methods in the image database and then use them to form a generalized model that can adapt various transformations. Farther on, in virtue of the effectiveness of the evolutionary computation and based on the model, we construct a fitness function using the wavelet transformation to optimize the image similarity search by the particle swarm optimization. The results of our approach present a much better quality than other existing similarity search measures.","","POD:0-7803-9005-9","10.1109/IWVDVT.2005.1504631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1504631","","Chaos;Entropy;Evolutionary computation;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Particle swarm optimization;Pixel;Search methods","evolutionary computation;image retrieval;optimisation;search problems;visual databases;wavelet transforms","evolutionary computation;evolutionary wavelet-based similarity search;histogram-based image search;histogram-based systems;image databases;image retrieval systems;particle swarm optimization;wavelet transformation","","0","","9","","","28-30 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Approaches to reduce the effects of OOV queries on indexed spoken audio","B. Logan; J. M. Van Thong; P. J.

We also examine linear and OOV-based combination of indexing schemes. We experiment on 75 h of broadcast news, comparing our techniques to a word index, a phoneme index and a phoneme index queried with phoneme sequences. Our results show that our approaches are superior to both a word index and a phoneme index for OOV words, and have comparable performance to the sequence of phonemes scheme. The particle system has worse performance than the acoustic query expansion scheme. The best system uses word queries for in-vocabulary words and a linear combination of the phoneme sequence scheme and acoustic query expansion for OOV words. Using the best possible weights for linear combination, this system improves the average precision from 0.35 for a word index to 0.40, a result only obtainable if the weights could be learnt on a development query set. The next best system used a word index for in-vocabulary words and the phoneme sequence system otherwise and had average precision of 0.39.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2005.854429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510637","Audio indexing;out-of-vocabulary words;speech indexing;spoken document retrieval","Automatic speech recognition;Broadcasting;Indexing;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Predictive models;Probability;Speech recognition;Vocabulary","audio signal processing;indexing;information retrieval systems;query processing;speech processing;vocabulary","OOV queries;acoustic query expansion;audio indexing;in-vocabulary words;indexed spoken audio;out of vocabulary query problem;particles;phoneme index;phoneme sequences;speech indexing;spoken document retrieval;syllable-like units;word indexing","","27","7","22","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To code the semantic structure of a document we adapted currently available methodologies for ontology engineering to the context of semantic document coding. We utilized an evolving methodology to design and build an ontology. The resulting methodology closely resembles an agile programming method. To capture the dynamicity of the knowledge within a historical document we embedded a time attribute to all elements of our ontology implementation. The temporal features of this ontology enhanced our semantic model and allowed us to capture the temporal dimension of the existing relations in historical documents. This temporal representation gives the relations more realism approaching that which they have in the real world. To ground our work, we applied the proposed methodology to encode a historical document covering the evolution of the constitution of modern Iran [A. Kasravi, (1940)]. We suggest that the proposed methodology applies equally well to a similar class of documents and that our ontological model can be generalized to any document, which covers historical events in a similar manner.","","POD:0-7803-9093-8","10.1109/IRI-05.2005.1506482","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1506482","","Application software;Constitution;Design methodology;Information retrieval;Internet;Keyword search;Libraries;Natural languages;Ontologies;Search engines","document handling;history;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;text analysis","agile programming method;historical documents;ontological model;ontology engineering;semantic document coding;temporal features;temporal representation","","0","","21","","","15-17 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An 18-participant user study was carried out to compare our design with the traditional search result list in terms of accuracy and task performance. Though statistically significant differences in performance were not observed, the participants' subjective ratings and opinions of the visualization's utility were positive. Despite the fact that the visualization introduces a new and somewhat complicated variable to consider when evaluating search result lists, the participants' performance did not fall below their performance level with the traditional interface. Our findings indicate the need to study such interfaces in a longitudinal setting.","1550-6037;15506037","POD:0-7695-2397-8","10.1109/IV.2005.152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509175","","Data visualization;Digital cameras;Frequency;Information retrieval;Search engines;Solids;Uniform resource locators;Web search;Web sites","Internet;data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;query processing;search engines;task analysis","Web search engines;document-shaped icon;query occurrence visualization;search result interface","","8","2","15","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To efficiently store, retrieve and update information, key-based data accessing algorithms such as hashing are usually used to improve the processing performance. In this paper, we propose the hybrid open hash, a composite algorithm that combines open addressing hash tables with the temporal responsiveness of incremental garbage collection. By dynamically switching between a novel table with incremental construction via selective copying of used entries, and an aged table with incremental cleaning via emptying of deleted entries, this algorithm solves the structural problem of conventional open hashing due to remnants left by deleted keys. Thus, it increases the data accessing speed. We also implement and compare our algorithm with Brutil, the latest proposed hashing mechanism designed for real-time embedded systems, from the concurrency issue of multithreading to the performance simulation by taking the real traffic information to construct hashed keys. Our results show that hybrid open hash has better performance. Several possible enhancement approaches are also discussed to improve the performance further.","2325-5552;23255552","POD:0-7803-8924-7","10.1109/HPSR.2005.1503205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1503205","","Aging;Algorithm design and analysis;Cleaning;Concurrent computing;Delay;Embedded system;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic","embedded systems;file organisation;table lookup","Brutil;dynamically switching;hybrid open hash tables;incremental cleaning;key-based data accessing algorithms;network processors;packet classification;real-time embedded systems;traffic header information","","1","","11","","","12-14 May 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, based on the derived features, a hierarchical indexing structure for 3D model database is constructed using the hierarchical self organizing map (HSOM). Third, an efficient search approach is presented based on the established indexing structure that requires only feature matching between the query model and a small number of SOM nodes. The main advantages of our approach include high retrieval precision due to the discrimination capacity of kernel PCA, and low computation cost due to the hierarchical indexing structure and data dimension reduction. In addition, the topology-preserving property of HSOM also facilitates the exploration of the model database with the possibility of further knowledge discovery.","1550-6037;15506037","POD:0-7695-2397-8","10.1109/IV.2005.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509171","","Application software;Feature extraction;Head;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Kernel;Organizing;Principal component analysis;Spatial databases","computer graphics;data mining;data reduction;data structures;database indexing;feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;principal component analysis;self-organising feature maps","3D head model retrieval framework;data dimension reduction;data reduction;feature extraction;feature matching;hierarchical indexing structure;hierarchical self organizing map;kernel PCA;knowledge discovery;query model;topology-preserving property","","1","","9","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
