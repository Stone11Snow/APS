Most text classification efforts so far concentrated on developing centralized solutions. However, centralized classification approaches often are limited due to constraints on knowledge and computing resources. In addition, centralized approaches are more vulnerable to attacks or system failures and less robust in dealing with them. We present a decentralized approach and system implementation (named MACCI) for text classification using a multi-agent framework. Experiments are conducted to compare our multi-agent approach with a centralized approach. The results show multi-agent classification can achieve promising classification results while maintaining its other advantages","","POD:1-58113-876-8","10.1145/1065385.1065420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118532","classification;multi-agent system","Distributed computing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Internet;Laboratories;Multiagent systems;Permission;Robustness;Software libraries;Text categorization","classification;multi-agent systems","automatic text classification;digital library;multi-agent framework","","1","","5","","","7-11 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents. Precision and recall for title extraction from Word is 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint is 0.875 and 0.895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language.

In this paper, we present the results of experiments we have carried out with a novel machine learning approach we have proposed for the deduplication problem. This approach, based on genetic programming (GP), is able to automatically generate similarity functions to identify record replicas in a given repository. The generated similarity functions properly combine and weight the best evidence available among the record fields in order to tell when two distinct records represent the same real-world entity.

One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms","","POD:1-58113-876-8","10.1145/1065385.1065415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118528","collaborative filtering;link prediction;recommender system","Books;Collaboration;Couplings;Filtering algorithms;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Predictive models;Recommender systems;Social network services","digital libraries;graph theory;human computer interaction;information filtering","collaborative filtering;data sparsity problem;digital library;graph-based algorithms;link prediction;network modeling;recommender systems;user interests;user preferences;user-item interactions","","33","","6","","","7-11 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, speech summarization has a number of significant challenges that distinguish it from general text summarization. Fundamental problems with speech summarization include speech recognition errors, disfluencies, and difficulties of sentence segmentation. Typical speech summarization systems consist of speech recognition, sentence segmentation, sentence extraction, and sentence compaction components. Most of the research has focuses on sentence extraction, using LSA (latent semantic analysis), MMR (maximal marginal relevance), or feature-based approaches, among which no decisive method has yet been found. Proper sentence segmentation is also essential to achieve good summarization performance. How to objectively evaluate speech summarization results is an important issue. Several measures, including families of SumACCY and ROUGE measures, have been proposed, and correlation analyses between subjective and objective evaluation scores have been performed. Although these measures are useful for ranking various summarization methods, they do not correlate well with human evaluations, especially when spontaneous speech is targeted.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0873-3; POD:1-4244-0872-5","10.1109/SLT.2006.326806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123351","","Broadcasting;Compaction;Computer science;Data mining;Information retrieval;Performance analysis;Speech analysis;Speech recognition;Speech synthesis;Synthesizers","natural language processing;speech recognition","automatic speech summarization;disfluencies;feature-based approaches;latent semantic analysis;maximal marginal relevance;sentence compaction components;sentence extraction;sentence segmentation;speech archives;speech recognition errors;spoken document retrieval","","4","","35","","","10-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed a novel technique for automatic initialisation of active contour. Using only shape information degrades performance in pose varying cases.

User-defined classes in large image databases are often composed of several groups of images and span very different scales in the space of low-level visual descriptors. The interactive retrieval of such image classes is then very difficult. To address this challenge, we evaluate here, in the context of satellite image retrieval, two general improvements for relevance feedback using support vector machines (SVMs). First, to optimize the transfer of information between the user and the system, we focus on the criterion employed by the system for selecting the images presented to the user at every feedback round. We put forward an active-learning selection criterion that minimizes redundancy between the candidate images shown to the user. Second, for image classes spanning very different scales in the low-level description space, we find that a high sensitivity of the SVM to the scale of the data brings about a low retrieval performance. We argue that the insensitivity to scale is desirable in this context, and we show how to obtain it by the use of specific kernel functions.

Based on well-studied information retrieval theories, this paper proposes a novel systematic approach for transcription factor target gene prediction. The key of the approach is to model the prediction problem as a classification task by representing the features of the sequential data into vector data points in a higher-order domain.

The alerting service notifies its clients about new or changed documents. Proprietary and mediating alerting services fail to fluidly integrate information from differing collections. So far, no sophisticated service has been proposed that is integrated with the digital library software and covers heterogeneous and distributed collections. This paper analyses the conceptual requirements of this much-sought after service for digital libraries. We demonstrate that the differing concepts of digital libraries and its underlying technical design has extensive influence (a) the expectations, needs and interests of users regarding an alerting service, and (b) on the technical possibilities of the implementation of the service. Our findings show that the range of issues surrounding alerting services for digital libraries, their design and use is greater than one may anticipate. We also show that, conversely, the requirements for an alerting service have considerable impact on the concepts of DL design. Our findings should be of interest for librarians as well as system designers. We highlight and discuss the far-reaching implications for the design of, and interaction with, libraries.

Secondly, there exists non-linear relationship between feature vectors of different images and can be exploited very efficiently with the use of support vector machines. At first level, for low level feature extraction we have used dual tree complex wavelet transform because recently it is proven to be one of the best for texture based features. At second level to extract semantic concepts, we grouped images of typical texture classes with the use of one against all support vector machines.

However, there is always a gap between high-level human perception of an image and the low-level image features used to describe its contents. This gap between low-level image features and semantic image content is the major bottleneck faced by traditional CBIR systems. Modern CBIR systems overcome this problem by using interactive learning, bringing the user in the loop. Such systems learn from feedbacks given by the user about the relevance or irrelevance of the current retrieval results. This paper presents a framework for interactive content-based image retrieval.

Dept., Queen Mary Univ. of London","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","20070305","2007","17","3","313","323","In this paper, a system for object-based semi-automatic indexing and retrieval of natural images is introduced. Three important concepts underpin the proposed system: a new strategy to fuse different low-level content descriptions; a learning technique involving user relevance feedback; and a novel object based model to link semantic terms and visual objects. To achieve high accuracy in the retrieval and subsequent annotation processes several low-level image primitives are combined in a suitable multifeatures space. This space is modelled in a structured way exploiting both low-level features and spatial contextual relations of image blocks.

For example, people wake up at the same time and follow more or less the same route to their work everyday. The discovery of hidden periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data could unveil important information to the data analyst. Existing approaches for discovering periodic patterns focus on symbol sequences. However, these methods cannot directly be applied to a spatiotemporal sequence because of the fuzziness of spatial locations in the sequence. In this paper, we define the problem of mining periodic patterns in spatiotemporal data and propose an effective and efficient algorithm for retrieving maximal periodic patterns. In addition, we study two interesting variants of the problem. The first is the retrieval of periodic patterns that are frequent only during a continuous subinterval of the whole history. The second problem is the discovery of periodic patterns, whose instances may be shifted or distorted. We demonstrate how our mining technique can be adapted for these variants.

We study how to identify known item queries in the context of a large academic institution's online public access catalog (OPAC), in which queries are issued via a simple keyword interface. We also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved the item in question. Our approach combines techniques in machine learning, language modeling and machine translation evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable of distinguishing known item queries and correctly classifies titles for whether they are the known item sought with an 80% and 95% correlation to human performance, respectively on each task.

Categorization enables one to determine automatically, based on the image content, the examined body region and imaging modality. It is a basic step in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems, the goal of which is to augment text-based search with visual information analysis. CBIR systems are currently being integrated with picture archiving and communication systems for increasing the overall search capabilities and tools available to radiologists. The proposed methodology is comprised of a continuous and probabilistic image representation scheme using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM) along with information-theoretic image matching via the Kullback-Leibler (KL) measure. The GMM-KL framework is used for matching and categorizing X-ray images by body regions. A multidimensional feature space is used to represent the image input, including intensity, texture, and spatial information. Unsupervised clustering via the GMM is used to extract coherent regions in feature space that are then used in the matching process. A dominant characteristic of the radiological images is their poor contrast and large intensity variations. This presents a challenge to matching among the images, and is handled via an illumination-invariant representation. The GMM-KL framework is evaluated for image categorization and image retrieval on a dataset of 1500 radiological images. A classification rate of 97.5% was achieved. The classification results compare favorably with reported global and local representation schemes. Precision versus recall curves indicate a strong retrieval result as compared with other state-of-the-art retrieval techniques.

Effective indexing and retrieval from surveillance video databases are very important. Although there are many ways to represent the content of video clips in current video retrieval algorithms, there still exists a semantic gap between users and retrieval systems. Visual surveillance systems supply a platform for investigating semantic-based video retrieval. In this paper, a semantic-based video retrieval framework for visual surveillance is proposed. A cluster-based tracking algorithm is developed to acquire motion trajectories. The trajectories are then clustered hierarchically using the spatial and temporal information, to learn activity models. A hierarchical structure of semantic indexing and retrieval of object activities, where each individual activity automatically inherits all the semantic descriptions of the activity model to which it belongs, is proposed for accessing video clips and individual objects at the semantic level. The proposed retrieval framework supports various queries including queries by keywords, multiple object queries, and queries by sketch. For multiple object queries, succession and simultaneity restrictions, together with depth and breadth first orders, are considered. For sketch-based queries, a method for matching trajectories drawn by users to spatial trajectories is proposed.

"Probe Minimization by Schedule Optimization: Supporting Top-K Queries with Expensive Predicates","S. w. Hwang; K. C. C. Chang","Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., Pohang Univ. of Sci. & Technol.","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20070326","2007","19","5","646","662","This paper addresses the problem of evaluating ranked top-k queries with expensive predicates. As major DBMSs now all support expensive user-defined predicates for Boolean queries, we believe such support for ranked queries can be even more important: first, ranked queries often need to model user-specific concepts of preference, relevance, or similarity, which call for dynamic user-defined functions. Second, middleware systems must incorporate external predicates for integrating autonomous sources typically accessible only by per-object queries. Third, ranked queries often accompany Boolean ranking conditions, which may turn predicates into expensive ones, as the index structure on the predicate built on the base table may be no longer effective in retrieving the filtered objects in order. Fourth, fuzzy joins are inherently expensive, as they are essentially user-defined operations that dynamically associate multiple relations.

The precision obtained at the end of every iteration is used was a reward signal in the Q-learning based reinforcement learning (RL) approach. The objective of learning in IRRL is to estimate the optimal RF technique to be applied for a given query at a specific iteration. The main drawback of IRRL is its prohibitive learning time and storage requirement. We propose a way of addressing these difficulties by performing `pre-digestion' of concepts before applying IRRL.

First, we present a hybrid peer architecture, in which peers prefer peer-to-peer architecture to super-peer based architecture. Then, we extend the definition of view and propose the peer view, local view and global view according to the requirements of applications. So a global view maintenance is became the maintenance of all related local views if join operations are confined in each local PDMS. Furthermore, we extend Mork's rules governing the use of updategrams and boosters and provide a push-based algorithm for view maintenance. Finally, we do extensive simulation experiments in our SPDMS.

Unlike the general library profession, which has been able to rely on MARC throughout the years as its primary vehicle for bibliographic description, museums and archives have traditionally had no formal metadata structure to create portable metadata records. It is likely that for this reason museums and archives were quick to embrace EAD (Encoded Archival Description) as the defacto method for creating portable finding aids. However, while EAD has provided a vehicle for portability, institutions have found that actually using these finding aids within a database or for display can be quite daunting. Often times, individual institutions creating finding aids have no idea how to make use of them within their institution's current infrastructure - often relying on larger organizations like the California Digital Library or the Northwest Digital Archive (NWDA) to provide a vehicle for distributing their materials.

One way of overcoming this problem is the postulation of a ""fuzzy ontology"" by adding a value for degree of membership to each term that is imprecise in nature. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy ontology generation framework in which a concept descriptor is represented as a fuzzy relation which encodes the degree of a property value using a fuzzy membership function. The fuzzy ontology framework provides appropriate support for application integration by identifying the most likely location of a particular term in the ontology.

Nodes can be physical items, concepts, events, actions or attributes. The nodes are interconnected by links or arcs. These arcs show the relationships between the various objects and descriptive factors. Knowledge can be represented through using semantic networks. Lexical item learning from contexts of texts is an efficient way better than memorizing many single words. In this paper, we propose a semantic network based vocabulary learning system (SNVLS) which is a knowledge based system.

The selected keyphrases are translated into disjunctive normal form (DNF) based on the POS phrase categorization technique for better query refomulation. Furthermore, we study whether ontologies such as WordNet and MeSH improve the retrieval performance in conjunction with the keyphrases.

The automatic class induction algorithm is based on the work of Pargellis et al,. The semantic similarity metrics that are evaluated and combined are based on narrow- and wide-context vector- product similarity. The metrics are combined using linear weights that are computed 'on the fly' and are updated at each iteration of the class induction algorithm, forming a corpus-independent metric. Specifically, the weight of each metric is selected to be inversely proportional to the inter-class similarity of the classes induced by that metric and for the current iteration of the algorithm. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two corpora: a semantically heterogeneous news domain (HR-Net) and an application-specific travel reservation corpus (ATIS). It is shown, that the (unsupervised) adaptive weighting scheme outperforms the (supervised) fixed weighting scheme. Up to 50% relative error reduction is achieved by the adaptive weighting scheme.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0873-3; POD:1-4244-0872-5","10.1109/SLT.2006.326823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123368","","Computer science;Data mining;Induction generators;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Natural languages;Ontologies;Speech;Text processing;Vocabulary","text analysis;unsupervised learning","application-specific travel reservation corpus;automatic class induction;corpus-independent metric;heterogeneous news domain;semantic class induction;semantic similarity metrics;unsupervised combination","","5","","7","","","10-13 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This interaction is based on a topic hierarchy constructed by the key terms extracted from the retrieved spoken documents. In this paper, the efficiency of the user interaction in such a system is further improved by a key term ranking algorithm using reinforcement learning with simulated users.

We examine the impact of three factors on summary efficacy: (1) the number and type of attributes selected for summary construction; (2) the use of a decision theoretic user model; and (3) the use of association rules derived automatically from the database subset currently in-focus.

There is some difficulty, however, in evaluating the impact of the test query set on retrieval results. The traditional evaluation process, the Cranfield evaluation paradigm, which uses a corpus and a set of user queries, focuses on making the queries as realistic as possible. Unfortunately such query sets lack the fine grained control necessary to test algorithm properties. We present an approach called controlled query generation (CQG) that creates query sets from documents in the corpus in a way that regulates the theoretic information quality of each query. This allows us to generate reproducible and well defined sets of queries of varying length and term specificity. Imposing this level of control over the query sets used for testing retrieval algorithms enables the rigorous simulation of different query environments to identify specific algorithm properties before introducing user queries. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of CQG by generating three different query environments to investigate characteristics of two blind relevance feedback approaches","","POD:1-59593-354-9","10.1145/1141753.1141818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4119141","algorithm evaluation;blind relevance feedback;control environment;controlled query generation","Character generation;Control systems;Feedback;Information retrieval;Permission;Process control;Research and development;Testing","query formulation;relevance feedback","blind relevance feedback algorithm evaluation;controlled query generation;document retrieval","","0","","27","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These features include minutia detail and Delaunay triangle (its handedness, angles, maximum edge, and related angle between orientation field and edges). Experiments on database FVC 2000 and scanned fingerprints with heavy distortion show our algorithm considerably narrows down the search space in fingerprint databases and is also available for distorted fingerprints.

"A hierarchical, HMM-based automatic evaluation of OCR accuracy for a digital library of books","R. Manmatha; S. Feng","University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA","Proceedings of the 6th ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL '06)","20070305","2006","","","109","118","A number of projects are creating searchable digital libraries of printed books. These include the Million Book Project, the Google book project and similar efforts from Yahoo and Microsoft. Content-based on line book retrieval usually requires first converting printed text into machine readable (e.g. ASCII) text using an optical character recognition (OCR) engine and then doing full text search on the results. Many of these books are old and there are a variety of processing steps that are required to create an end to end system. Changing any step (including the scanning process) can affect OCR performance and hence a good automatic statistical evaluation of OCR performance on book length material is needed. Evaluating OCR performance on the entire book is non-trivial. The only easily obtainable ground truth (the Gutenberg e-texts) must be automatically aligned with the OCR output over the entire length of a book. This may be viewed as equivalent to the problem of aligning two large (easily a million long) sequences. The problem is further complicated by OCR errors as well as the possibility of large chunks of missing material in one of the sequences. We propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) based hierarchical alignment algorithm to align OCR output and the ground truth for books. We believe this is the first work to automatically align a whole book without using any book structure information. The alignment process works by breaking up the problem of aligning two long sequences into the problem of aligning many smaller subsequences. This can be rapidly and effectively done. Experimental results show that our hierarchical alignment approach works very well even if OCR output has a high recognition error rate. Finally, we evaluate the performance of a commercial OCR engine over a large dataset of books based on the alignment results","","POD:1-59593-354-9","10.1145/1141753.1141776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4119107","OCR evaluation;book alignment;digital libraries","Books;Character recognition;Hidden Markov models;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Optical materials;Search engines;Software libraries","digital libraries;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;optical character recognition","HMM-based automatic evaluation;OCR accuracy;digital library;hidden Markov model;optical character recognition engine;printed book;text search","","7","3","21","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Novel Approach for Re-Ranking of Search Results Using Collaborative Filtering","U. Rohini; V. Varma","IIIT Hyderabad, India","Computing: Theory and Applications, 2007. ICCTA '07. International Conference on","20070312","2007","","","491","496","Search engines today often return a large volume of results with possibly a few relevant results. The notion of relevance is subjective and depends on the user and context. Re-ranking of the results to reflect the most relevant results to the user using the relevance feedback has received wide attention in information retrieval in recent years. Also, sharing of information among users having similar interests using collaborative filtering techniques has achieved wide success in recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for re-ranking of the search results using collaborative filtering techniques using relevance feedback of a given user as well as the other users. Our approach is to learn the profiles of the users using machine learning techniques making use of past browsing histories including queries posed and documents found relevant or irrelevant. Re-ranking of the results is done using collaborative filtering techniques. First, the context of the query is inferred from the query category. The user's community is determined dynamically in the context of the query by using the user profiles. The rank of a document is calculated using the user's profile as well profiles of the other users in the community","","POD:0-7695-2770-1","10.1109/ICCTA.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4127418","","Automobiles;Cats;Collaboration;Feedback;History;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Search engines;Web search","information filtering;information filters;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing;relevance feedback;search engines;text analysis","collaborative filter;information retrieval;machine learning technique;query category;re-ranking strategy;recommendation system;relevance feedback;search engine","","3","4","27","","","5-7 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many have suggested the use of genres to ameliorate the problem of Web search. A central issue in the implementation of this idea is the choice of genres to be used as Web page descriptors. Several studies have explored user terminology for and recognition of several types of digital documents, e.g., various types of office documents, personal home pages, and pages returned by user Web searches. This article reports on a series of three user studies with the purpose of developing a genre ""palette"" for use in Web retrieval","","POD:1-58113-876-8","10.1145/1065385.1065501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4118601","classification;genre;metadata;web search","Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Information science;Information technology;Internet;Oncology;Software libraries;Terminology;Web pages;Web search","Internet;information retrieval","Web page descriptors;Web retrieval;Web search;digital documents;genres;office documents;personal home pages;user terminology","","0","","","","","7-11 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current digital libraries do not provide users tools to retrieve documents based on the information available within the figures. We propose architecture for retrieving documents by integrating figures and other information. The initial step in enabling integrated document search is to categorize figures into a set of pre-defined types. We propose several categories of figures based on their functionalities in scholarly articles. We have developed a machine-learning-based approach for automatic categorization of figures. Both global features, such as texture, and part features, such as lines, are utilized in the architecture for discriminating among figure categories. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a testbed document set collected from the CiteSeer scientific literature digital library. Experimental evaluation has demonstrated that our algorithms can produce acceptable results for real- world use. Our tools can be integrated into a scientific-document digital library","","POD:1-59593-354-9","10.1145/1141753.1141778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4119109","documents;feature extraction;figures;machine learning;scientific literature","Computer science;Databases;Design engineering;Educational institutions;Flowcharts;Information retrieval;Permission;Search engines;Software libraries;Testing","classification;digital libraries;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","automatic categorization;digital library;machine-learning;nontextual information;scientific document retrieval","","7","","30","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second method is to access personalized information through social navigation support. This paper presents the details of the Knowledge Sea II system for comprehensive personalized access to educational resources and also presents the results of a classroom study. The study delivered a convincing argument for the importance of providing multiple information presentation modes, showing that only about 10% of all resource accesses were made through the traditional search interface.
