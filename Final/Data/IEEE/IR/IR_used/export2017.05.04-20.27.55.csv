Among these concepts is the use of Genetic Programming (GP) to control the game from a human player's perspective. Several GP-based approaches have been examined so far, where traditionally they define two types of GP terminals: one type for information retrieval, the second type for issuing actions (commands) to the game world. However, by using these action terminals the controller has to manage actions issued to the game during their runtime and to monitor their outcome. In order to avoid the need for active task management this paper presents a novel approach for the design of a GP-based Ms. Pac Man controller: the proposed approach solely relies on information retrieval terminals in order to rate all possible directions of movement at every time step during a running game. Based on these rating values the controller can move the agent through the mazes of the the game world of Ms. Pac Man. With this design, which forms the main contribution of our work, we decrease the overall GP solution complexity by removing all action control management tasks from the system. It is demonstrated that by following the proposed approach such a system can successfully control an autonomous agent in a computer game environment on the level of an amateur human player.","2325-4270;23254270","Electronic:978-1-4673-1194-6; POD:978-1-4673-1193-9; USB:978-1-4673-1192-2","10.1109/CIG.2012.6374163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6374163","","Abstracts;Computational intelligence;Games;Humans;Information retrieval;Sociology;Statistics","computer games;genetic algorithms;information retrieval","AI;GP solution complexity;GP-based approaches;Ms. Pac Man video game;action control management task removal;action terminals;artificial intelligence;autonomous agent control;game mazes;genetic programming;human player perspective;information retrieval;rating values;reactive control;task management","","5","","16","","","11-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem is not well solved yet despite many research efforts in this field. In this paper, we suggest mid-level summarization of music signals based on chord progressions. More specially, in our proposed algorithm, chord progressions are recognized from music signals based on a supervised learning model, and recognition accuracy is improved by locally probing n-best candidates. By investigating the properties of chord progressions, we further calculate a histogram from the probed chord progressions as a summary of the music signal. We show that the chord progression-based summarization is a powerful feature descriptor for representing harmonic progressions and tonal structures of music signals. The proposed algorithm is evaluated with content-based music retrieval as a typical application. The experimental results on a dataset with more than 70,000 songs confirm that our algorithm can effectively improve summarization accuracy of musical audio contents and retrieval performance, and enhance music retrieval applications on large-scale audio databases.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4875-3; POD:978-1-4673-4370-1","10.1109/ISM.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424623","Chord progression-based summarization;audio representing and computing;locality sensitive hashing;music-IR","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Multiple signal classification;Music;Support vector machines;Training","audio databases;audio signal processing;content management;content-based retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;signal representation","chord progression probing;chord progression recognition accuracy;chord progression-based summarization;compact music signal representation;content-based music retrieval;feature descriptor;harmonic progression representation;histogram;large-scale audio databases;large-scale content-based music applications;mid-level music signal summarization;music content management;music information retrieval performance;musical audio contents;n-best candidate probing;near duplicate audio detection;supervised learning model;tonal structures","","1","","18","","","10-12 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several researchers have developed tools implementing information retrieval (IR) approaches to suggest traceability links among artifacts. Aim: We explore the consequences of the fact that a majority of the evaluations of such tools have been focused on benchmarking of mere tool output. Method: To illustrate this issue, we have adapted a framework of general IR evaluations to a context taxonomy specifically for IR-based traceability recovery. Furthermore, we evaluate a previously proposed experimental framework by conducting a study using two publicly available tools on two datasets originating from development of embedded software systems. Results: Our study shows that even though both datasets contain software artifacts from embedded development, the characteristics of the two datasets differ considerably, and consequently the traceability outcomes. Conclusions: To enable replications and secondary studies, we suggest that datasets should be thoroughly characterized in future studies on traceability recovery, especially when they can not be disclosed. Also, while we conclude that the experimental framework provides useful support, we argue that our proposed context taxonomy is a useful complement. Finally, we discuss how empirical evidence of the feasibility of IR-based traceability recovery can be strengthened in future research.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-541-6","10.1049/ic.2012.0014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6272503","","","embedded systems;information retrieval;program diagnostics;software engineering;system recovery","benchmarking;context taxonomy;embedded software system development;information retrieval tool taxonomy;software artifact;software intensive system development;traceability link;traceability recovery evaluation","","1","","","","","14-15 May 2012","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

It allows different types of robots to share information and develop new skills even without specific sensors. They can also perform intensive tasks by combining multiple robots with a cooperative manner. Multi-sensor data retrieval is one of the fundamental tasks for resource sharing demanded by Cloud Robotic system. However, many technical challenges persist, for example Multi-Sensor Data Retrieval (MSDR) is particularly difficult when Cloud Cluster Hosts accommodate unpredictable data requested by multi robots in parallel. Moreover, the synchronization of multi-sensor data mostly requires near real-time response of different message types. In this paper, we describe a MSDR framework which is comprised of priority scheduling method and buffer management scheme. It is validated by assessing the quality of service (QoS) model in the sense of facilitating data retrieval management.

Among several automated detection approaches, text-based information retrieval (IR) approaches have been shown to outperform others in term of both accuracy and time efficiency. However, those IR-based approaches do not detect well the duplicate reports on the same technical issues written in different descriptive terms. This paper introduces DBTM, a duplicate bug report detection approach that takes advantage of both IR-based features and topic-based features. DBTM models a bug report as a textual document describing certain technical issue(s), and models duplicate bug reports as the ones about the same technical issue(s). Trained with historical data including identified duplicate reports, it is able to learn the sets of different terms describing the same technical issues and to detect other not-yet-identified duplicate ones. Our empirical evaluation on real-world systems shows that DBTM improves the state-of-the-art approaches by up to 20% in accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-1204-2; POD:978-1-4503-1204-2","10.1145/2351676.2351687","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6494907","Duplicate Bug Reports;Information Retrieval;Topic Model","","information retrieval;program debugging;text analysis","DBTM approach;IR approach;IR-based feature;duplicate bug report detection;text-based information retrieval;textual document;topic modeling;topic-based feature","","18","","30","","","3-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Subsequently, these priors are used in an IR (Information Retrieval) framework to determine the posterior probability of a file being the cause of a bug. We first present two models to estimate the priors, one from the defect histories and the other from the modification histories, with both types of histories as stored in the versioning tools. Referring to these as the base models, we then extend them by incorporating a temporal decay into the estimation of the priors. We show that by just including the base models, the mean average precision (MAP) for bug localization improves by as much as 30%. And when we also factor in the time decay in the estimates of the priors, the improvements in MAP can be as large as 80%.","2160-1852;21601852","Electronic:978-1-4673-1761-0; POD:978-1-4673-1760-3","10.1109/MSR.2012.6224299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6224299","Bug Localization;Document Priors;Information Retrieval;Software Maintenance","Computational modeling;Computer bugs;Frequency estimation;History;Maximum likelihood estimation;Software","information retrieval;probability;program debugging;software development management","bug localization;information retrieval;mean average precision;probability distribution;software defects;software project;temporal decay;version histories","","15","1","25","","","2-3 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Content-based satellite cloud image processing and information retrieval is a very important problem in image processing and analysis field. In this research, a Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system has been developed using color, texture and shape as retrieval features from the satellite image repository. To extract the grey level/color properties of an image, histogram values have been used. Four functions of texture features have used such as (Entropy, Energy, correlation and contrast) and the shape features (area, perimeter and metric) have been extracted using the morphological operations. The images and the extracted feature vectors were stored in the database.

We compared three different lemmatizer and one fixed length truncation approaches over Turkish text collection. The first one is based on morphological analyzer for Turkish using with finite state language processing technology; another one is Dictionary-based Turkish Lemmatizer (DTL), which uses radix-trie data structure; the third one is a simple dictionary based top-down parser and the last one is truncation of words at fix length. We have assessed the performance of lemmatizers on Bilkent University Milliyet collection, which contains more than 400K documents. The comparison of performance analysis was done by the well-known IR evaluation metrics and experimented in the IR system. The results we obtained show that the lemmatization process improves IR performance and we achieved the best results using with Turkish Lemmatizer that is DTL radix-trie data structure and it used the minimum number of terms in IR system.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1448-0; POD:978-1-4673-1446-6","10.1109/INISTA.2012.6246934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6246934","Information Retrieval;Lemmatization;Normalization;Turkish Information Retrieval","Data structures;Dictionaries;Educational institutions;Indexing;Pragmatics","data structures;finite state machines;information retrieval;natural languages;text analysis","Bilkent University Milliyet collection;DTL radix-trie data structure;IR evaluation metrics;Turkish text collection;dictionary form;dictionary-based Turkish lemmatizer;finite state language processing technology;fixed length truncation approaches;information retrieval;morphological analyzer;simple dictionary-based top-down parser","","0","","22","","","2-4 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our case, we view combining words and pictures as a task in which a training dataset of tagged pictures is provided and we need to automatically combine the query relevant words and pictures. To do this, we first describe the picture using feature vector. We do static analysis over computed features to get distinguishing feature descriptors. Maximum similarity i.e. minimum distance allows us to find the query relevant combined pictures and associated relevant words.

A lexical association function has been derived analytically using the system relevance criteria. The derivation is further justified using an empirical evidence from the user relevance criteria. Such analytical derivation as presented in this paper provides a proper mathematical framework to the query expansion techniques, which have largely been heuristic in the existing literature. By using the generalized retrieval framework, the proposed query representation model is equally applicable to the vector space model (VSM), Okapi best matching 25 (Okapi BM25), and Language Model (LM). Experiments over various data sets from TREC show that the proposed query representation gives statistically significant improvements over the baseline Okapi BM25 and LM as well as other well-known global query expansion techniques.

Semantic interoperability refers to the ability of peers to communicate with each others. We take into account these notions separately, as raising two different problems. Hence we propose two independent and complementary solutions. The GoOD-TA protocol aims at reducing heterogeneity through ontology-driven topology adaptation. DiQuESh is a top-k algorithm for distributed information retrieval that is intended to ensure interoperability. This distinction enables highlighting their respective benefits on the IR performances and leads to a modular architecture. For our experiments we obtained a set of actively used real-world ontologies through the NCBO BioPortal. We implemented GoOD-TA and DiQuESH in Java and used the PeerSim simulator. We first show that GoOD-TA nicely reduces the semantic heterogeneity related to the system topology, handles the evolution of peers' descriptors, and is suitable for dynamic systems. Then, GoOD-TA and DiQuESh are run simultaneously, with a significant increase of precision and recall. This enables to identify the indirect contribution of heterogeneity reduction obtained with GoOD-TA to improving interoperability.","2161-3559;21613559","Electronic:978-1-4673-2862-3; POD:978-1-4673-2860-9; USB:978-1-4673-2861-6","10.1109/P2P.2012.6335798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6335798","","Ontologies;Peer to peer computing;Protocols;Semantics;Topology;Vectors","Java;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;peer-to-peer computing","DiQuESh;GoOD-TA protocol;NCBO BioPortal;PeerSim simulator;distributed information retrieval;heterogeneity reduction;ontologies;ontology-driven topology adaptation;semantic heterogeneity;semantic interoperability;system topology;top-k algorithm;unstructured P2P information retrieval systems","","0","","27","","","3-5 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system of information research must organize, store information and then provide the documents which correspond to user information needs. These systems are based on models of information retrieval and use similarity measures taking into account the structural and textual information. This paper presents a new similarity measure, inspired by that of CASIT model (in French: CAlcul de SImilarité Textuelle). It is adapted to semi-structured documents, specifically XML documents. This measure is used to calculate a rate of resemblance between a required XML document and each document of an XML database, by generating of interference wave presenting the existence and importance of the vocabulary of the required document in each document of database. Two important notions are used: the neighborhood that allows the valuation of terms and the path of tags followed to reach lexical units. This similarity measure has been exploited by a system of semi-structured information retrieval which we realized. We have used an experimental XML database and defined the time as criterion of evaluation. Consequently the running time is linear, which makes use of a huge database possible. Then tested in term of quality and answers relevance by the measure: recall / precision.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1166-3; POD:978-1-4673-1167-0","10.1109/ICITeS.2012.6216597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6216597","Similarity measure;XML;indexing;information retrieval;path;semi-structured information","Educational institutions;Indexing;Information retrieval;Interference;Vectors;XML","XML;information needs;information retrieval;text analysis","CASIT model;XML database;XML documents;information research;interference wave;semistructured documents;semistructured information retrieval;similarity measures;structural information;textual information;user information needs","","0","","11","","","24-26 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study addresses these issues developing a Project Document Ontology (PDO) which is based on RDF Schema and combined with a set of well-known vocabularies, including FOAF, DC, and DOAP, to annotate project documents in Linked Data format. To illustrate the PDO applications, this study demonstrate project documents can be annotated from heterogeneous and distributed project resources, including design document, analysis document, plan document and work log.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2743-5; POD:978-1-4673-2742-8","10.1109/SCIS-ISIS.2012.6504998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504998","Linked Data;RDF;Semantic Web;XML","","document handling;information retrieval;information systems;meta data","DC;DOAP;FOAF;PDO applications;RDF Schema;RDF data model;XML- based metadata;analysis document;design document;distributed project resources;format;heterogeneous project resources;information interoperability;intelligent information retrieval;large-scale information system;linked data format;plan document;project document management;project document ontology;software project management;syntax;work log","","1","","24","","","20-24 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning to rank for information retrieval (LR4IR) employs supervised learning techniques to address this problem, and it aims to produce a ranking model automatically for defining a proper sequential order of related documents based on the query. The ranking model determines the relationship degree between documents and the query. In this paper an improved version of RankGP is proposed. It uses layered multi-population genetic programming to obtain a ranking function which consists of a set of IR evidences and particular predefined operators. The proposed method is capable to generate complex functions through evolving small populations. In this paper, LETOR 4.0 was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the results showed that the method is competitive with other LR4IR Algorithms.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359640","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359640","Evolutionary computation;Genetic programming;Learning to rank for Information Retrieval;Ranking function","Abstracts;Programming;Sociology;Statistics","document handling;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing","LETOR 4.0;LR4IR;RankGP;document ranking;layered multipopulation genetic programming;learning to rank for information retrieval;ranking function;supervised learning techniques;user query","","0","","18","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, this approach incurs a high computation cost as every part of document needs to be checked. As a result, it is not applicable to systems with a large number of documents that need to be protected. Additionally, the approach is prone to false positives if the fingerprints are common phrases. In this paper, we propose an improvement for this approach to offer a much faster processing time with less false positives. The core idea of our solution is to eliminate common phrases and non-sensitive phrases from the fingerprinting process. Non-sensitive phrases are identified by looking at available public documents of the organization that we want to protect from information leaks and common phrases are identified with the help of a search engine. In this way, our solution both accelerates leak detection and increases the accuracy of the result. Experiments were conducted on real-world data to prove the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed solution.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4762-6; POD:978-1-4673-2116-7","10.1109/EC2ND.2011.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378487","fingerprinting;information leaks;privacy","Accuracy;Electronic mail;Google;Leak detection;Organizations;Search engines","data privacy;document handling;fingerprint identification;information retrieval;search engines","IRILD;common phrases elimination;fingerprint generation;fingerprinting process;high computation cost;information leak detection;information retrieval-based method;nonsensitive phrases elimination;outgoing documents;processing time;public documents;real-world data;search engine;searching;sensitive data","","2","1","19","","","6-7 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, recently it has been shown that adding `small' correction to leading order Hawking analysis, accounting for the correlations, doesn't help to restore unitarity. This paper generalizes the bound on entanglement entropy by relaxing the `smallness' condition and configures the parameters for possible recovery of information from an evaporating black hole. The new bound effectively puts an upper limit on increase in entanglement entropy. It also facilitates to relate the change in entanglement entropy to the amount of correction to Hawking state.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1436-7; POD:978-1-4673-1434-3","10.1109/ICECE.2012.6471663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471663","Black hole evaporation;Hawking radiation;Information paradox","Correlation;Educational institutions;Entropy;Information retrieval;Production;Quantum mechanics","black holes;entropy;quantum entanglement","Hawking analysis;Hawking state;black hole evaporation;black hole radiation;entanglement entropy;nonunitary evolution;quantum correlations;radiation process","","0","","14","","","20-22 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the system has been treated to be the tough security measures to identify the user being genuine by avoiding the third party attack. But these systems are unable to judge whether the user who is providing the required authentication details is an impostor or genuine. To eliminate this flaw in biometric based security systems, the model proposed in this paper can be embedded in existing security systems to prevent the spoof attack. The proposed model comprises of two independent models namely Cryptographic based authentication system (model 1) and Text prompted authentication system (model 2). Model 1 has been designed by the most efficient cryptographic algorithm RSA which generates a secret key by using a pseudo-random number given by user for secure system access. In model 2, the user is made interactive with the system by prompting a question from a set of 15 questions, and authenticating the user with the help of correct answer provided by user. To provide higher level of security, MD5 (Message Digest 5) algorithm is integrated with RSA. The developed models provide promising level of security along with a biometric trait.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4805-8; POD:978-1-4673-4806-5","10.1109/WICT.2012.6409097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6409097","Aliveness Detection;AntiSpoofing;Biometrie traits;Cipher text;Secured data;User Authentication","Communications technology;Decision support systems","biometrics (access control);information retrieval;public key cryptography;text analysis","MD5 algorithm;Message Digest 5 algorithm;biometric based security systems;biometric trait;cryptographic algorithm RSA;cryptographic approach;cryptographic based authentication system;identification systems;information retrieval security;pseudo-random number;secret key generation;spoof attack prevention;text prompted authentication system;third party attack","","0","","16","","","Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The amount of information handled by various organizations in the world today is high and its management without the computer is no longer imaginable.

"Share Conversion and Private Information Retrieval","A. Beimel; Y. Ishai; E. Kushilevitz; I. Orlov","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Ben Gurion Univ., Beer-Sheva, Israel","2012 IEEE 27th Conference on Computational Complexity","20120719","2012","","","258","268","An information-theoretic private information retrieval (PIR) protocol allows a client to retrieve the i-th bit of a database, held by two or more servers, without revealing information about i to any individual server. Information theoretic PIR protocols are closely related to locally decodable codes (LDCs), which are error correcting codes that can simultaneously offer a high level of robustness and sublinear time decoding of each bit of the encoded message. Recent breakthrough results of Yekhanin (STOC 2007) and Efremenko (STOC 2009) have led to a dramatic improvement in the asymptotic complexity of PIR and LDC. We suggest a new “cryptographic” perspective on these recent constructions, which is based on a general notion of share conversion in secret sharing schemes that may be of independent interest. Our new perspective gives rise to a clean framework which unifies previous constructions and generalizes them in several directions. In a nutshell, we use the following two-step approach: (1) apply share conversion to get a low-communication secure multiparty computation protocol P for a nontrivial class F of low-depth circuits; (2) use a lower bound on the VC dimension of F to get a good PIR protocol from P. Our framework reduces the task of designing good PIR protocols to that of finding powerful forms of share conversion which support circuit classes of a high VC dimension. Motivated by this framework, we study the general power of share conversion and obtain both positive and negative results. Our positive results improve the concrete complexity of PIR even for very feasible real-life parameters. They also lead to some improvements in the asymptotic complexity of the best previous PIR and LDC constructions. For 3-server PIR, we improve the asymptotic communication complexity from O(2<sup>146√(log n log log n)</sup>) to O(2<sup>6√(log n log log n)</sup>) bits, where n is the database size. Our negative results on share conversion - stablish some limitations on the power of our approach.","1093-0159;10930159","Electronic:978-0-7695-4708-4; POD:978-1-4673-1663-7","10.1109/CCC.2012.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6243402","VC dimension;constant-depth circuits;locally decodable codes;matching vectors;private information retrieval;secret-sharing;secure multiparty computation","Additives;Complexity theory;Databases;Logic gates;Protocols;Servers;Vectors","computational complexity;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;decoding;error correction codes;information retrieval","LDC;PIR concrete complexity improvement;PIR protocols;VC dimension;asymptotic communication complexity improvement;circuit classes;cryptographic perspective;encoded message;error correcting code robustness;information-theoretic private information retrieval protocol;locally decodable codes;low-communication secure multiparty computation protocol;low-depth circuits;lower bound;nontrivial class;real-life parameters;secret-sharing schemes;share conversion;sublinear-time decoding","","4","","35","","","26-29 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The benefits of publishing information retrieval experiments as a service are striking for the community as a whole, including potential to boost research profiles and reputation. However, the additional work must be kept to a minimum and sensitive data must be kept private for this paradigm to become an accepted practice.

Consequently, requirements are scattered throughout multiple documents expressing different levels of requirements and different kinds of requirements. Formalizing this information and tracing different relationships among documents and organizing this environment present a challenging question. Domain-specific modeling and traceability modeling are Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques that could address various aspects of requirements formalization. Text-based high level requirements can be formalized as document concepts can be gathered and represented. Still, relationships cannot always be determined using sole MDE approaches and, as a consequence, relationships and traceability issue remains. Information retrieval (IR) approaches have already proved to work in an efficient way on large text corpora for requirements traceability analysis but do only consider similarity aspects of flatten documents, losing their organization and hierarchy. This paper aims to introduce how a combined use of both MDE and IR can lead to improved requirements organization and traceability while handling textual ambiguous requirements documents.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4389-3; POD:978-1-4673-4387-9","10.1109/MoDRE.2012.6360072","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360072","information retrieval;modeling;textual requirements;traceability","Analytical models;Indexes;Information retrieval;Organizations;Software;Standards organizations","formal specification;information retrieval;software engineering;text analysis","IR approach;MDE techniques;Text-based high level requirements;complex industrial projects;domain-specific modeling;flatten documents;information retrieval;large text corpora;model driven engineering;multilevel textual requirements traceability;multiple documents;textual information;traceability modeling","","1","","27","","","24-24 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we focus on computational PIR (cPIR) techniques which ensure privacy while using only one server and no dedicated hardware modules. Privacy is achieved with the help of encryption that relies on mathematical problems that are computationally intractable.

Locating the source code files that need to be changed in order to fix the bugs is a challenging task. Once a bug report is received, it is desirable to automatically point out to the files that developers should change in order to fix the bug. In this paper, we propose BugLocator, an information retrieval based method for locating the relevant files for fixing a bug. BugLocator ranks all files based on the textual similarity between the initial bug report and the source code using a revised Vector Space Model (rVSM), taking into consideration information about similar bugs that have been fixed before. We perform large-scale experiments on four open source projects to localize more than 3,000 bugs. The results show that BugLocator can effectively locate the files where the bugs should be fixed. For example, relevant buggy files for 62.60% Eclipse 3.1 bugs are ranked in the top ten among 12,863 files. Our experiments also show that BugLocator outperforms existing state-of-the-art bug localization methods.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-4673-1067-3; POD:978-1-4673-1066-6","10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227210","bug localization;bug reports;feature location;information retrieval","Computational modeling;Computer bugs;Equations;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Vectors","information retrieval;program debugging;public domain software;software quality","BugLocator;bug reports;information retrieval based method;information retrieval-based bug localization;open source projects;rVSM;revised vector space model;software quality;software system;source code files;textual similarity","","73","","39","","","2-9 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In deduplication systems, we need to use methods of information retrieval to find duplicate data chunks quickly. Chunk-lookup disk bottleneck problem is one of the most important problems in the information retrieval of deduplication systems. Previous methods can reduce RAM usage of index a lot to avoid reading index from disk for every chunk search. However, these methods still need several TB of RAM to hold the index for dozens of PB of storage space utilization. We design Linear Hashing with Key Groups(LHs), a variation of Linear Hashing, to organize and address bins. Based on LHs, we propose a novel method of information retrieval in deduplication, which can avoid an index in RAM by utilizing LHs to compute the address of a bin. A bin contains the chunk IDs of the similar files to a file. Then, we do not need to maintain an index in RAM to do the same thing. Our method does not decrease the deduplication efficiency compared with Extreme Binning, when it needs one disk read for every file. For every file, our method firstly computes the bin address of this file using LHs, loads the bin and then deduplicates the file against the loaded bin. Experimental results show that, while our method does not need an index in RAM, the deduplication efficiency of our method is slightly better than that of Extreme Binning.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359555","Deduplication;chunk-lookup disk bottleneck problem;index;linear hashing","Abstracts;Indexes;Random access memory","database indexing;information retrieval;random-access storage;search problems;storage management","LHS;RAM indexing;RAM usage;chunk search;chunk-lookup disk bottleneck problem;deduplication efficiency;deduplication systems;duplicate data chunks;extreme binning;information retrieval;key groups;linear hashing;storage space utilization","","1","","7","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is because the motive of information retrieval systems is not only to render information to the regular users of internet but also, help the novice users of internet to skim out the documents that they need. In our paper, we have suggested that the information retrieval models must contain some questions regarding the user intent as well so that the search engine is able to search the websites that may prove to be informative for the users.

This is a hard information retrieval problem as the texts are very short and have little predefined structure. We present a solution that involves three steps: text data preprocessing, clustering, and visualization. In this contribution, we focus on clustering and visualization by presenting a Hebbian network approach that is able to learn the principal components of the data while the data set is continuously growing in size.

MIR users like musicology researchers, musicians, music learners, music therapists, etc., require not just the sound but the actual strength of the music that controls our body, motivates us, cures mental illness, etc. The backbone of any form of music is its raga. A raga is a particular combination of notes with certain laws which, when carefully observed, preserves and safeguards their integrity and create wonders in music. The existing MIR systems and audio search engines concentrate on content based audio mining and not ragas. This paper discusses the classification of ragas and how it differs in Carnatic, Hindustani and Western musical forms.

After the saccadic eye movements the ERP signals were observed in target string retrievals, whereas not observed in standard string retrievals. The classification algorithm was applied and the average decoding performance of single-shot post-saccadic ERP could be 78.2% and 77.6% in recall and precision, respectively. The eye-tracking was also studied and the eye gaze points were confirmed to be on and around target strings when the ERP was elicited. This result suggests that the post-saccadic ERP with eye-tracking leads to a possibility of the use in the brain-computer interface for information retrieval.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1714-6; POD:978-1-4673-1713-9; USB:978-1-4673-1712-2","10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6378240","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6378240","Brain-Computer Interface;Classification;ElectroEncephaloGram (EEG);Event Related Potential (ERP);Information Retrieval;NeuroMarketing;Saccadic Eye Movement;Web Browsing","Electroencephalography;Electromyography;Standards","Internet;brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;eye;information filtering;medical signal processing;online front-ends;pattern classification;visual evoked potentials","ERP signals;Web browsing;brain-computer interface;classification algorithm;decoding performance;eye gaze points;eye tracking;information retrieval;post-saccadic event related potential;saccadic eye movements;single-shot post-saccadic ERP;string retrieval;two-channel electroencephalogram","","0","","9","","","14-17 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a PIR protocol with the communication complexity of $(O(gamma log n))$ bits, where $(gamma)$ is the ciphertext size. Furthermore, we extend the PIR protocol to a private block retrieval (PBR) protocol, a natural and more practical extension of PIR in which the user retrieves a block of bits, instead of retrieving single bit. Our protocols are built on the state-of-the-art fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) techniques and provide privacy for the user if the underlying FHE scheme is semantically secure. The total communication complexity of our PBR is $(O(gamma log m+gamma n/m))$ bits, where $(m)$ is the number of blocks. The total computation complexity of our PBR is $(O(mlog m))$ modular multiplications plus $(O(n/2))$ modular additions. In terms of total protocol execution time, our PBR protocol is more efficient than existing PBR protocols which usually require to compute $(O(n/2))$ modular multiplications when the size of a block in the database is large and a high-speed network is available.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2012.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189348","Private information retrieval;fully homomorphic encryption;private block retrieval","Complexity theory;Encryption;Indexes;Protocols;Servers","","","","20","","36","","20120424","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our decision processes, emotions and interactions with the world around us are based on and driven by associations to our memories. This natural association paradigm will become critical in future memory systems, namely, the key question will not be “How do I store more information?” but rather, “Do I have the relevant information? How do I retrieve it?” The focus of this paper is to make a first step in this direction. We define and solve a very basic problem in associative retrieval. Given a word W, the words in the memory that are t-associated with W are the words in the ball of radius t around W. In general, given a set of words, say W, X and Y, the words that are t-associated with {W, X, Y} are those in the memory that are within distance t from all the three words. Our main goal is to study the maximum size of the t-associated set as a function of the number of input words and the minimum distance of the words in memory - we call this value the uncertainty of an associative memory. We derive the uncertainty of the associative memory that consists of all the binary vectors with an arbitrary number of input words. In addition, we study the retrieval problem, namely, how do we get the t-associated set given the inputs? We note that this paradigm is a generalization of the sequences reconstruction problem that was proposed by Leven-shtein (2001). In this model, a word is transmitted over multiple channels. A decoder receives all the channel outputs and decodes the transmitted word. Levenshtein computed the minimum number of channels that guarantee a successful decoder - this value happens to be the uncertainty of an associative memory with two input words.","2157-8095;21578095","Electronic:978-1-4673-2579-0; POD:978-1-4673-2580-6; USB:978-1-4673-2578-3","10.1109/ISIT.2012.6283016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6283016","","Associative memory;Context;Decoding;Hamming distance;Uncertainty;Vectors","content-addressable storage;information retrieval","associative memory system;associative retrieval;decision processes;decoder;emotions;information retrieval;memory machines;natural association paradigm;sequence reconstruction problem;uncertainty","","6","","17","","","1-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this research, the theory of planned behavior (TPB), technology acceptance model (TAM), and ethical decision-making process were integrated trying to explore the determinants of intention on participating in VORAs. Structural equation modeling confirmed the fit of the model using 208 individuals/participants in Taiwan as the sample in the context of VORAs. The results indicate that not all the TPB-hypothesized relationships are supported. Noticeably, attitude and subjective norms are significant antecedents of intention.

Learning to rank for information retrieval (LR4IR), which leverages supervised learning-based methods to address the problem, aims to produce a ranking model automatically for defining a proper sequential order of related documents according to the given query. The ranking model is employed to determine the relationship degree between one document and the user query, based on which a ranking of query-related documents could be produced. In this paper we proposed an improved RankGP algorithm using multi-layered multi-population genetic programming to obtain a ranking function, trained from collections of IR results with relevance judgments. In essence, the generated ranking function is consisted of a set of IR evidences (or features) and particular predefined GP operators. The proposed method is capable of generating complex functions through evolving small populations.

Keyword-search, a de-facto standard to search over Electronic Health Records (EHR), being simple and therefore popular technique, however, is not ideal and often returns either too many irrelevant or too few relevant search results. Clinicians, usually very short on time, just cannot afford trial and error of keyword-search and therefore do not use all information available in patient records. Next generation patient care requires more efficient access to valuable information hidden in patient histories represented by millions of patient records. There is abundance of relevant research results in the Semantic Web research community that offers more robust access interfaces to unstructured data compared to keyword-search.
