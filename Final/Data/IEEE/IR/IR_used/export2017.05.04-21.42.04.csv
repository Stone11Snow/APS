The huge volume of data and the long latency of data transfer on the Internet make it very difficult to ensure high-performance access to data grids. Thus, data replication techniques have been widely adopted to solve the latency problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient data replication algorithm for multi-source data transfer, whereby a data replica can be assembled in parallel from multiple distributed data sources and adapted to the variability of network bandwidths. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can obtain more aggregated bandwidth, reduce connection overheads, and achieve superior load balance.","","POD:0-7695-2585-7","10.1109/CCGRID.2006.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630851","","Application software;Assembly;Bandwidth;Computer science;Data analysis;Data engineering;Delay;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet","Internet;electronic data interchange;grid computing;resource allocation","Internet data transfer latency;connection overhead reduction;data grid access;data replication;data-intensive application;load balancing;multiple distributed data source;multisource data transfer;network bandwidth variability","","7","","9","","","16-19 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the non-operational data retrievable from the system has a potential to reveal useful information regarding the health of the system and infrastructural flaws in the system. The non-operational data consists of records or logs of multiple events such as series of faults, power fluctuations, disturbances and lightning strikes. The paper describes the concept of data warehousing of non-operational data for a power utility. The value of analyzing non-operational data is elaborated. The identification and sources of non-operational data is established and the methods of collecting the data are elaborated. The user groups who would benefit from the non-operational data are identified. The concept of a data warehouse and the steps involved in the implementation are discussed.

A semantic matching method is presented to estimate the similarity between the semantic segments of the query and the questions in the FAQ collection. Additionally, the vector space model (VSM) is adopted to measure the similarity between the query and the answers of the QA pairs. Finally, a multistage ranking strategy is adopted to determine the optimally performing combination of similarity metrics. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method achieves an average rank of 4.52 and a top-10 recall rate of 90.89 percent.

The technique is applicable for both categorical and numerical (discrete and continuous) attribute values. Attribute value neighbor hierarchies generated by the ePKI technique allow a cooperative query answering system to search for approximate answers by relaxing each individual query condition separately. Consequently, users can search for approximate answers even when the exact match answers do not exist in the database (i.e., searching for existing similar parts as part of the implementation of the concepts of rapid prototyping). Several experiments were conducted to assess the performance of the ePKI in constructing attribute-level neighbor hierarchies.

Caching is a widely used approach in mobile environments to improve system performance and keep track of replications. Within the scope of mobile and ubiquitous computing infrastructure, traditional caching techniques are not effective for large-size data such as images due to the limitations of bandwidth, storage, and power. The functionality of caching techniques relies on exact match, making them unsuitable for imprecise and similarity-based queries. In addition, the description of cached contents is defined based on the query context instead of data content, which fails to exploit the semantic locality of cached data and makes the traditional caching techniques inefficient in utilizing cache storage. In this paper, we present a semantic-aware caching scheme (SAIC) for image databases in ad hoc networks. The proposed scheme is designed based on several novel ideas: 1) multi-level partitioning of semantic space, 2) constraint-based representation of image semantics, 3) non-flooding query resolution, and 4) adaptive cache consistency maintenance. Our combination of theoretical analysis and simulation show the efficiency of the proposed scheme, and evaluate its performance in comparison against two ad hoc caching schemes as advanced in the literature.","1551-6245;15516245","POD:0-7695-2526-1","10.1109/MDM.2006.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630544","","Ad hoc networks;Computer network management;Content based retrieval;Content management;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;System performance","","","","2","1","11","","","10-12 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main features of this system are the multi-images query approach and the use of a dynamic knowledge base in order to improve the system performances. The multi-images query is utilized because often a single image does not fully cover the semantic query idea of the user, so, this work presents a system that allows the user to submit multi query images.

This knowledge base is composed of two sets of clusters: the first one is obtained with an automatic clustering algorithm and the second one is built dynamically by the user when using the system.

The ability to effectively retrieve non-alphanumeric data is a complex issue. The problem becomes even more difficult due to the high dimension of the variable space associated with the images. Image classification is a very active and promising research domain in the area of image management and retrieval. In this paper, we propose a new image classification and retrieval scheme that automatically selects the discriminating features. Our method consists of two phases: (i) classification of images on the basis of maximum cross correlation and (ii) retrieval of images from the database against a given query image. The proposed retrieval algorithm recursively searches similar images on the basis of their correlation against a given query image from a set of registered images in the database. The algorithm is very efficient, provided that the mean images of all of the classes are computed and available in advance. The proposed method classifies the images on the basis of maximum correlation so that the images with more similarities and, hence, exhibiting maximum correlation with each other are grouped in the same class and, are retrieved accordingly.","","POD:0-7695-2542-3","10.1109/CRV.2006.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640415","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Image classification;Image databases;Image registration;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information technology;Pattern recognition;Space technology","","","","1","","15","","","07-09 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose Rein - a policy and delegation framework that is grounded in semantic Web technologies - to help the Web preserve maximum expressiveness for local policy communities by enabling global interoperability of policy reasoning. Rein provides ontologies for describing policy and delegation networks, and provides mechanisms for reasoning over them, both of which can be used to develop domain and policy language specific access control frameworks for Web resources. The focus of this paper is the delegation mechanisms of the Rein policy framework that support both delegation of authorization and trust.

Coding of side information intended for the channel decoder is a Wyner-Ziv like problem, since the channel output depends statistically on the state, thus serving as side information in retrieving the encoded state. Therefore, coding for such a channel involves the simultaneous solution of a Wyner-Ziv problem and a related Gel'fand-Pinsker problem. A single letter characterization of the capacity of this channel is developed, that involves two rate constraints, in the form of Wyner-Ziv and Gel'fand-Pinsker formulas.

In this work, several heuristic algorithms - branch and bound, greedy, random, and first-choice have been proposed for efficient object retrieval from parallel air channels in the presence of replicated objects. Empirical evaluation of the algorithms shows that the greedy algorithm produces near-optimal-response time with minimum overhead in terms of energy consumption.

This paper introduces a method for finding distinctive features of a shape that are useful for determining shape similarity. Although global shape descriptors have been developed to facilitate retrieval, they fail when local shape properties are the distinctive features of a class. Alternatively, local shape descriptors can be generated over the surface of shapes, but then storage and search of the descriptors becomes unnecessarily expensive, as perhaps only a few descriptors are sufficient to distinguish classes. The challenge is to select local descriptors from a query shape that are most distinctive for retrieval. Our approach is to define distinction as the retrieval performance of a local shape descriptor. During a training phase, we estimate descriptor likelihood using a multi-variate Gaussian distribution of real-valued shape descriptors, evaluate the retrieval performance of each descriptor from a training set, and average these performance values at every likelihood value. For each query, we evaluate the likelihood of local shape descriptors on its surface and lookup the expected retrieval values learned from the training set to determine their predicted distinction values. We show that querying with the most distinctive shape descriptors provides favorable retrieval performance during tests with a database of common graphics objects","","POD:0-7695-2591-1","10.1109/SMI.2006.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631200","","Application software;Computer graphics;Computer science;Design automation;Gaussian distribution;Information retrieval;Phase estimation;Shape;Spatial databases;Testing","Gaussian distribution;computational geometry;image matching;image retrieval;visual databases","geometric matching;global shape descriptor;local shape descriptor;multivariate Gaussian distribution;query processing;shape database;shape distinction;shape retrieval;similarity retrieval","","20","","26","","","14-16 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data access is a known bottleneck of high performance computing (HPC). The prime sources of this bottleneck are the performance gap between the processor and memory storage and the large memory requirements of ever-hungry applications. Although advanced memory hierarchies and parallel file systems have been developed in recent years, they only provide high bandwidth for contiguous, well-formed data streams, performing poorly for accessing small, noncontiguous data. Unfortunately, many HPC applications make a large number of requests for small and noncontiguous pieces of data, as do high-level I/O libraries such as HDF-5. The problematic memory wall remains after years of study and, in fact, is becoming the most important issue of HPC. We propose a new I/O architecture for HPC. Unlike traditional I/O designs where data is stored and retrieved by request, our architecture is based on a novel ""server-push"" model in which a data access server proactively pushes data from a file server to the compute node's memory or to it's cache directly based on the architecture design. Simulation results show that with the new approach the cache hit rates increase well above 90% for various benchmark applications that are notorious for poor cache performance. Performance evaluation is the driven force of the push-based model. Mechanisms of performance modeling, evaluation, and optimization are applied to data access pattern identification, prefetching algorithm design, data replacement strategy development, and architecture optimization to enable the ""server-push"" model. Our current success illustrates the power and unique role of performance evaluation in computing","1530-2075;15302075","POD:1-4244-0054-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639621","","Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Design optimization;File servers;File systems;High performance computing;Information retrieval;Libraries;Prefetching","file servers;input-output programs;memory architecture;parallel processing;performance evaluation","HDF-5;I/O architecture;architecture optimization;data access pattern identification;data replacement strategy development;file server;high performance computing;high-level I/O library;memory storage;memory wall;parallel file system;performance evaluation;performance modeling;prefetching algorithm design;server-push model","","0","","","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be done using a look-up-table (LUT) in which modeled spectra are stored for many combinations of water and bottom parameters, which are then searched to find the modeled spectrum that best matches the measured data for each ground sample. This method is applied to 4 m resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery of the Indian River Lagoon in Florida, and the retrieved bathymetry is compared to 30 m resolution ground validation data. LUT bathymetry retrievals for regions identified as a having uniform bottom type correlated well with measured bathymetry to a depth of 5 m. These preliminary results suggest that the LUT method has the potential for accurate bathymetry determination from space.","0197-7385;01977385","Paper:0-933957-34-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2005.1640103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640103","","Hyperspectral imaging;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Light scattering;Performance evaluation;Rivers;Sea measurements;Table lookup;Water storage","bathymetry;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;underwater optics","Florida;Indian River Lagoon;airborne hyperspectral imagery;coastal bathymetry retrieval;data matching;look up table;spaceborne maritime hyperspectral imaging;sunlight scattering;water-leaving spectral radiance","","0","","8","","","17-23 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While limiting the validity of a particular result set to a given area, the VR may also be used in caching implementations to determine if cached results satisfy semantically equivalent queries. Existing LDQ caching schemes rely on the database servers to provide the VR at a cost of high computational overhead. Alternatively, a LDQ proxy cache, which approximates the VR can be employed, freeing the database servers from the high cost of calculating the VR. A LDQ proxy cache architecture is proposed to compute an estimated validity region (EVR) based on the observed querying history at the proxy server. We present an algorithm - Window_EVR - for the LDQ proxy to compute the EVR for a window query result set. The simulation results show that LDQ proxy caching using the Window_EVR algorithm significantly reduces both the window query response time and the workload at the database servers while maintaining query result set accuracy.","1551-6245;15516245","POD:0-7695-2526-1","10.1109/MDM.2006.166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630575","","Computational efficiency;Computer science;Databases;History;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Network servers;Neural networks;Query processing;Virtual reality","","","","3","","17","","","10-12 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

OSCAR is currently one of the widely used cluster installation toolkits; it boasts hundreds of thousands of downloads and active mailing lists. OSCAR has expanded its area with several sub-projects targeting other types of HPC clusters. Each of these projects share a core set of OSCAR code, including the OSCAR Database and its access API, ""ODA"" (OSCAR Database API). The ODA abstraction layer, consisting of a database schema and corresponding API, hides a commodity back-end database (e.g., MySQL [15]). Because OSCAR and its sub-projects are targeted at new, innovative environments (including non-HPC environments), there are significant issues with managing various configurations of each project. For example, as we previously showed [8], previous versions of ODA were unable to represent the complex, ever-growing set of data required to accurately describe the clusters that it manages. Further, its API was extremely complex, requiring a steep learning curve for OSCAR developers. Therefore, we have designed and implemented a new database schema to deal with these issues. This new version of ODA has not only resolved the above problems but also, as proposed in our previous paper, enabled storage and retrieval of various configuration information, and encouraged data re-use between the main OSCAR project and its derivative projects. In addition, the new version of ODA has sped up the OSCAR installation process. This document presents a simpler, highly flexible design and implementation of ODA slated to be included in OSCAR v5.0. It also suggests a blueprint for maintaining the database modules of ODA in a systematic, organized way.","1550-5243;15505243","POD:0-7695-2582-2","10.1109/HPCS.2006.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1628230","","Algorithms;Environmental management;High performance computing;Image databases;Information retrieval;Innovation management;Laboratories;Open systems;Project management;Spatial databases","","","","0","","15","","","14-17 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on both the apparent motion and the defocus blur (low-level features), we estimate extrinsic and intrinsic camera parameter changes, and then deduce 3D camera operations (i.e. mid-level features), such as panning/tracking, tilting/booming, zooming/ dollying and rolling, as well as focus changes. Finally, camera operations are recorded into an index which is then used for video retrieval. Experiments confirm that the proposed mid-level features can be accurately deduced from low-level features and that they can be used for indexing and retrieval purpose.","","POD:0-7695-2542-3","10.1109/CRV.2006.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640362","Content-based video retrieval;apparent motion;camera;defocus blur;focus changes;motion;operations","Cameras;Content based retrieval;Focusing;Indexing;Information retrieval;Motion estimation;Radiometry;Robot vision systems;Tracking;Videoconference","","Content-based video retrieval;apparent motion;camera;defocus blur;focus changes;motion;operations","","1","","32","","","07-09 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Together with an advanced pipelined multithreaded architecture they can be used to implement concurrent read concurrent write (CRCW) memory access in shared memory multiprocessor systems on chip (MP-SOC) without cache coherency problems. Unfortunately obvious step cache architectures assume full associativity, which can become expensive since the size and thus associativity of caches equal the number of threads per processor being at least the square root of the number of processors. In this paper, we describe a technique to radically reduce the associativity and even size of step caches in CRCW operation. We give a short performance evaluation of limited associativity step cache systems with different settings using simple parallel programs on a parametrical MP-SOC framework. According to the evaluation, the performance of limited associativity step cache systems comes very close to that of fully associative step cache systems, while decreasing the size of caches decreases the performance gradually","1530-2075;15302075","POD:1-4244-0054-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2006.1639546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1639546","","Associative memory;Cache memory;Clocks;Delay;Information retrieval;Length measurement;Logic;Multiplexing;Size control;Size measurement","associative processing;cache storage;concurrency control;distributed shared memory systems;multi-threading;network-on-chip;pipeline processing","CRCW operation;associativity reduction;concurrent read concurrent write;limited associativity;memory access;pipelined multithreaded architecture;shared memory multiprocessor;step cache system;systems on chip","","0","2","16","","","25-29 April 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In a highly heterogeneous and dynamic environment such as a grid, statically defined searches are usually inappropriate.

We describe a relevance feedback technique that captures the significance of different features at different spatial locations in an image. Spatial content is modeled by partitioning images into non-overlapping grid cells. Contributions of different features at different locations are modeled using weights defined for each feature in each grid cell. These weights are iteratively updated based on user's feedback in terms of positive and negative labeling of retrieval results. Given this labeling, the weight updating scheme uses the ratios of standard deviations of the distances between relevant and irrelevant images to the standard deviations of the distances between relevant images. The proposed technique is quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated using shots related to several sports from the news video collection of the TRECVID video retrieval evaluation where the weights could capture relative contributions of different features and spatial locations","","POD:1-4244-0049-X","10.1109/EURCON.2005.1629878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1629878","Relevance feedback;TRECVID;news videos;sports videos;video retrieval","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Labeling;Negative feedback;Spatial databases;Videos","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image segmentation;relevance feedback;video retrieval","TRECVID video retrieval;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image partitioning;multimodal retrieval;news video collection;news video database;news video retrieval;nonoverlapping grid cells;relevance feedback;retrieval result labeling;spatial content;spatial location;sports videos;user feedback;weight updating","","4","","13","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growing popularity of XML as a language for the representation of data has enabled its use for several applications involving storage, interchange, and retrieval of data. Several textual query languages have been proposed for XML retrieval, including the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) recommendation of XQuery. Native XML database systems have been implemented, all of which provide methods for user communication with the database, although most communication methods use text-based query languages or form-based interfaces. QBT, the language presented here, is one of the first attempts toward a generalized alternative language that is based on human factors of familiarity. It is ideal for documents with a simple yet highly recognizable layout (e.g., poems, dictionaries, journals, etc.). We present the QBT language and report results from an initial usability test that shows promise for this type of an interface as a generalized user-database communication method.","0361-1434;03611434","","10.1109/TPC.2006.875073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1637795","Complex structured data;Extensible Markup Language (XML);XQuery;information shape;query evaluation;query languages;query processing;visual languages","Database languages;Database systems;Dictionaries;Human factors;Information retrieval;Internet;Memory;Shape;Web sites;XML","Internet;XML;data structures;database management systems;human computer interaction;human factors;query languages;query processing;user interfaces","Extensible Markup Language;Internet applications;QBT;Query by Templates;World Wide Web Consortium;XML database systems;XQuery;data representation;form-based interfaces;human factors;next-generation databases;textual query languages;user-centered database query language","","4","1","48","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But the performance of the network in terms of download speed and request hit ratio is not that good. We propose two modifications to Freenet in order to improve the download speed and request hit ratio for all participants. To improve download speed we propose preferential partition routing, where nodes are grouped according to bandwidth and slow nodes are discriminated when routing. For improvements in request hit ratio we propose file mesh propagation where each node sends fuzzy information about what documents it posesses to its neighbours. To verify our proposals we simulate the Freenet network and the bandwidth restrictions present between nodes as well as using observed distributions for user actions to show how it affects the network. Our results show an improvement of the request hit ratio by over 30 times and an increase of the average download speed with six times, compared to regular Freenet routing","","POD:0-7695-2585-7","10.1109/CCGRID.2006.1630904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1630904","","Availability;Bandwidth;Costs;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Routing;Speech","peer-to-peer computing;performance evaluation;telecommunication network routing","Fast Freenet;Freenet network;Freenet peer-to-peer network;Freenet performance;bandwidth restrictions;download speed;file mesh propagation;fuzzy information;preferential partition routing;request hit ratio;user actions","","1","","12","","","16-19 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Limited sensing capabilities, power, and mobility of individual robotic platforms can be overcome by forming teams of heterogeneous robots. This work addresses the power limitations associated with individual robots, which have finite amounts of power, and thus limited operational lifetimes. This work presents a method by which mobile docking stations can optimize their locations in order to maximize the power available to the deployed robots. Simulated results are presented in which teams of docking stations continuously recover and recharge a much larger team of deployed robots. It is assumed that the deployed robots are able to maintain a communication link between themselves and the docking station. This communication link is used to provide position information and available power to the docking stations.

These characteristics necessitate the use of a good multidimensional indexing strategy to provide efficient access to the data. Researchers have previously proposed the use of bitmap indexes for high-dimension scientific data as a way of overcoming the drawbacks of traditional multidimensional indexes such as R-trees and KD-trees, which are bulky and whose performance does not scale well as the number of dimensions increases. However, the techniques proposed in previous work on bitmap indexes are not sufficient to address all problems that arise in practice. In experiments with real datasets, we experienced problems with index size and query performance. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose the use of adaptive, multilevel, multi-resolution bitmap indexes, and evaluate their performance in two scientific domains.

Domain-specific knowledge helps recognizing the meaning the text representing various entities and values and detecting their formats. However, such domain knowledge becomes powerless when value-representing data are not labeled with appropriate textual descriptions or there is nothing but a hyper link when certain text labels or values are expected. In order to alleviate these problems, we propose a probabilistic method for recognizing the entity type, i.e. generating wrapper rules, when there is no label associated with value-representing text. In addition, we have devised a method for using the information reachable by following hyperlinks when textual data are not immediately available on the target Web page. Our experimental work shows that the proposed methods help increasing precision of the resulting wrapper, particularly extracting the title information, the most important entity on a Web page.

Since music sequences may be subjectively classified in different ways, the retrieval process is upgraded by user's feedback and neural network decision. After the first pass, from the initial set of sequences ordered related to objectively measured distances from the query, the user select and mark those subjectively declared as more similar to a query. Selected sequences update the weights of radial basis function (RBF) neural network: moving the RBF center towards selected sequences and changing the width of RBF for obtaining fine-tuning. New ranking of audio sequences is then performing from RBF output. The user can repeat the process in iterative way until obtaining satisfactory results.

The basic tenet of this architecture is the use of ontologies to represent objects in order to enable semantic resource discovery and retrieval which reflect the interest of the user within a specific community. Three advertising and retrieval schemes, namely aggressive, crawler-based and minimum-cover-rule, are discussed and investigated using an emulation-based experimental framework.

In a typical data center, there are thousands of different events reporting system faults, status, and performance information. Their occurrences are unpredictable. In addition, new events and conditions can occur as operating environment changes. Traditional approaches of authoring policies and techniques of implementing policy-based management systems, such as relying entirely on static authoring of simple ""if [condition] then [actions]"" rules, become insufficient. Hence, new approaches, such as goal policy, utility function etc., to the design and implementation of policy-based management systems have emerged. However, none of these approaches provides a systematic way to enable policies in a policy-based management system to be responsive to new and ambiguous situations. In this paper, we describe a novel method by which policies can be selected or created automatically based on events observed and knowledge learned. This new approach treats the observed event-policy relationship represented by an event-policy matrix as a statistical problem. Using singular value decomposition (SVD) technique, implicit higher order correlations among policies and their associated events are used to estimate the selection or creation of recommended policies based on events found in the observed event set. Initial results have indicated that this approach to policy-based management system is very promising","","POD:0-7695-2598-9","10.1109/POLICY.2006.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631161","","Data mining;Environmental management;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Ink;Learning;Matrix decomposition;Resource management;Singular value decomposition;Spectral analysis","database management systems;singular value decomposition;statistical analysis","automatic policy creation;automatic policy selection;autonomic computing;event-policy matrix;event-policy relationship;implicit higher order correlations;policy-based management system;singular value decomposition","","4","3","11","","","5-7 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For both user and vendor organisations, this raises immediate problems of trust, security, privacy and prevention of malicious attacks. Until these problems are addressed and solved properly, the use of Web services will be severely restricted because no-one will trust them. We describe in this paper a service-oriented architecture and an attack-tolerant information retrieval (ATIR) service which tackles certain classes of privacy problems. In particular, we address the problem of protecting a user against malicious attacks upon an information service when the user retrieves some information from the service. Although there have been many theoretical solutions to certain aspects of this problem, the results have yet to be adapted to real systems. We report our experience of integrating the ATIR service with Taverna, a popular workflow system used amongst the UK e-science/grid computing community, to support secure information retrieval in the biology context. Performance studies show that the overhead of ATIR server-side processing is trivial (<5%) in comparison with the total processing time of the integrated Taverna.

PROuST consists of several components that perform different tasks at different stages. Given a target protein, an index-based search retrieves from a database a list of proteins that are good candidates for similarity, then a dynamic programming algorithm aligns the target protein with each candidate protein. The same geometric properties of secondary structure elements of proteins are used by different components of PROuST. Thus, an important issue of the distributed implementation is data transfer vs. data recomputation tradeoffs. Our implementation avoids recomputation by re-using the hash table data as much as possible, once they are accessed. The algorithmic changes to the application allow to reduce the number of data accesses to storage elements and consequently the execution time.

One of the benefits of mobile agents is that they reduce the communication costs between the hosts where the information is available and the central processor where the processing of information is done. That is, instead of sending messages with all the data in a local host, mobile agents are able to work in local processors and to send only the data that they consider relevant.

The enormity and diversity of the visual contents on the Web images adds another dimension to this challenging task. Moreover, the retrieval of Web images cannot be easily achieved with images of other than trivial collections, and therefore one needs to put more cognitive load on the users. Based on the groupings, effective indices can however be built for an image database. In this paper, we show how a specific high-level classification problem can be solved from relatively basic low-level visual features geared for the particular classes. We have developed a procedure to qualitatively measure the saliency of a feature towards a classification problem based on the discrimination power of the HSV color histograms, which capture the visual characteristics of each of the images were computed. We found that the HSV color histogram, mainly the hue component, has the most discriminative power for the classification problem of our interest. A k-means classifier is used for the classification, which results in an accuracy of 90.5% when evaluated on an image database of 2,738 Web images. The images are classified as full faces, natural sceneries, events and city images.

The study aimed at relating field measurements of leaf area index (LAI) to spaceborne Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor-III (LISS-III) data, preparation of site-level LAI maps, and validation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1-km LAI global fields. Measurements of field-level LAI, aerosol optical thickness and water vapor were carried out on the day of LISS-III overpasses. Empirical models based on the site-specific LAI-vegetation index relation were developed and used to generate 23-m resolution LAI maps for two sites (Indore and Bhopal) covering 30 kmtimes30 km. These LAI images were degraded to 1-km spatial resolution and used for validation of the version 3 and 4 MODIS LAI products (MOD15A2). The results indicate a positive correlation (r=0.78) between LAI derived from LISS-III data and MODIS data. However an overestimate by a factor of 1.6 to 2.5 in the version 3 MODIS product is observed with root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.20 to 1.26. The factor of overestimation reduces significantly by 50% and RMSE by 40% when version 4 MODIS LAI was analyzed. The improvement in accuracy was observed to be associated with the change in algorithm path adopted for retrieving version 3 and 4 MODIS LAI.

"Texture characterization for joint compression and classification based on human perception in the wavelet domain","G. Fahmy; J. Black; S. Panchanathan","Lane Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Electr. Eng., West Virginia Univ., Morgantown, WV, USA","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","20060515","2006","15","6","1389","1396","Today's multimedia applications demand sophisticated compression and classification techniques in order to store, transmit, and retrieve audio-visual information efficiently. Over the last decade, perceptually based image compression methods have been gaining importance. These methods take into account the abilities (and the limitations) of human visual perception (HVP) when performing compression. The upcoming MPEG 7 standard also addresses the need for succinct classification and indexing of visual content for efficient retrieval. However, there has been no research that has attempted to exploit the characteristics of the human visual system to perform both compression and classification jointly. One area of HVP that has unexplored potential for joint compression and classification is spatial frequency perception. Spatial frequency content that is perceived by humans can be characterized in terms of three parameters, which are: 1) magnitude; 2) phase; and 3) orientation. While the magnitude of spatial frequency content has been exploited in several existing image compression techniques, the novel contribution of this paper is its focus on the use of phase coherence for joint compression and classification in the wavelet domain. Specifically, this paper describes a human visual system-based method for measuring the degree to which an image contains coherent (perceptible) phase information, and then exploits that information to provide joint compression and classification. Simulation results that demonstrate the efficiency of this method are presented.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2006.871160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632194","Human vision;joint compression and classification;perceptual image compression","Content based retrieval;Frequency;Humans;Image coding;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Visual perception;Visual system;Wavelet domain","data compression;image classification;image coding;image texture;visual perception;wavelet transforms","classification techniques;compression techniques;human perception;human visual system;image compression method;spatial frequency perception;texture characterization;wavelet domain","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Biomimetics;Cluster Analysis;Data Compression;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Visual Perception","6","","25","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These interactions, as in real life, require the mutual trust of the peers participating in a negotiation process. Trust quantification is a complex process that involves many parameters. Applying trust mechanisms in a P2P network is essential for guarantee the trustworthiness of participating peers and eventually the success of the negotiation. In this paper, we propose an agent-based community-centric P2P organization of service providers, clients and intermediaries that effectively and securely collaborate with each other, by considering common context in their negotiations, to discover trustworthy request-relevant services.

"Spherical Wavelet Descriptors for Content-based 3D Model Retrieval","H. Laga; H. Takahashi; M. Nakajima","Tokyo Institute of Technology, Japan","IEEE International Conference on Shape Modeling and Applications 2006 (SMI'06)","20060626","2006","","","15","15","The description of 3D shapes with features that possess descriptive power and invariant under similarity transformations is one of the most challenging issues in content based 3D model retrieval. Spherical harmonics-based descriptors have been proposed for obtaining rotation invariant representations. However, spherical harmonic analysis is based on latitude-longitude parameterization of a sphere which has singularities at each pole. Consequently, features near the two poles are over represented while features at the equator are under-sampled, and variations of the north pole affects significantly the shape function. In this paper we discuss these issues and propose the usage of spherical wavelet transform as a tool for the analysis of 3D shapes represented by functions on the unit sphere. We introduce three new descriptors extracted from the wavelet coefficients, namely: (1) a subset of the spherical wavelet coefficients, (2) the L<sub>1</sub> and, (3) the L<sub>2</sub> energies of the spherical wavelet sub-bands. The advantage of this tool is three fold; first, it takes into account feature localization and local orientations. Second, the energies of the wavelet transform are rotation invariant. Third, shape features are uniformly represented which makes the descriptors more efficient. Spherical wavelet descriptors are natural extension of 3D Zernike moments and spherical harmonics. We evaluate, on the Princeton shape benchmark, the proposed descriptors regarding computational aspects and shape retrieval performance","","POD:0-7695-2591-1","10.1109/SMI.2006.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1631197","3D model retrieval;rotation invariant representation.;shape matching;spherical;wavelets","Biomedical imaging;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Harmonic analysis;Information retrieval;Shape;Solid modeling;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet coefficients;Wavelet transforms","computational geometry;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image representation;image retrieval;image sampling;wavelet transforms","3D Zernike moment;3D shape representation;Princeton shape benchmark;content-based 3D model retrieval;feature extraction;feature localization;latitude-longitude parameterization;shape retrieval;spherical harmonic analysis;spherical wavelet descriptor;wavelet transform","","24","1","25","","","14-16 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
