We combine techniques of visual image retrieval and information visualization to acquire insight into the extracted feature data.

Therefore, the demands on the user-friendly querying interface such as query by sketch and query by editing are increasing. In this paper, we propose a new shape retrieval system using the attributed relational graph (ARG) composed of nodes with unary attributes and edges with binary relations for interactive searching and comparing 3-D objects. As similar to other systems, the ARG-based retrieval system consists of two components: the ARG generation via feature extraction and its similarity matching. For the ARG generation, we adopt a morphological shape decomposition scheme as a part-based representation. More specifically, the part-based representation can be generated from the decomposition result and encoded into the ARG. In the case of similarity matching, we consider various ARG matching algorithms such as earth mover's distance, spectral analysis, relaxation and modified nested earth mover's distance. Finally, we have conducted the experiments for the ARG with various matching algorithms and the Shape3D, i.e.an international standard for description and browsing of 3-D object database in MPEG-7, using the database of 480 3-D objects with 33 categories in terms of the bull's eye performance, the average normalized modified retrieval rate, and the precision/recall curve.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384944","","Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Databases;Earth;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Shape;Spectral analysis;Topology","","","","0","1","","","","27-02 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By extending the local orientation histogram feature, we make it applicable to the human hand, an object of very little texture. The key steps are augmenting the local orientation histogram feature vector with its relative image coordinates, and clustering the augmented vector to find a compact yet descriptive representation of the hand shape. The recognition result is given by collective voting of all the local orientation histogram features extracted from the hand region of the testing image. The matching score is evaluated by retrieval in the image feature database of the training hand gestures. Locality sensitive hashing is used to reduce the computational cost for retrieval. The experimental results on labelled real-world images demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency of our algorithm.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384959","","Feature extraction;Histograms;Humans;Image databases;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape;Testing;Voting","","","","7","","","","","27-02 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we explore the possibility of using an associative memory for the purpose of enhancing the interactive capability of perceptual vision systems. By following the biological memory principles, we show how vision systems can be designed to recognize faces, facial gestures and orientations, using low-end video-cameras and little computational power.

Since the availability of digital media seems ever rising, not only the retrieval performance in terms of what the user is presented with as a result but also the retrieval speed proves to be crucial. Images are arguably the most prominent type of media that is to be searched and retrieved, and similar to other media such as videos or sound, images are usually stored in compressed form in order to save storage and bandwidth resources. One way of addressing the speed problem is to perform image retrieval directly in the compressed domain thus saving the time it takes to decode the pictures. In this paper we introduce such a compressed domain image retrieval technique based on the Colour Visual Pattern Image Coding (CVPIC) compression method. A combined colour co-occurrence/shape matrix is built and used in retrieval experiments. These experiments show that our approach is not only desirable from an efficiency point of view but that it also clearly outperforms popular image retrieval techniques such as colour histograms, colour coherence vectors and colour correlograms.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384941","","Bandwidth;Content based retrieval;Decoding;Histograms;Image coding;Image edge detection;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Shape","","","","3","","","","","27-02 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These values are relatively small compared to high-dimensional data, e.g., >32D. The consequence is that existing techniques (on low-dimensional data) that minimize cache misses are no longer effective. We present a novel index structure, called Δ-tree, to speed up the high-dimensional query in main memory environment. The Δ-tree is a multilevel structure where each level represents the data space at different dimensionalities: the number of dimensions increases toward the leaf level. The remaining dimensions are obtained using principal component analysis. Each level of the tree serves to prune the search space more efficiently as the lower dimensions can reduce the distance computation and better exploit the small cache line size. Additionally, the top-down clustering scheme can capture the feature of the data set and, hence, reduces the search space. We also propose an extension, called Δ<sup>+</sup>-tree, that globally clusters the data space and then partitions clusters into small regions. The Δ<sup>+</sup>-tree can further reduce the computational cost and cache misses. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed structures against existing techniques on different kinds of data sets. Our results show that the Δ<sup>+</sup>-tree is superior in most cases.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1388245","","Computational efficiency;Computer Society;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Principal component analysis;Query processing;Random access memory;Spatial databases","cache storage;database indexing;principal component analysis;query processing;tree data structures;tree searching;very large databases","Δ-tree index structure;high-dimensional data indexing;in-memory similarity search;main memory systems;principal component analysis;top-down clustering scheme","","6","","23","","","March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In our system, the semantic hierarchy of word senses from WordNet is used to strengthen the association between images and the textual description of a concept. A statistical keyword selection algorithm is followed to choose the most representative keywords to annotate those images of the concept.

We propose a method for improving the accuracy of this type of system. First, the system learns a set of chance probability functions (CPFs). The CPFs estimate the probabilities of obtaining a query shape with particular distances from each training example by chance. The learned CPFs are used at runtime to rapidly estimate the chance probabilities of the observed distances between the actual query shape and the database shapes. These estimated probabilities are then used as a dissimilarity measure for shape retrieval and/or nearest-neighbor classification. The CPF learning method is parameter-free. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that: (1) chance probabilities yield higher accuracy than Euclidean distances; (2) the learned CPFs support fast matching; and (3) the CPF-based system outperforms prior systems on a standard benchmark test of retrieval accuracy.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384887","","Benchmark testing;Computer science;Databases;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Learning systems;MPEG 7 Standard;Runtime;Shape measurement;System testing","","","","8","","","","","27-02 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unique characteristics of WARP are the exploitation of the phase of Fourier coefficients and the use of the dynamic time warping (DTW) distance to compare shape descriptors. While phase information provides a more accurate description of object boundaries than using only the amplitude of Fourier coefficients, the DTW distance permits us to accurately match images even in the presence of (limited) phase shillings. In terms of classical precision/recall measures, we experimentally demonstrate that WARP can gain, say, up to 35 percent in precision at a 20 percent recall level with respect to Fourier-based techniques that use neither phase nor DTW distance.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2005.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1359759","Dynamic Time Warping distance;Index Terms- Shape matching;discrete Fourier transform.","Content based retrieval;Discrete Fourier transforms;Gain measurement;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Phase measurement;Shape","discrete Fourier transforms;image matching;image retrieval;information retrieval;visual databases;vocabulary","Fourier based techniques;Fourier phase coefficient;Fourier shape descriptors;dynamic time warping distance;image contents;image databases;image matching;object boundary description;phase shillings;shape information retrieval","Algorithms;Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Simulation;Fishes;Fourier Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","87","1","26","","","Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An attractor pattern continuously depends upon an initial pattern; it also reflects the embedded pattern.

Arguing that casual searchers are likely to be unwilling to engage in the dialogue required for interactive QE, we provide an automatic QE system based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Having received mixed results, our analysis suggests that automatic QE based on a collection dependent knowledge structure may work for explorative, i.e. broader, queries whilst targeted and more focused queries suffer from query drift.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385442","","Humans;Indexing;Informatics;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Natural languages;Personnel;Search engines;Web search;Web sites","","","","3","","28","","","03-06 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Perceived security weaknesses within these operating systems typically involve computer system intrusion or data storage security. This paper calls attention to conflicting normative values regarding the concept of secure data storage. A perceived security risk is associated with the file management system's policy of allowing deleted data to remain intact. Some argue that lingering traces associated with deleted files should not exist. An alternative view perceives usefulness from the ability to retrieve accidentally deleted data. This view is also held from within the forensic computer science field. This presents a dilemma for software designers seeking to provide operating systems that meet the security desires of society. This paper discusses arguments of these conflicting views, and it encourages more research to provide a foundation on which to base suggestions to resolve this quandary.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385881","","Communication system security;Computer security;Data security;Forensics;Information retrieval;Memory;Operating systems;Personal communication networks;Programming;Risk management","","","","0","","30","","","03-06 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic idea is to avoid exchanging security information between networks visited by a roaming user and the user's home authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) server that is typically located in the home network possibly far away from the visited network. Instead, authentication and authorization of a roaming user shall be supported by an AAA server in the visited network. We propose that the AAA server that is responsible for authentication and authorization in a newly visited network locates the AAA server in the previously visited network and retrieves the required security information from that AAA server. The AAA servers can be organized in a peer-to-peer manner and peer-to-peer mechanisms can be applied for searching and transferring security information between them. We propose several mechanisms for quickly locating the previously responsible AAA server in order to decrease authentication delays. The performance of these mechanisms is evaluated by simulations.

An efficient image annotation and retrieval system is highly desired. Clustering algorithms make it possible to represent visual features of images with finite symbols. Based on this, many statistical models, which analyze correspondence between visual features and words and discover hidden semantics, have been published. These models improve the annotation and retrieval of large image databases. However, image data usually have a large number of dimensions. Traditional clustering algorithms assign equal weights to these dimensions, and become confounded in the process of dealing with these dimensions. In this paper, we propose weighted feature selection algorithm as a solution to this problem. For a given cluster, we determine relevant features based on histogram analysis and assign greater weight to relevant features as compared to less relevant features. We have implemented four different models to link visual tokens with keywords based on the clustering results of K-means algorithm with weighted feature selection and without feature selection, and evaluated performance using precision, recall and correspondence accuracy using benchmark dataset. The results show that weighted feature selection is better than traditional ones for automatic image annotation and retrieval.","","POD:0-7695-2217-3","10.1109/MMSE.2004.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376692","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Digital cameras;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet telephony;Shape","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;pattern clustering;very large databases;visual databases","clustering algorithm;image annotation;image databases;image retrieval;weighted feature selection algorithm","","0","3","24","","","13-15 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces the concept of multicluster interleaving (MCI), a generalization of traditional interleaving problems. MCI problems for paths and cycles are studied. The following problem is solved: how to interleave integers on a path or cycle such that any m (m≥2) nonoverlapping clusters of order 2 in the path or cycle have at least three distinct integers. We then present a scheme using a ""hierarchical-chain structure"" to solve the following more general problem for paths: how to interleave integers on a path such that any m (m≥2) nonoverlapping clusters of order L (L≥2) in the path have at least L+1 distinct integers. It is shown that the scheme solves the second interleaving problem for paths that are asymptotically as long as the longest path on which an MCI exists, and clearly, for shorter paths as well.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2004.840893","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386529","","Broadcasting;Error correction codes;Information retrieval;Interleaved codes;Labeling;Lakes;Materials science and technology;Shape","information retrieval;interleaved codes","MCI;burst errors;cycles;distributed data retrieval;hierarchical-chain structure;interleaving codewords;multicluster interleaving;paths","","9","","17","","","Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper describes a framework for recognizing human actions and interactions in video by using three levels of abstraction. At low level, the poses of individual body parts including head, torso, arms and legs are recognized using individual Bayesian networks (BNs), which are then integrated to obtain an overall body pose. At mid level, the actions of a single person are modeled using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) with temporal links between identical states of the Bayesian network at time t and t+1. At high level, the results of mid-level descriptions for each person are juxtaposed along a common time line to identify an interaction between two persons. The linguistic 'verb argument structure' is used to represent human action in terms of <agent-motion-target> triplets. Spatial and temporal constraints are used for a decision tree to recognize specific interactions. A meaningful semantic description in terms of subject-verb-object is obtained. Our method provides a user-friendly natural-language description of several human interactions, and correctly describes positive, neutral, and negative interactions occurring between two persons. Example sequences of real persons are presented to illustrate the paradigm.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384801","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer interfaces;Data engineering;Humans;Information retrieval;Layout;Natural languages;Pattern recognition;Surveillance","","","","12","","","","","27-02 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A large number of peers may work under a collaborative and self-organizing scheme to answer their common queries or sub-queries. Given the workload and storage of each peer, some certain peers establish and maintain the views via a cost-based and negotiating way. When processing queries, the peers can first retrieve data from views locally or on nearby peers, instead of from the remote sources.

Instrumenting people in their workplace is often untenable, yet oversimple laboratory studies often miss explanatory richness.

In this paper, we present a two-phase approach where an inexpensive feature-based method is used to jind a set of potential matches and a more expensive and accurate case matching method is used to make the jinal selection. This approach has been successfully employed in TEXTALTM, a system that retrieves previously solved 3D patterns of electron density from a database to determine the structure of proteins. Electron density patterns are characterized by numeric features and an appropriate distance measure is used to efficiently jilter good matches through an exhaustive search of the database. These matches are then examined using a computationally expensive density correlation procedure based on jinding an optimal superposition between 3D patterns. We provide an empirical and theoretical analysis of some of the keys issues related to this method. In particular, we dejine a model for estimating how approximate various featurebased similarity measures are (relative to an objective matching metric), and determine its relation to the number of cases that should be jiltered from a given database to make the approach effective.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383539","","Computer science;Crystallography;Databases;Electrons;Information retrieval;Matched filters;Particle measurements;Pattern matching;Predictive models;Proteins","","","","1","","20","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The texture analysis has a long history and how to extract texture feature efficiently and accurately is still an active subject of study in the field of image retrieval. June proposed a method that used two features, and one of them is the gray-level histogram based on each low frequency. The gray-level histogram does not take the spatial relationship of gray in an image into account. In this paper, we establish a new way that describes texture in terms of their orientations and original image gray distributions using geostat, which represents the global spatial relationship of color. The performance has raised about 4% than that of June's method.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1384554","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384554","","Anisotropic magnetoresistance;Discrete wavelet transforms;Histograms;Image retrieval;Image texture analysis;Information retrieval;Signal resolution;Spatial resolution;Stochastic processes;Wavelet transforms","feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;image texture;wavelet transforms","color spatial relationship;content based image retrieval;feature extraction;geostat;gray level histogram;image gray distributions;image texture analysis;medical imaging;remote sensing;similarity matching;visual characteristics","","1","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that many important text classifiers, either probabilistic or non-probabilistic, can be unified under this framework, and the proposed MCE classifier training approach can be applied to improve the classifier performance. In addition, we describe an effective MCE classifier training algorithm that uses AdaBoost to generate alternative initial classifiers, as opposed to combining multiple classifiers as it is typically used. This method is applied to MCE classifier training to overcome local minimums in optimal classifier parameter search, utilizing the fact that the family of generalized linear classifiers is closed under AdaBoost. Moreover, we extend the loss function in MCE training to incorporate training sample prior distributions to compensate the imbalanced training data distribution in each category. Experimental studies are performed on the text classification tasks, and the significant classification error reductions of 25% - 55% are observed.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383490","","Boosting;Databases;Filtering;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Man machine systems;Natural languages;Routing;Text categorization;Training data","","","","2","","24","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the well-known text-based search engines are not adequate for that task, content modeling is assisting by providing information not about the actual bits that constitute a media file, but about their meaning, in other words the bits about the bits. The COSMOS model successfully integrates low level and high-level semantics into a single framework, and is therefore a complete and operational scheme for describing content related information. The MPEG-7 scheme standardizes content modeling and since its introduction in 1999 has now reached a mature state. As applications to create MPEG-7 content are scarce, the COSMOS model can now not only be used to create multimedia content but also act as an application for creating MPEG-7 compliant output.","1550-5502;15505502","POD:0-7695-2164-9","10.1109/MMMC.2005.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385983","","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Management information systems;Multimedia computing;Multimedia systems;Search engines;Streaming media;XML","","Content modeling and querying;Cosmos-7;MPEG-7","","1","","29","","","12-14 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we deal with the characterization of an audio signal, which may be part of a larger audiovisual system or may be autonomous, as for example in the case of an audio recording stored digitally on disk. Our goal was to first develop a system for segmentation of the audio signal, and then classification into one of two main categories: speech or music. Among the system's requirements are its processing speed and its ability to function in a real-time environment with a small responding delay. Because of the restriction to two classes, the characteristics that are extracted are considerably reduced and moreover the required computations are straightforward. Experimental results show that efficiency is exceptionally good, without sacrificing performance. Segmentation is based on mean signal amplitude distribution, whereas classification utilizes an additional characteristic related to the frequency. The classification algorithm may be used either in conjunction with the segmentation algorithm, in which case it verifies or refutes a music-speech or speech-music change, or autonomously, with given audio segments. The basic characteristics are computed in 20 ms intervals, resulting in the segments' limits being specified within an accuracy of 20 ms. The smallest segment length is one second. The segmentation and classification algorithms were benchmarked on a large data set, with correct segmentation about 97% of the time and correct classification about 95%.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.840604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1386250","","Audio databases;Audio recording;Audio-visual systems;Classification algorithms;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Real time systems;Speech","audio databases;audio recording;audio signal processing;audio-visual systems;feature extraction;information retrieval;music;signal classification;speech processing;statistical analysis","audio recording;audio signal segmentation;audiovisual media;classification algorithm;information extraction;mean signal amplitude distribution;music classification;speech classification;speech/music discriminator;zero-crossing rate","","81","1","14","","","Feb. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Neither of these approaches is satisfactory for what is claimed to be the usual end-user task: the exploration of an information base in order to find interesting items. This paper shows how dynamic taxonomies, a model proposed for the intelligent exploration of heterogeneous information bases, can be extended in order to provide guided browsing and retrieval for multimedia information bases and seamlessly integrate access through metadata with methods based on primitive multimedia features.
