We introduce a system that would extract a summary from multiple documents based on the document cluster centroids, which is effectively the distribution of terms in the multiple documents in the cluster. This summarization technique is a cluster- based, extractive summarization method, where passages are first clustered based on similarity, prior to the selection of passages that form the extractive summary of the documents. The sentences are then issued a timestamp based on the order of their occurrence in the original document, thereby ensuring the chronological order of sentences. Passage clustering forms a main component in this system that aims to extract the most relevant sentences of the documents at the same time keeping the summary non-redundant. The implementation is based on the MEAD extraction algorithm and redundancy based algorithm. MEAD extraction algorithm uses three features to compute the salience of the sentence. They are centroid value, positional value and first-sentence overlap. Redundancy algorithm checks for overlapping words in sentences and issues a redundancy penalty. Timestamps are issued to sentences to maintain the chronological order of the sentences and hence a coherent and free- flowing summary can be generated.","2157-0477;21570477","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3267-7","10.1109/ICETET.2008.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579948","Centroid and Timestamp;MEAD;Multi-document summariztion","Clustering algorithms;Communications technology;Computer science;Data mining;Educational institutions;Information processing;Information retrieval;Internet;Natural languages;Search engines","pattern clustering;text analysis","Automatic text summarization;MEAD extraction algorithm;chronological sentence order;document cluster centroid;extractive summarization method;first-sentence overlap;multiple-document summarization system;passage clustering;redundancy algorithm;time stamp;user interaction","","0","","9","","","16-18 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a general method for mapping XML documents to RDB. The method does not need a DTD or XML schema. And it can be applied as a general solution for any tree data structure and not just for XML data. Also, it can be used for data-centric and document-centric documents. Experiments on this method shows it's ability to maintain document structure at a low cost price and easily, building of the original document is straight forward, performing first level semantic search is achievable either on a single document or on all documents.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2358-3; POD:978-1-4244-2357-6","10.1109/CIT.2008.4594668","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4594668","","Buildings;Costs;Forward contracts;Information retrieval;Internet;Labeling;Object oriented databases;Relational databases;Tree data structures;XML","XML;information retrieval;object-oriented databases;relational databases","DTD schema;Internet;OODB;RDB;XML document mapping;XML documents retrieval;data centric documents;document centric documents;extensible markup language;native XML database;object oriented database;relational database;tree data structure","","0","","8","","","8-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system accepts queries in the form of simple English like statements, eliminating the need to use any query language. In timeline based paradigm the layout is represented using temporal synchronization points and can be effectively used for non-iterative presentations. In this system graph based paradigm uses dynamic Petri nets, which are best suitable for iterative and interactive presentations.

The method hinges in the use of quasi-random sampling to retrieve those images in a database which are related to a query image provided by the user. Departing from random sampling theory, we make use of the EM algorithm so as to organize the images in the database into compact clusters that can then be used for stratified random sampling. For the purposes of retrieval, we use the similarity between the query and the clustered images to govern the sampling process within clusters. In this way, the sampling can be viewed as a stratified sampling one which is random at the cluster level and takes into account the intra-cluster structure of the dataset. This approach leads to a measure of statistical confidence that relates to the theoretical hard-limit of the retrieval performance. We show results on the Oxford Flowers dataset.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587387","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587387","","Australia;Clustering algorithms;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image sampling;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Tree graphs","expectation-maximisation algorithm;image retrieval;image sampling;pattern clustering;visual databases","EM algorithm;Oxford Flowers dataset;image query;image retrieval;images database;intra-cluster structure;quasi-random sampling approach;statistical confidence","","1","","30","","","23-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Upper layer is a server layer which is composed of original CDN servers including origin servers and replica servers. Lower layer consists of groups of clients who request the streaming services, each client is considered as a client peer in the group. Each group of client peers is led by the nearby replica server. Client peers contribute their resource through the coordination of the leader peer. The scheme uses a revised Kademlia-like protocol for peer-to-peer topology management and DHT for data retrieval. It constructs a topology-aware overlay network and results reduced jitter. PeerCDN makes best use of original investment and infrastructure. The service capacity is larger than traditional CDN system with the participation of the client peers. Also, the topology-aware overlay network restricts the unnecessary backbone bandwidth consuming during client peer sharing.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme taking advantage of two different similarity measurements to improve not only the retrieval accuracy but also the retrieving speed. First, Earth Moverpsilas Distance (EMD), which is note-based and much faster, is adopted to eliminate most unlikely candidate. Then, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), which is frame-based and more accurate, is executed on these surviving candidates.

Data management techniques for traditional text-based data are inadequate to handle multimedia data efficiently due to their atypical characteristics. Thus, to have a robust data management framework for complex multimedia data like videos, comparable in efficiency and capability to the traditional data management approaches, components like multimedia data storage, index, and query engines need to be developed with dedicated abilities to handle the characteristics of multimedia data like multidimensional representation and semantic gap. In this paper, we investigate the design of the second component, i.e., a multimedia index, and propose a novel tree-based multidimensional hierarchical index structure called Hierarchical Affinity Hybrid-Tree (HAH-Tree) which addresses the critical issues of multidimensionality and semantic gap. The index structure accommodates different levels of video relationships during Content-Based Video Retrieval (CBVR) by utilizing a probabilistic approach called the Hierarchical Markov Model Mediator (HMMM), which is also responsible for managing the high-level semantic content of the video components. In addition, a computationally efficient k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm is proposed, which supports CBVR for different video units with a high precision level.","","POD:978-1-4244-2659-1","10.1109/IRI.2008.4583070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4583070","","Content based retrieval;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Robustness;Search engines;Videos","","","","1","","17","","","13-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since it remains unchanged when the camera or the object of interest moves, this provides powerful additional constraints that can be incorporated into standard pose estimation algorithms. The key idea and main contribution of the paper is therefore to show that the registration should also be performed in the lighting environment space, instead of in the image space only. This lets us recover very accurate pose estimates because the specularities are very sensitive to pose changes. An interesting side result is an accurate estimate of the lighting environment. Furthermore, since the mapping from lighting environment to specularities has no analytical expression for objects represented as 3D meshes, and is not 1-to-1, registering lighting environments is far from trivial. However we propose a general and effective solution.

Financial time series data normally fluctuate unexpectedly which courses very high dimensions. The peak and the dip points of the series may appear frequently over time. These points are known as the most important points which reflect some related events to the market. However, to manipulate financial time series, researchers usually decrease this complexity of time series in their techniques. Consequently, transforming the time series into another easily understanding representation is usually considered as an appropriate approach. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution important point retrieval method for financial time series representation. The idea of the method is based on finding the most important points in multiresolution. These retrieved important points are recorded in each resolution. The collected important points are used to construct the TS-binary search tree. From the TS-binary search tree, the application of time series segmentation is conducted. The experimental results show that the TS-binary search tree representation for financial time series exhibits different performance in different number of cutting points, however, in the empirical results, the number of cutting points which are larger than 12 points show the better results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1692-9; POD:978-1-4244-1691-2","10.1109/ICCCE.2008.4580656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4580656","","Biochemical analysis;Computer science;Data engineering;Data mining;Economic forecasting;Finance;Information retrieval;Information systems;Time series analysis;Turning","data mining;financial data processing;time series","TS-binary search tree;data mining;financial time series data;financial time series representation;multiresolution important point retrieval method","","0","","11","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, video surveillance/retrieval, 3D/4D medical image analysis, and other computer vision applications require particular reduction in spatio-temporal space, but not along data index dimension.

Continuous dynamic programming (CDP) is a promising method for spotting recognition applied to sequential patterns. However, the computational burden for conducting a retrieval task using CDP increases as O(JIP), where I is the input length, J is the reference length and P is the number of paths. This paper proposes a faster nonlinear spotting method like CDP, called fast spotter (FS). FS is regarded as an approximation of CDP using A* search.

At this step, we can build a contingency table crossing ""visual words"" as terms/words and images as documents.

Firstly, we transform a term as a vector with elements of each corresponding to a synset of WordNet. Then, with singular value decomposition (SVD), we reduce the dimension size of the vector to represent the latent semantic structure. For evaluation, we implement an automatic assessment system for short essays and acquire reliable accuracy.

Learning distance metric from a number of queries with side information, i.e., relevance judgements, has been studied widely, for example pairwise constraint-based distance metric learning. However, the capacity of existing algorithms is limited, because they usually assume that the distance between two similar objects is smaller than the distance between two dissimilar objects. This assumption may not hold, especially in the case of information retrieval when the input space is heterogeneous. To address this problem explicitly, we propose rank-based distance metric learning. Our approach overcomes the drawback of existing algorithms by comparing the distances only among the relevant and irrelevant objects for a given query. To avoid over-fitting, a regularizer based on the Burg matrix divergence is also introduced. We apply the proposed framework to tattoo image retrieval in forensics and law enforcement application domain.

Therefore, a cascade mining algorithm was proposed, which consisted of one cascade classifier operator and three mining components, including jamming mining component, Bopomofo mining component and complicated characters mining component. After mined with the three components, the temporary mining result of a Web page would be dealt with the cascade classifier operator and got the last result; the classified Web page was normal or malicious.

In this problem, the configuration is illuminated by a single frequency wave-field and the scattered field is measured in an external observation domain. The inversion of this data is well-known to be non-linear and ill-posed. Furthermore, the retrievable information is limited. In order to overcome such drawbacks, multi-frequency data can be used by exploiting the Maxwellian dispersion relationships. However, the use of the set of multi-frequency data significantly increases the computational burden of the inversion process. Recently, the so-called Diagonalized Contrast Source Inversion (DCSI) method is introduced to efficiently solve the inverse problem. In this method, instead of solving the full non-linear problem, a three-linear-step procedure is carried out to significantly reduce the overall computational time. In order to further enhance the DCSI method, in this paper it has been extended for dealing with multi-frequency data.","2164-3342;21643342","POD:978-92-9092-937-6","10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584917","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4584917","iterative technique;multi-frequency imaging;non-linear inversion","Communications technology;Computed tomography;Cost function;Electromagnetic scattering;Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;Integral equations;Inverse problems;Iterative methods;Robustness","","","","0","","11","","","6-10 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By following these links, a crawler is able to index the RDB along with all the URL-queries. Once the content and their corresponding URL-queries have been indexed, a user may submit keyword queries through a standard search engine and receive up-to-date database information.

We exploit the iMinMax(thetas) transformation to map high-dimensional data points to 1-dimensional values. All transformed data points are then distributed on a structured P2P network called BATON, where all peers are virtually organized as a balanced binary search tree. Subsequently, a progressive algorithm is proposed to compute skyline in the distributed P2P network. Further, we propose an adaptive skyline filtering technique to reduce both processing cost and communication cost during distributed skyline computing.

Exploiting side information, we develop algorithms to preserve both the intra-class and inter-class local structures. This new type of locality preserving projection (LPP), called LPP with side information (LPPSI), preserves the datapsilas local structure in the sense that the close, similar training patterns will be kept close, whilst the close but dissimilar ones are separated. Our algorithms balance these conflicting requirements, and we further improve this technique using kernel methods. Experiments conducted on popular face databases demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms LPP. Further, we show that the performance of our algorithm with partial side information (that is, using only small amount of pair-wise similarity/dissimilarity information during training) is comparable with that when using full side information. We conclude that exploiting side information by preserving both similar and dissimilar local structures of the data significantly improves performance.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587596","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587596","","Access control;Australia;Databases;Face recognition;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Scattering","computer vision;visual databases","computer vision;face database;kernel methods;locality preserving projection;side information","","0","","28","","","23-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from previous methods, the proposed LRML method integrates both log data and unlabeled data information through an effective graph regularization framework. We show that reliable metrics can be learned from real log data even they may be noisy and limited at the beginning stage of a CIR system.

The profiling radiometer can retrieve vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and cloud liquid water every 30 seconds or every minute from the surface up to 10 km in height under clear sky and cloudy conditions. It is also capable of assessing the columnar cloud liquid water content (also known as the liquid water path L) and the water vapour path continuously, unlike what can be achieved with conventional radiosondes. The profiler also features an infrared thermometer that detects the cloud base temperature: the cloud base height of the lowest layer can thus be estimated using the contemporaneous temperature profile. Statistics on liquid water path, cloud base height and cloud top height for non-precipitating liquid-phase and mixed-phase stratus and stratocumulus clouds observed over CRC between April 2005 and April 2006 during the daytime are presented in this paper. According to the land cloud climatology of Hahn and Warren [1], these clouds are one of the most frequently occurring liquid-bearing types over a 5-degree by 5-degree box that includes the Ottawa area. Cloud top height has been assessed using CRC's cloud detection algorithm [2]. It is based on the Chernykh and Eskridge (CE) method that was originally designed to detect cloud layers and amounts from radiosonde profiles [3]. Our algorithm uses the CE method with retrieved vertical profiles of temperature and relative humidity, but also data not measured by radiosondes: the cloud base height estimated by the infrared thermometer, and the retrieved L. This extra set of conditions can be summarized as follows: a cloud contains liquid water whenever L exceeds a certain threshold value computed for each profile [2] and its cloud base height is lower than some maximum value (found to be 6 km in [2]). This cloud detection algorithm has - - been shown to significantly reduce the number of false positives compared to the application of the original CE method [2]. Daytime seasonal and annual averages will be compared, whenever possible, to the 6-year climatology of midlatitude low-level continental clouds from the United States ARM Southern Great Plains (SGP) Central Facility, Oklahoma, reported in [4]. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this 6-year cloud climatology is the only one available in the literature.","2164-3342;21643342","POD:978-92-9092-937-6","10.1109/EUCAP.2006.4584744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4584744","","Cloud computing;Cyclic redundancy check;Detection algorithms;Humidity measurement;Information retrieval;Infrared detectors;Land surface temperature;Optical computing;Radiometry;Statistics","climatology;clouds;radiosondes","Communications Research Centre Canada;Earth-Space links;Ottawa;columnar cloud liquid water content;infrared thermometer;land cloud climatology;liquid-dominant mixed-phase clouds;low-lying liquid clouds;mixed-phase stratus clouds;multifrequency profiling radiometer;radiosonde profiles;stratocumulus clouds;water vapour","","2","","8","","","6-10 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose the semantic based method of finding similar texts by determining the meaning of the words, using semantic similarity measurement with U-WIN.","","POD:978-0-7695-3273-8","10.1109/ALPIT.2008.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4584339","Semantic Similarity;Text Similarity;U-WIN","Educational institutions;Equations;Frequency;Information retrieval;Information systems;Information technology;Intelligent networks;Natural languages;Ontologies;Recommender systems","natural language processing;text analysis","U-WIN;WordNet;semantic language resources;semantic similarity measurement;similar text finding","","1","","11","","","23-25 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One method of copyright protection is to embed a digital code, ldquowatermarkrdquo, into the video sequence. The watermark can then unambiguously identify the copyright holder of the video sequence. In this paper we propose a new video watermark embedding algorithm that would insert watermarks into video sequences and also detect if a given video sequence contains a given watermark. The video standard that has been chosen is the H.264 standard as it offers a significant efficiency improvement over the previous video compression standards. A couple of tests that can be considered representative for most image manipulations and attacks were performed. The proposed algorithm has passed all attack tests. The watermarking mechanisms in this paper have been proved to be robust and efficient to protect the copyright of H.264 coded video within the video retrieval system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2358-3; POD:978-1-4244-2357-6","10.1109/CIT.2008.4594713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4594713","","Computational complexity;Content based retrieval;Copyright protection;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Robustness;Testing;Video compression;Video sequences;Watermarking","copyright;image sequences;multimedia systems;video coding;video retrieval;watermarking","H.264 standard;copyright protection;digital code;digital multimedia content;video retrieval;video sequence;watermarking","","0","","16","","","8-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hyperlinked Web resources represent a rich information tapestry of content and context, instrumental in effective knowledge sharing and further knowledge development. However, the Web’s simple linking model has become increasingly inadequate for effective content discovery and reuse. At the same time, rigorous but heavyweight solutions such as the Semantic Web have yet to garner critical mass in adoption. This paper analyzes the relative strengths and shortcomings of existing linked data approaches. It proposes a novel, lightweight architecture for the modeling, aggregation, retrieval, management, and sharing of contextual information for Web resources, based on established standards and designed to encourage more efficient and robust information reuse on the Web.","","POD:978-1-4244-2659-1","10.1109/IRI.2008.4583029","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4583029","","Context modeling;Data models;HTML;Information retrieval;Instruments;Joining processes;Robustness;Semantic Web;Service oriented architecture;XML","","","","1","","24","","","13-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the relevance of images, we are further interested in what portion of the image is of interest to the user. Therefore, we consider images represented by sets of regions and propose multiple-instance rank learning based on the max margin framework. Three different schemes are designed to encode the multiple-instance assumption.

Overcoming limitations of a coordination language can be a major challenge for developers of distributed systems. This paper presents a novel coordination mechanism based on code mobility. In this mechanism coordination is realised by exchanging pieces of mobile code between coordinated entities. This approach overcomes constrains of a statically defined coordination language by allowing coordinated entities to dynamically redefine coordination rules and use all the power of a programming language to express such rules. This helps to implement sophisticated and efficient data retrieval and processing algorithms and also reduce network traffic. The paper also discusses a non-language based coordination framework specially developed to support coordination based on mobile code and a pragmatic solution to the problem of protecting hosts from potentially harmful mobile code. A proof of concept implementation demonstrates the feasibility and applicability of the proposal.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3275-2","10.1109/ICCGI.2008.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4591366","","Authorization;Computer languages;Information retrieval;Information systems;Information technology;Mobile agents;Mobile computing;Proposals;Protection;Telecommunication traffic","client-server systems;mobile computing;security of data","client-server interaction;coordination mechanism;data processing;data retrieval;distributed systems;network traffic;nonlanguage based coordination framework;potentially harmful mobile code;programming language;statically defined coordination language","","0","","17","","","July 27 2008-Aug. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, there were studies on integrating these two approaches to support soft queries, based on a user's sense of relevance and preference, for ranking with numerical attributes. However, in real life, it is desirable to use categorical attributes together with numerical ones in ranking. For example, when buying a car, categorical attributes, such as make, model, color, and equipments, are considered as significant factors as numerical attributes, such as price and year. Meanwhile, users often do not have sufficient domain knowledge at formulating an effective selection query over categories, whereas rank formulation is even more challenging as categories have no inherent ordering. In this paper, we propose a framework PerRank (Personalized Ranking with Categorical and Numerical Attributes) to support personalized ranking with both categorical and numerical attributes for soft queries. For an efficient computation, we developed an algorithm CAC (Clustering-based Attribute Construction) which makes use of a clustering method. Extensive experiments show CAC is effective and efficient at supporting ranking with both categorical and numerical attributes for soft queries.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597024","Categorical Attributes;Personalization;Ranking","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Computer science;Data mining;Deductive databases;Information management;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Machine learning","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;query processing","categorical attribute;clustering-based attribute construction;database community;intelligent data retrieval;machine learning community;numerical attribute;personalized rank retrieval;query selection","","0","","19","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key component of these approaches is that local regions of images are characterized using high-dimensional descriptors which are then mapped to ldquovisual wordsrdquo selected from a discrete vocabulary.This paper explores techniques to map each visual region to a weighted set of words, allowing the inclusion of features which were lost in the quantization stage of previous systems. The set of visual words is obtained by selecting words based on proximity in descriptor space. We describe how this representation may be incorporated into a standard tf-idf architecture, and how spatial verification is modified in the case of this soft-assignment. We evaluate our method on the standard Oxford Buildings dataset, and introduce a new dataset for evaluation. Our results exceed the current state of the art retrieval performance on these datasets, particularly on queries with poor initial recall where techniques like query expansion suffer. Overall we show that soft-assignment is always beneficial for retrieval with large vocabularies, at a cost of increased storage requirements for the index.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:978-1-4244-2242-5","10.1109/CVPR.2008.4587635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4587635","","Architecture;Buildings;Costs;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Quantization;Visual databases;Vocabulary","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;visual databases","high-dimensional descriptor;large scale image databases;quantization;visual object retrieval;visual words","","385","10","18","","","23-28 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a multi-stage way which considers all the available information to improve the accuracy of ontology mapping. The initial similarities of concepts of two ontologies are obtained at the first stage based on the information of labels, instances and properties. Then former indexed experiences that imbed domain knowledge are used to modify the result. After that we use a preprocessing process to modify the structures of ontologies to reduce the heterogeneity of the structures. Then a graph-based iteration process is carried out, which considers the similarity of structures. Finally the correspondences of properties of the equivalent concepts are identified based on the labels, types, values and axioms, wherein the axioms may be predefined or may be discovered via data mining from instances.","","POD:978-1-4244-2659-1","10.1109/IRI.2008.4583055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4583055","Experience Reuse;Information Integration;Knowledge Management;Ontology Mapping","Data mining;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Lattices;Machine learning;Management information systems;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Vehicles","","","","1","","16","","","13-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method uses a knowledge base to store related information of some past queries, groups the search regions of the past queries into larger regions and retrieves the tuples from the larger regions. To answer a newly submitted query, our method tries to obtain most results from the previously retrieved tuples that are still in main memory. Thus, this method seeks to minimize the response time by reducing the search regions or avoiding accesses to the underlying databases. Extensive experiments are carried out to measure the performance of this new strategy and the results indicate that it is significantly better than the naive method for both low-dimensional and high-dimensional data.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597021","","Application software;Computer science;Database systems;Delay;Educational institutions;Information management;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Relational databases;Thyristors","query processing;relational databases","knowledge base;learning-based strategies;naive method;region clustering techniques;relational databases;top-N selection queries","","0","","21","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since a large amount of transliteration/translation pairs can be collected from the Web, a large transliteration-training corpus can be curated from these pairs.

By defining a confidence map and content-context similarity matrix, images with small semantic gaps are selected and clustered. The final concept lexicon is mined from the surrounding descriptions (titles, categories and comments) of these images. This lexicon offers a set of high-level concepts with small semantic gaps, which is very helpful for people to focus for data collection, annotation and modeling.

To motivate subscribers to buy the high quality encrypted video content, trailers are usually produced in a variety of media. However, producing two kinds of films not only spends extra time and storage space but also increases the cost of production. In this paper, we propose a new solution to solve this problem which splits a film into two layers: a preview layer with low quality content and a protected layer which can be recovered to retrieve the entire video data. In such a way, the preview layer could be used to attract users to buy the content and the protected layer protected by the DRM system is used to recover the original resolution.
