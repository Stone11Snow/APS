First, we present a fuzzy agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm for clustering documents and to get the document cluster centers of document clusters. Then, we present a method to construct fuzzy logic rules based on the document clusters and their document cluster centers. Finally, we apply the constructed fuzzy logic rules to modify the user's query for query expansion and to guide the information retrieval system to retrieve documents relevant to the user's request. The fuzzy logic rules can represent three kinds of fuzzy relationships (i.e., fuzzy positive association relationship, fuzzy specialization relationship and fuzzy generalization relationship) between index terms. The proposed fuzzy information retrieval method is more flexible and more intelligent than the existing methods due to the fact that it can expand users' queries for fuzzy information retrieval in a more effective manner.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2004.840134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1411824","Fuzzy agglomerative hierarchical clustering;fuzzy information retrieval systems;fuzzy logic rules;fuzzy relationships;query expansion","Boolean functions;Clustering algorithms;Councils;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy systems;Helium;Inference algorithms;Information retrieval;Information science","fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy systems;pattern clustering;query formulation;query processing;vocabulary","fuzzy agglomerative;fuzzy hierarchical clustering;fuzzy inference technique;fuzzy information retrieval;fuzzy logic rules;index term;query expansion","","25","","30","","","April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To improve the performance of multimedia retrieval, our PatternQuest first employs an efficient feature selection method to extract a low-dimensional feature subspace. With the feature selection, PatternQuest can effectively alleviate the curse of dimensionality for learning-based relevance feedback. To discover patterns of interest in the feature subspace effectively, we propose a multiresolution pattern discovery (MPD) approach, which trains an online pattern classification method known as adaptive random forests to filter negative objects, from the neighborhood of the query to the global scope, in a fine to coarse way. With MPD, our PatternQuest method can iteratively capture the patterns of interest with a little training data from the user's feedback. We have carried out extensive experiments on an image database (with 31,438 Corel images) to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.","","POD:0-7803-8603-5","10.1109/ICME.2004.1394175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1394175","","Computer science;Filters;Image databases;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Pattern classification;Robustness;Spatial databases;State feedback;Training data","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia systems;pattern classification;relevance feedback;visual databases","Corel images;PatternQuest;adaptive random forests;feature selection;image database;multimedia information retrieval;multiresolution pattern discovery approach;pattern classification;pattern learning;patterns of interest;positive objects distribution patterns;relevance feedback","","0","","10","","","27-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This extension is then used to support flexible querying of multidimensional OLAP data and rules discovery. Rough SQL is based on an efficient and optimized algorithm that operates approximations on data only once and stores the results in the database. The advantages are: the first is reducing considerably time spent to do the same treatment for each concept approximation request of the user; the second is that users are so given answers immediately. It proposes just adding concept approximation operators to the SQL algebra for more flexibility when dealing with imperfect data. Rough SQL can be connected to any relational database and applied on data warehouses. These capabilities allow extending the OLAP (on line analytical processing) analytical querying capabilities with approximate queries supported by the Rough SQL.","","POD:0-7803-8482-2","10.1109/ICTTA.2004.1307801","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307801","","Algebra;Cleaning;Data mining;Data warehouses;Decision support systems;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Prototypes;Relational databases;XML","SQL;approximation theory;data mining;data warehouses;query processing;relational algebra;relational databases;rough set theory","SQL algebra;analytical querying;approximate query;concepts approximation operator;data warehouse;database store;explicit information extraction;information retrieval;lower upper approximation;multidimensional OLAP data querying;on line analytical processing;pragmatic OLAP;query optimized algorithm;relational database;rough SQL;rough set theory;rules discovery","","0","","6","","","19-23 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings of","20040824","2004","","","133","138","For content-based image retrieval techniques, systems adopt certain metric to measure the similarity between images using some visual features. In most of existing approaches, the measurements are fixed up and calculated based on the whole image. The usefulness of those systems is limited because 1. The end-users are not involved in the retrieval processes. 2. The spatial information is not taken into account and end users can not put different emphasizes on different regions in the image when retrieve. Therefore, the systems demonstrate a disability to use the locally spatial relevance feedback. This paper describes an approach towards those problems to improve the discrimination power using locally spatial information. Images are divided into 5 overlapped regions and 5 neural networks are employed to measure the similarity between corresponding regions in a query image and images in the database. The relevance feedbacks for different regions from end users are used to refine the neural networks for adjusting the measurements. Results demonstrate a good potential of the methodology.","","POD:0-7803-8243-9","10.1109/ICISIP.2004.1287639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287639","","Biomedical measurements;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia databases;neural nets;relevance feedback;visual databases","content based image retrieval;discrimination power;image database;learning;neural networks;query image;relevance feedback;spatial information feedback;visual features","","0","","17","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To project the usefulness of the IGA to develop emotional human-computer interfaces, we have applied it to the problems of image and music information retrieval. Several experiments show that our approach allows us to design and search digital media not only explicitly expressed, but also abstract images such as ""cheerful impression,"" and ""gloomy impression.""

The database retrieval aspect of such systems has received considerable attention, but the query processing and the resulting melodic representation have not been examined as carefully. Common methods for query processing are rudimentary, which suggests that more advanced methods might improve retrieval performance. Researchers have also proposed that coarsely quantized melodic representations might improve performance, but these claims have not been carefully investigated. We examine several advanced query processing methods as well as quantized melodic representations for a query-by-humming system. We compute the retrieval accuracy of a complete query-by-humming system that uses these transcription methods along with varying degrees of pitch and duration quantization. We also compare the transcription methods in isolation by computing their segmentation performance. The results show that more advanced query processing can improve both segmentation performance and retrieval performance. Further, coarsely quantizing the melodic representation generally degrades retrieval accuracy rather than improving it.","","POD:0-7803-7850-4","10.1109/ASPAA.2003.1285839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1285839","","Computational complexity;Databases;Degradation;Information retrieval;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Quantization;Query processing;Robustness;Signal processing","audio coding;audio databases;music;quantisation (signal);query processing;signal representation","duration quantization;melodic databases;music information retrieval;pitch quantization;quantized melodic representation;query processing;query-by-humming;segmentation performance;sung query coding;transcription methods","","2","","8","","","19-22 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each generator selects a supply bid curve as the best response to all simulated bidding scenarios. After observing the actual outcomes and performing sensitivity analysis from the most similar bidding scenario, the bids are adjusted for subsequent use. The optimality of the decisions may need to be altered by the power system constraints. The objective of the paper is to provide a possible way of extracting information from the bidding process rather than analyzing the strategic behavior of the generators.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:0-7695-2268-8","10.1109/HICSS.2005.475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1385347","","Cost function;Data mining;Electricity supply industry;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Power markets;Power system analysis computing;Power system simulation;Sensitivity analysis;Uncertainty","","Information asymmetry;electricity market","","0","","10","","","03-06 Jan. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An electronic road can be visualized as a virtual multidimensional information road, supported by distributed digital library that contains digital information such as video, audio, images and text. The distributed digital library is accessed with intelligent means to ease navigation. ERIS has to resolve several issues in different disciplines such as computer networks, digital libraries, coordination models, synchronisation models and system design. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to investigate two key areas: contend-based image retrieval (CBIR), and the provision of quality of service (QoS) to the networked services, or lack of it in the current Internet. To provide better QoS to the users, we investigate new previously proposed Internet architectures, which aim to provide rudimentary QoS through service differentiation, i.e. IP-DiffServ.","","POD:0-7803-6290-X","10.1109/MELCON.2000.880010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=880010","","Content based retrieval;Cultural differences;Diffserv networks;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Quality of service;Roads;Software libraries;Visualization;Web and internet services","Internet;content-based retrieval;digital libraries;image retrieval;quality of service;transport protocols","ERIS project;Electronic Roads in the Information Society;IP DiffServ;Internet;QoS provision;audio;computer networks;content-based image retrieval;coordination models;digital information;distributed digital library;images;navigation;networked services;quality of service;service differentiation;synchronisation models;system design;text;video;virtual multidimensional information road","","0","","10","","","2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an approach with the capability of matching partial word images to address two issues in document image retrieval: word spotting and similarity measurement between documents. First, each word image is represented by a primitive string. Then, an inexact string matching technique is utilized to measure the similarity between the two primitive strings generated from two word images. Based on the similarity, we can estimate how a word image is relevant to the other and, thereby, decide whether one is a portion of the other. To deal with various character fonts, we use a primitive string which is tolerant to serif and font differences to represent a word image. Using this technique of inexact string matching, our method is able to successfully handle the problem of heavily touching characters. Experimental results on a variety of document image databases confirm the feasibility, validity, and efficiency of our proposed approach in document image retrieval.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1339266","65;Index Terms- Document image retrieval;document similarity measurement.;partial word image matching;primitive string;word searching","Digital images;Document image processing;Electronics packaging;Image converters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet;Optical character recognition software;Paper technology","character sets;document handling;image retrieval;string matching;visual databases","character fonts;document image database;document image retrieval;document similarity measurement;information retrieval;partial word image matching;string matching;word searching;word spotting","","19","","40","","","Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is based on an equivalent transformation theory and an XDD theory. It employs the MPEG-7 and SMIL standards which provide the tools to annotate the spatial and temporal relations inside multimedia and the tools to compose the multimedia, respectively. SMIL is selected to be one of the representation languages for the multimedia documents and presentations. Yet this has no enough efficiency to handle higher-level spatial and temporal relations, whereas the MPEG- 7 provides tools to annotate those kinds of relations. These tools are used to decompose multimedia contents into segments and synchronize them together. Nevertheless, they should have more expressiveness power for retrieval and composition. As a result, the XDD theory is employed to enhance the language in terms of expressibility and computability. Moreover, by making use of XDD, constraints and axiom specifications are easily defined. This paper also defines a modeling language called SMILD that be able to represent spatial and temporal multimedia.","","POD:0-7695-2217-3","10.1109/MMSE.2004.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1376662","","Application software;Computer applications;Computer languages;Content based retrieval;Informatics;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia systems;Telecommunication computing;XML","Unified Modeling Language;content management;document handling;information retrieval;multimedia databases;spatial reasoning;temporal reasoning;video coding","XDD theory;equivalent transformation theory;modeling language;multimedia documents;multimedia information retrieval;spatial reasoning;synchronized multimedia integration language;temporal multimedia;temporal reasoning","","0","","11","","","13-15 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is difficult for conventional search engines based on centralized architecture to retrieve really fresh information, because they take a long time to collect documents via Web robots. In contrast to a centralized architecture, a search engine based on a distributed architecture does not need to collect documents, because each site independently makes an index. As a result, distributed search engines can retrieve really fresh information. However, fast indexing is not enough to easily retrieve fresh information. The value of information is determined by both freshness and relevance. Traditional ranking methods consider either freshness or relevance; so, we proposed FTF-IDF (fresh term frequency multiplied by inverse document frequency) as a scoring method that considers both freshness and relevance. In this paper, we describe a verification of FTF-IDF on an actual Web diary.","","POD:0-7803-8593-4","10.1109/ISCIT.2004.1412481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1412481","","Computer aided software engineering;Computer architecture;Content based retrieval;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Lakes;Search engines;Service oriented architecture;Web pages","Web sites;relevance feedback;search engines;statistical analysis","FTF-IDF;Web diary;distributed architecture;distributed search engines;fresh information retrieval;fresh term frequency multiplied by inverse document frequency;freshness based scoring;ranking methods;relevance;scoring method","","3","","13","","","26-29 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Items in a transaction are non-noise words in the query request corresponding with the transaction. Each item is weighted with a value to measure the importance of the item for the user.

A general approach to providing neighborhood information to moving objects is to retrieve objects in the neighborhood of a moving object with a spatial query that uses the traditional Euclidean distance. However, if we know the destination and the estimated route of a moving object, we would be able to provide more appropriate information to the object. Based on this idea, we have developed adaptive spatial query generation models that take the trajectory of a moving object into consideration to retrieve desired information. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the neighborhood information retrieval system based on the models and evaluate its effectiveness with experiments.","","POD:0-7695-2103-7","10.1109/WISEW.2003.1286783","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286783","","Appropriate technology;Automotive engineering;Ellipsoids;Euclidean distance;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Navigation;Prototypes;Systems engineering and theory;Vehicles","information retrieval systems;mobile computing;query processing;search problems;transforms","Euclidean distance;adaptive neighborhood information retrieval system;adaptive spatial query generation model;digital cartography;global positioning systems;location-based services;mobile devices;mobile users","","0","","18","","","13 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In each refinement step a user is provided with a complete but minimal set of refinements, which enables him to develop/express his information need in a step-by-step fashion. The approach is based on the model-theoretic interpretation of the refinement problem, so that the query refinement process can be considered as the process of inferring all queries which are subsumed by a given query. Moreover, query refinements are ranked according to their relevance to user's needs, whereas these needs are online discovered by analysing a user's behaviour.

Similar to the dynamic sales dialog for electronic commerce scenarios, information gain measure based approaches are widely used for attribute selection and dialog length reduction. However, for speech enabled information retrieval systems, another important factor influencing attribute selection is speech recognition accuracy. Too low accuracy results in a failed dialog. Recognition accuracy varies with many issues, including acoustic model performance and grammar complexity. The acoustic model is fixed for a whole dialog, while grammar is different for each interaction round, thereby grammar complexity influences the attribute selected for the next question. An approach combining both information gain measurement and grammar complexity is presented for a dynamic dialog driven system. Offline evaluations show that this approach can give a trade-off between the target of faster discrimination of the candidates for retrieval and higher recognition accuracy.","","POD:0-7803-8678-7","10.1109/CHINSL.2004.1409657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1409657","","Acoustic measurements;Automatic speech recognition;Electronic commerce;Gain measurement;Information retrieval;Length measurement;Marketing and sales;Speech recognition;Speech synthesis;Target recognition","computational complexity;grammars;information retrieval;interactive systems;speech processing;speech recognition","acoustic model;attribute selection;dialog length reduction;dynamic dialog driven system;grammar complexity;information gain;recognition accuracy;speech enabled information retrieval","","0","","4","","","15-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We can obtain the equivalent classes of semantic index terms by using description logic reasoner. The logical views of documents and user information needs, generated in terms of the equivalent classes of semantic index terms, can represent documents and user information needs well, so the performance of information retrieval can be improved effectively when suitable ranking function is chosen.

By engineering web-based information gathering systems along the dimensions of agency and ontology, relations among concepts can be identified and established, and information filtering and monitoring tasks can be automated by information filtering agents (IFAs) and information monitoring agents (IMAs). IFAs and IMAs relieve users of the tasks of browsing and monitoring changes in websites and multiple web sites can be browsed and monitored in parallel by several IFAs and IMAs. By establishing ontological relations among (key)words 1) the query processing agent (QPA) selects appropriate URLs for a query and 2) IFAs search and filter information relevant to the query.

Variations of WP and AWP are in use in most deployed digital libraries using the Boolean model, text extenders for relational database systems (e.g., Oracle text) and the search engine Altavista. We present the syntax, semantics and model theory of WP and AWP and analyze the complexity of query satisfiability and entailment.

"A proposed parallel model for extracting and translating query keywords for bilingual information retrieval","M. Nour","Electron. Res. Inst., Cairo, Egypt","Proceedings. 2004 International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies: From Theory to Applications, 2004.","20040706","2004","","","649","","In this work, a parallel model is proposed to analyze an input English query and translate the English keywords; word-by-word; into Arabic. The proposed model involves three main parts: the architectural model, the application model, and the cost model. In the architectural model, a multiprocessor system based on shared memory is adopted. The communication among processors is done via the shared memory. Concerning the application model, four important phases are done to translate the English extracted keywords into Arabic, and form two patterns one in English and the other in Arabic. Once the English and Arabic patterns are formed, they will be searched against the terms describing the collection of English and Arabic documents respectively, i.e. the patterns are prepared to be matched against the Web documents which is not our objective here. The proposed model does searching and also computation of the similarity value in parallel. The parallel model is going to decrease the time consumed in searching and computation. Moreover, the cost model calculates the total execution time of the query analysis and keywords' translation. That execution time is calculated by using one processor and more than one processor. The speedup is also calculated as well as the processors' utilization. This work was simulated on the IBM/PC with speed of 800 MHZ. The simulation was done for different query lengths from one to six words. It is concluded that, parallelism is significant for reducing the time consumed in extracting and translating the query keywords for bilingual information retrieval.","","POD:0-7803-8482-2","10.1109/ICTTA.2004.1307932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307932","","Concurrent computing;Costs;Data mining;IEEE members;Information retrieval;Internet;Multiprocessing systems;Natural languages;Noise generators;Pattern matching","Internet;information retrieval;language translation;multiprocessing systems;natural languages;parallel processing;query languages","Arabic patterns;English keyword translation;bilingual information retrieval;cross-language information retrieval;multiprocessor system;parallel model;parallel searching;performance evaluation;query analysis","","0","","","","","19-23 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, they get a huge number of references. Moreover, the Web technology is suitable to build distributed information. Due to the huge quantity of available information and its distributed structure, it is necessary to abstract it and eliminate the redundancy data. In this work, we propose a method for cooperative conceptual data reduction that is integrated in a conceptual information retrieval system. The proposed method is based on the concept lattice incremental construction.

A Web page links to the media objects distributed over the Web so that it aggregates them with respect to the page content. Our approach extracts the referential context by analyzing the logical structure of the Web and discovers the aspect of a media object, which means the latent semantics of the referential context.

While these methods provide an evaluation of average system performance, they are not able to identify influence of other factors such as retrieval task and system user. Detailed information is hidden behind the average and no indication can be obtained from the evaluation for further improvement. Therefore, there is a need of new methods for detailed evaluation. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional approach to the evaluation of IR results so that effects of both an IR system and the environment where the system performs on retrieval results can be examined.

However, it is difficult for conventional search engines based on centralized architecture to retrieve really fresh information, because they take a long time to collect documents via Web robots. In contrast to a centralized architecture, a search engine based on a distributed architecture does not need to collect documents, because each site independently makes an index. As this result, distributed search engines can retrieve really fresh information. However, fast indexing is not enough to easily retrieve fresh information. The value of information is determined by both freshness and relevance. Traditional ranking methods consider either freshness or relevance; so, we proposed FTFIDF (fresh term frequency multiplied by inverse document frequency) as a scoring method that considers both freshness and relevance.","","POD:0-7695-2051-0","10.1109/AINA.2004.1283905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283905","","Computer architecture;Content based retrieval;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information theory;Robots;Search engines;Service oriented architecture;Web pages","Internet;information retrieval;search engines","FTF-IDF scoring;Web robots;distributed architecture;distributed searching;document collection;fresh term frequency;information retrieval;inverse document frequency;ranking methods;search engines","","4","","19","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To decrease feature vector dimension, genetic algorithm is used. The optimizing features constitute the visual contents. Only using these low-level features can't get satisfying results, because these features can't entirely describe human recognition to images, the semantic features are needed, but it is difficult to extract the image semantic contents directly at the present time, so the text information in the image report by radiologists is chosen for semantic content.

From the perspective of retrieval, the semantics of multimedia data features context-dependency and media-independency; both are inadequately supported by the state-of-the-art data modeling technology. In this paper, we address this problem by advocating MediaView as an extended object-oriented view mechanism to bridge the ""semantic gap"" between conventional databases and semantics-intensive multimedia applications. This mechanism captures the dynamic semantics of multimedia using a modeling construct named media view (MV), which formulates a customized context where heterogeneous media objects with similar/related semantics are characterized by additional properties and user-defined semantic relationships. View operators are proposed for the manipulation and derivation of individual MVs, which can be fit into the desired real-life scenarios automatically. The usefulness and elegancy of MediaView are demonstrated by its applications in various (subjective) activities supporting multi-modal retrieval.","1550-445X;1550445X","POD:0-7695-2249-1","10.1109/AINA.2005.255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423482","context-dependency;media view;multi-modal retrieval","Bridges;Content management;Context modeling;Explosives;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Nonhomogeneous media;Object oriented databases;Object oriented modeling;Spatial databases","information retrieval;multimedia computing;object-oriented databases;semantic Web","context dependency;data modeling;heterogeneous media objects;media view;multimedia information;multimodal information retrieval;object-oriented view;semantic view mechanism","","0","","11","","","28-30 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

No.04CH37541)","20050117","2004","1","","","755","The present paper describes a method of fully automated cross-language information retrieval, which does not require any query translation. Namely, monolingual queries retrieve documents from a multilingual collection, which includes items from the query's source language. This is achieved by a method, which combines the construction of a multilingual semantic space using latent semantic indexing (LSI) and the clustering ability of self-organizing maps (SOM) for the generation of multilingual semantic categories. Tests on an English-Greek corpus reveal the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.","1098-7576;10987576","POD:0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1380013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380013","","Engineering management;Financial management;Histograms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Robustness;Self organizing feature maps;Testing;Tongue","indexing;information retrieval;natural language interfaces;self-organising feature maps","English-Greek corpus;cross-language information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;monolingual queries retrieve document;multilingual collection;multilingual semantic space;self-organizing map","","2","1","14","","","25-29 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, conventional search engines are not suited for fresh information retrieval because they are based on centralized architecture. So, we have developed a distributed search engine, cooperative search engine (CSE), which based on distributed architecture. CSE can search fresh information in a short time. The cost of fresh information retrieval is O(1) in the average case, but O(n) in the worst case. So, CSE is scalable, because it is not depended on the system scale. However, even if the performance is good, it is not enough for fresh information retrieval. The value of information is determined by both freshness and relevance. Traditional ranking methods consider either freshness or relevance. So, we propose FTF-IDF scoring which considers both freshness and relevance. In this paper, we evaluate its effects.","1550-445X;1550445X","POD:0-7695-2249-1","10.1109/AINA.2005.326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423561","distributed search engine;web information retrieval","Chaos;Computer architecture;Costs;Entropy;Frequency;Information retrieval;Information theory;Plants (biology);Search engines;Web pages","Internet;information retrieval;search engines","FTF-IDF scoring;Web information retrieval;cooperative search engine;distributed search engine;page ranking;relevance feedback","","0","","14","","","28-30 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
