In this paper we discuss solar images and the results of our investigation of techniques that can be used to identify solar phenomena in images from the TRACE satellite for the creation of a search engine. Being able to automatically identify and search for various phenomena in solar images is of great interest for scientists studying the sun. We discuss a set of characteristics that can be quickly extracted from solar images. These characteristics are used to create classifiers for various phenomena contained in solar images. The classifiers are then used to create an example based information retrieval system There are many obstacles that need to be overcome when extracting features and creating these classifiers. These include the inherent unbalanced data sets due to varying rates different phenomena appear and multiple phenomenon that could appear in each image.","1051-4651;10514651","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2175-6; POD:978-1-4244-2174-9","10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4761078","","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Data mining;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Satellites;Statistical analysis;Sun","astronomical image processing;feature extraction;image retrieval;information retrieval","TRACE repository;example based image retrieval;feature extraction;information retrieval;search engine;solar image","","3","","11","","","8-11 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the view of facilitating knowledge sharing and reusing, modularization is introduced into ontology.

Thus, a novel approach for semi-automatic decomposition of ontology into modules, which takes fuzzily computing concept semantic similarity based ontology as the base, is proposed in this paper.

The content in a KMS includes both the knowledge management (KM) schema and the data contained within. KM schemas can be viewed as ontologies and the data contained within can be viewed as instance data. Thus we can apply semantic web ontology and instance data processing techniques and tools in KM settings. There are many semantic web tools aimed at ontology evaluation, however there is little, if any, research focusing on instance data evaluation. Although instance data evaluation has many issues in common with ontology evaluation, there are some issues that are either more prominent in or unique to instance data evaluation. Instance data often accounts for orders of magnitude more data than ontology data in organization intranets, thus our work focuses on evaluation techniques that help users of KMSs to determine when certain instance data is ready for use. We present our work on semantic web instance data evaluation for KMSs. We define the instance data evaluation research problem and design a general evaluation process GEP. We identify three categories of issues that may occur in instance data: syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and potential issues. For each category of issues, we provide illustrative examples, describe the symptoms, analyze the causes, and present our detection solution.

"Demarcation of land-water boundary of Indian coast using MSMR data of IRS-P4 satellite at 10.65 GHz","O. P. N. Calla; U. Purohit; M.

The frequency range from 3 GHz to 30 GHz is designated as microwaves. The microwaves are used extensively in remote sensing because of its unique capabilities like day and night capability and all weather capability. Because of these they have stand alone applications. Microwave sensors are either active or passive type. These sensors provide the required database with the help of emission and scattering properties of terrain under study. To mark the land water boundary of Indian Coast passive sensor radiometer is used. The brightness temperature varies with the presence of water in the soil. It is different for soil and water. The brightness temperature is different for different locations based on the emissivity. The emissivity of dry soil is more and so it has a high value of brightness temperature (TB) whereas the emissivity is low for ocean surface and so it has lower values of TB. Coastal areas contain mixture of soil and water and so its microwave temperature lies between the TB values of ocean and land surface. The multi-frequency scanning microwave radiometer (MSMR) was placed onboard IRS-P4 satellite which was launched in May 1999. This radiometer operates at 6.6, 10.65, 18 and 21GHz frequencies with dual polarization. MSMR data contains information about different geophysical parameters. From this large set of database, microwave temperature (TB) values taken at 10.65 GHz with dual polarization are used to identify the land water boundary for the Indian Coast. MSMR data is available for Grid-1, Grid-2 and Grid-3 which correspond to spatial resolution of 150, 75 and 50 Km respectively. In the present study, TB data for Grid-1 is used at frequency 10.65 GHz. From the MSMR data, brightness temperature values for Indian Coast are retrieved using the data retrieval program developed in dasiaCpsila. The program output gives the day, latitude and longitude at which data is retrieved for both vertical and hor- - izontal polarizations. Data has been retrieved for 28 months from June 03, 1999 to September 30, 2001. TB data values obtained are used for demarcation of land-water boundary of Indian Coast. Data values are obtained along the coastline, adjacent land surface and ocean touching the coastline.

From the correlogram matrix the correlation values of all the item pairs are computed and top-k correlated pairs are extracted very easily.

From this categorization, we conducted a user study of the results obtained from three Web SE, and three communities QA. In this way, we found that SE result in a better alternative when the query is designed to get a uni-objective answer, while communities QA provide better results if the question gets multi-objective answers. On the other hand, when the query expects a subjective answer, none of these systems provides a very effective answer that can fulfill the expectations from the user.

In this work, we focus on collections of personal photos and exploit the contextual information naturally implied by the associated GPS and time metadata. First, we employ a constrained clustering method to partition a photo collection into event-based subcollections, considering that the GPS records may be partly missing (a practical issue). We then use conditional random field (CRF) models to exploit the correlation between photos based on 1) time-location constraints and 2) the relationship between collection-level annotation (i.e., events) and image-level annotation (i.e., scenes). With the introduction of such a multilevel annotation hierarchy, our system addresses the problem of annotating consumer photo collections that requires a more hierarchical description of the customers' activities than do the simpler image annotation tasks. The efficacy of the proposed system is validated by extensive evaluation using a sizable geotagged personal photo collection database, which consists of over 100 photo collections and is manually labeled for 12 events and 12 scenes to create ground truth.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2008.2009693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757436","CRF;Consumer photo collections;GPS;scene and event annotation","Clustering methods;Computer vision;Context modeling;Global Positioning System;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Lakes;Layout;Multimedia systems","Global Positioning System;image retrieval;image segmentation;information retrieval systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;random processes","GPS;clustering method;conditional random field model;event-based subcollection;geotagged personal photo collection database;hierarchical event model;image retrieval system;image-level annotation system;ontology method;scene model;time-location constraint","","30","","45","","","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to perform object recognition many researchers have focused on local features as the basis of their proposed methodologies. This work is devoted to the task of learning invariant region descriptor operators with genetic programming. The idea is to find a set of expressions that could be equal or better than the weighted gradient magnitude that is normally applied on the SIFT descriptor. This magnitude corresponds to the operator that we would like to improve through genetic programming (GP). The key for a successful problem statement was achieved with the F-measure. After a bibliographical study we have found a criterion that is simple, reliable, and useful in the estimation of such a metric. The measure that we propose here is based on the harmonic mean which is normally used by the information retrieval community. Experimental results show that the evolved descriptor¿¿s operator can enhance significantly the overall performance of the SIFT descriptor and surpass other state-of-the-art algorithms.","1051-4651;10514651","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2175-6; POD:978-1-4244-2174-9","10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4761178","","Computer vision;Data mining;Genetic programming;Histograms;Image matching;Information retrieval;Machine vision;Object recognition;Principal component analysis;Veins","computer vision;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","SIFT descriptor;computer vision;genetic programming;information retrieval;learning invariant region descriptor operators;object recognition","","1","","12","","","8-11 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ASAR GM mode has delivered the first global multiyear C-band backscatter data set in HH polarization at a spatial resolution of 1 km. This paper investigates if ASAR GM can be used for retrieving soil moisture using a change detection approach over large regions. A method previously developed for the European Remote Sensing (ERS) scatterometer is adapted for use with ASAR GM and tested over Oklahoma, USA. The ASAR-GM-derived relative soil moisture index is compared to 50-km ERS soil moisture data and pointlike <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> measurements from the Oklahoma MESONET. Even though the scale gap from ASAR GM to the <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> measurements is less pronounced than in the case of the ERS scatterometer, the correlation for ASAR against the <i>in</i> <i>situ</i> measurements is, in general, somewhat weaker than for the ERS scatterometer. The analysis suggests that this is mainly due to the much higher noise level of ASAR GM compared to the ERS scatterometer. Therefore, some spatial averaging to 3-10 km is recommended to reduce the noise of the ASAR GM soil moisture images. Nevertheless, the study demonstrates that ASAR GM allows resolving spatial details in the soil moisture patterns not observable in the ERS scatterometer measurements while still retaining the basic capability of the ERS scatterometer to capture temporal trends over large areas.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2004711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4773463","Change detection;ScanSAR;scatterometer;soil moisture;synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","Information retrieval;Moisture measurement;Monitoring;Radar measurements;Satellites;Soil measurements;Soil moisture;Spatial resolution;Surface soil;Synthetic aperture radar","backscatter;data assimilation;geophysical techniques;moisture;remote sensing by radar;soil;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar","ASAR;C-band backscatter data;ENVISAT;ERS scatterometer;European Remote Sensing scatterometer;HH polarization;MESONET;Oklahoma;USA;advanced synthetic aperture radar;change detection;data assimilation;global mode data;radiometer measurement;spatial resolution;surface soil moisture","","73","","83","","","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These peer to peer systems help remove the cost and bandwidth limitations of a centralized group of servers. However, limited upload bandwidth in the current Internet combined with flash crowds limits the quality and smoothness of the streaming videos. In this paper, we present a novel idea to alleviate the problem of flash crowds, i.e. the sudden drastic increase in the number of requests for a video, such as at the video release time. The flash crowd problem causes potential network congestion that in turns increases the rate of video request rejections, thus reducing the video streaming capacity of the P2P systems. Our design supports video pre-release distribution by allowing users to subscribe to a movie series or a video from a schedule of upcoming videos. By using this information, encrypted versions of the video published by the publishers may be automatically retrieved even before the video is officially released. At the video release time, the decryption key of the encrypted video gets distributed to allow the user to decrypt the encrypted video and subsequently watch it. This pre-release video distribution system uses a hybrid peer to peer approach to handle distribution of schedules and decryption keys. We design a GUI and implement a prototype to demonstrate the feasibility and viability of this pre-release P2P distribution system.","2162-1020;21621020","POD:978-1-4244-2680-5","10.1109/ATC.2008.4760559","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760559","","Bandwidth;Costs;Cryptography;Information retrieval;Internet;Motion pictures;Streaming media;Video on demand;Watches;Web server","Internet;peer-to-peer computing;video on demand;video streaming","Internet;P2P video on demand streaming;flash crowd avoidance;network congestion;peer to peer systems;pre-release video distribution system;upload bandwidth;video request rejections","","0","","7","","","6-9 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, probabilistic topic models, which were originally developed for text analysis, have been used for image categorization successfully. Usually, ldquotopicsrdquo which represent contents of an image is detected based on the underlying probabilistic model, then image categorization is carried out using topic distribution as the input feature. Typical method is to use k-nearest neighbor classifier based on L2-distance after topic discovery. In the method, topic distribution is just treated as a feature point. In this paper, we propose a categorization method based on more natural use of the topic distribution, which is derived by using pLSA model. Categorization is carried out by estimating conditional probability p(category|data). We present two types of image categorization tasks, scene classification and document image segmentation, and show the proposed method performs very well. In addition, we also examine the performance of the proposed method under the situation where only the limited number of labeled examples are available. We show our method can perform quite well even in the circumstances.","1051-4651;10514651","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2175-6; POD:978-1-4244-2174-9","10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4761423","","Content based retrieval;Image analysis;Image classification;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Layout;Text analysis;Videos","image classification;image segmentation;probability","classifier;content-based information retrieval;document image segmentation;image categorization;k-nearest neighbor classifier;probabilistic topic model;probabilistic topic models;scene classification;text analysis;visual information","","0","","14","","","8-11 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing semantic annotation methods usually require many labeled training examples before they can effectively operate, and this bottleneck holds back the widely applications of these semantic annotation methods. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised semantic annotation method, self-teaching SVM-struct, which uses fewer labeled examples to improve the annotating performance. The key of the self-teaching method is how to identify the reliably predicted examples for retraining. Two novel confidence measures are developed to estimate prediction confidence.

Instead, users can give any query object (in image format) and the frames containing the object will be retrieved. Given an object image, the method extracts features like color and shape of objects in each frame of the laparoscopic video and compare with the input image feature to retrieve the frames containing the desired instrument.

In this paper, we propose and develop a flexible data schema and a topic-sensitive co-pagerank algorithm for studying this problem. The main idea is measuring the authorspsila authorities with considering topics bias on the basis of their social networks and citation networks, and then, recommending expert candidates for the requests.

A user inputs a keyframe by posing an artistpsilas doll with painted joints in front of a stereo camera rig. The system interactively gives real-time feedback on the results of the joint detection and 3D pose reconstruction as the user is positioning and rotating the doll. The robust 3D joint reconstruction is achieved by integrating 3D joint positions from multiple views of the same pose. After the user has finished inputting all the keyframes, the motion sequences are retrieved from the database and ranked based on their similarities to the keyframes. Experiments show that the presented system is simple to use and has high quality of retrieval results.","1051-4651;10514651","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2175-6; POD:978-1-4244-2174-9","10.1109/ICPR.2008.4761301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4761301","","Animation;Cameras;Databases;Feedback;Humans;Information retrieval;Instruments;Libraries;Real time systems;Robustness","feedback;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;image retrieval;image sensors;image sequences;stereo image processing","3D joint positions;3D pose reconstruction;artist doll;keyframe-based human motion capture data retrieval;motion sequences;real-time feedback;stereo camera rig;wooden doll","","1","","15","","","8-11 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inspired by the success of Wikipedia, Wiki software has become a broadly discussed alternative for corporate metadata management. However, in contrast to the performance and sustainability of Wikis in general, benefits of using semantic Wikis have not been investigated sufficiently.The paper at hand presents results of a controlled experiment that investigates effects of using a semantic Wiki for metadata management in comparison to a classical Wiki. Considering threats to validity, the analysis (i.e. 74 subjects using both a classical and a semantic Wiki) shows that the semantic Wiki is superior to the classical variant regarding information retrieval tasks. At the same time, the results indicate that more effort is needed to build up the semantically annotated Wiki content in the semantic Wiki.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:978-0-7695-3450-3","10.1109/HICSS.2009.428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755668","","Companies;Conference management;Control systems;Dictionaries;Information analysis;Information management;Information retrieval;Planning;Usability;Wikipedia","business data processing;information retrieval;meta data;semantic Web","Wiki software;Wikipedia;corporate metadata management;diversified companies;information retrieval;semantic Wiki","","0","","35","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system is based on existing IETF standardisation efforts and utilises SIP-based messaging protocols in a novel way to improve management and distribution of community context information. The testing results show that our system clearly outperforms the method of individual subscriptions to context information when the number of members in a community increases.

Recently, the number of users who employ search engines for not only retrieving Web pages but also understanding or learning an arbitrary concept has been increasing. It is difficult to understand and learn an arbitrary concept by using most of the current search engines, because they provide a list of results according to the input keywords. The proposed approach represents the various relationships between arbitrary concepts as an outline. For example, it is assumed that a user wants information related to an input keyword. Current search engines represent a list of contents that match the keyword. The proposed approach dynamically represents various related concepts and contents on heterogeneous fields by using multiple views that are mutually synchronized. It helps to obtain various contents related to heterogeneous resources while understanding or learning an arbitrary concept.","1530-1605;15301605","POD:978-0-7695-3450-3","10.1109/HICSS.2009.376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4755487","","Communications technology;Information resources;Information retrieval;Navigation;Search engines;Visualization;Web pages","information retrieval;search engines;semantic Web","SAVVY;Web page retrieval;heterogeneous knowledge resource;search engine;semantic association various viewpoint system;semantic associative browsing system","","0","","22","","","5-8 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Video data of digital contents such as VOD (video on demand), NOD (news on demand), digital library, IPTV (Internet protocol television), and UCC (user created contents) are getting more permeated in various application fields. Video data have sequential characteristic besides providing the spatial and temporal information in its 3D format, making searching or browsing ineffective due to long turnaround time.In this paper, we suggest ATVC (authoring tool for video contents) for solving this issue. ATVC is a video editing tool that detects key frames using visual rhythm and insert metadata such as keywords into key frames via XML tagging. Visual rhythm is applied to map 3D spatial and temporal information to 2D information. Its processing speed is fast because it can get pixel information without IDCT (inverse discrete cosine transform), and it can classify edit-effects such as cut, wipe, and dissolve. Since XML data save key frame information via XML tag and keyword information, it can furnish object-based retrieval or content-based retrieval.","","POD:978-0-7695-3521-0","10.1109/ICCET.2009.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4769660","","Content based retrieval;IPTV;Information retrieval;Information technology;Multimedia communication;Rhythm;Software libraries;User-generated content;Video on demand;XML","IP networks;XML;digital television;discrete cosine transforms;identification technology;meta data;multimedia systems;video on demand","IPTV;Internet protocol television;XML tagging;authoring tool for video contents;communication-multimedia proliferation;content-based retrieval;digital contents authoring tools;digital library;information technology;inverse discrete cosine transform;metadata;news on demand;object-based retrieval;spatial-temporal information;user created contents;video on demand","","0","","19","","","22-24 Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classification results show the proposed feature, which could be used for the first time in such an audio classification, is quite successful in speech/music classification. Experimental comparisons with popular features for audio classification, such as HZCRR and LSTER, are presented and discussed.

We believe that delivering this information in the least intrusive fashion possible will improve their understanding. We have prototyped a system that selects a single Wikipedia article for users when they highlight text in an abstract. This prototype employs a contextual retrieval algorithm developed for high precision retrieval of Wikipedia articles that uses the terms in the abstract, currently being read, as a context for the search. The results from our evaluation reveal that the top-performing algorithm is able to respond with a single relevant article 77% of the time.

However, they all rely only on basic ranking techniques, as TFxIDF, which are comparable to the first generation of Web search engines. In this paper we propose to connect semantically related desktop items by exploiting activity information about accesses to local resources. We investigate and evaluate in detail the possibilities to translate this information into a desktop linkage structure, and we propose several algorithms that exploit these newly created links in order to efficiently rank desktop items. Finally, we show that the ranking results based on the user activity links surpass both TFxIDF ranking scores, as well as the rankings generated using the schema based approaches we devised in our previous work.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3397-1","10.1109/LA-WEB.2008.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4756161","Activity Based Ranking;Desktop Search;User Activity Analysis","Couplings;Hard disks;Indexing;Information management;Information retrieval;Prototypes;Resource description framework;Search engines;Semantic Web;Web search","indexing;information retrieval;meta data;search engines;semantic Web","Web search engine;hard disk;indexing;metadata;personal information management;ranking factor;semantic desktop search;user activity link","","1","","17","","","28-30 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
