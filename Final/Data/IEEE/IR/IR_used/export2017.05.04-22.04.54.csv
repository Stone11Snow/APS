Some systems also endeavour to represent some of the various types of relationships that can exist between documents. However, few systems provide effective mechanisms to help users discover useful information within the set of retrieved documents. In this paper, we present a question-driven approach to delivering retrieved documents in an attempt to organize them in a way that is closer to the user's mental representation of the expected answer. In our proposed approach, retrieved documents are dynamically classified into categories; an appropriate classification scheme is selected by a user on the basis of his own understanding of the information need.

A single case of a water vapor profile retrieval using a combination of the SSM/T-2 on the DMSP satellite and cloud parameters from the AVHRR on the NOAA satellite retrieved a reasonable cloud base. While hardly definitive, this case is suggestive. The authors examine the cloud base signal in a combination of the SSM/1 and SSM/T-2 on the DMSP satellite from a theoretical point of view. It is shown that the signal is strong enough for a useful retrieval only over the ocean. For low altitudes, a cloud top temperature (CTT) constraint, as could be provided from an infrared radiometer, is required. While difficult with the DMSP-NOAA satellite combination, this has become much easier with the recent launch of NOAA-K with the AMSU-B and AVHRR. It is shown that the signal is acceptable over the relevant range of cloud liquid water content values. To achieve useful results, some local tuning of the algorithm will be necessary. This tuning could take the form of water vapor profile covariance matrices, climatological estimates of the cloud liquid water density, or purely empirical methods.

The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques.

The framework is based on a hierarchical probabilistic mixture methodology. Two classes of models emerge from the analysis and these have been termed as symmetric and asymmetric models. For text data specifically, both asymmetric and symmetric models based on the multinomial and binomial distributions are most appropriate. The subsequent visualisation of document collections is achieved by exploiting the topographic relations between similar documents. A latent trait model is developed which provides the means of viewing vector space document representations on a 2D grid and thereby visualising the inherent structure of the document collection.

The cache performance depends on the locality characteristics of the data being processed in a program as well as the underlying architecture. A typical executing program has a data access profile that exhibits both temporal and spatial locality characteristics. Since most processors contain single data caches at a given level and since the single data cache cannot be optimized for purely spatial nor purely temporal locality data accesses, cache space pollution and inefficient usage of cache resources can occur. In the worst case, these phenomena can actually introduce additional data access latency through repeated line fills. An analysis and modeling scheme is presented that describes the runtime data access behavior of several benchmark programs in a typical, unified data cache. The motivation for the development of this model is to produce information that may aid in the design of a split data cache with one side optimized for temporal locality accesses and the other for spatial locality accesses","1526-7539;15267539","POD:0-7695-0728-X","10.1109/MASCOT.2000.876582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=876582","","Cache memory;Computer architecture;Data analysis;Delay;Design optimization;Hardware;Information retrieval;Pollution;Runtime;Scheduling","cache storage;data analysis;memory architecture;storage management;virtual machines","benchmark programs;cache performance;cache resident data locality analysis;cache resources;cache space pollution;data access latencies;data access latency;data access profile;data cache organization;executing program;locality characteristics;modeling scheme;repeated line fills;runtime data access behavior;spatial locality;spatial locality accesses;split data cache;temporal locality accesses;unified data cache","","4","","21","","","2000","29 Aug 2000-01 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The relation between known execution classes is explored, and it is shown that coordinated checkpointing, SZPF (strictly Z-path free) and ZPF (Z-path free) are 1-rollback mechanisms, while ZCF (Z-cycle free) is (n-1)-rollback, where n is the number of participants in an execution. A new class of executions, called d-BC (d-bounded cycles), is introduced, and is shown to be an [(n-1)Â·d]-rollback mechanism (ZCF is a special case of d-BC for d=1). Finally, a d-BC protocol is presented. This protocol has the nice property that it does not impose any control information overhead on an application's messages, yet it only sends a few control messages of its own.

Motion data is captured by a motion capture system which captures the position of sensors on body joints, so we can get motion data as 3-D time series data. Since, motion data is multi-stream data of time series for 17 body parts, the amount of data is huge. Furthermore, motion data is expensive. A motion database can help those creators to produce motion data with less cost. The database, however, requires a content-based retrieval method because it is difficult to identify the motion by using a keyword approach. Consequently we introduce association rules which represent dependency between body parts. Association rules represent the motion of body parts and can be used as visual tags. We introduce a method to discover dependency between body parts as association rules. Association rules consist of symbols uniquely representing basic patterns. We call basic patterns primitive motions. Primitive motions are extracted from motion data by using segmentation and clustering processes.

In order to achieve this density using angular multiplexing it is necessary to store diffraction-limited holograms at an angular density consistent with the Bragg width of the individual holograms over all allowed angles. In the typical storage geometry employing crystals with flat polished faces, access to all angles is not possible due to refraction effects. We report the storage and retrieval of data in a holographic system employing a rotating spherical medium which allows access to all Bragg angles. Phase conjugate readout of the gratings allows diffraction-limited resolution using inexpensive highly-aberrating lenses. The medium in these experiments is the so-called DX crystal CdF/sub 2/:Ga which supports the formation of refractive index gratings through the optical excitation of bistable dopant atoms.","","POD:1-55752-634-6","10.1109/CLEO.2000.906895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=906895","","Atom optics;Crystals;Diffraction gratings;Geometry;Holography;Information retrieval;Lenses;Memory;Optical diffraction;Refractive index","cadmium compounds;gallium;holographic gratings;holographic storage;multiplexing;optical phase conjugation","Bragg angles;CdF/sub 2/:Ga;DX crystal;angle multiplexing;bistable dopant atoms;diffraction-limited holograms;diffraction-limited resolution;highly-aberrating lenses;holographic data storage;holographic memory system;optical excitation;phase conjugate readout;refractive index gratings;rotating spherical medium","","0","","4","","","7-12 May 2000","07 May 2000-12 May 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RAR MTF is estimated by applying empirical MTF estimation methodologies to inter-look cross spectra between various combinations of individual looks and available polarizations for a given radar frequency. The concept behind the nonlinear inversion is that any combination of like- and cross-polarization image spectra should return the same wave spectrum, in agreement with in situ and model wave spectra. This permits estimation of the RAR MTF on a case-by-case basis. The results are compared with theoretical treatments of the RAR MTF, which are shown to be inadequate for the range of conditions encountered in their data set. However, the theory and measurements fit well in describing the polarization dependence of the RAR MTF.

This paper studies the ways that untrained users naturally express and interpret queries, revealing some of the underlying reasons why this task is so difficult. Among the study's findings are: people interpret the word AND to mean either conjunction or disjunction depending on context, the scope to which they attribute the word NOT depends on whether the subsequent operator is AND or OR, and they often ignore parenthesis. Therefore, relying on these words and symbols for query formulation will result in poor usability. A tabular query form is proposed that avoids the need to name the operators, provides a clear distinction between conjunction and disjunction, and makes grouping more explicit. Comparing the tabular language with textual boolean expressions, the study finds that untrained users perform better when they express their queries in the tabular language, and about equally well when interpreting queries written in either language.

Attempts to relate vegetation phenology to community type using AVHRR data have produced mixed results and large classification errors have been attributed to subpixel scale topographic and soil background variations, lack of in-flight calibration, inaccurate reflectance retrieval and poor registration. While these are important factors, anisotropy in surface reflectance as a result of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) also causes severe perturbations in the signal and yet this is rarely accounted for adequately. Recent years have seen a wider acknowledgement of this fundamental aspect of optical remote sensing, although it is usually approached as a problem. The extent of the improvement in community type differentiation may be considerable when a BRDF model is used to separate isotropic and anisotropic components.

The goal of the XBC is to improve on the Trace Cache (TC) hit rate, while providing the same bandwidth. The improved hit rate is achieved by having the XBC a nearly redundant free structure. The basic unit recorded in the XBC is the extended block (XB), which is a multiple-entry single-exit instruction block. A XB is a sequence of instructions ending on a conditional or an indirect branch. Unconditional direct jumps do not end a XB. In order to enable multiple entry points per XB, the XB index is derived from the IP of its ending instruction. Instructions within the XB are recorded in reverse order, enabling easy extension of XBs. The multiple entry-points remove most of the redundancy. Since there is at most one conditional branch per XB, we can fetch up to n XBs per cycle by predicting n branches. The multiple fetch enables the XBC to march the TC bandwidth","","POD:0-7695-0550-3","10.1109/HPCA.2000.824339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=824339","","Bandwidth;Decoding;Degradation;Delay;Identity-based encryption;Information retrieval;Iron;Out of order;Radio access networks;Steady-state","cache storage;instruction sets;redundancy","XBC;eXtended block cache;instruction-supply mechanism;multiple-entry single-exit instruction block;nearly redundant free structure;redundancy;trace cache hit rate","","4","4","14","","","2000","08 Jan 2000-12 Jan 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm uses multispectral surface reflectances and a land cover classification map as input data to retrieve global LAI and FPAR fields. The authors' objectives are to evaluate its performance as a function of spatial resolution and uncertainties in surface reflectances and the land cover map. They analyzed reasons the algorithm can or cannot retrieve a value of LAI/FPAR from the reflectance data and justified the use of more complex algorithms, instead of NDVI-based methods. The algorithm was tested to investigate the effects of vegetation misclassification on LAI/FPAR retrievals. Misclassification between distinct biomes can fatally impact the quality of the retrieval, while the impact of misclassification between spectrally similar biomes is negligible. Comparisons of results from the coarse and fine resolution retrievals show that the algorithm is dependent on the spatial resolution of the data. By evaluating the data density distribution function, they can adjust the algorithm for data resolution and utilize the algorithm with data from other sensors","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.868894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=868894","","Algorithm design and analysis;Information retrieval;Land surface;MODIS;Prototypes;Remote sensing;Satellites;Spatial resolution;Uncertainty;Vegetation mapping","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;remote sensing;vegetation mapping","FPAR;LAI;LANDSAT;LASUR;MODIS;algorithm;biome;classification;fraction of photosynthetically active radiation;geophysical measurement technique;land cover classification map;leaf area index;misclassification;moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer;muiltispectral remote sensing;optical imaging;surface reflectance;vegetation mapping","","67","","36","","","Sep 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The preprocessing checks the existence of the content objects specified in the predicates to eliminate unqualified videos.

We define a hierarchical dissimilarity vector between a parent node and his child, to express a hierarchical relation between them. Then, to describe a relation among child nodes, we compute a covariance matrix of dissimilarity vectors. We associate the covariance matrix with the parent node, and call such a quadtree âhierarchical correlation wavelet treeâ (HCWT). Finally, to make up an index of database, we calculate the texture feature vectors defined by the diagonal of elements of the covariance matrix of HCWT and the texture feature vectors, and use the discriminant analysis to make an effective index from the texture feature vectors.

A novel and fast approach for computing the membership values based on fuzzy c-means algorithm is introduced. The proposed FCH is further exploited in the application of image indexing and retrieval. Experimental results clearly show that FCH yields better retrieval results than CCH.

The bursty nature of compressed video raises challenges in the design of video servers. In this paper, we first present a method for the efficient retrieval of bursty video data from the disk system to the memory of a digital video server. For a single video stream, the proposed retrieval schedule minimizes the buffer requirement for continuous retrieval, given that a fixed disk bandwidth is reserved for the entire duration of retrieval. Secondly, we present an optimal resource-reservation algorithm for multiple video streams based on the proposed retrieval schedule. The resource-reservation algorithm maximizes the number of bursty video streams that ran be supported by a video server given any disk bandwidth and memory resource. Thirdly, we present a progressive display scheme for scalable video that is based on the retrieval schedule and resource-reservation algorithm. Performance evaluations based on simulations using MPEG-2 trace data are presented. For a personal computer with four disks and a memory resource of 120 MB, our approach can support 50%-275% more video streams than previously proposed approaches, depending on the pre-fetch delay that users are willing to tolerate in interactive viewing of videos","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/76.836292","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=836292","","Bandwidth;Bit rate;Computational modeling;Computer displays;Information retrieval;Processor scheduling;Radio access networks;Scheduling algorithm;Streaming media;Video compression","buffer storage;image retrieval;scheduling;video servers","MPEG-2 trace data;buffer requirement;bursty variable bit rate video;bursty video streams;compressed video;digital video compression;disk system;fixed disk bandwidth;interactive viewing;multiple video streams;optimal resource-reservation algorithm;pre-fetch delay;progressive display scheme;resource reservation;resource-reservation algorithm;scalable video;variable bit rate scalable video;video-server retrieval scheduling","","6","","16","","","Apr 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A case-based dialogue system could provide an approach to solve these problems because it can work as an empirical language learner, and can become a better hearer and speaker for the human user as the case database becomes larger during dialogues. The goal of this research is to design an efficient case-base for a dialogue system, which contains dialogues between humans or between a human and a computer.

Different characteristics of AF may be more amenable to treatment, but it is not easy to assess the characteristics of the atrial rhythm from ECG recordings since the atrial complexes are small relative to the ventricular complexes. AF is usually seen on the ECG as apparently irregular deviations of the baseline. Our aim was to develop a technique which would allow researchers to retrieve information about the atrial rhythm non-invasively from body-surface ECGs and to assess the stability of the atrial rhythm. We recorded 300 s of simultaneous 12-lead ECGs at 500 Hz directly to a computer from six patients with AF for subsequent analysis. For stability analysis, we split the 300 s recordings into two sections of 150 s each. These were then subdivided into sections of approximately 10 s, and principal component analysis was performed on each 12-lead section, generating 12 orthogonal data components. A frequency analysis of each component was carried out using a fast Fourier transform algorithm and the average spectrum calculated for each 150 s section. From this the dominant AF frequency was identified from the peak in the spectrum between 5 and 10 Hz. The atrial waveform was most commonly observed in principal components 6, 7 and 8 with mean (SD) frequency 6.8 Hz (0.9 Hz) and range 5.9 Hz to 8.2 Hz across the subjects. The difference between the paired 150 s sections was 0.3 Hz (0.3 Hz), showing that the dominant atrial frequency could be identified consistently and that there was little short term variability","0276-6547;02766547","POD:0-7803-6557-7","10.1109/CIC.2000.898456","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898456","","Atrial fibrillation;Cardiology;Electrocardiography;Frequency;Hospitals;Information retrieval;Physics;Principal component analysis;Rhythm;Stability analysis","electrocardiography;medical signal processing;principal component analysis","300 s;5 to 10 Hz;500 Hz;ECG recordings;atrial complexes;atrial fibrillation;atrial rhythm;average spectrum;baseline irregular deviations;body-surface ECG;common arrhythmia;fast Fourier transform algorithm;frequency analysis;little short term variability;noninvasive method;orthogonal data components;principal component analysis;simultaneous 12-lead ECG;stability analysis;ventricular complexes","","33","5","4","","","2000","24 Sep 2000-27 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RPCL-b-tree is a hierarchical indexing structure built with a hierarchical RPCL clustering implementation, which transforms the feature space into a sequence of nested clusters. Based on the RPCL-b-tree, the efficient Nearest-Neighbor search for a query can be performed with the branch-and-bound algorithm. The index efficiency of a RPCL-b-tree relates to a set of parameters: leaf node size of the tree, number of retrieved objects per search, feature dimensionality and database size. To formulate this relationship, we develop a nonlinear regression model in this paper. This regression model includes two components. One is used to describe the relationship between index efficiency and the number of retrieved objects per search; another is to describe the relationship between index efficiency and leaf node size of a RPCL-b-tree. In both of these two components, we consider the influence from the database size and the feature dimensionality. Our experimental results show that the proposed regression model has a high convergibility and high generalization ability. Moreover, this regression model is explainable on its coefficients, whose values directly reflect the index efficiency of a RPCL-b-tree. Depending on the regression model and its estimated coefficients, we can easily analyze the index efficiency of a RPCL-b-tree to be built. Because the parameters of the different kinds of indexing structures are very similar, this model also is suitable to analyze the other kinds of indexing structures. Thus, it is a powerful tool to construct the optimal RPCL-b-tree or other kinds of indexing structures for a database","1098-7576;10987576","POD:0-7695-0619-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2000.859411","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=859411","","Binary trees;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Deductive databases;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Regression analysis;Spatial databases","statistical analysis;tree searching;unsupervised learning","Nearest-Neighbor search;RPCL-b-tree;Rival Penalized Competitive Learning Binary Tree;branch-and-bound;hierarchical indexing structure;index efficiency;nonlinear regression;regression analysis model","","0","1","7","","","2000","24 Jul 2000-27 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such applications first need an estimate of the available network resources to each of the collaborating servers in order to identify a schedule for retrieving the objects composing the presentation. A collaborating server can suggest modifications to the retrieval schedule depending on its load.

Popular phylogenetic databases such as Tree of Life and TreeBASE do not support flexible querying through query languages for the exploration of their contents. The query facility employed in these databases is usually limited to complex interfaces or is too limited to be useful for many applications. The most striking shortcoming of these systems is that they do not treat phylogenies (trees) as first citizens. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual query language for phylogenetic databases in which trees are recognized as basic units. We also introduce a Web based query interface, based on this language, for querying any tree like structure, either on the Web (e.g. Tree of Life), or in traditional relational databases (e.g. TreeBASE). As an aside, the mapping technique used in our system makes it possible to interoperate between a variety of heterogeneous phylogenetic databases. Finally, we demonstrate that the basic tree manipulation operators proposed in this paper can be used to form unlimited types of tree queries that were not possible in popular phylogenetic databases until now.","","POD:0-7695-1423-5","10.1109/BIBE.2001.974405","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=974405","","Bioinformatics;Computer science;Data analysis;Database languages;Genomics;Information retrieval;Phylogeny;Relational databases;Sequences;Visual databases","biology computing;data visualisation;genetics;information resources;online front-ends;query languages;query processing;relational databases;scientific information systems","Tree of Life;TreeBASE;Web based query interface;mapping technique;phylogenetic database querying;phylogenetic database visualization;relational databases;tree manipulation operators;tree queries;visual query language","","1","1","21","","","4-6 Nov. 2001","04 Nov 2001-06 Nov 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the large number of components, disk arrays are susceptible to disk and node failures that can affect the server reliability. Therefore, fault tolerance must be already addressed in the design of the video server. For fault tolerance, we consider parity-based as well as mirroring-based techniques with various distribution granularities of the redundant data. We identify several reliability schemes and compare them in terms of the server reliability and per stream cost. To compute the server reliability, we use continuous time Markov chains that are evaluated using the SHARPE software package. Our study covers independent disk failures and dependent component failures.

The association rules are discussed within the scope of our WHOWEDA (warehouse of Web data) project. WHOWEDA is supported by a Web data model and a set of algebraic operators. The Web data model allows a uniform and integrated view of Web data gathered using a user's query graph. A user's query graph describes the query by example (what the user perceives as the query) and the Web coupling query gathers instances of such a query graph from the Web and stores them in the form of subgraphs (called Web tuples) in a Web table. We discuss association rules within this domain. An association rule defines an association between the nodes and links attributes of Web tuples within a Web table. There are two different classes of association rules that can be developed from data in a Web table. There are two different classes of association rules that can be developed from data in a Web table. Node-to-node associations are those rules that relate the content (defined by metadata attributes) between two or more nodes within a Web tuple.

This paper investigates the possibility of including an unlabeled data set to make up the insufficiency of labeled data. Different from most current research in image retrieval, the proposed approach tries to cast image retrieval as a transductive learning problem, in which the generalization of an image classifier is only defined on a set of images such as the given image database. Formulating this transductive problem in a probabilistic framework the proposed algorithm, Discriminant EM (D-EM) not only estimates the parameters of a generative model but also finds a linear transformation to relax the assumption of probabilistic structure of data distributions as well as select good features automatically.

In this environment, users carrying their portable computers can retrieve local or remote information anywhere and at anytime. Data broadcast, with its advantages, has become a powerful means to disseminate data in wireless communications. Indexing methods for the broadcast data have been proposed to speedup access time and reduce power consumption. However, the influence of access failures has not been discussed. For the error-prone mobile environment, the occurrence of access failures is often due to disconnections, handoffs, and communication noises. Based on the distributed indexing scheme, we propose an adaptive access method which tolerates the access failures. The basic idea is to use index replication to recover from the access failures. One mechanism, named search range, is provided to dynamically record the range where the desired data item may exist. According to the search range, an unfinished search can be efficiently resumed by finding an available index replicate. A performance analysis is given to show the benefits of the method.
