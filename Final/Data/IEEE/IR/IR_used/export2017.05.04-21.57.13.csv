The two red edge parameters were extracted with four approaches: four-point interpolation, polynomial fitting, Lagrangian technique, and inverted-Gaussian (IG) modeling. Experimental results indicate that the four-point approach is the most practical and suitable method for extracting the two red edge parameters from Hyperion data because only four bands and a simple interpolation computation are needed. The polynomial fitting approach is a direct method and has its practical value if hyperspectral data are available. However, it requires more computation time. The Lagrangian method is applicable only if the first derivative spectra are available; thus, it is not suitable to multispectral remote sensing.

The novel method is based on a multi-dimensional extension of the Rank Reduction Estimator (RARE), originally developed for DOA estimation in partly calibrated arrays. In the K-D RARE algorithm the frequency parameters in the various dimensions are sequentially estimated. The dimensionality of the estimation problem and therefore the computational load of the optimization procedure is successively reduced exploiting the rich multidimensional structure of the estimation problem.

To extract corners from each frame of video sequence in pre-processing stage, proposed multi-scale corner detector is applied. As a user interface, a proposed fast active contour model has been used to specify one object of interest as a query in one of the frames of each video shot. This frame which is in the selected-frame are extracted and tracked forwardly and backwardly through the whole of that shot using proposed multiple-match tracker. The multi-match tracker, which does not make any important assumptions or use any motion models, can retrieve the query in any video sequence even when there is unconstrained and non-smooth motion. By tracking the corners or query object forwardly and backwardly, the positions of similar objects in each video frame are determined. Two methods are considered for demonstrating the query and its similar objects to the user. Experiments have been carried out on a wide range of real video databases. All the results confirm that among the existing techniques, proposed method which exploits image corners is believed to be more generally applicable.","","POD:0-7803-7713-3","10.1109/MMSP.2002.1203287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203287","","Active contours;Content based retrieval;Detectors;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Robustness;Shape;Video sequences","content-based retrieval;edge detection;feature extraction;image retrieval;image sequences;tracking;user interfaces;video databases;video signal processing","CSS corner detector;active contour model;backward tracking;content-based video database retrieval;forward tracking;motion models;multiple hypotheses;multiple match tracker;multiscale corner detector;nonsmooth motion;query object;robust corner tracking;selected-frame;unconstrained motion;user interface;video sequence frame","","1","","8","","","9-11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A feature of skeletal matching is the ability to perform part-matching, and its inherent intuitiveness, which helps in defining the search and in visualizing the results. Also, the matching results, which are presented in a per-node basis can be used for driving a number of registration algorithms, most of which require a good initial guess to perform registration.

The audio tracks are indexed by a Cantonese syllable recognizer. Our investigation indicates that there is a large discrepancy in recognition performance, i.e. dropping from 59% to 39% in syllable accuracy (and corresponding reliability in audio indexing), as we move from anchor speech recorded in the studio to reporter/interview speech recorded in the field. Hence we present several automatic methods to extract anchor/studio speech from the audio tracks for retrieval: (i) extraction based only on video information using a fuzzy c-means algorithm; (ii) extraction based only on audio information using Gaussian mixture models; (iii) a fusion strategy that combines video- and audio-based extraction.

The paper describes an intelligent universal situation awareness (USA) system and in particular discusses a natural language front-end interface that is designed to reduce the impedance mismatch between the human and the machine. The effective translation of natural language semantics is critically dependent on an accelerated capability for learning. Hence, a conversational natural language is mapped onto a set of procedures, which effect directed mining and linking operations on a relational database. These procedures are written in a very high-level extensible language (VHLL), which serves to facilitate knowledge expression and maintenance operations. The VHLL is underpinned by expert compiler technology. Objects for directed mining and linking are invoked as rule consequents in a blackboard architecture. Using information hiding, objects can be visually displayed in the form of a tree to facilitate acquisition and maintenance operations. Finally, projected and restricted database views can be analyzed by a distinct high-level knowledge base to generate natural language reports. Most importantly, these reports provide the analyst with immediate feedback, which serves to catalyze the generation of subsequent queries.","","POD:0-7803-7810-5","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1206612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206612","","Acceleration;Application software;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Joining processes;Knowledge acquisition;Learning systems;Natural languages;Relational databases;USA Councils","blackboard architecture;data mining;decision support systems;fuzzy set theory;high level languages;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;relational databases","VHLL;accelerated learning capability;blackboard architecture;directed mining;expert compiler technology;high-level knowledge base;impedance mismatch;information hiding;intelligent technologies;intelligent universal situational awareness system;knowledge expression;natural language interface;natural language reports;natural language semantics;queries;relational database;terrorist threats detection;very high-level extensible language","","0","","14","","","25-28 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A current trend in telecommunication is the convergence of wireless communication and computer network technologies, and the emergence of wireless application protocol (WAP) devices is an example. Since WAP will also be a common feature found in future mobile communication devices, it is worthwhile to investigate its use in telemedicine. This paper describes the implementation and experiences with a WAP-based telemedicine system for patient-monitoring that has been developed in our laboratory. It utilizes WAP devices as mobile access terminals for general inquiry and patient-monitoring services. Authorized users can browse the patients' general data, monitored blood pressure (BP), and electrocardiogram (ECG) on WAP devices in store-and-forward mode. The applications, written in wireless markup language (WML), WMLScript, and Perl, resided in a content server. A MySQL relational database system was set up to store the BP readings, ECG data, patient records, clinic and hospital information, and doctors' appointments with patients. A wireless ECG subsystem was built for recording ambulatory ECG in an indoor environment and for storing ECG data into the database. For testing, a WAP phone compliant with WAP 1.1 was used at GSM 1800 MHz by circuit-switched data (CSD) to connect to the content server through a WAP gateway, which was provided by a mobile phone service provider in Hong Kong. Data were successfully retrieved from the database and displayed on the WAP phone.

We studied how exposure to serial learning tasks would affect the structure of both sequences of songs and sequences of elements composing such songs. Analyses of singing performed by tutored Nightingales (n=24) revealed two results: Imitations of element sequences reflected a kind of 'gestalt'-learning related to a centered song 'nucleus' where the phonology and syntax of elements appeared stereotyped. Imitations of song sequences, however, reflected a kind of 'list'-learning that was linked to formations of plastic song clusters and a serially flexible retrieval of songs. These findings contrast to language properties, e.g. by suggesting that the freedom of unit combination is high at the level of song sequences, but decreases in top-down direction.","","POD:981-04-7524-1","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1202886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202886","","Biological information theory;Biological system modeling;Birds;Humans;Information retrieval;Performance analysis;Plastics;Sequences;Social factors;Switches","brain models;encoding;neural nets;neurophysiology","Nightingales;bird singing;hierarchical structure;memory;neurophysiology;phonology;serial learning;song sequences","","0","","21","","","18-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The AVI retrieval system achieves excellent retrieval accuracy, substantially higher than that of the key-frame based video indexing (KFVI), a popular benchmark for video retrieval. Furthermore, AVI structure can be integrated to a specialized neural network model to perform automatic relevance feedback retrieval.

Otherwise, they will lead to a poor clustering performance. Unfortunately, it is often hard to determine k* in advance in many practical problems. Under the circumstances, Xu et al. in 1993 proposed an approach named Rival Penalized Competitive Learning (RPCL) algorithm that can perform appropriate clustering without knowing the cluster number by automatically driving extra seed points far away from the input data set. Although RPCL has made great success in many applications, its performance is however very sensitive to the selection of the de-learning rate. To our best knowledge, there is still an open problem to guide this rate selection. We further investigate RPCL by presenting a mechanism to dynamically control the rival-penalizing forces. Consequently, we give out a rival penalized controlled competitive learning (RPCCL) approach, which circumvents the selecting problem of the de-learning rate by always fixing it at the same value as the learning rate. In contrast, the RPCL cannot do that in the same way. The experiments have shown the outstanding performance of this algorithm in comparison with the RPCL.","","POD:981-04-7524-1","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1202214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202214","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Force control;Image analysis;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Silicon carbide","pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","RPCCL;Rival Penalized Competitive Learning algorithm;clustering algorithms;clustering performance;data clustering;exact cluster number;k-means;rival penalization controlled competitive learning;rival penalized controlled competitive learning;rival-penalizing forces;unknown cluster number","","17","","10","","","18-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analyzing relationships between various repeated sections, our method called RefraiD can detect all the chorus sections in a song and estimate both ends of each section.

We propose Gauss mixture vector quantization (GMVQ) as the quantization method for a histogram-based image retrieval to capture the spatial information in the image via the Gaussian covariance structure. Two common histogram distance measures are used to evaluate the similarity of histograms resulting from GMVQ.

Unlike existing methods, ours assumes that the music is used as background music (BGM) and overlapped by another sound such as speech and that the interfering sound is typically louder than the target music. The proposed method is based on time-series active search, which is a quick signal search method reported earlier (Kashino, K. et al., Proc. ICASSP-99, vol.VI, 1999). To realize the BGM search, however, a novel extension is introduced.

Known approaches that use crisp hierarchical semantic networks have been studied and applied to content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to narrow the gap between semantics and image features. Unfortunately, most of the studies lack the flexibility to adapt to an individual's preferences and/or to establish a general-purpose semantic network for sharing the perceptual understanding. In this paper, we propose a semantic query system for diagnostic image database retrieval that uses physician-defined linguistic variables. Users can obtain more desirable retrieval results by creating new, customized semantic terms, and by modeling a suite of membership functions to reflect their preferences. The system brings an increased versatility for image retrieval, and a great amount of possibilities for customizing the semantic terms using customized fuzzy mappings. Our unique approach provides various query methods that use the semantic terms within the domain of HRCT images of the lung and allows individual users to bring the contribution to the common knowledge base.","","POD:0-7803-7810-5","10.1109/FUZZ.2003.1206595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1206595","","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Engines;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging","content-based retrieval;fuzzy set theory;image retrieval;lung;medical image processing;visual databases","CBIR;HRCT lung images;content based image retrieval;crisp hierarchical semantic networks;customized fuzzy mappings;customized fuzzy membership functions;diagnostic medical image database;fuzzy methods;perceptual understanding;physician defined linguistic variables;query methods;semantic query system;semantics modeling","","5","","17","","","25-28 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed scheme, which we refer to as the streaming audio fingerprinting (SAF) system, allows a very efficient database lookup and is also very robust against many different audio processing steps, including low bit rate audio coding, noise addition and amplitude compression. However it is not inherently robust against large linear speed changes (i.e. speed changes larger than 2%) where both the pitch and the tempo change. This is a potential problem, because some radio stations speed up by a few percent. We discuss a modification of the originally proposed fingerprinting algorithm to make it robust against large linear speed changes.

These attributes can describe the relationship between different frequent colors and the image can be transferred to smooth gray level, which can capture the objects in images. Second, we reduce the gray levels of image pixels to lower gray levels to speed up computation. Third, we label each root pixel based on a similarity measurement. We perform a sliding window to move from one block to the next one. The similarity of the two root pixels blocked by the sliding window depends on their neighboring pixels.

We focus on eliciting the 'native' music information strategies employed by people searching for popular music (that is, music sought for recreational or enjoyment purposes rather than to support a 'serious' or scientific exploration of some aspect of music). To this end, we conducted an ethnographic study of the searching/browsing techniques employed by people in the researchers' local communities, as they use two common sources of music: the public library and music stores.

In our experiments, spread spectrum watermarks with additive and multiplicative embedding for MPEG video are used.

These characteristics make the model suitable for image identification applications. Some experiments of image identification are performed, and the results verify that the proposed model accurately represents the image feature, and the image can be correctly identified.

This paper presents a failure model and a revised exception handling framework for mobile agent systems. An exception handler design is presented for mobile agents to survive agent server crash failures. A replica mobile agent operates at the agent server visited prior to its master's current location. If a master crashes its replica is available as a replacement.

Central to our approach is the Kundali data structure that represents the set of data maintained by the peers and drives the smart routing of the search requests (queries).

The log-polar transform converts a given image into a rotation and scale invariant but row-shifted image, which is then passed to the adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet transform to generate adaptively some subbands of rotation and scale invariant wavelet coefficients with respect to an information cost function. An energy signature is computed for each subband of these wavelet coefficients. In order to reduce feature dimensionality, only the most dominant log-polar wavelet energy signatures are selected as feature vector for image retrieval.

Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on","20030605","2002","3","","1504","1508 vol.3","The aim of the experiment was to study the adaptive capacities of children to perform drawing movements while being visually perturbed. Children aged 5 to 11 (N = 47) and a group of adults (N = 10) drew diamonds via information provided through a computer screen. The screen display was either upright or rotated 180°. The absence of direct vision of the hand yielded more perturbation in the youngest group of children compared to all other groups. In spite of some initial difficulty, all children reached good control after 5 trials on the task. When faced with spatial rotations of the visual field, youngsters were again more perturbed than others. All children showed the same rate of adaptation to visual rotations, but they differed on adoptive strategies. Five- and 7-year olds shifted to a feedforward mode of control consisting in the production of a rapid gesture, followed by error evaluation in order to correct their next movement. Older children were characterised by a progressive integration of re-afferent visual and proprioceptive information. This resulted in an increase in duration of strokes and reduced speed, meaning enhanced on-line retrieval of information. However, nine-year-old children experienced more difficulty recuperating sensory information during movement than 11-year olds, and kept using error feedback. Finally, visuo-manual coordination in children aged 11, while only slightly differing from that of adults, was not yet totally mature.","","POD:981-04-7524-1","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1202871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1202871","","Aging;Computer displays;Computer vision;Degradation;Error correction;Face detection;Feedback;Information retrieval;Mirrors;Production","feedback;feedforward;neurophysiology;vision","children;direct vision;feedforward mode;motor coordination;visual feedback;visual field;visual-manual coordination","","0","","15","","","18-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automated semantic annotation and retrieval based on sharable ontology and case-based learning techniques","Von-Wun Soo; Chen-Yu Lee; Chung-Cheng Li; Shu Lei Chen; Ching-chih Chen","Dept. of Comput.

Proceedings.","20030620","2003","","","61","72","Effective information retrieval (IR) using domain knowledge and semantics is one of the major challenges in IR. We propose a framework that can facilitate image retrieval based on a sharable domain ontology and thesaurus. In particular, case-based learning (CBL) using a natural language phrase parser is proposed to convert a natural language query into resource description framework (RDF) format, a semantic-web standard of metadata description that supports machine readable semantic representation. This same parser also is extended to perform semantic annotation on the descriptive metadata of images and convert metadata automatically into the same RDF representation. The retrieval of images then can be conducted by matching the semantic and structural descriptions of the user query with those of the annotated descriptive metadata of images. We tested in our problem domain by retrieving the historical and cultural images taken from Dr. Ching-chih Chen's ""First Emperor of China"" CD-ROM (1991) as part of our productive international digital library collaboration. We have constructed and implemented the domain ontology, a Mandarin Chinese thesaurus, as well as the similarity match and retrieval algorithms in order to test our proposed framework. Our experiments have shown the feasibility and usability of these approaches.","","POD:0-7695-1939-3","10.1109/JCDL.2003.1204844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1204844","","Cultural differences;Image converters;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Natural languages;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Testing;Thesauri","case-based reasoning;digital libraries;grammars;image retrieval;indexing;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;natural languages;semantic networks;string matching;thesauri","CBL technique;IR;Mandarin Chinese thesaurus;RDF format;automated semantic annotation;case-based learning;digital library;domain knowledge;image retrieval;information retrieval;machine readable semantic representation;metadata description;natural language phrase parser;natural language query;resource description framework;semantic-Web standard;sharable domain ontology;structural description matching;thesaurus;user query","","10","2","29","","","27-31 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel melody similarity matching technique, which is based on continuous melody contour. We introduce a contour alignment technique, which addresses the robustness and efficiency issues. We also present a new melody similarity metric, which is performed directly on continuous melody contours of the query data. This approach cleanly separates the alignment and similarity measurement in the retrieval process. Our melody alignment method can reduce the matching candidate to 1.7% with 90% correct alignment rate. The overall retrieval system achieved 88% correct retrieval in the top 20 rank lists.","","POD:0-7803-7713-3","10.1109/MMSP.2002.1203293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203293","","Content based retrieval;Databases;Dynamic programming;Information technology;Laboratories;Music information retrieval;Robustness","audio databases;audio signal processing;music;pattern matching;query formulation","alignment measurement;continuous melody contour;contour alignment technique;humming querying;melody database;melody similarity matching;melody similarity metric;melody slope;query-by-humming;retrieval process;similarity measurement","","0","","13","","","9-11 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a mechanism that also allows the seamless integration of remote databases. To this end, our proposed mechanism splits the existing SRS functionality into two components and adds a third component that enables us to employ peer-to-peer computing techniques to create optimized overlay-networks within which database queries can efficiently be routed. As an additional benefit, this mechanism also reduces the administration effort that would be needed with a conventional approach using replicated databases.","","POD:0-7695-1919-9","10.1109/CCGRID.2003.1199420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1199420","","Bioinformatics;Data analysis;Databases;Genomics;Grid computing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Mirrors;Peer to peer computing;Web server","biology computing;query processing;replicated databases","biological database integration;biological information retrieval;database query;distributed access;overlay-network approach;peer-to-peer computing;replicated database","","0","","10","","","12-15 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The NSF-funded MALACH project aims to provide improved access to large spoken archives by advancing the state-of-the-art in automated speech recognition (ASR), Information Retrieval (IR) and related technologies [1,2] for multiple languages. This paper describes the ASR research for the English speech in the MALACH corpus. The MALACH corpus consists of unconstrained, natural speech filled with disfluencies, heavy accents, age-related coarticulation, uncued speaker and language switching, and emotional speech collected in the form of interviews from over 52000 speakers in 32 languages. In this paper, we describe this new testbed for developing speech recognition algorithms and report on the performance of well-known techniques for building better acoustic models for the speaking styles seen in this corpus. The best English ASR system to date has a word error rate of 43.8% on this corpus.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-7663-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2003.1198756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198756","","Acoustic testing;Automatic speech recognition;Error analysis;History;Humans;Information retrieval;Information technology;Loudspeakers;Natural languages;Speech recognition","natural languages;records management;speech recognition","ASR;English;MALACH project;accents;acoustic models;age-related coarticulation;automated speech recognition;automatic transcription;disfluencies;emotional speech;interviews;large spoken archives;natural speech;speaking styles;word error rate","","4","1","13","","","6-10 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A direct extension as well as an efficient modification of the LSI model applied to numerical data problems are presented and the associated problems and likely remedies discussed. The techniques under investigation are shown to perform competitively with respect to popular existing numerical classification techniques on a range of synthetic and real world benchmark data. In particular, we show that the modified LSI proposed in this work avoids confronting the optimal subspace selection problem yet generalizes well and remains computationally efficient for large data.","","POD:981-04-7524-1","10.1109/ICONIP.2002.1198992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198992","","Data engineering;Data mining;Design engineering;Filtering;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Multidimensional systems;Numerical models;Predictive models","classification;indexing;singular value decomposition","LSI model;SVD;data modeling;information retrieval;numerical data classification;semantic indexing;similarity metric","","0","","15","","","18-22 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most current mobile systems employ a two-tier database structure to store mobile users' information. HLR (Home Location Register) is used to retrieve user's information, and VLR (Visitor Location Register) is the temporal database for storing visitors' profile. In the case that the number of users exceeds the capacity of the VLR due to mobility, database overflow occurs. In this paper, we propose a new policy, the least frequent replacement policy, which selects the least frequently accessed users as replacement candidates. Extensive simulation is carried out for predicting the performance of the existing replacement policies and the proposed least frequent policy. Our simulation results show that the most idle and least frequent policies outperform the inactive and random replacement policies in most cases and that the least frequent policy performs slightly better than the most idle replacement policy.","","POD:0-7695-1921-0","10.1109/ICDCSW.2003.1203655","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1203655","","Computer network management;Computer science;Costs;Distributed databases;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Memory management;Mobile computing;Predictive models;Registers","mobile computing;temporal databases;wireless LAN","home location register;least frequent replacement policy;location management;mobile networking systems;temporal database;two-tier database structure;visitor location register","","0","","6","","","19-22 May 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
