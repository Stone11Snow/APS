The use of languages other than English has been growing exponentially on the Web. Amharic language belongs to one of these languages. Web documents in Amharic language are increasing very fast. The number of Internet users in Ethiopia is growing dramatically. Nevertheless, the major search engines have been lagging behind in providing search features to handle this language. Therefore, a Web search engine that considers the typical characteristics of the Amharic language is needed. In this paper, we present our design and implementation of a search engine system for Amharic language Web documents. The search engine helps users to search Amharic documents of their interest on the Web. This engine allows indexing and searching of Amharic documents written in multiple encoding representations. The crawler, indexer and query engine are the basic components of this search engine that considers the typical characteristics of the Amharic language.","2153-0025;21530025","POD:978-1-4244-3918-8","10.1109/AFRCON.2009.5308133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5308133","Amharic Search Engine;IR in Amharic language;Information Retrieval","Computer science;Crawlers;Encoding;Indexing;Information resources;Information retrieval;Internet;Natural languages;Search engines;Web search","Internet;document handling;information resources;information retrieval;natural language processing;search engines","Amharic Web content;Amharic language;Web documents;information resources;query engine;search engine system;search engines","","0","","17","","","23-25 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several attempts have used negative feedback to solve this challenge; however, there are two issues for using negative relevance feedback to improve the effectiveness of information filtering. The first one is how to select constructive negative samples in order to reduce the space of negative documents. The second issue is how to decide noisy extracted features that should be updated based on the selected negative samples. This paper proposes a pattern mining based approach to select some offenders from the negative documents, where an offender can be used to reduce the side effects of noisy features. It also classifies extracted features (i.e., terms) into three categories: positive specific terms, general terms, and negative specific terms. In this way, multiple revising strategies can be used to update extracted features. An iterative learning algorithm is also proposed to implement this approach on RCV1, and substantial experiments show that the proposed approach achieves encouraging performance.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5284909","Information Filtering;Information Retrieval;text mining","Australia;Conferences;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information filtering;Information filters;Information science;Information technology;Intelligent agent;Negative feedback","","","","0","","26","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Second, it develops an agent called user-agent for managing the user profile. Third, it develops an agent called source-agent for each information source in order to manage its information source (source profile) in parallel. Fourth, it develops an agent called agent-broker for cooperating between user-agent and each source-agent in order to select the best source to the user’s query.

While the space of possible music sound sequences is very large, our method enables the construction of a compact and efficient representation for the song collection using finite-state transducers. This paper gives a novel and substantially faster algorithm for the construction of factor transducers, the key representation of song snippets supporting our music identification technique. The complexity of our algorithm is linear with respect to the size of the suffix automaton constructed. Our experiments further show that it helps speed up the construction of the weighted suffix automaton in our task by a factor of 17 with respect to our previous method using the intermediate steps of determinization and minimization. We show that, using these techniques, a large-scale music identification system can be constructed for a database of over 15 000 songs while achieving an identification accuracy of 99.4% on undistorted test data, and performing robustly in the presence of noise and distortions.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2023170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4926217","Content-based information retrieval;factor automata;finite-state transducers;music identification;suffix automata","","Gaussian processes;acoustic transducers;computational complexity;finite state machines;music;sequences;unsupervised learning","Gaussian mixture model;elementary music sound sequence;factor transducer;large-scale robust music identification system;large-vocabulary speech recognition;song snippet;suffix automaton;unsupervised learning;weighted finite-state transducer","","6","1","25","","20090515","Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As such, our method is more robust as compared to approaches that simply quantize the input vectors into symbols for suffix tree construction.

Consequently, Recommender Systems (RS) which are considered as powerful tools for Information Retrieval (IR), can access these available information efficiently. Unfortunately, the recommendations accuracy is seriously affected by the problems of data sparsity and scalability. Additionally, the time of recommendations is very essential in the Recommender Systems. Therefore, we propose a proficient dimensionality reduction-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) Recommender System. In this technique, the Singular Value Decomposition-free (SVD-free) Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is utilized to obtain a reduced data representation solving the sparsity and scalability limitations. Also, the SVD-free extremely reduce the time and memory usage required for dimensionality reduction employing the partial symmetric Eigenproblem. Moreover, to estimate the optimal number of reduced dimensions which greatly influences the system accuracy, the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is utilized to automatically obtain it. As a result, the proposed technique enormously increases the recommendations prediction quality and speed. In additions, it decreases the memory requirements. To show the efficiency of the proposed technique, we employed it to the MovieLens dataset and the results was very promising.","","POD:978-1-4244-4538-7","10.1109/NLPKE.2009.5313754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313754","Information retrieval;collaborative filtering;dimensionality reduction;latent semantic indexing;particle swarm optimization;recommender system;singular value decomposition","Collaboration;Filtering algorithms;Indexing;Information resources;Information retrieval;Internet;Large scale integration;Particle swarm optimization;Recommender systems;Scalability","Internet;groupware;indexing;information filters;information retrieval;particle swarm optimisation;singular value decomposition","Internet;MovieLens dataset;SVD-free latent semantic indexing;collaborative filtering algorithm;information retrieval;partial symmetric eigenproblem;particle swarm optimization;recommender systems;singular value decomposition","","2","","15","","","24-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among the most important of these are (i) that the definition of responsiveness that governs the search effort can be learned and made explicit through effective interaction with the responding party, (ii) that the governing definition of responsiveness is generally complex, deriving both from considerations of subject-matter relevance and from considerations of litigation strategy, and (iii) that the result of the search effort is a set (rather than a ranked list) of documents, and sometimes a quite large set, that is turned over to the requesting party and that the responding party certifies to be an accurate and complete response to the request. This paper describes the design of an Â¿interactive taskÂ¿ for the text retrieval conference's legal track that had the evaluation of the effectiveness of e-discovery applications at the Â¿responsive reviewÂ¿ task as its goal. Notable features of the 2008 interactive task were high-fidelity human-system task modeling, authority control for the definition of Â¿responsiveness,Â¿ and relatively deep sampling for estimation of type 1 and type 2 errors (expressed as Â¿precisionÂ¿ and Â¿recallÂ¿).

This paper presents a user modelling framework, which integrates a statistic model based upon latent semantic indexing (LSI) and a first-order logic (FOL) type knowledge-based technique, in order to acquire static and dynamic user preferences. Consequently, the framework is able to detect shifts in user interests. The framework is also able to construct a user profile at appropriate levels of granularity and coverage by taking advantage of concept properties, relations and the distance between nodes in users' model of a domain with respect to a common or global domain model.

It is not unconceivable that certain alphabets allow writers to express their individuality of handwriting with a more distinct and unique style compared with other alphabets. This paper establishes that such alphabets have higher discriminative powers in identifying writers.

Information needs such as these are commonplace in legal, patent, medical and intelligence searches. In such applications, high recall with high precision is the primary consideration, and the standard model, which treats human interaction as a kind of post-processing filter, does not yield a system with desired characteristics.

"Term relevance estimation for Chinese query expansion","X. Tu; T. He; J. Luo","Engineering & Research Center For Information, Technology On Education, Huazhong Normal, University. Wuhan, Hubei, China","2009 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","20091106","2009","","","1","7","In this paper we propose a novel method to estimate the relevance between query and candidate expansion terms for Chinese information retrieval. In previous method, expansion terms are usually selected by counting term co-occurrences in the documents. However, term co-occurrences are not always a good indicator for relevance, whereas some are background terms of the whole collection. In order to remove noise, an EM-algorithm is used in our model to estimate two kinds of relevance weight. One is the relevance weight between query and its relevant term extracted from the top-ranked documents in initial retrieval results. The other is the relevance weight between each query term and its relevant terms extracted from the snapshot of Google search result when that query term is used as search keyword. The estimated relevance weights are used to select good expansion terms for second retrieval. The experiments on the two test collections show that our query expansion model is more effective than the standard Rocchio expansion.","","POD:978-1-4244-4538-7","10.1109/NLPKE.2009.5313763","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5313763","information retrieval;query expansion;relevant terms","Computer science;Computer science education;Data mining;Feedback;Information retrieval;Information technology;Performance analysis;Statistical analysis;Testing;Thesauri","natural languages;query processing;relevance feedback;search engines","Chinese information retrieval;Chinese query expansion;EM algorithm;Google search result snapshot;candidate expansion term;search keyword;term relevance estimation;top-ranked document","","0","","22","","","24-27 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, reported approaches mainly suffer from low identification accuracy and poor robustness over different concepts. One of the main reason is that the existing approaches typically isolate the video signature generation from the process of classifier training. Also, very few approaches consider effects of multiple video features. The paper describes a novel approach fusing different information from diverse knowledge sources to facilitate effective video concept detection. The system is designed based on CM*F scheme and its basic architecture contains two core components including 1) CM*F based video signature generation scheme and 2) CM*F based video concept detector. To evaluate the approach proposed, an extensive experimental study on two large video databases has been carried out.

Despite not achieving very high-precision drum loop transcription, the extracted drum loop pattern characterizes the salient rhythm structure of the music, and can be very useful for categorization or similarity matching of music.

An improved loss function is proposed based on the transitivity, which reduces the complexity greatly.

The business community has developed techniques that can generate traffic to websites; however, little work has been done to develop models that assess the performance of web servers resulting from Internet marketing campaigns. From a computer performance standpoint, one challenging aspect of Internet marketing campaigns is they can instantaneously place high demands on the server(s). For example, many campaigns utilize PPC (Pay-Per-Click) engines to market their products, which can generate heavy loads to their server in minutes. Thus, it's important for system administrators, web hosting services, providers, etc., to plan appropriately for increased traffic volumes during these campaigns since it's well known that user-perceived system performance is often a critical factor determining whether or not customers continue with their online business transaction. In this paper, we develop analytic models that can be used to measure and model the performance impact Internet marketing campaigns on web servers. Our experimental results show that our models work best for highly targeted marketing campaigns; however, the formulations presented can be generalized. We demonstrate our models can be used estimate the traffic to a web site due to SEO and PPC campaigns and show how these models can be used to address web server capacity planning issues.","","POD:978-1-4244-4901-9","10.1109/IDAACS.2009.5342919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342919","Computer Performance;Information Retrieval;Internet Marketing;Queueing Theory","Advertising;Capacity planning;Computer performance;Conferences;Predictive models;Search engines;Traffic control;USA Councils;Web and internet services;Web server","Internet;Web sites;marketing;search engines","Internet marketing campaigns;Pay-Per-Click engines;Web servers;Web sites;online business transaction;user-perceived system performance","","0","","12","","","21-23 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since query data is very diverse and sparse, it is still challenging to measure the similarity of each query pair. We propose a novel algorithm called QueryTrans, which can efficiently compute pairwise similarity scores between all queries with respect to the global structure of a query trace graph mined from search engine logs. Compared with previous query suggestion approaches, QueryTrans is robust for different queries and stable for different parameter settings. We also present the performance of QueryTrans on large scale query logs. Experiments on about 100,000 queries show: QueryTrans can efficiently computes almost 10 billion pairwise similarity scores within 15 minutes on a single computer; and its results are significantly better than all 4 recent approaches on query suggestion.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286067","information retrieval;query suggestion;search engine;text mining","Artificial intelligence;Computers;Conferences;Equations;Intelligent agent;Iterative algorithms;Large-scale systems;Robustness;Search engines;Uniform resource locators","","","","0","","10","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

In terms of mean average precision, results for Basque-English cross-lingual retrieval show that structured queries are the best approach both with long queries and short queries.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:978-0-7695-3763-4","10.1109/DEXA.2009.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5337087","Crosslingual information retrieval;co-occurrence statistics;structured query translation","Algorithm design and analysis;Context;Databases;Dictionaries;Expert systems;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Research and development;Statistics","language translation;natural language processing;query processing","Basque-English cross-lingual retrieval;cross-language information retrieval;mean average precision;out-of-vocabulary terms;structured queries;target co-occurrence based selection;translation selection","","1","","17","","","Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However with the introduction of Blog track in TREC 2006, a considerable improvement has been seen in this field at document level. But now it is the time when researchers are thinking to shift their orientation from opinion finding at document level to opinion finding at sentence or passage level. In this paper, we investigate the challenges the researchers might face with sentence-level opinion detection and have tried to demonstrate them with few examples. Our work also includes annotation of a small set of opinionated sentences by two annotators. These Annotators annotate the sentences by labels Positive or Negative. The results of annotation prove that task of opinion detection on sentence-level is more challenging task than opinion detection on document level. In addition, we also discuss the importance of sentence-level opinion detection.

"An Experimental Analysis of Suggestions in Collaborative Tagging","D. Bollen; H. Halpin","","2009 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology","20091013","2009","1","","108","115","Most tagging systems support the user in the tag selection process by providing tag suggestions, or recommendations, based on a popularity measurement of tags other users provided when tagging the same resource, like a web-page. In this paper we investigate the influence of tag suggestions on the emergence of power-law distributions as a result of collaborative tag behavior. Although previous research has already shown that power-laws emerge in tagging systems, the cause of why power-law distributions emerge is not understood empirically. The majority of theories and mathematical models of tagging found in the literature assume that the emergence of power-laws in tagging systems is mainly driven by the imitation behavior of users when observing tag suggestions provided by the user interface of the tagging system. This imitation behavior leads to a feedback loop in which some tags are reinforced and get more popular which is also known as the `rich get richer' or a preferential attachment model. We present experimental results that show that the power-law distribution forms when tag suggestions are not presented to the users, and the power-law distribution does not hold when there are tag suggestions presented to the user. Furthermore, we show that the real effect of tag suggestions is rather subtle; the power-law distribution that would naturally occur without tag suggestions is `compressed' if tag suggestions are given to the user, resulting in a shorter long tail and a `compressed' top of the power-law distribution. The consequences of this experiment show that tag suggestions by themselves do not account for the formation of power-law distributions in tagging systems.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286089","Distributed information systems;Information retrieval;User interfaces","Collaborative work;Conferences;Industrial engineering;Informatics;Intelligent agent;International collaboration;Probability distribution;Tagging;Technological innovation;User interfaces","","","","3","","15","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

This paper uses a collection of six programming assignments with guaranteed relative timestamps from 272 students to examine evolution of coding style. We find that the problem domain of the software developed has a large affect on the ability to attribute authorship, and that coding style does change over time regardless of the requirements that are coded. The outcomes suggest that it takes at least three programming tasks for coding style to settle, and that at least one piece of code in the same problem domain as the code to classify is necessary for accurate authorship attribution. In the final part of the paper we analyze low level code features to discover simple features that appear immune to evolution of coding style, and use them to improve effectiveness of our system from 79% to 82% (p < 0.01, z-test).","0730-3157;07303157","POD:978-0-7695-3726-9","10.1109/COMPSAC.2009.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5254209","Adversarial Information Retrieval;Authorship Attribution;Coding Style Evolution","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Computer applications;Information retrieval;Law;Phase detection;Plagiarism;Robustness;Software maintenance;Writing","programming","adversarial information retrieval;authorship attribution;coding style;programming assignment;programming task;software forensics;source code","","0","","18","","","20-24 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As solution to these problems we extend our work in another of our papers by introducing a new measure to handle heterogeneous textual and numerical data type for co-incident meaning extraction. Firstly, to in order accommodate the heterogeneous data types we propose a new weight called Bin Frequency - Inverse Document Bin Frequency (BF-IDBF) for effective heterogeneous data pre-processing and classification by unified vectorization. Secondly in order to handle the unfamiliar data structure, we use the unsupervised algorithm Self-Organizing Map.

This paper presents a method for music genre classification based solely on the audio contents of the signal. The method relies on a language modeling approach and takes in account the temporal information of the music signals for genre classification. First, the music data is transformed into a sequence of symbols, and a model is derived for each genre by estimating n-grams from the training data. As a term o comparison, HMMs models for each musical genre were also implemented. Tests on different audio sets show that the proposed approach performs very well, and outperforms HMMs based methods.","","POD:978-0-7695-3693-4","10.1109/MMEDIA.2009.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5206888","Clustering;Data Mining;Language Modeling;Music Information Retrieval","Databases;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Performance evaluation;Statistics;Telecommunications;Testing;Training data","audio databases;audio signal processing;classification;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;music","HMM models;audio signal contents;automatic music genre classification;hierarchical clustering;language model approach;music databases;music information retrieval community;music signals","","4","","14","","","20-25 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Offline processor is an offline ranker used to automatically extract definitive <query, page>pairs which will be seen as descriptions for corresponding pages and then given higher weights in online process to insure a better search result. <anchor text, destination page> pairs are used as candidate definitive pairs, because anchor texts can be seen as latent queries and can reply future issued queries.

We present details of our UM-approach and its four main components: (i) use case (ii) scope (iii) nuance and (iv) linguistic variability. We illustrate how these components provide a framework with which a user and a proxy co-construct a shared representation of information needs and mutual knowledge.

Different version Web feature service has different schema and different version WFS service support different data formats, all these result in problems for interoperability among web feature service with different versions. Such as user only request some versions WFS service specified by WFS server, when WFS server find the request service version is not supported by it may cease communicating with user. In order to enable multi-version Web feature service requests in a uniform interface, the paper design a service retrieve plug-and-play middleware to match different version schemas dynamically and automatically transform the XML result document into a form that meet the requirement of user request, ultimately to achieve WFS service request independence of service version. At end the whole system's schema matching quality and information retrieval efficiency have been tested successfully in GeoServer WFS services, the tested results show the feasibility of the designed approach.","2161-024X;2161024X","POD:978-1-4244-4562-2","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5293133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293133","OGC;Web feature service;information retrieval;interoperability;plug-and-play middleware;schema match","Data engineering;Geographic Information Systems;Helium;Information retrieval;Java;Laboratories;Middleware;Standards development;System testing;XML","Web services;XML;geographic information systems;middleware","GIS data;GeoServer WFS services;Open Geospatial Consortium;WFS1.0;WFS1.1;XML;dynamic schema matching approach;geospatial data interoperability;multi-version Web feature service retrieve;plug-and-play middleware","","0","","16","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes automatic analysis methods to extract potentially relevant visual structures from a set of candidate visualizations. Based on features, the visualizations are ranked in accordance with a specified user task. The user is provided with a manageable number of potentially useful candidate visualizations, which can be used as a starting point for interactive data analysis. This can effectively ease the task of finding truly useful visualizations and potentially speed up the data exploration task.

Our approach assumes that the Web service interfaces are defined with Web service description language (WSDL) and the algorithm combines the analysis of their structures and the analysis of the terms used inside them. The higher the similarity, the less are the differences among their interfaces. As a consequence, Urbe is useful when we need to find a Web service suitable to replace an existing one that fails. Especially in autonomic systems, this situation is very common since we need to ensure the self-management, the self-configuration, the self-optimization, the self-healing, and the self-protection of the application that is based on the failed Web service. A semantic-oriented variant of the approach is also proposed, where we take advantage of annotations semantically enriching WSDL specifications. Semantic Annotation for WSDL (SAWSDL) is adopted as a language to annotate a WSDL description. The Urbe approach has been implemented in a prototype that extends a universal description, discovery and integration (UDDI) compliant Web service registry.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760142","WSDL/SAWSDL;Web-based services;information search and retrieval;similarity.","","Web services;formal specification;information retrieval;user interfaces","SAWSDL;UDDI registry by example;URBE;Urbe;WSDL specifications;Web service description language;Web service interfaces;Web service retrieval;semantic annotation;semantic-oriented variant;similarity evaluation","","105","","51","","20090123","Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A query log of a search engine contains rich information on issued queries and their corresponding clicked Web pages. The clicked data implies its relevance to the query and can be used to define the topical context. However, the log is usually not completely available due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we derive clicked pages from clicked domains and use the surrounding query context to enhance retrieval performance. One strategy is to promote clicked pages directly in the initial retrieval result. Another strategy is to expand the original query using selected terms from the clicked pages. Our experimental results on the TREC GOV2 data and a query log of a major search engine show that both strategies can boost retrieval performance compared to the standard language model and pseudo relevance feedback (PRF) model. Their good performance on early precision allows us to apply PRF further for even more accurate result that is comparable to the performance of true relevance feedback.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:978-0-7695-3763-4","10.1109/DEXA.2009.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5337090","Language Models;Parsimonious Language Models;Pseudo Relevance Feedback;Query Expansion;Web Information Retrieval","Context modeling;Data mining;Degradation;Feedback;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Privacy;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","Internet;query formulation;relevance feedback;search engines","TREC GOV2 data;ad-hoc Web page retrieval;clicked Web pages;clicked domain names;pseudo relevance feedback model;query log;search context;search engine;standard language model;user information","","0","","19","","","Aug. 31 2009-Sept. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the artificial intelligence era, construction of stories by the system has the significant role in natural language process. Constructing the stories automatically by the system is significant in the artificial intelligence era. Most of the story generation models have concentrated on syntactic level rather than semantics. Syntactically constructed story may lose their interestingness. To provide the semantics for the constructed story, ontology has significant role.

Specifically, we use the self-organizing-map algorithm in conjunction with a user-adaptable combination of graph features for clustering of graphs. It offers insight into the overall structure of the data set. The clustering output is presented in a grid containing clusters of the connected components of the input graph. Interactive feature selection and task-tailored data views allow the exploration of the whole graph space. The system provides also tools for assessment and display of cluster quality.

The bit-split technique is used to reduce the RAM size, and the byte-parallel technique is used to boost the throughput of the architecture. By the particular design and comprehensive experiments with 100 MHz RAM chips, one piece of the architecture can achieve a throughput of up to 1.6 Gbps by 2-byte-parallel input, and we can further boost the throughput by using multiple parallel architectures.","","POD:978-1-4244-5218-7","10.1109/CYBERC.2009.5342207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342207","finite state machine;information retrieval;parallel hardware architecture;string matching","Algorithm design and analysis;Automata;Computer architecture;Hardware;Logic design;Parallel architectures;Random access memory;Read-write memory;Reduced instruction set computing;Throughput","finite state machines;microprocessor chips;parallel architectures;random-access storage;string matching","Aho-Corasick algorithm;RAM chip;RAM size;bit-split byte-parallel string matching architecture;finite state machine;frequency 100 MHz;logic element;parallel architecture;random-access memory","","1","","9","","","10-11 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This information is provided through a variety of media, including machine- and human-generated text, images, video, and files that combine different media (such as briefings that contain text and graphics). However, few efforts aim to provide human-generated, multimedia content in machine-generated text environments that are currently under development.

The domain ontology is used to represent the learning materials. In this context, the ontology is composed by a hierarchy of concepts and sub-concepts. Whereas, the learner’s ontology model represents a subset of the domain ontology, and the cluster-based recommendations are added as additional semantic recommendations to the model. Combining the content-based with the rule-based provides the user with hybrid recommendations. All of them influenced the re-ranking of the retrieved documents with different weights.

This process is often called ldquoconnecting the dots.rdquo When analysts interactively explore complex datasets over multiple sessions, they may uncover a large number of findings. As a result, it is often difficult for them to recall the past insights, views and concepts that are most relevant to their current line of inquiry. This challenge is even more difficult during collaborative analysis tasks where they need to find connections between their own discoveries and insights found by others. In this paper, we describe a context-based retrieval algorithm to identify notes, views and concepts from users' past analyses that are most relevant to a view or a note based on their line of inquiry. We then describe a related notes recommendation feature that surfaces the most relevant items to the user as they work based on this algorithm. We have implemented this recommendation feature in HARVEST, a Web based visual analytic system. We evaluate the related notes recommendation feature of HARVEST through a case study and discuss the implications of our approach.","","POD:978-1-4244-5283-5","10.1109/VAST.2009.5333023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333023","H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]—Retrieval models","Algorithm design and analysis;Collaboration;Context modeling;Data visualization;Heuristic algorithms;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Tag clouds;Visual analytics","information filtering;information retrieval","Harvest system;Web based visual analytic system;collaborative analysis task;connecting-the-dots process;context based retrieval algorithm;datasets exploration;recommendation feature;visual analysis","","10","1","20","","","12-13 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By analyzing hundreds of credible reviews from website, a 7 keywords mood model is constructed. 217 songs were collected in our dataset. Every song was divided into several 10s-long segments and our dataset containing 5929 music clips. We used Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as classifier and four feature selection algorithms to do mood classification experiments. A post-processing method was presented to find the strongest mood expression of each song. From the experiment result, we can see that SVM is the best classifier for mood classification, and Active Selection algorithm can remove weak features effectively. Using SVM classifier, the classification accuracy can achieves 83.33% with 40 features by using active selection algorithm, and 85.42% with 84 features which selected by ReliefF.","","POD:978-1-4244-5209-5","10.1109/NCM.2009.311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5331338","feature selection;mood detection;music information retrieval;music mood classification;music mood taxonomy","Computer vision;Data analysis;Databases;Feature extraction;Mood;Music information retrieval;Stress;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Taxonomy","information retrieval;music;pattern classification;support vector machines","Gaussian mixture model;Web site;active selection algorithm;classifier;emotional expression;feature selection algorithms;large music database;mood information;music retrieval;songs;support vector machine","","1","","20","","","25-27 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some geographic information websites ignore the social network building mechanism, while some social network sites with geographic features make little use of geographic information except for display. As a result, we propose a geo-social network service for individuals building and managing social network online. Users can define geographic information, such as location, with a place name and a corresponding coordinate-based object, which can be called a geo-Tag. The system can help users find appropriate persons to make friends with, according to the similarity among geo-Tags from different users. Furthermore, information from World Wide Web related to a geo-Tag can be provided to each user with the help of geographic information retrieval techniques.","2161-024X;2161024X","POD:978-1-4244-4562-2","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5293492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293492","geo-social network services;geographic information retrieval;social network services;spatial cognition","","Internet;geographic information systems;information retrieval;social networking (online)","Web sites;World Wide Web;geo-social network services;geographic information systems;information retrieval","","2","2","14","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
