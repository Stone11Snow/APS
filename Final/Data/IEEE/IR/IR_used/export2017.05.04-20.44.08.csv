Using automated systems such as search engines help users cope with the size of the Web. However the results produced by these systems usually contain documents from a large variety of topics with little or no relevance to the end user. In this work, we propose a model that can be used by a Web spider to selectively explore the Web for relevant documents. In this model, two criteria are used for assessing document relevance; content and structure. These two criteria are integrated in a fuzzy predicate that indicates the degree of relevance of a document with respect to a user-defined topic. The parameters of the proposed model are generated by a genetic algorithm that solves a bi-criteria optimization problem.","","POD:978-0-7695-3320-9","10.1109/CERMA.2008.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4641067","Evolutionary Algorithms;Information Retrieval;MCDA;Web Spider","Automotive engineering;Databases;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Informatics;Information retrieval;Mechanical variables measurement;Robots;Search engines;Web pages","Internet;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;information retrieval;search engines","bi-criteria optimization problem;document relevance measurement;evolutionary model;focused Web spider;fuzzy predicate;genetic algorithm;search engines;user-defined topic","","0","","17","","","Sept. 30 2008-Oct. 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivated by the 'bag of words' approach in text mining and more recently in image categorization, we represent each trajectory as a collection of segments, each assigned a membership to a codeword of a dictionary. The trajectory segments are represented by their shape and motion information while the inter-segment relationship is ignored. In the 'bag of trajectory segments' representation, the trajectories are transformed to a vector in the codeword space. The codebook is generated by clustering a large amount of trajectory segments using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and each codeword is a weighted regression model. Given the codebook, trajectories are segmented and associated with a soft-frequency vector in codeword space as an intermediate representation. With the 'bag of segments' representation, trajectory analysis can be carried out in vector space as traditional data. Experiments show the 'bag of segments' method is very effective in trajectory similarity search and classification.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:978-1-4244-1765-0","10.1109/ICIP.2008.4711865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4711865","Information retrieval;Motion analysis;Pattern classification","Clustering algorithms;Dictionaries;Image motion analysis;Image segmentation;Machine learning algorithms;Motion analysis;Shape;Space technology;Text mining;Trajectory","expectation-maximisation algorithm;image classification;image motion analysis;image representation;regression analysis","bag of segments approach;bag of trajectory segments representation;codebook;codeword space;expectation maximization algorithm;image categorization;motion information;motion trajectory analysis;shape information;soft-frequency vector;weighted regression model","","0","","7","","","12-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper first presents a series of experiments carried out with two state-of-the-art methods for cover song identification. We have studied several components of these (such as chroma resolution and similarity, transposition, beat tracking or dynamic time warping constraints), in order to discover which characteristics would be desirable for a competitive cover song identifier.

Modern Standard Arabic, which is used in formal writings, is the ancient Arabic language incorporated with loanwords derived from foreign languages. Different synonyms and loanwords tend to be used in different writings. Indeed, the Arabic composition style tends to vary throughout the Arab countries (Abdelali, 2004). Relevant documents could be overlooked when the query terms are synonyms or related to the ones used in the document collection. This could deteriorate the performance of a cross lingual information retrieval (CLIR) system. Query expansion (QE) using the document collection is the usual approach taken to enrich translated queries with context related terms. In this study, QE is explored for an English-Arabic CLIR system in which English queries are used to search Arabic documents. A thesaurus-based disambiguation approach is applied to further optimize the effectiveness of that technique.

The task of competitor mining that we address in the paper includes mining all the information such as competitors, competing fields and competitors' strength. A novel algorithm called CoMiner is proposed, which tries to conduct a Web-scale mining in a domain-independent manner. The CoMiner algorithm consists of three parts: 1) given an input entity, extracting a set of comparative candidates and then ranking them according to comparability; 2) extracting the fields in which the given entity and its competitors play against each other; 3) identifying and summarizing the competitive evidence that details the competitors' strength. As for evaluation, a prototype system implementing the CoMiner algorithm is presented. An evaluation data set consisting of 70 entities is constructed. 728 competitors and 3,640 competitive fields with 6,381 competitive evidences are discovered with the prototype. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is highly effective.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4522551","Content Analysis and Indexing;Information Search and Retrieval;Performance evaluation","","Internet;data mining","CoMiner algorithm;Web-scale mining;competitor mining;information retrieval;information search","","20","","28","","20080516","Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mobile agents crawl the network to find images matching a given example query. The images retrieved are shown to the user who labels them, following the classical relevant feedback scheme. The labels are used both to improve the similarity measure used for the retrieval and to learn paths leading to sites containing relevant images.

Different entities of society are seeking varied information on a day to day basis. In every walk of life decision makers are taking decisions after careful analysis of relevant information. Hence quality of decisions eventually depends upon quality of information. With the advent of Internet technology the population of online information seekers is growing beyond any stretch of imagination. However information which is retrieved from World Wide Web suffers from few drawbacks. One of the major draw backs about which there is a universal concern that is information retrieved is not the same as information perceived. We commonly comes across pages that are not of interest while searching the Web. This is partly due to a word or words in the search query having different contexts, the user obviously expecting to find pages related to the context of interest. This research paper attempts to investigate the usefulness of Web page clustering algorithms to overcome the drawback of mismatching between information desired and information retrieved. This paper also proposes a method to disambiguate contexts in Web search results.","","POD:978-0-7695-3308-7","10.1109/ICCSIT.2008.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624981","Information Retrieval;Search Engines;Web mining;Web search problem;World Wide Web","Clustering algorithms;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Internet;Knowledge engineering;Search engines;Web mining;Web pages;Web search;Web sites","Internet;information analysis;information retrieval;search engines","Internet;Web page clustering;Web searching;World Wide Web;context disambiguation;information perceived;information retrieval;online information seeker;search query","","0","1","18","","","Aug. 29 2008-Sept. 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An empirical study focuses on two characteristics: gender and ethnic appearance. However, the approach is generally applicable to any characteristic of a categorical nature. Language models are transparent in that they allow us to firstly indicate which actions lead to a particular profile and secondly afford identification of those features of criminal behaviour associated with a group of offenders sharing a common characteristic.","","POD:978-0-7695-3243-1","10.1109/ICCSA.2008.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561260","Information Retrieval;Language Modelling;Offender Profling","Automation;Character generation;Computer crime;Costs;Data mining;Fires;Humans;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Psychology","behavioural sciences computing;linguistics;police data processing","categorical nature;language modelling;offender profiling;police archives","","0","","11","","","June 30 2008-July 3 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, it is beneficial to minimize the number of labeled instances. In this paper, we bring the idea of active learning into ranking problem, and propose a new active ranking approach for document retrieval, referred to as Active RSVM. Specifically, we present an uncertainty- based query function to estimate the uncertainty of each instance, decide which instances can provide more information for the ranker and reduce the labeling cost.

This, for example, renders the A""-NN approach to classification rather slow in large databases. Our novel idea is to predict closeness between elements according to how they order their distances toward a distinguished set of anchor objects. Each element in the space sorts the anchor objects from closest to farthest to it and the similarity between orders turns out to be an excellent predictor of the closeness between the corresponding elements. We present extensive experiments comparing our method against state-of-the-art exact and approximate techniques, both in synthetic and real, metric and nonmetric databases, measuring both CPU time and distance computations.

Since margins are introduced into the training process, our approach can achieve nearly or even ranking results of the maximal margin based ranking approaches. In the meanwhile, as an online ranking algorithm, our approach is much more efficient than them. Moreover, there are degrees of freedom to set the margins in our approach, which can make the training process of our approach focused on instances from particular ranks. That is an especially favorable property in real-word applications, such as information retrieval where the errors made on relevant documents are much more serious than the errors on irrelevant documents.

Musical beat tracking using traditional Kalman filtering is however not reliable in the presence of tempo fluctuations and expressive timing deviations. To address this problem, we adopt data association techniques to assign probability masses to all possible beat interpretations, and then locate the true beat according to the weighting. Two methods are proposed. The first one (PDA-I) weighs the distance between the candidate observation and the predicted beat location while the second method (PDA-II) considers not only the distance but also the onset intensity in weight selection.

To facilitate the location of service(s) already implemented in the systems, a helpful step is to locate components that realize the required functionality. In this paper, a static and semi-automatic approach to locating components realizing service is proposed. The approach consists of three steps: retrieval of links between a service and the components in the source code, filtering of links using static structural analysis and finally categorizing them as functional and technical components. The results of the approach applied to two open source systems are presented. The results indicate that the approach is quite effective in identifying the links between the service descriptions and source code components and categorizing them into functional and technical components.","","POD:978-0-7695-3283-7","10.1109/SCC.2008.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4578457","information retrieval;service components","Availability;Costs;Filtering;Filters;Information retrieval;Inventory management;Laboratories;Packaging;Reverse engineering;Service oriented architecture","public domain software;software architecture","component location;open source systems;service based operations;service oriented architecture;service realization;source code components;static structural analysis","","2","","12","","","7-11 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, the greater the search time and cost required in order to increase target discovery probability, the lower the user utility becomes.

Establishing the correlations among the occurrences of solar activities and solar features is a long-standing problem in solar imaging. This work is an attempt to shed more light on the driving forces behind the initiations of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). This is still a big mystery in this field and in this work we have analysed years of data relating to one particular feature, filaments, to determine if an association between filaments and the eruptions of CMEs can be drawn.

The mood of a song is expressed by means of musical features but a relevant part also seems to be conveyed by the lyrics. We evaluate each factor independently and explore the possibility to combine both, using natural language processing and music information retrieval techniques. We show that standard distance-based methods and latent semantic analysis are able to classify the lyrics significantly better than random, but the performance is still quite inferior to that of audio-based techniques. We then introduce a method based on differences between language models that gives performances closer to audio-based classifiers. Moreover, integrating this in a multimodal system (audio+text) allows an improvement in the overall performance. We demonstrate that lyrics and audio information are complementary, and can be combined to improve a classification system.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725050","audio;classification;hybrid;lyrics;mood;multimodal;music information retrieval","Acoustic signal detection;Information resources;Machine learning;Mood;Music information retrieval;Natural language processing;Performance analysis;Psychology;Recommender systems;Spatial databases","audio signal processing;music;signal classification","audio information;audio-based classifier;distance-based method;latent semantic analysis;lyrics information;multimodal music mood classification system;musical feature","","23","2","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our previous research results show that all these features only lead to classifiers which successfully identify music instruments in monophonic music (only one instrument playing at a time). Their confidence for polyphonic music is much lower. This brought the need for blind sound source separation algorithms. In this paper, we present a new spectrum clustering enhanced method which improves the estimation of fundamental frequency as well as the balance of the categorization tree of training datasets, and therefore enhances the precision of automatic indexing. The system is recursively detecting the pitch of the predominant sound source, then calculates the features based on the estimated pitch, and then predicts the most similar spectrum by the corresponding classification tree, and finally subtracts the estimated predominant spectrum until silence is detected.","2375-9232;23759232","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3503-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2008.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4733950","Automatic Indexing;Blind Sound Source Separation;Clustering;Music Information Retrieval;Sound Features","Audio databases;Frequency estimation;Instruments;MPEG 7 Standard;Machine assisted indexing;Music;Recursive estimation;Spatial databases;Speech recognition;Standards development","audio coding;audio databases;blind source separation;database indexing;frequency estimation;learning (artificial intelligence);music;pattern clustering;signal classification;spectral analysis;speech recognition;tree data structures","audio feature;automatic music indexing;blind sound source separation algorithm;dataset training;fundamental frequency estimation;harmonic blind sound source isolation;music instrument;spectrum clustering;speech recognition;standard MPEG7 audio descriptor;tree categorization","","0","","36","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Identifying keywords from a large amount of on-line news data is very useful in that it can produce a short summary of news articles. As on-line text documents rapidly increase in size with the growth of WWW, keyword extraction has become a basis of several text mining applications such as search engine, text categorization, summarization, and topic detection. Manual keyword extraction is an extremely difficult and time consuming task; in fact, it is almost impossible to extract keywords manually in case of news articles published in a single day due to their volume. For a rapid use of keywords, we need to establish an automated process that extracts keywords from news articles.

To do so, we earlier proposed a Wordnet and Wordnet+LSI (latent semantic indexing) based model for dimension reduction. While LSI concepts contain identifiable terms in top-level concepts, we show in this paper that semi-discrete decomposition provides mostly smaller list of terms and we need to cope only with ternary weights. With this size of term list, the identification of document's topic becomes much more feasible.","2164-7143;21647143","POD:978-0-7695-3382-7","10.1109/ISDA.2008.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696242","LSI;SDD;information retrieval;semi-discrete decomposition;vector space model","Application software;Computer science;Indexing;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Ontologies;Singular value decomposition;Software engineering","information retrieval;pattern recognition;vectors","Wordnet;Wordnet+LSI;dimension reduction;document vectors;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;semidiscrete decomposition;topic identification","","1","","21","","","26-28 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel approach to melody-based retrieval in audio collections. Our approach supports audio, as well as symbolic queries and ranks results according to melodic similarity to the query. We introduce a beat-synchronous melodic representation consisting of salient melodic lines, which are extracted from the analyzed audio signal. We propose the use of a 2D shift-invariant transform to extract shift-invariant melodic fragments from the melodic representation and demonstrate how such fragments can be indexed and stored in a song database. An efficient search algorithm based on locality-sensitive hashing is used to perform retrieval according to similarity of melodic fragments. On the cover song detection task, good results are achieved for audio, as well as for symbolic queries, while fast retrieval performance makes the proposed system suitable for retrieval in large databases.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2008.2007293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4668511","Audio collections;information retrieval;melody;music","","audio databases;feature extraction;music;query processing;transforms;very large databases","audio collection;beat-synchronous melodic representation;large database;locality-sensitive hashing;melodic similarity;melody extraction;melody-based retrieval;musical descriptor;search algorithm;shift-invariant transform;song database;song detection;symbolic query","","18","5","29","","20081107","Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Practically, the proposed approach is adopted to personal crawler systems (the so-called focused crawlers), which can support the corresponding userpsilas web navigation tasks in real-time. By taking into account the user context (e.g., intentions or interests), the crawler can build the queries to evaluate candidate information sources. As a result, we can discover semantic associations i) between user context and the sources, and ii) between all pairs of the sources. These associations are applied to rank the sources, and transform the queries for the other sources. For evaluating the performance of contextualized query-sampling on 53 information sources, we compared the ranking lists recommended by the proposed method with user feedbacks (i.e., ideal ranks), and also computed the precision of discovered subsumptions as semantic associations between the sources.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2624-9; POD:978-1-4244-2623-2","10.1109/ICADIWT.2008.4664344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664344","Context;Distributed information retrieval;Ontology mapping;Query sampling","Crawlers;Data mining;Distributed databases;Frequency;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Sampling methods;Search engines","database management systems;feedback;query processing;semantic Web","contextualized query sampling;personal crawler systems;query-sampling method;semantic associations;semantic resource descriptions;user feedbacks","","0","","14","","","4-6 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With only modes labeled, traditional approaches to key or mode classification cannot be directly applied, due to the lack of the reference point to transpose and align the chroma features with different keys. In this paper, we present an alignment approach to transpose chroma features within each mode to a reference (but unknown) tonic.

Each query is run on each ISE and first hundred images are considered to measure overlap ratios of ISE pairs. In the second phase, MISEs, namely, Metacca, LemmeFind, CurryGuide, iZito, and ixquick, and thirty queries are determined. Each query is run on each MISE separately and first forty images retrieved are evaluated as being ""relevant"" or ""non-relevant"". Afterwards, precision ratios of MISEs are calculated at various cut-off points for each pair of query and MISE. Furthermore, MISEs are compared with the image search engine Google in terms of precision to see the current state of MISEs. MISEs can improve the coverage by combining the results of multiple ISEs due to the overlap between ISEs is very low. Overall, iZito appears to be the best MISE.

At the same time the availability of huge non-volatile storage capacities (flash memory etc.) suggests to maintain huge music databases even in mobile devices. Automated music classification promises to allow keeping a much better overview on huge data bases for the user. Such a classification enables the user to sort the available huge music archives according to different genres which can be either predefined or user defined. It is typically based on a set of perceptual features which are extracted from the music data. Feature extraction and subsequent music classification are very computational intensive tasks. Today, a variety of music features and possible classification algorithms optimized for various application scenarios and achieving different classification qualities are under discussion. In this paper results concerning the computational needs and the achievable classification rates on different processor architectures are presented. The inspected processors include a general purpose P IV dual core processor, heterogeneous digital signal processor architectures like a Nomadik STn8810 (featuring a smart audio accelerator, SAA) as well as an OMAP2420. In order to increase classification performance, different forms of feature selection strategies (heuristic selection, full search and Mann-Whitney-Test) are applied. Furthermore, the potential of a hardware-based acceleration for this class of application is inspected by performing a fine as well as a coarse grain instruction tree analysis. Instruction trees are identified, which could be attractively implemented as custom instructions speeding up this class of applications.","","POD:978-1-4244-1985-2","10.1109/ICSAMOS.2008.4664851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664851","ASIP;feature extraction;music classification;music information retrieval;processor architecture optimization;processor performance","Application software;Computer architecture;Databases;Digital signal processing;Feature extraction;Flash memory;Nonvolatile memory;Personal digital assistants;Portable computers;Smart phones","classification;database management systems;feature extraction;information retrieval;music;signal processing;storage management","PDA;digital signal processing;feature extraction;huge data bases;music classification;nonvolatile storage capacities;smart phones","","2","","22","","","21-24 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach is to classify music based on specific groups of musical instruments. In this paper we report on our experiments that classify musical instrument timbres based on specific groups that are often found in commercial recordings. Classification using the k-nearest neighbour classifier, with audio features such as Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, on a set of 160 samples from commercial recordings, gave an accuracy of 80%. Some of the difficulties arose from distinguishing similar instrument groups, such as those only differing by the inclusion or exclusion ofa voice.

Perceptual parameters of the system are determined based on experiments conducted on 20 users, for three, four, and five songs. Results illustrate that the proposed methodology requires less listening time as compared to traditional list-based interfaces when the desired audio clip is among one of the audio streams.

In this paper we present a real time unsupervised analysis method for identifying duplicate Wi-Fi network nodes which are physically separate.

Basically, our proposed QA system gives user a set of candidate query question for user information needs, and the candidate questions are automatically generated from significant sentences that are expected to contain meaningful facts or events. The QA system builds a complete database of (question, answer) pairs after analyzing a whole collection of documents. For this, we need to perform the following steps: sentence split, named-entity recognition, question generation, question filtering, question/ answer indexing. The important things in the process are question generation and question filtering. For the first thing, we can generate questions that ask the entities extracted from a given sentence. The question filtering is to isolate significant sentences that have meaningful information that users want.","","POD:978-0-7695-3322-3","10.1109/NCM.2008.236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624170","Information Retrieval;Named Entity Recognition;Question Answering System;Question Generation","Computer networks;Data mining;Databases;Indexing;Information analysis;Information filtering;Information filters;Information management;Information retrieval;Natural languages","information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","automated question generation;named-entity recognition;natural language questions;query question;question answering system;question filtering;question/answer indexing;sentence split;system architecture;user information needs","","2","","4","","","2-4 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unlike regular CD music, where the stereo sound involves two audio channels that usually sound the same, karaoke music encompasses two distinct channels in each track: one is a mixture of the lead vocals and background accompaniment, and the other consists of accompaniment only. Although the two audio channels are distinct, the accompaniments in the two channels often resemble each other. We exploit this characteristic to: i) infer the background accompaniment for the lead vocals from the accompaniment-only channel, so that the main melody underlying the lead vocals can be extracted more effectively, and ii) detect phrase onsets based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to predict the onset points of a song where a user's sung query may begin, so that the similarity between the melodies of the query and the song can be examined more efficiently. To further refine extraction of the main melody, we propose correcting potential errors in the estimated sung notes by exploiting a composition characteristic of popular songs whereby the sung notes within a verse or chorus section usually vary no more than two octaves. In addition, to facilitate an efficient and accurate search of a large music database, we employ multiple-pass dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with multiple-level data abstraction (MLDA) to compare the similarities of melodies. The results of experiments conducted on a karaoke database comprised of 1071 popular songs demonstrate the feasibility of query-by-singing retrieval for karaoke music.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2008.2007345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4694852","Bayesian information criterion;dynamic time warping;karaoke;music information retrieval;query-by-singing","Bayesian methods;Councils;Data mining;Databases;Error correction;Humans;Internet;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Signal processing","Bayes methods;audio databases;data structures;music;query formulation","Bayesian information criterion;accompaniment-only channel;audio channel;background accompaniment;karaoke database;karaoke music;lead vocal;multiple-level data abstraction;multiple-pass dynamic time warping;music database;music retrieval;query-by-singing retrieval;query-by-singing system","","22","6","38","","","Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To improve the relevance ranking for underspecified queries requires better understanding of users' search goals. By analyzing the semantic query context extracted from the query logs, we propose Q-Rank to effectively improve the ranking of search results for a given query. Experiments show that Q-Rank outperforms the current ranking system of a large-scale commercial Web search engine, improving the relevance ranking for 82% of the queries with an average increase of 8.99% in terms of discounted cumulative gains.

Traditionally, case-based reasoning techniques have been widely used to help workers solve problems. However, conventional approaches focus on identifying similar problems without exploring relevant context of problem situations. Situation features are generally occurred according to the context characteristics of problem. Moreover, situation features collected are usually partial or incomplete. Workers need to use knowledge inferred from relevant context information and previous problem-solving experience to clarify the causes and take appropriate action effectively. In this paper, we propose to use rule inference to infer possible situation features based on context information. Association rule mining is used to discover context-based inference rules from historical problem-solving logs. The discovered patterns identify frequent associations between context information and situation features, and therefore can be used to infer more situation features. By considering the inferred situation features, case-based reasoning can then be employed to identify similar situations effectively. Moreover, we employ information retrieval techniques to extract context-based situation profiles to model workerspsila information needs when handling problem situations in certain context. Effective knowledge support can thus be facilitated by providing workers with situation-relevant information based on the profiles.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620959","Case-based reasoning;Data mining;Information retrieval;Problem solving;Rule inference","Association rules;Communication industry;Context modeling;Cybernetics;Data mining;Information management;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Problem-solving;Production systems","case-based reasoning;data mining;information retrieval","association rule mining;case-based reasoning;competitive business advantages;context-based inference rules;context-based knowledge support;information retrieval;problem-solving;rule-inference;situation-relevant information","","0","","19","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately our memory can sometimes fail to retrieve all the details of when, where and why something happened. Today, with advances in technology, we are able to capture our serendipitous moments as digital images, videos, audio, text and as other forms of data, making use of the huge capacities of storage available to us. In this paper, we describe a system that can make personal serendipity moments available to be shared with trusted peer group members. We propose a flexible and scalable system for storing serendipitous moments in a human life memory framework and share them with friends without the need for a central server through a peer-to-peer network.","","POD:978-1-4244-1865-7","10.1109/UMEDIA.2008.4570878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4570878","human life memories;information retrieval;lifetime store;multimedia annotation;multimedia storage;personal information systems","Accidents;Digital images;Humans;Image storage;Information systems;Multimedia computing;Multimedia systems;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Videos","peer-to-peer computing;personal computing","human life memory;peer group members;peer-to-peer network;personal serendipity moments","","2","1","16","","","July 31 2008-Aug. 1 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the important papers in this direction; the cons and pros of the recent-proposed framework and algorithms for ranking are analyzed, and the relationships among them are discussed.

The binary relations between these concepts are also extracted based on some semantic and syntactic constraints.

Many image retrieval systems are proposed. However, these systems are mainly based on pattern recognition techniques. Therefore, the features of images are also based on these recognition techniques, such as color histogram, and shape of the object in images. Generally, these systems do not consider weight of features, which means how important these features are, which are generally used in textual information retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a method considering weight, such as TFIDF, to identify the importance degree of features.

The aim is to identify patterns of associations that can be represented using SVM learning rules to enable real-time and reliable CME predictions. The NGDC filaments catalogue and the SOHO/LASCO CMEs catalogue are processed to associate filaments with CMEs based on timing and location information. Automated systems are created to process and associate years of filaments and CME data, which are later arranged in numerical training vectors and fed to machine learning algorithms to extract the embedded knowledge and provide learning rules that can be used for the automated prediction of CMEs. Features representing the filament time, duration, type and extent are extracted from all the associated (A) and not-associated (NA) filaments and converted to a numerical format that is suitable for machine learning use. The machine learning system predicts if the filament is likely to initiate a CME. Intensive experiments are carried out to optimise the SVM. The prediction performance of SVM is analysed and recommendations for enhancing the performance are provided.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2206-7; POD:978-1-4244-2205-0","10.1109/SSD.2008.4632812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632812","Data mining;SVM;Solar Imaging;information retrieval;machine learning;space weather","Data mining;Earth;Geomagnetism;Machine learning;Magnetic fields;Plasmas;Space technology;Storms;Support vector machines;Timing","astronomical image processing;cataloguing;corona;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","NGDC filaments catalogue;SOHO-LASCO CME catalogue;SVM classification system;associations algorithms;automated knowledge extraction;coronal mass ejection;data mining;historical solar data;machine learning algorithm;numerical training vectors;pattern identification;solar catalogues data;solar imaging;support vector machine","","0","","20","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces the application of content-based music information retrieval (CBMIR) in wireless ad-hoc networks. We investigate, for the first time in the literature, the challenges posed by the wireless medium and recognize the factors that require optimization. We propose novel techniques that attain a significant reduction in both response time and network traffic, compared to naive approaches. Extensive experimental results illustrate the appropriateness, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed method to this bandwidth-starving and volatility due to mobility and environment.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2008.925874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4554012","Content-based similarity;Mobile Ad-hoc NETwork (MANET);music information retrieval (MIR);peer to peer (P2P);reducing length representation;wireless ad-hoc network","","ad hoc networks;audio signal processing;content-based retrieval;mobile radio;music","CBMIR;audio music retrieval;content-based music information retrieval;mobile device;wireless ad-hoc network","","3","","37","","20080627","Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The corners are extracted by finding the intersections of the detected lines found using Hough transform. Taking the corner as the center coordinate, the angles of the intersecting lines are determined and inner and outer object boundary pixel information around the corner is used to represent the corner geometry. For similarity measurement, the histogram of the information is used. This result in a significant small size feature matrix compared to the algorithms using color features. Experimental results show that it is computationally efficient in similarity measurement and the image corners being noise invariant produce good results in noisy environments.","","POD:978-0-7695-3427-5","10.1109/UMC.2008.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4656531","Multimedia Data Mining;Multimedia Information Retrieval;Multimedia Representation;Visualization of Information and Knowledge","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feedback;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Military computing;Shape;Working environment noise","Hough transforms;image representation;image retrieval","Hough transform;color features;corner angle representation;corner boundary pixel information;histogram;image corners;image representation;noise invariant;object boundary pixel information;object retrieval","","1","","26","","","13-15 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
