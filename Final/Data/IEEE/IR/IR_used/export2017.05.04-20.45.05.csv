Retrieving documents that are off-topic to a user's predefined area of information need (task) via a search engine is potentially a violation of access rights and is a concern to every private, commercial, and governmental organization. Such misuse, defined as ""off-topic access to sensitive data by an authorized user"", is the second most prevalent form of computer crime after viruses per a recent Computer Security Institute/Federal Bureau of Investigation study. We present a content-based off-topic detection approach that uses query result clustering to detect off-topic searches. This approach supports higher detection precision than the state of the art. Multiple methods for picking the ""good"" clusters are proposed, and their effect on the detection rate and precision is evaluated. A high detection precision is critical as a false access violation accusation unfairly and inappropriately subjects the user to scrutiny. Our empirical results show that using clustering query results can significantly reduce such false positives.","","Electronic:1-4244-1329-X","10.1109/ISI.2007.379547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4258688","Clustering;Information Retrieval;Off Topic Search;misuse detection","Computer crime;Computer security;Computer viruses;Humans;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Permission;Search engines;US Department of Transportation","computer crime;pattern clustering;query processing;search engines","computer crime;content-based off-topic detection approach;document retrieval;query result clustering;search engine","","1","","26","","","23-24 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CSpec feature is derived from (1) information content of concepts, and (2) information content of the ontology given a corpus. We evaluated the proposed measure with benchmark test set of term pairs scored for similarity by human experts.

The belief in the validity of these candidates is ascertained using knowledge of foreground pixels and temporal linking of candidates. The transferable belief model is used to combine these sources of information and segment objects. Extracted objects are subsequently tracked using adaptive thermo-visual appearance models.

Coordination, cooperation and exchange of information is important to the medical community. This paper presents an ontology-based holonic multi-agent system that combines the advantages of the holonic paradigm with multi-agent system technology and ontology design, in order to realize a highly reliable, adaptive, scalable, flexible and robust diagnostic system for diseases. We design a new ontology, called generic human disease ontology (GHDO), for the representation of knowledge regarding human diseases. The concepts of the GHDO ontology are organized into the following four dimensions: types, symptoms, causes and treatments of human diseases. The holonic multi-agent system uses this common GHDO ontology for purpose of query formulation, information retrieval and information integration. This intelligent dynamic system provides opportunities to collect information from multiple information resources, to share data efficiently and to integrate and manage scientific results in a timely manner. We believe such a technique is expected to become the norm once existing resources (e.g. disease databases) will have become unlocked semantically through annotation with a shared ontology","","POD:1-4244-0020-1","10.1109/CIMA.2005.1662307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1662307","holonic multi-agent systems;human disease ontology;intelligent information retrieval;ontology-based multi-agents systems","Diseases;Humans;Information resources;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Medical diagnostic imaging;Multiagent systems;Ontologies;Resource management;Robustness","biology computing;diseases;information resources;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);patient diagnosis;query formulation","biomedical community;data sharing;disease diagnostic system;generic human disease ontology;holonic multiagent system;information exchange;information integration;information resources;intelligent dynamic system;intelligent information retrieval;knowledge representation;medical milieu;query formulation","","0","","10","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we propose FM-based knowledge representation in both graphic and algebraic format. The representation is capable of identifying dependencies across compound propositions in the rules. In the algebraic representation, the FM closure matrix is considered a precompiled rule base enabling efficient query processing. An iterative approach is presented to facilitate the construction and expansion of the FM closure matrix, which is a key for real-world applications. Next, we introduce the concept of indexing, which was originally developed for information retrieval (IR), to enable an immediate extraction of relevant entries from the FM closure matrix. The indexing approach is applied in combination with the FM closure matrix. Based on the combination, corresponding inference mechanisms are introduced to achieve instant acquisition of relevant rules over a large collection of rules.

"Precise pitch profile feature extraction from musical audio for key detection","Yongwei Zhu; M. S. Kankanhalli","","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20060515","2006","8","3","575","584","The majority of pieces of music, including classical and popular music,are composed using music scales, such as keys. The key or the scale information of a piece provides important clues on its high level musical content, like harmonic and melodic context. Automatic key detection from music data can be useful for music classification, retrieval or further content analysis. Many researchers have addressed key finding from symbolically encoded music(MIDI); however, works for key detection in musical audio is still limited. Techniques for key detection from musical audio mainly consist of two steps:pitch extraction and key detection. The pitch feature typically characterizes the weights of presence of particular pitch classes in the music audio. In the existing approaches to pitch extraction, little consideration has been taken on pitch mistuning and interference of noisy percussion sounds in the audio signals, which inevitably affects the accuracy of key detection. In this paper, we present a novel technique of precise pitch profile feature extraction, which deals with pitch mistuning and noisy percussive sounds. The extracted pitch profile feature can characterize the pitch content in the signal more accurately than the previous techniques, thus lead to a higher key detection accuracy. Experiments based on classical and popular music data were conducted. The results showed that the proposed method has higher key detection accuracy than previous methods, especially for popular music with a lot of noisy drum sounds.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2006.870727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1632042","Audio processing;key finding;music analysis;music information retrieval;pitch extraction;scale estimation","Acoustic noise;Acoustic signal detection;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Independent component analysis;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval","audio signal processing;feature extraction;information retrieval;music","audio signal;automatic key detection;music classification;music retrieval;musical audio;pitch profile feature extraction","","17","","40","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, leveraging information retrieval (IR) algorithms such as Vector Space Model (VSM) and relevance ranking algorithms, we present GES (Gnutella with Efficient Search) to improve search performance. The key idea is that GES uses a distributed topology adaptation algorithm to organize semantically relevant nodes into same semantic groups by using the notion of node vector. Given a query, GES employs an efficient search protocol to direct the query to the most relevant semantic groups for answers, thereby achieving high recall with probing only a small fraction of nodes. To the best of our knowledge, GES is the first to identify node vector size as an important role in impacting search performance and to show that the node vector size offers a good trade-off between search performance and bandwidth cost. Moreover, GES adopts automatic query expansion and local data clustering to improve search performance. We show that GES is efficient and even outperforms the centralized node clustering system SETS. For example, in the scenario where node capacity is heterogeneous, GES can achieve 73 percent recall when probing only 20 percent nodes, outperforming SETS by about 18 percent.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2006.173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1717409","Peer-to-peer;biased walk;information retrieval.;node vector;recall;semantic group;topology adaptation","Bandwidth;Computational efficiency;Costs;Distributed computing;IP networks;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Protocols","","Peer-to-peer;biased walk;information retrieval.;node vector;recall;semantic group;topology adaptation","","26","","34","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose a system, that generates playlists including songs similar to accepted ones, discarding songs similar to rejected ones, where similar refers to timbre. Additional adaptivity is achieved with a user-adaptive distance function which in our case requires modeling features separately. After a seed-song (which is the first accepted song) is given by the user, the distance function is used by a song selection strategy to select songs. Minimal user feedback is collected with a skip button that is pressed to directly jump to the next song and explicitly reject the current one while acceptance is implicitly given by listening to a song.","1520-6149;15206149","CD-ROM:1-4244-0728-1; POD:1-4244-0727-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4217058","music information retrieval;music similarity;playlist generation;skipping behavior;user adaptation","Acoustic testing;Bioinformatics;CD recording;Digital audio players;Feedback;Genomics;Mood;Music information retrieval;Spatial databases;Timbre","audio recording","MP3;adaptive distance measure;intelligent automatic song selection;manual playlist generation;minimal user feedback;music recording;random selection;similarity based playlist generation;song selection strategy;user-adaptive distance function","","0","4","15","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To use heterogeneous Web data for decision making, documents containing relevant data must be located, and the data of interest within the documents must be identified and extracted. Currently, most automatic information extraction systems can only cope with a limited set of document formats or do not adapt well to changes in document structure, as a result, many real-world data sources with complex document structures cannot be consistently interpreted using a single information extraction system. This paper presents an adaptive information extraction system prototype that combines multiple information extraction approaches to allow more accurate and resilient data extraction for a wide variety of Web sources. The Amorphic Web information extraction system prototype can locate data of interest based on domain knowledge or page structure, can automatically generate a wrapper for a data source, and can detect when the structure of a Web-based resource has changed and act on this to search the updated resource to locate the desired data. The prototype Amorphic information extraction system demonstrated improved information extraction accuracy for the four different extraction scenarios examined when compared with traditional data extraction approaches","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2006.876061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4033003","Businness intelligence;information extraction;information retrieval;intelligent systems","Adaptive systems;Aggregates;Business;Data mining;Decision making;HTML;Information retrieval;Organizational aspects;Prototypes;Web sites","Internet;XML;competitive intelligence;decision making;information retrieval systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Web business intelligence applications;World Wide Web;adaptive information extraction system;business decision making;data extraction;data source;document formats;document structure;heterogeneous Web data;information Web","","13","","59","","","Jan. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Secondly, based on the semantic data model, we deploy a distributed semantic information processing architecture to support information organization, effective retrieval and web-based search for information resources of user interested.

Relevance feedback is often used to alleviate those problems. In this paper, we propose a novel interactive boosting framework to integrate user feedback into boosting scheme and bridge the gap between high-level semantic concept and low-level image features. Our method achieves more performance improvement from the relevance feedback than AdaBoost does because human judgment is accumulated iteratively to facilitate learning process. It also has obvious advantage over the classic relevance feedback method in that the classifiers are trained to pay more attention to wrongfully predicted samples in user feedback through a reinforcement training process. An interactive boosting scheme called i.Boost is implemented and tested using adaptive discriminant projection (ADP) as base classifiers, which not only combines but also enhances a set of ADP classifiers into a more powerful one. To evaluate its performance, several applications are designed on UCI benchmark data sets, Harvard, UMIST, ATT facial image data sets and COREL color image data sets. The proposed method is compared to normal AdaBoost, classic relevance feedback and the state-of-the-art projection-based classifiers. The experiment results show the superior performance of i.Boost and the interactive boosting framework.","1520-6149;15206149","CD-ROM:1-4244-0728-1; POD:1-4244-0727-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4217242","Algorithms;Artificial intelligence;Image classification;Information retrieval;Pattern recognition","Application software;Boosting;Bridges;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Humans;Image retrieval;Principal component analysis;Testing","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback","ATT facial image data sets;AdaBoost;COREL color image data sets;Harvard;UCI benchmark data sets;UMIST;adaptive discriminant projection;base classifiers;content-based image retrieval;high-level semantic concept;i.Boost;interactive boosting framework;learning process;low-level image features;reinforcement training process;relevance feedback;state-of-the-art projection-based classifiers","","3","","14","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semantic image analysis techniques, which automatically detect high level semantic contents of images for annotation, are promising solutions toward this problem. However, few efforts have been made to convey the annotation results to users in an intuitive manner to enable effective image browsing and retrieval. There is also a lack of methods to monitor and evaluate the automatic image analysis algorithms due to the high dimensional nature of image data, features, and contents. In this paper, we propose a novel, scalable semantic image browser by applying existing information visualization techniques to semantic image analysis. This browser not only allows users to effectively browse and search in large image databases according to the semantic content of images, but also allows analysts to evaluate their annotation process through interactive visual exploration. The major visualization components of this browser are multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based image layout, the value and relation (VaR) display that allows effective high dimensional visualization without dimension reduction, and a rich set of interaction tools such as search by sample images and content relationship detection. Our preliminary user study showed that the browser was easy to use and understand, and effective in supporting image browsing and retrieval tasks","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0592-0; POD:1-4244-0591-2","10.1109/VAST.2006.261425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4035765","1.4.8 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Scene AnalysisÂ¿Object recognition;H.3.3 [Information Storage and Retrieval]: Information Search and RetrievalÂ¿Search process;H.5.2 [Information Interfaces and Presentation]: User InterfacesÂ¿Graphical user interfaces;Image retrieval;image layout;multi-dimensional visualization;semantic image classification;visual analytics","Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Displays;Image analysis;Image classification;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Visual analytics;Visualization","data visualisation;image retrieval;interactive systems","automated intelligent image analysis;high dimensional visualization;image retrieval;information visualization;interaction tools;interactive visual exploration;large image databases;multidimensional scaling based image layout;semantic image analysis;semantic image browser;semantic image classification;value and relation display;visual analytics","","19","6","22","","","Oct. 31 2006-Nov. 2 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a novel approach where the annotations may be entered at coarser spatial granularity while the concept may still be learnt at finer granularity. This can speed up annotation significantly. Using the multiple instance learning paradigm, we show that it is possible to learn representations of concepts occurring at the regional level by using annotations for several images. We present a generalized multiple instance learning algorithm with three variations in the strategy to select the most likely positive instance from a positively annotated bag. Furthermore, we show how the three strategies can be combined to improve upon any single strategy and demonstrate 15% performance improvement over any single strategy using a few regional semantic concepts from the TRECVID 2003 benchmark corpus.","1522-4880;15224880","CD-ROM:1-4244-0481-9; POD:1-4244-0480-0","10.1109/ICIP.2006.312907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4107254","Algorithm;Information retrieval","Government;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia communication;NIST;Road vehicles;Robustness;Statistical learning;TV broadcasting;Video sequences","learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;statistical analysis;video retrieval","cross granular learning;generalized multiple instance learning algorithm;multimedia features;multiple selection strategies;semantic concepts;statistical learning techniques;video search","","1","","5","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spatial memory enables humans to store computerized information such as digital files and commands into the real world by assigning three-dimensional position as the memory addresses. Humans can retrieve and store such information by directly indicating the point using their own body e.g. user's hand and user's head. A virtual tag, which associates a digital data with a spatial location, is called spatial-knowledge-tag (SKT). SKT is created by a human based on his policy and his purpose in an environment. SKTs including locations and contents describe human activities at places. To design and implement services for inhabitants in an intelligent environment, it is required to know purposes which people intend to use the places. This paper applies two approaches to classify human activities spatially and characteristically.

In this paper, we explore the acoustic features that reflect vibrato information in order to identify singers of popular music. We start with an enhanced vocal detection method that allows us to select vocal segments with high confidence. From the selected vocal segments, the cepstral coefficients which reflect the vibrato characteristics are computed. These coefficients are derived using bandpass filters, such as parabolic and cascaded bandpass filters, spread according to the octave frequency scale. The strategy of our classifier formulation is to utilize the high level musical knowledge of song structure in singer modeling.

These onomatopoeia words describe the acoustic properties of sources, and they can be useful in annotating a medium that cannot embed audio (e.g. text). First, an audio-to-word relationship is established by manually tagging a variety of audio clips (from a sound effects library) with onomatopoeia words. Using a newly proposed distance metric for word-level similarities, the feature vectors from the audio are clustered according to their tags, resulting in clusters with similarities in their onomatopoeic descriptions. By discriminant analysis of the clusters at the feature level, we present results on separability of these clusters. Our results indicate that by just using onomatopoeic descriptions, meaningful clusters with similar acoustic properties can be formed. However, in terms of audio feature level representation, clusters formed by some word groups such as buzz, fizz etc are better represented by signal features than percussive sounds such as clang, clank, tap.","1520-6149;15206149","CD-ROM:1-4244-0728-1; POD:1-4244-0727-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2007.366349","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4217522","analysis of audio clusters;audio information retrieval;audio ontology;onomatopoeia based audio descriptions","Acoustic testing;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Labeling;Laboratories;Libraries;Nails;Ontologies;Pattern analysis;Speech analysis","audio signal processing","acoustic properties;audio clustering analysis;audio feature level representation;audio-to-word relationship;discriminant analysis;onomatopoeic descriptions;word descriptions;word-level similarities","","2","","15","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The sharing of resources across multiple information communities raises the need of new technologies that support resource discovery and information retrieval. This paper investigates if a common ontology is desirable and feasible for information retrieval in a European spatial data infrastructure. It does so by reviewing relevant literature and proposes an approach for the automatic updating of existing ontologies, designed to facilitate access to multilingual descriptors of geospatial resources. We demonstrate by means of a prototype of an experimental system that the proposed approach is feasible. The experimental system is unique because it integrates a gazetteer, the EuroVoc multilingual vocabulary, the GEMET multilingual thesaurus, an automatic concept space generator, and graph matching into one system. Based on our study, we conclude that it will be impractical to rely only on one common ontology for resource discovery. We also conclude that the approach of using human-created ontologies in combination with automatic concept space generation and associative retrieval is a powerful means to the discovery of geospatial resources.

The records have been created by researchers who are currently digitising a collection of historical archives stored at the Abbaye de Saint-Maurice, Switzerland. The string `Beatrix, daughter of Johannes Trona, of Saillon' is a typical example of a record. We wish to annotate every term (word and symbol) in our records with a label which describes whether the term is a name (e.g. `Beatrix'), a place (e.g. `Saillon'), or a relationship (e.g. `daughter'). Using this information, we are able to derive both a canonical form for each name (e.g. `Beatrix Trona'), and the relationships between people. We build upon work developed for the cleaning and standardization of names for record linkage corpora, adding several enhancements to deal with our more difficult data, which contains common name structures of French, Italian and Latin, over hundreds of years. We present an approach to this problem that works interactively with a user to annotate the data set accurately, greatly reducing the human effort required. We do this by learning a hidden Markov model representing a record structure, and finding structural patterns in new records.

Large collections are also precategorized into classes so that a single class contains objects of the same type (e.g., human faces, cars, four-legged animals). It is shown that general object retrieval methods are inadequate for intraclass retrieval tasks. We advocate that such intraclass problems require a specialized method that can exploit the basic class characteristics in order to achieve higher accuracy. A novel 3D object retrieval method is presented which uses a parameterized annotated model of the shape of the class objects, incorporating its main characteristics. The annotated subdivision-based model is fitted onto objects of the class using a deformable model framework, converted to a geometry image and transformed into the wavelet domain. Object retrieval takes place in the wavelet domain. The method does not require user interaction, achieves high accuracy, is efficient for use with large databases, and is suitable for nonrigid object classes. We apply our method to the face recognition domain, one of the most challenging intraclass retrieval tasks.

Search engines are incorporating new techniques (such as examining document link structures) to increase effectiveness. However, searchers all too often face one of two outcomes: reviewing many more Web pages than they'd prefer or failing to find as much useful information as they really want. We introduce a new retrieval technique that exploits users' persistent information needs.

At the same time, search engine plays an important role while retrieving inform.ation. Nevertheless, the smallest processing unit of search engine is the whole web pages, which contains plenty of noisy information. If the information can be extracted and used as the smallest processing unit, then it can place a positive effect on search engine's precision; so was born the page segmentation algorithm. However, traditional algorithms cannot extract blocks in product level. Hence, a novel algorithm, basing on product features and DOM (document object mode), is proposed. Compared with those traditional algorithms, not only information consistence is greatly enhanced, but also complexity is decreased with this novel page segmentation algorithm.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0529-7; POD:1-4244-0528-9","10.1109/ICIA.2006.305954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4097887","Information Retrieval;Page Segmentation;Product Block;Search Engine","Computer science;Data mining;Educational products;HTML;High performance computing;Information retrieval;Internet;Navigation;Search engines;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;search engines","Internet;Web page segmentation;document object mode;information retrieval;product information extraction;search engine","","1","","19","","","20-23 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

LDA is known for capturing the most discriminant features of the data in the projected space while PCA is known for preserving the most descriptive ones after projection. Our hybrid technique integrates discriminant and descriptive information and finds a richer set of alternatives beyond LDA and PCA in a 2-D parametric space, which fits a specific classification task and data distribution better. Theoretical study shows that our technique also alleviates the singularity problem of scatter matrix, which is caused by small training set, and increases the effective dimension of the projected subspace. In order to find the hybrid features adaptively and avoid exhaustive parameter searching, we further propose a boosted hybrid analysis method that incorporates a nonlinear boosting process to enhance a set of hybrid classifiers and combine them into a more accurate one. Compared with the other techniques that aim at combining PCA and LDA, our approaches are novel because our method finds alternatives to LDA and PCA in a 2-D parameter space and the boosting process provides enhancement and robust combination of the classifiers. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark and real image databases to compare our proposed methods with the state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear discriminant analysis techniques.

Rather than downloading all accessible Web pages, a topical crawler analyzes the frontier of the crawled region to visit only the portion of the Web that contains relevant Web pages, and at the same time, try to skip irrelevant regions. This leads to significant savings in both computation and communication resources. In this paper, we present an integrated topical crawler: AuToCrawler. The main features of AuToCrawler consist of a user interest specification module that mediates between users and search engines to identify target examples and keywords that together specify the topic of their interest, and a URL ordering strategy that combines features of several previous approaches and achieves significant improvement. It also provides a graphic user interface such that users can evaluate and visualize the crawling results that can be used as feedback to reconfigure the crawler.","","POD:0-7695-2296-3","10.1109/ICIS.2005.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1515448","Focused Crawler;Information Retrieval;Machine Learning;Search Engines;Topical Crawler","Computer science;Crawlers;Graphics;Information retrieval;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;User interfaces;Visualization;Web pages;Web sites","data visualisation;graphical user interfaces;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);search engines","AuToCrawler;URL ordering;Web crawler;Web page retrieval;Web page searching;World Wide Web;automatic topical crawler;crawler reconfiguration;feedback;focused crawler;graphic user interface;information retrieval;keywords;machine learning;search engines;user interest specification module","","3","","12","","","2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Training is divided into three phases using all or some of these songs. The test set consists of 10 songs selected from 5 genres which are not included in training. We trained and tested the music classifiers using both TreeQ and LVQ algorithms with varying parameters such as, Number of Codebook (NOC) and pruning thresholds to identify the effects of different parameters and features in the Thai music classification and retrieval. We observed that TreeQ-based experiments yield faster response-times than those of LVQ; and therefore, a TreeQ-based system maybe appropriate for online (real-time) music retrieval tasks. On the other hand, LVQ-based experiments consistently yield better accuracy than those of TreeQ; and therefore, a LVQ-based system may be appropriate in the music classification task since music classification can generally be performed off-line.

The latter is achieved by a novel algorithm which makes use of feature selection and statistical novelty detection approaches based on kernel methods. The video stream is independently segmented to detect changes in motion activity, as well as shot boundaries.

The method relies primarily on the geometric 3D structure of the proteins, which is produced from the corresponding PDB files and secondarily on their primary and secondary structure. After proper positioning of the 3D structures, in terms of translation and scaling, the spherical trace transform is applied to them so as to produce geometry-based descriptor vectors, which are completely rotation invariant and perfectly describe their 3D shape. Additionally, characteristic attributes of the primary and secondary structure of the protein molecules are extracted, forming attribute-based descriptor vectors. The descriptor vectors are weighted and an integrated descriptor vector is produced. Three classification methods are tested. A part of the FSSP/DALI database, which provides a structural classification of the proteins, is used as the ground truth in order to evaluate the classification accuracy of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves more than 99 percent classification accuracy while remaining much simpler and faster than the DALI method","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2006.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1668019","Information search and retrieval;classification;protein databases.","Chemicals;Crystallography;Databases;Evolution (biology);Information retrieval;Laboratories;Proteins;Shape;Space technology;Testing","biology computing;information retrieval;molecular configurations;proteins","FSSP/DALI database;geometric 3D protein structure;geometry-based descriptor vectors;information retrieval;integrated descriptor vector;primary structure;protein classification;secondary structure;spherical trace transform;structural classification;three-dimensional shape-structure comparison method","Algorithms;Amino Acid Sequence;Computer Simulation;Databases, Protein;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Chemical;Models, Molecular;Molecular Sequence Data;Protein Conformation;Proteins;Sequence Alignment;Sequence Analysis, Protein;Structure-Activity Relationship","30","","34","","","July-Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The repository consists of a document registration module, hybrid search engine, and reasoning base. The document registration module is designed to reduce the cost of adding metadata to documents, and the hybrid search engine combines full-text search with metadata-based search engine to improve the recall of retrieval result. The reasoning base is implemented based on the association rule mining method, which contributes to improve both precision and recall of the hybrid search engine.
