It provides critical function in the development and maintenance of a software system. From the software evolution point of view, requirements traceability plays an important role in facilitating software evolution. Since the evolution is inevitable, a traceability approach must take as much as possible the important influencing aspects into account to the evolution processes in order to minimize the evolution efforts. This paper evaluates several recent traceability approaches published in literature with the focus on their contributions to software evolution. The evaluation results may be used as a basis for improving requirements traceability approaches that may simplify the software evolution tasks.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-2937-0; POD:0-7695-2937-2","10.1109/ICSEA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299902","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information systems;Resumes;Software algorithms;Software engineering;Software maintenance;Software systems","formal specification;program diagnostics;software maintenance;software prototyping","requirement traceability approaches;software engineering;software evolution;software system development;software system maintenance","","7","1","28","","","25-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most of the existing online learning algorithms handle interactions of a single user, which may pose restrained performance due to the limited size of positive feedback. An alternative solution is to learn general user perceptions via collecting feedback from different users. The training process is initiated only when the number of feedbacks reaches a certain threshold. This could improve the performance but it becomes a manual process to decide the threshold and initiate the training process. To address this challenge, ire propose an advanced training method by adopting the association rule mining technique, which can effectively evaluate accumulated feedback and automatically invoke the training process. Training is performed per video rather than for all videos in the database, making the process more efficient and robust. In addition, it can further improve semantic modeling in the video database and continuously improve retrieval performance in the long run. As an example, the proposed method is applied to a mobile-based soccer video retrieval system and the experimental results are analyzed.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-1500-4; POD:1-4244-1499-7","10.1109/IRI.2007.4296649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4296649","","Association rules;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feedback;Information retrieval;Multimedia computing;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Radio frequency;Support vector machines","data mining;multimedia systems;video databases;video retrieval","advanced training method;association rule mining;automated multimedia systems training;general user perceptions;mobile-based soccer video retrieval system;online learning algorithms;positive feedback;refine retrieval performance;semantic modeling;user feedback;video database","","2","","14","","","13-15 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our indexing approach, the resulting index is an RDF file that can be interrogated using one of the RDF query languages. An ontology-based information retrieval system is built as a Web application to help and guide users in their research for resources.

The frequency of terms in each description relates to the behaviour of the offender and this can be used to link crimes to a common offender. Language modelling uses Bayes' theorem and thus require a prior probability. Such a prior can be based on each offender's past propensity to offend, derived from historic data. Language modelling yields a probability of a document being relevant, which in this case is interpreted as the probability of a suspect being the culprit. Although the absolute value of the probability does not carry any direct applied implications, the study does show that the general likelihood of identification of the actual suspect does correspond to the relative values. Thus these probabilities can be used for more than just ranking suspects.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-2876-2; POD:0-7695-2876-7","10.1109/IAS.2007.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299806","","Computer crime;Data analysis;Data security;Databases;Frequency;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information science;Information security;Psychology","Bayes methods;natural languages;police data processing;probability","Bayes theorem;language model;police database;probability;serial crime description analysis;suspect likelihood;suspect prioritisation","","2","","13","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel search system with a new search interface and answer ranking scheme. Due to the limited number of query types in the Biomedical-specific searches, we employ a form-based interface with various query templates for specifying required information. This can ascertain a user's intentions more accurately than a conventional keyword-based interface. Ranking is another key issue in this type of search. We propose a linear ranking model, trained by a supervised learning algorithm, which combines different features. Two semantic features, named entity types and semantic roles, are incorporated into the model to help match a query with entities in relevant documents. After employing all effective semantic features, our system achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 43.1% and Top-5 MRR of 47.1%. In comparison with the baseline system.

To describe data, the resource description framework has been extended with a schema-level and description logics (e.g. RDF-S and OWL DL). To successfully retrieve data described by RDF -based ontologies, the query language SPARQL is currently being developed at W3C. However, although SPARQL also provides a client/server protocol, currently queries are targeted to single sites only. For a large-scale data integration, which is the scope of a middleware developed within the Austrian grid project, it is necessary to execute queries on distributed data nodes. Because of the large amount of research undertaken in the field of relational database systems, it is reasonable to apply relational algebra to SPARQL query processors. In fact, most RDF triple stores are based on relational database systems.

This approach can significantly reduce the false alarm rate at the input to the fusion/tracking algorithm, and reduce node-to-fusion-center communication link throughput requirements. This paper describes this concept and derives a method for determining the data lookup ""snippets"", given a detection cue.

"MULS: A General Framework of Providing Multilevel Service Quality in Sequential Data Broadcasting","H. P. Hung; M. S. Chen","","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20070917","2007","19","10","1433","1447","In recent years, data broadcasting becomes a promising technique to design a mobile information system with power conservation, high scalability and high bandwidth utilization. In many applications, the query issued by a mobile client corresponds to multiple items which should be accessed in a sequential order. In this paper, we study the scheduling approach in such a sequential data broadcasting environment. Explicitly, we propose a general framework referred to as MULS (standing for MUlti-Level Service) for an information system. There are two primary stages in MULS: on-line scheduling and optimization procedure. In the first stage, we propose an On- Line Scheduling algorithm (denoted by OLS) to allocate the data items into multiple channels. As for the second stage, we devise an optimization procedure SCI, standing for Sampling with Controlled Iteration, to enhance the quality of broadcast programs generated by algorithm OLS. Procedure SCI is able to strike a compromise between effectiveness and efficiency by tuning the control parameters. According to the experimental results, we show that algorithm OLS with procedure SCI outperforms the approaches in prior works prominently in both effectiveness (i.e., the average access time of mobile users) and efficiency (i.e., the complexity of the scheduling algorithm). Therefore, by cooperating algorithm OLS with procedure SCI, the proposed MULS framework is able to generate broadcast programs with flexibility of providing different service qualities under different requirements of effectiveness and efficiency: in the dynamic environment in which the access patterns and information contents change rapidly, the parameters used in SCI will perform online scheduling with satisfactory service quality. As for the static environment in which the query profile and the database are updated infrequently, larger values of parameters are helpful to generate an optimized broadcast program, indicating the advantageous feature of MULS.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1072","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302748","Data Broadcasting;mobile computing;multi-level service quality;ordered-dependency;sequential data broadcasting","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Information retrieval;Information systems;Mobile computing;Sampling methods;Scalability;Scheduling algorithm;Spatial databases;Weather forecasting","","","","1","","30","","","Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Following the searching stage, a similarity measure computation algorithm is developed to evaluate the shape similarity of object data and the stored models. By this classification approach, both whole and partial matching results with similarity ranks can be obtained; especially, focus match can be achieved, in which different key parts can be labeled and all the matched models with corresponding key parts can be obtained. Some experiments are given to show the validity and efficiency of the approach for 3D object classification","","POD:1-4244-0475-4","10.1109/COGINF.2006.365524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216441","3D object classification;interpretation tree;match;similarity measure;volumetric part","Assembly;Classification tree analysis;Error correction;Indexing;Information retrieval;Libraries;Object recognition;Psychology;Shape measurement;Volume measurement","image classification;object detection;tree searching","3D object classification;constrained search;efficient tree search;interpretation tree;partial matching;similarity measure;superquadric-based geon description;volumetric parts","","0","","16","","","17-19 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

QA systems employing combination of SCB and resolution theorem proving have been used to provide both satisfying and hypothetical answers. Satisfying answers are associated with ground term corresponding with questions whose logical form contains variables. Hypothetical answer is an answer which comes from the story or plot of text, and required logical thinking because it is not explicitly stated in the knowledge domain.

In this paper, we first show the limitation of conventional MAC protocols in the proposed environment; and introduce a new MAC protocol: the adaptive propagation-delay-tolerant collision-avoidance protocol (APCAP).

The adaptive alpha-trimmed average operator extracts the representation by trimming outliers and then estimating the central value of the rest. Since the more samples are used, the more accurate representation we get, the optimal trimming parameter should guarantee to remove the extreme values and at the same time keep useful samples as more as possible. The criterion to distinguish between useful data and extreme noise is derived from Gaussian distribution hypothesis test on the basis of global statistics.

In this paper, we modeled the relationship between semantic classes and visual feature distributions of data set with the Gaussian mixture model, and proposed a semantics supervised cluster based index (briefly as SSCI) approach to integrate the advantages of both semantic classes and visual features. The entire data set is divided hierarchically by a modified clustering technique into many clusters until the objects within a cluster are not only close in the visual feature space but also within the same semantic class, and then an index entry including semantic clue and visual feature clue is built for each cluster. Especially, the visual feature vectors in a cluster are organized adjacently in disk. So the SSCI-based nearest-neighbor search can be divided into two phases: the first phase computes the distances between the query example and each cluster index and returns the clusters with the smallest distance, here namely candidate clusters; then the second phase retrieves the original feature vectors within the candidate clusters to gain the approximate nearest neighbors.

The widespread use inevitably produces malicious peers who try to disrupt the network by flooding it with in authentic files. This necessitates the need for a robust reputation system to identify bad peers and files. The former has been extensively studied and many peer based reputations already exist. In this paper we present a novel framework for a Hybrid P2P Reputation System (HPRS) using peer and file rating. This combined rating enables good peers to judge individual files and thus eliminate any in authentic downloads. It also helps a peer extract the maximum from the system by enabling him to get those occasional good files from bad peers and reject accidental bad files from good peers. Simulation results illustrate that HPRS significantly improves performance in a network.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-2876-2; POD:0-7695-2876-7","10.1109/IAS.2007.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299791","File reputation;peer reputation;transitive trust.","Computer science;Educational institutions;History;Information retrieval;Information security;Information technology;Memory;Merging;Peer to peer computing;Robustness","data integrity;peer-to-peer computing;security of data","HPRS;file rating;hybrid P2P reputation system;inauthentic files;peer rating;peer-to-peer file sharing networks","","0","","7","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach is based on novel modifications and improvements of a few recent techniques in this area: (1) the scale adapted Harris detector, which is an extension to multi-scale domains of the Harris corner detector; (2) automatic scale selection by the characteristic scale of a local structure. (3) SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), one of the most widely investigated descriptors in recent years. Like most of other local feature representations, the proposed approach can also be divided into two stages: (i) a set of distinctive local features are selected by first detecting scale adaptive Harris corners where each of them is associated with a scale factor, and then selecting as the final result only those corners whose scale matches the scale of blob-like structures around them. Here, the scale of a blob-like structure is detected by the Laplace-based scale selection, (ii). for each feature detected, an enhanced SIFT descriptor is computed to represent this feature. Our improvements lead two novel methods which we call the Modified Harris-Laplace (MHL) detector, and the enhanced SIFT descriptor. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the proposed scheme to the shoeprint image retrieval problem using six sets of synthetic scene images, 50 images for each, and a database of 500 reference shoeprint images. The retrieval performance of the proposed approach is significantly better, in terms of cumulative matching score, than the existing methods investigated in this application area, such as edge directional histogram, power spectral distribution, and pattern & topological spectra.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-2876-2; POD:0-7695-2876-7","10.1109/IAS.2007.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4299804","","Computer vision;Detectors;Footwear;Forensics;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Soil;Spatial databases","Laplace transforms;feature extraction;image retrieval","Harris corner detector;Laplace-based scale selection;Modified Harris-Laplace detector;automatic scale selection;enhanced SIFT descriptor;feature detection;local feature descriptor;local feature detector;local image features;reference database;scale adapted Harris detector;scale-invariant feature transform;scene-of-crime shoeprint images;shoeprint image retrieval problem;synthetic scene images","","0","","29","","","29-31 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the practical approaches to open domain QA consists in extracting facts from free text offline and using a lookup mechanism when answering user's questions online. This approach is related to natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) that were studied extensively from the 1970s to the 1990s. NLIDB systems employed a range of techniques, from simple pattern-matching rules to formal logical calculi such as the lambda calculus, but most were restricted to specific domains. In this paper we describe a machine learning approach to querying tabular data for QA which is not restricted to specific domains. Our approach consists of two steps: for an incoming question, we first use a classifier to identify appropriate tables and columns in a structured database, and then employ a free-text retrieval to look up answers. The system uses part-of-speech tagging, named-entity normalization and a statistical classifier trained on data from the TREC QA task. With the TREC QA data, our system is shown to significantly outperform an existing rule-based table lookup method.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2932-1","10.1109/DEXA.2007.119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312923","","Calculus;Data mining;Databases;Expert systems;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Natural languages;Table lookup;Tagging;Text analysis","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;pattern matching","formal logical calculi;free-text retrieval;human-like manner;lambda calculus;lookup mechanism;machine learning;natural language interfaces;natural language questions;part-of-speech tagging;pattern-matching rules;question answering systems;rule-based table lookup method;structured database;tabular data","","5","1","20","","","3-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In AWS, a wireless information retriever (WIR), equipped with an antenna array, interrogates a select ensemble of sensors with wideband space-time waveforms for rapid and energy-efficient retrieval of sensor information. The WIR extracts sensor information by exploiting the differences in the space-time signatures associated with distinct sensors. In this paper, we investigate the challenging problem of AWS in multipath environments. Our results show that the use of wideband waveforms in AWS allows for exploitation of multipath scattering in two important aspects: higher energy capture and improved sensor resolution, and consequently improved energy efficiency and larger information retrieval rates. These advantages are first quantified through improved reliability and increased capacity of information retrieval for a given sensor transmission energy. A time-reversal technique is also proposed for simultaneously addressing individual sensors. Our results indicate that the richer the multipath, the sharper the ability to address individual sensors while limiting the interference to other sensors.

In this paper, we propose an energy efficient protocol for such delay tolerant data retrieval applications. This protocol can be optimized to reduce retrieval time and energy consumption and is highly customizable to suit various network sizes and application requirements. It adopts efficient erasure codes (LT codes) and forward error correction codes (LDPC codes) to overcome the challenges in an underwater acoustic environment, such as large and variable propagation delay, low and narrow bandwidth and limited energy resources.

Several indexes have been proposed which try to reach a good trade-off between the space needed to store both the text and the index, and its search efficiency. Self-indexes are becoming more and more popular. Not only they index the text, but they keep enough information to recover any portion of it without the need of keeping it explicitly. Therefore, they actually replace the text. In this paper, we focus in a self-index known as wavelet tree. Being originally organized as a binary tree, it was designed to index the characters from a text. We present three variants of this method that aim at reducing its size, while keeping a good trade-off between space and performance, as well as making it well-suited for indexing natural language texts. The first approach we describe joins Huffman compression and wavelet trees. The other two new variants index words instead of characters and use two different word-based compressors.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2932-1","10.1109/DEXA.2007.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312859","","Binary trees;Compressors;Databases;Expert systems;Indexing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Multiple signal classification;Natural languages;Streaming media","Huffman codes;data compression;indexing;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis;trees (mathematics);wavelet transforms","Huffman compression;binary tree;document indexing;large text collection management;natural language texts indexing;self-indexes;text retrieval;wavelet trees;word-based compressors","","0","","13","","","3-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we consider the problem of exploiting the potential of learned semantics concepts, together with the combination of traditional methods, for automatic and interactive retrieval. We argue that it is important, in both automatic and interactive retrieval scenarios, to find a few relevant concepts to search with, given a multimedia query. For automatic retrieval, we show that both text and image inputs are useful for solving this query-concept-mapping (QUCOM) problem. For interactive retrieval, searching with relevant concepts plus conventional feedback methods is quite effective and is robust to initial search results. Experimental evidence on the search task of TRECVID 2006 shows that by solving QUCOM with a large lexicon of 311 semantic concept detectors, the automatic retrieval performance increases 20% and the interactive retrieval performance has the potential to outperform the state-of-the-art systems.","","POD:0-7695-2997-6","10.1109/ICSC.2007.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4338364","","Computer science;Detectors;Feedback;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Layout;Snow;Videoconference","video retrieval","automatic-interactive video retrieval;feedback methods;query-concept-mapping problem;semantic indices","","3","","20","","","17-19 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Underwater digital holography has enabled high resolution real-time data to be obtained with depths-of-field otherwise unobtainable by conventional non-holographic optical techniques. However, conventional emulsion methods provide large volume retrieval at a superior resolution. This paper will discuss a twin camera automated image retrieval system for in-line emulsion holographic reconstruction and future alternative real-time reconstruction methods using digital holography. In both techniques image acquisition and data retrieval from reconstructed holograms presents a number of challenges that hinder the ability to readily extract information. The application of holography to store high resolution three-dimensional data for large volumes is well understood, however here also belies a problem for data retrieval and large information storage, the data extraction is time-consuming and requires manual intervention. The automated holographic reconstruction system has been developed to aid the analysis, databasing and identification of objects captured by in-line holography. Whereas, the digital off-axis system presents an alternative real-time visualisation approach for underwater analysis. Digital off-axis real-time reconstruction will be presented using numerical pre-processing of captured holograms for data extraction and visualization using a spatial light modulator (SLM). This method has the advantage of recording surface information and optimizing the recording quality of holograms in-situ without the necessity of numerical post-processing. Preliminary experimental research has demonstrated optical and numerical reconstructions at interactive frame rates. Observed interlacing artifacts caused by the CCD camera used are presented and discussed. Optical and numerical reconstructions are presented using - a spatial light modulator. Fourier methods are presented using a Negative Laplacian finite impulse response filter to pre-process holograms for optimizing the numerical and optical reconstructionn.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0635-7; POD:978-1-4244-0634-0","10.1109/OCEANSE.2007.4302446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4302446","Holography","Data mining;Data visualization;Holographic optical components;Holography;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Optical filters;Optical modulation;Optical recording","FIR filters;data acquisition;data visualisation;holography;image retrieval;oceanographic techniques","CCD camera;Fourier methods;holographic image acquisition;in-line emulsion holographic reconstruction;large volume data retrieval;negative Laplacian finite impulse response filter;optical methods;remote underwater visualization;spatial light modulator;twin camera automated image retrieval system;underwater analysis;underwater digital holography","","0","","7","","","18-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed framework tackles this issue by integrating the strength of multimodal content analysis and neural network ensembles. Specifically, due to the rareness of the target events, the boostrapped sampling method is adopted to reduce the effect of class imbalance and a group of component neural networks are constructed consequently. Thereafter, a weighting scheme is applied to intelligently traverse and combine the component network predictions.

The sensor is rigidly fixed on a generic moving platform, which moves on a plane. Practical on-line applications of localization algorithms impose constraints on the execution time, problem that is addressed in this paper and compared with other existing solutions. Due to the nature of the sensor adopted, the localization algorithm is based on a fast and accurate registration algorithm, which is able to deal with noisy measurements, outliers and dynamic environments. The proposed solution relies on the RANSAC algorithm in combination with a Huber kernel in order to cope with typical nuisances in LIDAR measurements. The robust registration is successively used in combination with an extended Kalman filter to track the trajectory of the LIDAR over time, hence to solve the localization problem. Simulations and experimental results are reported to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.","2161-8070;21618070","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1154-2; POD:978-1-4244-1153-5","10.1109/COASE.2007.4341827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341827","","Clouds;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Iterative closest point algorithm;Kernel;Laser radar;Layout;Robots;Robustness;Simultaneous localization and mapping","Kalman filters;optical radar","Huber kernel;LIDAR measurements;LIDAR sensor;accurate localization;extended Kalman filter;fast RANSAC-based registration algorithm;generic moving platform;unknown environments","","8","","22","","","22-25 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many middlewares have been proposed, but they use different programming languages to manipulate functions in WSNs. This inhibits usability when manipulating multiple WSNs managed by different middlewares, because the primitives of each language have different descriptive capabilities. In this paper, we propose and apply design patterns in WSN programming to complement the capabilities of language primitives, and discuss the effectiveness of these design patterns. First, we discuss major middleware languages and compare the capabilities of their primitives. Second, we extract design patterns from the representative middlewares to cover the missing capabilities identified in the comparison. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of design patterns for WSN programming. The discussion indicates that design patterns improve the usability of manipulating multiple WSNs.","1095-2055;10952055","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1251-8; POD:978-1-4244-1250-1","10.1109/ICCCN.2007.4317965","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4317965","design pattern;middleware;wireless sensor network","Abstracts;Computer languages;Energy efficiency;Information retrieval;Middleware;Programming profession;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Software design;Usability;Wireless sensor networks","middleware;programming languages;wireless sensor networks","design patterns;language primitives;middleware;programming languages;wireless sensor network programming","","2","","11","","","13-16 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has been considered as one of main obstacles in using ontologies. Semantic Association (SA) is to depict the correlation of two concepts, and can be measured as the weight of the link. In this paper, we defined Degree of Association (DOA) to measure SA from a concept to its direct-related concept in domain ontology, and proposed a Language-Model-Based Method (LMBM) to compute DOA. Our idea comes from the intuition that the semantic relationship between two concepts implies certain semantic association of them. We took probabilistic model for computing DOA, and used Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate parameters. We tested the proposed method on two different domain ontologies, and applied it in experiments of semantic query expansion. Experimental results show the benefit of our approach and demonstrate the promising effectiveness over semantic query expansion.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2932-1","10.1109/DEXA.2007.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4312919","","Computer applications;Data engineering;Data mining;Databases;Direction of arrival estimation;Expert systems;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Ontologies;Parameter estimation","computational linguistics;maximum likelihood estimation;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","degree of association computing;direct-related concept;domain ontologies;domain ontology;language-model-based method;maximum likelihood estimation;parameter estimation;probabilistic model;semantic association;semantic query expansion;semantic relationships","","1","","8","","","3-7 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The query result also often had only ""scope"" but no ""depth"" and exited plenty of rubbishes. Traditional query mechanism was inflexible and hadn't point. So a kind of personalized query platform for heterogeneous data was given. In the research and implementation course, ontology technology was led into; as a domain model, ontology provides a common comprehension about the domain concepts and the hierarchy of the concepts; at the same time, its utilization also reduces the dependence on the comprehension technology of natural language. Firstly gave a definition of ontology, and denoted a conception object by a quintuple group, constructed domain ontology and then designed a personalized query platform based on ontology, in the following content, introduced the working process of the platform and characteristics detailedly, finally drew an conclusion that personalized query platform we designed not only assured the recall and accuracy of query but also satisfied different users' demands.","2161-9646;21619646","CD-ROM:1-4244-1312-5; POD:1-4244-1311-7","10.1109/WICOM.2007.1539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341314","","Data engineering;Educational institutions;Forestry;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Knowledge engineering;Natural languages;Ontologies;Search engines;XML","distributed databases;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing","domain ontology;heterogeneous distributed data resource;ontology-based personalized query","","0","","8","","","21-25 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are hundreds of millions of images available on the current World Wide Web. For multimedia documents, the typical keyword-based retrieval methods assume that the user has an exact goal in mind in searching a set of images whereas users normally do not know what they want, or the user faces with a repository of images whose domain is less known and content is semantically complicated. In these cases it is difficult to decide what keywords to use for the query. In this paper, we propose a user-centered image retrieval method that is based on the current Web, keyword-based annotation structure, and combining Ontology guided knowledge representation and probabilistic ranking. A Web application for image retrieval using the proposed approach has been implemented. The model provides a recommendation subsystem to support and assist the user modifying the queries and reduces the user's cognitive load with the searching space. Experimental results show that the image retrieval recall and precision rates increased and therefore demonstrates the effectiveness of the model.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1328-7; POD:9781-4244-1327-0","10.1109/COGINF.2007.4341933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4341933","","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet;Knowledge representation;Ontologies;Web sites","Internet;image retrieval;multimedia systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","World Wide Web;keyword-based annotation structure;knowledge representation;multimedia documents;probabilistic ranking;user-centered image retrieval method;user-driven ontology","","0","","25","","","6-8 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The typical subspace learning for discovering the intrinsic geometrical structure include Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). PCA discover the global Euclidean structure while LPP discovers the local manifold structure. LPP is based on a nearest neighbor graph which models the local geometrical structure of the image manifold. However, such a graph can not always accurately estimate the intrinsic manifold structure. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Iterative Locality Preserving Projections (ILPP). ILPP iteratively updates the nearest neighbor graph, so that it can better model the intrinsic manifold structure. We compared our algorithm with PCA and LPP on the COREL image database. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms PCA and LPP for image retrieval.","","POD:978-0-7695-2929-5","10.1109/ICIG.2007.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4297188","","Computer graphics;Covariance matrix;Data mining;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Nearest neighbor searches;Principal component analysis;Symmetric matrices","computational geometry;feature extraction;graph theory;image representation;image retrieval;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;principal component analysis","feature extraction;global Euclidean structure;image representation;image retrieval;intrinsic manifold structure;iterative locality preserving projection;multimedia information retrieval;nearest neighbor graph;principal component analysis;subspace learning","","0","","6","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the performance of five desktop search engines, Yahoo, Copernic, Archivarius, Google, and Windows are evaluated. An established dataset, TREC 2004 Robust track, and a set of files representing a typical desktop have been used to perform comprehension experiments. A standard set of evaluation measures including recall-precision averages, document level precision and recall, and exact precision and recall over retrieved set are used.
