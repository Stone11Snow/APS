Trace retrieval is gaining attention in the Case Based Reasoning research community, but so far it has been faced in a completely separate way from the construction of a process model from the log, instead, we propose an approach aiming at integrating these two goals. The core notion of our proposal is the log-tree, which constitutes a ""bridge"" between the notions of (log) index and process model.

The proposed method efficiently processes spatio-temporal intersection by using a spatiotemporal index to reduce the processing time for the spatiotemporal similarity search. Additionally, this paper presents the efficient spatio-temporal range search method by using this spatio-temporal index. The spatio-temporal range search is needed for the analysis and visualization in order to grasp a damage situation after spatio-temporal similarity search returns some scenarios similar to observed data. The results of the performance evaluation show that the proposed method has a shorter response time for the spatiotemporal similarity search than two conventional methods that use a temporal index and a spatial index. They also show that the response time is within about 30 seconds when the proposed method searches the database storing 50 billion time-series grid data items for some scenarios similar to 100 observed data items. As a result, the proposed method can be applied to a real environment in which a spatio-temporal similarity search needs to processed within 10 minutes. Additionally, the evaluation results show that the spatio-temporal range search method by using the spatio-temporal index can be also applied to a real environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7364041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7364041","disaster management;spatio-temporal database;spatio-temporal similarity;time-series grid data","Earthquakes;Geometry;Indexes;Search problems;Sensors","data visualisation;digital simulation;disasters;emergency management;information retrieval;time series","disaster estimation;disaster simulation results;large-scale disaster;spatio-temporal index;spatio-temporal intersection;spatio-temporal range search method;spatio-temporal similarity search;spatio-temporal similarity search method;time-series grid data;visualization","","","","12","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"MAMS: A Highly Reliable Policy for Metadata Service","J. Zhou; Y. Chen; W. Wang; D. Meng","Texas Tech Univ., Lubbock, TX, USA","2015 44th International Conference on Parallel Processing","20151210","2015","","","729","738","Most mass data processing applications nowadays often need long, continuous, and uninterrupted data access. Parallel/distributed file systems often use multiple metadata servers to manage the global namespace and provide a reliability guarantee. With the rapid increase of data amount and system scale, the probability of hardware or software failures keeps increasing, which easily leads to multiple points of failures. Metadata service reliability has become a crucial issue as it affects file and directory operations in the event of failures. Existing reliable metadata management mechanisms can provide fault tolerance but have disadvantages in system availability, state consistence, and performance overhead. This paper introduces a new highly reliable policy called MAMS (multiple actives multiple standbys) to ensure multiple metadata service reliability in file systems. Different from traditional strategies, the MAMS divides metadata servers into different replica groups and maintains more than one standby node for failover in each group. Combining the global view with distributed protocols, the MAMS achieves an automatic state transition and service takeover. We have implemented the MAMS policy in a prototyping file system and conducted extensive tests to validate and evaluate it. The experimental results confirm that the MAMS policy can achieve a faster transparent fault tolerance in different error scenarios with less influence on metadata operations. Compared with typical designs in Hadoop Avatar, Hadoop HA, and Boom-FS file systems, the mean time to recovery (MTTR) with the MAMS was reduced by 80.23%, 65.46% and 28.13%, respectively.","0190-3918;01903918","Electronic:978-1-4673-7587-0; POD:978-1-4673-7588-7","10.1109/ICPP.2015.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349628","Parallel file systems;cluster file systems;fault tolerance;metadata management;multiple metadata service","Fault tolerance;Fault tolerant systems;Metadata;Protocols;Servers;Software","avatars;fault tolerance;information retrieval;meta data;parallel processing;probability;reliability","Boom-FS file system;Hadoop HA;Hadoop avatar;MAMS;MTTR;automatic state transition;distributed file system;distributed protocol;fault tolerance;hardware failure;mean time-to-recovery;metadata service reliability;multiple active multiple standby;multiple metadata server;parallel file system;probability;reliable metadata management mechanism;software failure;transparent fault tolerance;uninterrupted data access","","1","","29","","","1-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These objectives can only be achieved if components of the IoT can be dynamically managed end-to-end across heterogeneous objects, transmission technologies, and networking architectures. Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that provides powerful tools for addressing some of these challenges. Using a software-based control plane, SDNs introduce significant flexibility for resource management and adaptation of network functions. In this article, we study some promising solutions for the IoT based on SDN architectures. Particularly, we analyze the application of SDN in managing resources of different types of networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and mobile networks, the utilization of SDN for information-centric networking, and how SDN can leverage Sensing-as-a-Service (SaaS) as a key cloud application in the IoT.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6773-8; POD:978-1-4673-6774-5","10.1109/LCNW.2015.7365931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365931","ICN;IoT;SDN;WSN;heterogeneity;resource management","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Control systems;Protocols;Sensors;Wireless sensor networks","DiffServ networks;Internet of Things;cloud computing;information retrieval;mobile computing;mobile handsets;mobile radio;quality of service;software defined networking","Internet of Things;IoT;SDN;SaaS;cloud application;context-aware semantic information retrieval;differentiated application;fine-grained QoS support;information-centric networking;mobile device;resource management;sensing-as-a-service;software-based control plane;software-defined wireless network architecture","","2","","19","","","26-29 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We collect ten thousand tweets related to ten technology brands: Apple, Google, Microsoft, Samsung, GE, IBM, Intel, Facebook, Oracle and HP. We perform sentiment analysis using SentiWordNet while we detect emotions using the NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon.

The ODISEES and OlyMPUS systems rely on an Earth science ontology and metadata repository that provide an ontological framework for describing NASA data holdings with enough detail and fidelity to enable researchers to quickly find and evaluate individual data variables. The Earth Science ontology is a highly precise and robust model of the Earth Science domain, expressed in a formal, logic-based language, that provides a conceptual framework for describing in detail the phenomena (i.e., radiation, aerosols, hydrology, carbon cycles, temperature, cloud properties, etc.) that are the subject of satellite observations and climate modeling, and the measurements of these phenomena that are the subject of NASA data products. To meet the challenges of using NASA big data to address global environmental issues, the Earth science research community needs a rich collaborative environment bringing together data access, computing capability and collaboration tools. The NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) project provides this environment. The NEX is a collaborative platform to increase the capability of researchers to analyze large datasets by staging TB to PB-scale datasets and providing analysis tools to operate on those data, saving time and costs of data transfer. The NEX roadmap calls for incorporating enhanced search capability into NEX to assist scientists in identifying applicable datasets.

However, most existing traffic generator tools either are designed for generic network applications, or only produce synthetic data based on certain time series models. In addition, few have raised their performance bar to millions-packets-per-second level with minimum time violations.

Our traffic generator stands out in the following four aspects: 1) it generates time-conforming packets based on high-fidelity reproduction of archived time series data; 2) it leverages an open-source Linux Exokernel middleware and a customized userspace network subsystem; 3) it includes a scalable 10G network card driver and uses ""absolute"" zero-copy in stack processing; and 4) it has an efficient and scalable application-level software architecture and threading model. We have conducted extensive experiments on both a quad-core Intel workstation and a 20-core Intel server equipped with Intel X540 10G network cards and Samsung's NVMe SSDs. Compared with a stock Linux baseline and a traditional mmap-based file I/O approach, we observe that our traffic generator significantly outperforms other alternatives in terms of throughput (10X), scalability (3.6X) and time violations (46.2X).","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363747","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363747","","Generators;Kernel;Linux;Message systems;Middleware;Protocols;Time series analysis","Internet of Things;Linux;information retrieval systems;middleware;parallel processing;public domain software;software architecture;telecommunication traffic;time series","IoT applications;application-level software architecture;archived data;high-performance traffic generator;minimum time violations;open-source Linux Exokernel middleware;quad-core Intel workstation;time series data;time series traffic generation","","","","38","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To enable just-in-time decision support, we set out to identify the documentation of delirium in clinical notes. Two experts annotated documents from a Pittsburgh dataset. We experimented with 3 different topic modeling methods including LDA and 2 ICD-based methods and a keyword search method for the identification of delirium related documents and sentences in clinical notes. As expected, the keyword search method is highly specific but insufficiently sensitive when searching for mentions of delirium in the documents. All 3 topic models performed better in terms of recall but worse in precision when compared with keyword search. The ICD-2 method, in particular, achieved a F-score of 0.677. In contrast, the keyword search reached a F-score of 0.442.

The growing capacity of digital documents and electronic objects storage has opened up vast new avenues for the distribution of knowledge in virtual space. This data abundance has made the task of locating relevant knowledge more complex. Such complexity drives the need for intelligent techniques for searching and for knowledge retrieval. The Artificial Intelligence and Semantic Web provide a common framework that allows knowledge to be shared and reused in an efficient way. This paper proposes a new method to gather all these resources and organize so that patrons have everything in one place and able to search and access easily. We propose a comprehensive approach for discovering information objects in large digital collections based on analysis of recorded semantic metadata and the application of artificial intelligence techniques.

Such data provides a good resource for social multimedia research. However, regarding different styles are mixed together in the internet speech data, how to classify such data remains a challenging problem. In previous work, utterance-level statistics of acoustic features are utilized as features in classifying speaking styles, ignoring the local context information. Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) has achieved exciting success in lots of research areas, such as speech recognition. It is able to retrieve context information for long time duration, which is important in characterizing speaking styles. To train LSTM, huge number of labeled training data is required. While for the scenario of internet speech data classification, it is quite difficult to get such large scale labeled data. On the other hand, we can get some publicly available data for other tasks (such as speech emotion recognition), which offers us a new possibility to exploit LSTM in the low-resource task. We adopt retraining strategy to train LSTM to recognize speaking styles in speech data by training the network on emotion and speaking style datasets sequentially without reset the weights of the network. Experimental results demonstrate that retraining improves the training speed and the accuracy of network in speaking style classification.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9953-8; POD:978-1-4799-9954-5; USB:978-1-4799-9952-1","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344667","long short-term memory;recurrent neural network;retraining;speaking style","Context;Internet;Recurrent neural networks;Speech;Speech recognition;Training;Training data","Internet;information retrieval;recurrent neural nets;social networking (online);speech processing","Internet speech data classification;LSTM;LSTM recurrent neural network;RNN;acoustic features;context information retrieval;local context information;long short term memory;low resource training;social multimedia research;social network communication;speaking style classification;speaking styles;speech recognition;understanding speaking styles;utterance level statistics","","","","15","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We tackle here the acquisition of expertise in phylogeny, which is a notoriously rich and prolific field where hundreds, if not thousands, concrete cases are reported in the literature, yet tools to assist the phylogenist in analyzing a new dataset are virtually absent. Thus, we propose an approach that amounts to ontology-based workflow mining: Our T-GROWLer system abstracts general patterns from event sequences previously extracted from texts.

However, a challenge is the positioning, both in terms of step detection, step length approximation as well as heading estimation, which must be accurate and robust, even when the use of the device is varied in terms of placement or orientation. In this paper, we propose a scheme for retrieving relevant information to detect steps and to estimate the correct step length from raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This approach uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM-RNNs). Designed to take contextual information into account, the network can process data gathered from different positions, resulting in a system, which is invariant with respect to transformation and distortions of the input patterns. An experimental evaluation on a dataset produced from 10 individuals demonstrates that this new approach achieves significant improvements over previous attempts and increase the current state-of-the-art results even in the presence of variations and degradations. We achieved a mean classification rate of 98.5% and a standard deviation of 0.70 for 10000 different test sequences and an average error of 1.45% regarding the step length. Thus is the best result on the task gathered in the experiments compared with competing techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8402-5; POD:978-1-4673-8403-2","10.1109/IPIN.2015.7346954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346954","Indoor positioning;dead reckoning;deep learning;inertial tracking;machine learning","Detectors;Estimation;Legged locomotion;Logic gates;Sensor fusion;Yttrium","indoor navigation;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pedestrians;recurrent neural nets;smart phones","BLSTM-RNN;IMU;bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks;correct step length estimation;deep learning;heading estimation;indoor positioning;inertial measurement unit data;location estimation;location navigation;machine learning;pedestrian dead reckoning;relevant information retrieval;smartphones;step detection;step length approximation","","2","","24","","","13-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, our approach aims to identify a group of users (candidates) who have the potential to answer a new question by using feature-based prediction approach and social network based prediction approach. We develop predictive models to predict whether an identified candidate answers a new question. This prediction helps motivate the knowledge exchanging in the community by routing relevant questions to potential answerers. The evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our predictive models, achieving 44% precision, 59% recall, and 49% F-measure (average across all test sets).

The theoretical framework of TCM is unique and with rich of content, which contains the complex relationships between disease and medicine. Research on question-answering (QA) over TCM is significant for Chinese NLP and representative, because the resources of TCM are mostly Chinese-based. In this paper we present a QA system over TCM, which transforms user supplied questions into conjunctive query sentences (i.e. SQL) and retrieves the answer from both the built-up dataset and online encyclopedia. The contribution of this paper is threefold: Firstly, we introduce a novel approach for word segmentation over Chinese questions. We employ a TF-IDF model on the dataset to generate domain-specific dictionary with weight factor and tags, which are computed to select the best result of segmentation. Secondly, we present a novel method for constructing queries to retrieve answers. We compute the entity-attribute distance over a set of tagged words to construct incomplete ontology instances, which are used as the intermediary to generate queries. Lastly, we propose a method to integrate web data extraction with question answering, which allows us to extract answers from online encyclopedia website (i.e. Wikipedia). The results of our evaluation with 50 benchmark queries demonstrate the value of our approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6799-8; POD:978-1-4673-6800-1","10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359945","Question-Answering System;TF-IDF;Traditional Chinese Medicine;Web Information Extraction","Cultural differences;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Text analysis;World Wide Web","Internet;diseases;medical computing;question answering (information retrieval)","Chinese NLP;Chinese cultural heritage;Chinese questions;QA system;TF-IDF model;benchmark queries;built-up dataset;disease;domain-specific dictionary;entity-attribute distance;online encyclopedia website;ontology instances;question-answering system;traditional chinese medicine;web data extraction;weight factor;word segmentation","","","","9","","","9-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, a Layered Performance Matching (LPM) model and its associated algorithm are proposed to match the request and reply speed for each layer of a memory hierarchy to improve memory performance. The rationale of LPM is that the performance of each layer of a memory hierarchy should and can be optimized to closely match the request of the layer directly above it. The LPM model simultaneously considers both data access concurrency and locality. It reveals the fact that increasing the effective overlapping between hits and misses of the higher layer will alleviate the performance impact of the lower layer. The terms pure miss and pure miss penalty are introduced to measure the effectiveness of such hit-miss overlapping. By distinguishing between (general) miss and pure miss, we have made LPM optimization practical and feasible. Our evaluation shows the data stall time can be reduced significantly with an optimized hardware configuration. We also have achieved noticeable performance improvement by simply adopting smart LPM scheduling without changing the underlying hardware configurations. Analysis and experimental results show LPM is feasible and effective. It provides a novel and efficient way to cope with the ever-widening memory wall problem, and to optimize the vital memory system design.","0190-3918;01903918","Electronic:978-1-4673-7587-0; POD:978-1-4673-7588-7","10.1109/ICPP.2015.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349643","Memory wall;concurrent average memory access time (C-AMAT);data access concurrency;data stall time;layered performance matching (LPM)","Analytical models;Concurrent computing;Hardware;Mathematical model;Optimization;Out of order;Space heating","concurrency control;information retrieval;pattern matching;scheduling","LPM model;LPM optimization;concurrency-driven layered performance matching model;data access;data access concurrency;data access locality;hit-miss overlapping;memory hierarchy;memory performance;memory wall problem;optimized hardware configuration;smart LPM scheduling","","1","","24","","","1-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, a spam webpage detection method based on topic and semantics was proposed, with the use of two categories of features, namely, semantics and statistics. Topic modeling was first performed over the contents of the webpage, with the webpage contents mapped into the topic space.

Based on the rationale that the retrieval time mainly depends on the storage media used at the server side, we introduce the concept of Provable Storage Medium (PSM), to denote the ability of a user to efficiently verify that the provider is complying to this aspect of the SLA. We propose PSM as an extension of Provable Data Possession (PDP): embedding challenge-response PDP schemes with measurements of the response time, both properties can be enforced without any need for the user to locally store nor download her data. We describe a realistic implementation of PSM in a scenario where data should be stored both in RAM and HDD. A thorough analysis shows that, even for relatively small challenges, the total time to compute and deliver the response is sensibly affected by the remarkable difference in the access time of the two supports.

To investigate the highly non-linear semantic correlation between image and text, we propose a regularized deep neural network(RE-DNN) for semantic mapping across modalities. By imposing intra-modal regularization as supervised pre-training, we finally learn a joint model which captures both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships.

This paper presents a data retrieval system by using public key encryption system with keyword search, in which the client could test whether or not the file stored in cloud server contains the keyword without leaking the information about the encrypted file. We apply asymmetric pairings to achieve shorter key size scheme in the standard model, and adopt the dual system encryption technique to reduce the scheme's secure problem to the hard Symmetric External Diffie-Hellman assumption. In the last of paper, we analyse the scheme's efficiency and point out that our scheme is more efficient and secure than some other classical data retrieval models.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8420-9; POD:978-1-4673-8421-6","10.1109/SocialSec2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371894","asymmetric pairings;data retrieval;dual system encryption;keyword search encryption","Big data;Data privacy;Security;Social network services","cloud computing;information retrieval;public key cryptography;storage management","asymmetric pairings;cloud server;cloud storage;cloud technologies;data explosion;data portability;data retrieval system;data storage;dual system encryption technique;encrypted file;information security risks;key size scheme;keyword search;privacy;public key encryption system;searchable encryption;secure data retrieval scheme;symmetric external Diffie-Hellman assumption","","","","20","","","16-18 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, there are the problems related to the integration of the WSNs in the IoT realm including those related to data access. In this paper, we address more precisely the in-network data storage and data retrieval performed in a WSN integrated in the IoT realm. In order to develop an adequate data storage scheme for this scenario, we first design a system that integrates the Virtual Broking Coding (VBC) data storage scheme in the IoT realm. Then, we propose an algorithm called Dynamic Adaptive Virtual Broking Coding (DA-VBC) that adapts dynamically the packet redundancy level adopted in VBC to the optimal redundancy level, regarding the actual condition of the network, in order to ensure a reliable data storage and data retrieval. To do so, we model the choice of the optimal redundancy level as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem. Using the optimal policy found by the MDP, DA-VBC always performs with the minimum cost-benefit for the network which means allowing more packet to be retrieved without overload the energy consumption. The simulation results confirm that the dynamic adaptation of the redundancy level improves the reliability of the data storage scheme while achieving an energy consumption comparable to the solution that does not use any redundancy. Besides, they show that the optimization of the cost-benefit metric is far more efficient than optimizing only one metric (for instance the cost or the packet delivery ratio), or using a fixed redundancy level.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1849-9; POD:978-1-5090-1850-5","10.1109/NCA.2015.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371726","Data storage;MDP;Network Coding;Optmization;Virtual Broking;WSNs","Adaptation models;Data models;Logic gates;Memory;Redundancy;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;Markov processes;adaptive codes;information retrieval;information storage;network coding;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;IoT;Markov decision process;WSN;data retrieval;dynamic adaptive virtual broking coding;energy consumption;optimal network coding-based in-network data storage;optimal policy;packet redundancy;virtual broking coding data storage scheme","","","","24","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Taking advantage of features from all three network genres (telecommunication, information, and social) will enable this balancing act. These users also need to interact using unstructured, ad-hoc queries to decrease the cognitive overload of specialized training or the necessity of learning a constrained language. High QOI can be maintained if an intelligent agent on the network can use social sensing to capture the intent of the query and identify the implied task. Knowing the task will allow other agents that service the requests to filter, summarize, or transcode data prior to responding, lessening the network footprint. This paper describes an approach that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, multi-valued logic based inferencing, network status checking, and task-relevant metrics for information retrieval. This research effort has resulted in a low-level NLP approach that can be used to capture intent from unstructured text, a quality metric formed from intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of the objects and the tasks under consideration, and a simple inferencing approach to allow intelligent agents to make quality assessments, delivering the appropriate form of the information that will lessen the impact on a disadvantaged network.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9101-6; POD:978-1-4673-9102-3","10.1109/MASS.2015.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367006","fuzzy logic;intelligent agents;natural language processing;quality of information","Bandwidth;Context;Fuzzy logic;Intelligent agents;Measurement;Natural language processing;Sensors","inference mechanisms;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multivalued logic;natural language processing","NLP technique;QOI;ad-hoc query;cognitive overload;disadvantaged network;information retrieval;intelligent agent;learning;multivalued logic based inferencing;natural language processing technique;network footprint;network status checking;quality of information;social sensing;task-relevant metric;transcode data","","","","8","","","19-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the rise of web forums where certified experts answer questions, strategies that are tailored towards addressing the new type of experts will be beneficial. In this paper, we identify a new type of user called `designated experts' (i.e., users designated as domain experts by the web administrators). These are the experts who are guaranteed by web administrators to be an expert in a given domain. Our focus is on how we can capture the unique behavior of designated experts in an online domain. We have noticed designated experts have different behaviors compared to CQA experts. In particular, unlike existing CQAs, only one designated expert responds to any given thread. To capture this intuition, we introduce a matrix factorization algorithm with regularization to capture the behavior. Our results show that the regularization method improves the performance significantly compared to the baseline approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363810","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363810","Designated Experts;Matrix factorization;Online Forums;Recommender Systems","Big data;Collaboration;Medical services;Message systems;Probabilistic logic;Recommender systems;Semantics","Web sites;matrix decomposition;question answering (information retrieval);recommender systems","CQA Web sites;Web forums;community question and answer Web sites;designated experts;forum post recommendation;matrix factorization algorithm;online forums","","","","34","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given a group of relevant articles for a news topic, the proposed method constructs original clue chains after identified theme clue sentences by the conditional random field model and then filters original chains to get theme clue chains by taking time and semantic similarity between clue chains as conditions. Each clue can be represented by its time and strength and the clues with high strength are selected as theme foci. For each theme focus, the relevant theme clue sentences corresponding to the clue chain are selected to form a summary. All summaries are then ordered chronologically to form the theme overview of the news.

Often, these community networks act as ""social sensors"" in which users sense information in the real world and mention them online. The web interfaces of these networks often support features such as keyword search that allow an user to quickly find entities of interest. While these interfaces are adequate for regular users, they are often too restrictive to answer complex queries such as (1) find 100 Twitter users from California with at least 100 followers who talked about earthquakes last year or (2) find 25 restaurants in Yelp with at least 10 5-star reviews with 10 or more 'useful' points. In this paper, we investigate the problem of answering complex queries that involve non-searchable attributes through the web interface of an online community network. We model such a network as a heterogeneous graph with two access channels, Content Search and Local Search. We propose a number of efficient algorithms that leverage properties of the heterogeneous graph and also propose a strategy selection algorithm based on the concept of multi-armed bandits.

Different applications, such as document structuring or information retrieval have led to the exploration of speaker diarization in many different domains, from broadcast news to lectures, phone conversations and meetings. Almost all current diarization systems are offline and ill-suited to the growing need for online or real-time diarization, stemming from the increasing popularity of powerful, mobile smart devices. While a small number of such systems have been reported, truly online diarization systems for challenging and highly spontaneous meeting data are lacking.

"Analyzing the Moving Parts of a Large-Scale Multi-label Text Classification Pipeline: Experiences in Indexing Biomedical Articles","A. Rios; R. Kavuluru","Dept. of Comput.

In the 2014 version of MeSH terminology there are a total of 27,149 terms. Librarians at the NLM tag each biomedical article to be indexed for the PubMed literature search system with terms from MeSH. This means the human indexers look at each article's full text and index it with a small set of descriptors, 13 on average, from over 27,000 descriptors available in MeSH. There have been many recent attempts to automate this process focused on using the article title and abstract text to predict MeSH terms for the corresponding article. There has also been an open automated biomedical indexing challenge, BioASQ [1], that started in 2013. The best general supervised learning framework in these challenges has been a pipeline with four different components: 1. pre-processing and feature extraction; 2. employing the binary relevance and/or nearest neighbor approaches to select a set of candidate terms; 3. ranking these candidate terms using corresponding informative features; and 4. applying label calibration to dynamically predict the number of top terms to be included in the final selection for the current instance. The specific details in how each of these components is implemented determines the performance variations of various entries in the challenge. In this paper, we analyze these moving parts of the MeSH indexing multilabel classification pipeline with experiments involving different combinations. Our best combination achieves ≈ 1% increase in micro F-score compared with the top performing team across the five weeks of the final batch of the BioASQ 2014 challenge. The main take away from our efforts is that small improvements/modifications to different components of the pipeline can offer moderate improvements to the overall performance of the method. Our experiences show that, at least thus far, top perfor- ances have resulted mostly due to these improvements rather than drastic changes of the core methodology.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9548-9; POD:978-1-4673-9549-6","10.1109/ICHI.2015.6","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349667","","Biological system modeling;Calibration;Indexing;Pipelines;Support vector machines;Training;Vocabulary","feature extraction;indexing;information retrieval;medical computing;pattern classification;text analysis","MeSH;PubMed literature search system;biomedical article indexing;feature extraction;medical subject heading;multilabel text classification pipeline","","","","26","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Forming a network constructively eliminates the problem of unnecessarily learning of neural network thus save time. The quantum computing concept gives large subspace for selection of appropriate connection weight in evolutionary ways. Also, the threshold value is decided using the quantum computing concept. To increase the performance of system, a Web crawler is also proposed which find objection URLs on the Web according to the objectionable keywords. The proposed algorithm is tested on Web data, to develop a firewall which detects malicious Web request. Extensive testing on 2000 objectionable and non objectionable URLs are done which shows that proposed system works efficiently for detection of objectionable content.

In microblogging, hash tags mean some topic words between two '#', such as some social events or some hot topics. Hash tags can highlight the topic of tweets, and make tweets be easily searched and understood by others. Therefore, many users like adding hash tags for their tweets. Existing hash tag recommendation methods always consider semantic similarity between hash tags and tweets as the only key factor. However, the hash tags' user acceptance degree and development tendency are two important factors for evaluate the recommendation probability of them. In this paper, we propose a model for recommending some related hash tags for users to choose one or more of them as content added into forthcoming tweets. The above three factors have been considered to complete this task, which are the semantic similarity between a hash tag and a tweet, the user acceptance degree of the hash tag, and the development tendency of the hash tag. Experimental results on a dataset from Sina Weibo, one of the largest Chinese microblogging websites, show usefulness of the proposed model for recommending hash tags to forthcoming tweets.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8697-2; POD:978-1-4799-8698-9","10.1109/SMC.2015.348","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379480","forthcoming tweets;hashtag development tendency detection;hashtag recommendation;microblogging;topic model;web service","Data models;Semantics;Splines (mathematics);Tagging;Time series analysis;Training;Twitter","information retrieval;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Chinese microblogging Web site;Sina Weibo;hash tag development tendency;hashtags recommendation method;recommendation probability;semantic similarity;tweets;user acceptance degree","","","","19","","","9-12 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This fact led to a lot of lecture recordings which include knowledge for a variety of subjects. The typical way of searching these videos is by title and description. Unfortunately, not all important keywords and facts are mentioned in the title or description if they are available. Furthermore, there is no possibility to analyze how important those detected keywords are for the whole video. Another lecture archive specific virtue is that every regular university lecture is repeated yearly. Normally this will lead to duplicate lecture recordings. In search results doubling is disturbing for students when they want to watch the most recent lectures from the search result. This paper deals with the idea to resolve these problems by analyzing the recorded lecture slides with Optical Character Recognition (OCR). In addition to the name and description the OCR data will be used for a full text analysis to create an index for the lecture archive search. Furthermore, a fuzzy search is introduced. This will solve the issue of misspelled search requests and OCR detection defects. Additionally, this paper deals with the performance issues of a full text search with an in-memory database, issues in OCR detection, handling duplicate recordings of lectures repeated every year. Finally, an evaluation of the search performance in comparison with other database ideas besides the in-memory database is performed. Additionally, a user acceptability survey for the search results to increase the learning experience on lecture archives was performed. As a result, this paper shows how to handle the big amount of OCR data for a full text live search performed on an in-memory database in reasonable time. During this search a fuzzy search is performed additionally to resolve spelling mistakes and OCR detection problems. In conclusion this paper shows a solution for - n enhanced video lecture archive search that supports students in online research processes and enhances their learning experience.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8297-7; POD:978-1-4673-8298-4","10.1109/CSE.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371371","","Indexes;Multimedia communication;Optical character recognition software;Search engines;Search problems;Synchronization","computer aided instruction;database management systems;information retrieval;optical character recognition","OCR slide detection;fuzzy search;in-memory database technology;keyword detection;lecture archive search;lecture recordings;optical character recognition;text search;user acceptability survey;video lecture archives","","","","14","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is because ICN has various scalability and feasibility challenges, and host-to-host communication is also diffused like remote login, VoIP, and so on. Therefore, the authors' research aims to establish the feature of information-centric network on conventional IP network to achieve feasible architecture. In this paper, we propose to operate Breadcrumbs (BC) and Content Delivery Network (CDN) frameworks coordinately on IP network to improve the performance on content retrieval and acquisition.

The proposed algorithm not only utilizes the conventional pairwise constraints, including the Must-link constraint (ML) and the Cannot-link constraint (CL), but also designs a new kind of constraints called the associative-link constraint (AL).

Each execution interleaving sequence can be used as a test scenario to evaluate the correctness of the system. Both the exponential interleaving space and non-deterministic execution make testing concurrent systems a challenging task. Concurrency errors are classified as synchronization, data-race, data inconsistency, starvation, and deadlock. A good test suite must have test scenarios that uncover above all classes of errors. Selecting test scenarios to uncover above errors needs a systematic analysis of test scenarios to classify them into one of concurrency behaviors. In this paper, we propose an approach to analyze test scenarios from UML models using a state-based classifier. First, we present an extension to UML models to represent data access-tags, which help generating data-access traces. Then, we generate test scenarios from extended UML models using existing test scenario generation techniques. After that, we analyze test scenarios using enhanced state machine diagram (ESMD) classifier for concurrency behaviors, like sequentilization, synchronization, blocking, and non-blocking scenarios. Experimental results show ESMD classifier classifies test scenario accurately thereby helping to design test suite for concurrency testing. Selected test scenarios achieve better concurrency behavior coverage and avoid false test scenarios.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7946-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7948-9; POD:978-1-4673-7949-6","10.1109/IC3.2015.7346739","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346739","Activity Diagram;Concurrency Testing;ESMD Classifier;Sequence Diagram;State Machine Diagram;Test Scenario Selection;UML Models","Concurrent computing;Java;Message systems;Software;Synchronization;Testing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;finite state machines;information retrieval;parallel processing;pattern classification;program testing","ESMD classifier;Test Scenario Selection;UML model;concurrency error;concurrency testing;data access-tag;data inconsistency;enhanced state machine diagram classifier;parallel system;state-based classifier;synchronization;systematic analysis;test scenario generation technique","","","","20","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our experiment, which was conducting regarding to one of the citation-based papers' recommendation systems, Google Scholar, as a baseline, shows that citation-based systems like Google scholar are very vulnerable to ignore more related but less cited papers while systems based on the textual value of papers can be more successful to recommend papers that are more similar to the input paper. However, comparing full-textual content of papers is a time consuming and aggressive process, while achieving a summarized version of papers and comparing them, can be both faster and reusable.

The proposed API primarily consists of two components, namely; DB connector and the API functions. Proposed ""AccessBIM"" DB will be implemented using real-time database such as ""PostgreSQL"". The weighted focus will be given to the areas such as Queries, Indexes and Transactions in relation to tuning the DB and the queries. The performance of the proposed API will be evaluated based on the time required to parse and Data insert rate and retrieval rates.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-9439-0; Electronic:978-1-4673-9441-3; POD:978-1-4673-9442-0","10.1109/ICTER.2015.7377713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377713","AccessBIM;Data Model;Database Optimization;indoor navigation","Navigation","SQL;application program interfaces;database management systems;handicapped aids;indoor environment;indoor navigation;information retrieval;vision defects","API functions;AccessBIM database;AccessBIM features;DB connector;PostgreSQL;data insert rate;data retrieval rates;database connection initiation;database connection termination;database modelling;function call;function return;indoor environment;real-time database;relational schema;vision impaired indoor navigation systems","","","","","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We thoroughly analyzed touch points between e-commerce enterprises and consumers, and proposed an E-commerce Communication Model (ECM), which consisted of three stages and two paths. Driven strategies of ECM had been designed based on Cognitive Reaction Model. Driven strategies can attract consumer's attention and stimulate their interest in information search stage and information exposure stage, then strengthen consumer's cognition and gain their trust in page communication stage, ultimately ensure them to smoothly implement purchasing behavior in transaction stage. Main function of driven strategies was to drive consumers to shift successfully from upper stage to next stage, preventing them running off in upper stage, which can improve the turnover rate of e-commerce websites. Finally, we discussed research findings and limitations.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1891-1; POD:978-1-4799-1892-8","10.1109/LISS.2015.7369715","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7369715","EMC;cognitive reaction model;driven strategies","Advertising;Cognition;Companies;Electronic countermeasures;Optimization;Search engines","Web sites;cognition;electronic commerce;information retrieval;modelling;purchasing","ECM model;cognitive reaction model;driven strategy;e-commerce Web site;e-commerce communication model;information exposure stage;information search stage;purchasing behavior;transaction stage","","","","13","","","27-29 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A GMRT is a special formal concept in Formal Concept Analysis. Mining GMRTs from data is based on Galois' lattice construction. Four situations of learning are considered: inserting an object (value) and deleting an object (value). The approach proposed can be very useful for many information retrieval applications related to the changeable environment: mining logical rules from dynamic databases, intrusion detection, Web page classification, Web mining, constructing dynamic knowledge bases and many others.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7606-8; POD:978-1-4673-7607-5; USB:978-1-4673-7605-1","10.1109/IntelliSys.2015.7361258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7361258","Galois' lattice;dynamic classification context;formal concept;good classification test;incremental learning;insertion (deletion) of attribute value;insertion (deletion) of object;machine learning","Context;Data mining;Electronic mail;Heuristic algorithms;Knowledge based systems;Lattices;Training","Internet;data mining;formal concept analysis;information retrieval;lattice theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","GMRT;GMRT mining;Galois lattice construction;Web mining;Web page classification;context-dependent incremental learning;dynamic databases;dynamic knowledge base construction;formal concept analysis;good maximally redundant tests;information retrieval applications;intrusion detection;logical rule mining;object deletion;object insertion","","","","34","","","10-11 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we aim to predict whether a user is getting depressed or not through his blog posts on the Internet. For this purpose, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find out top frequency words appearing in a user's diaries and use SentiWordNet to calculate the emotion score of the user. Experimental results show that our method is useful in the diagnosis of mental disorder detection in social platforms.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8697-2; POD:978-1-4799-8698-9","10.1109/SMC.2015.217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379349","Depression;Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA);SentiWordNet","Blogs;Cleaning;Mental disorders;Pragmatics;Resource management;Training;Twitter","behavioural sciences computing;information retrieval;social networking (online)","Internet;SentiWordNet;blog posts;latent Dirichlet allocation;mental disorder detection;mental disorder measurement;social platforms;user emotion score","","","","17","","","9-12 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
