The relevance feedback is supposed to work with interactive keyword map system, which visualizes the relationship between keywords extracted from retrieved results. As the first step for realizing relevance feedback based on interactive keyword map, this paper also proposes the algorithm for extracting the pair of keywords that reflects a userpsilas interest from the keyword map.

According to the comparison, the surface air temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) in July has continuously increased during the past century, which is associated to the increases in greenhouse gases mostly CO2 and in volcanic activity, demonstrating that: A. The variation in the surface air temperature is approximately out of phase with that of the volcanic activity index. In other words, when volcanic activity occurs frequently, a cooling in the NH surface layer corresponds; and on the contrary, the inactive volcanic activity corresponds to a warming event. The variation in volcanic activity strongly impacts the variation in the surface air temperature, the variance contribution of which is 39.22%. B. The increase in CO2 concentration is largely consistent with that of the summer surface air temperature in the NH. However, the increase in the air temperature is not in a linear pattern, during which several cooling events interrupts. The cooling event during early 20th century is a remarkable one, so are the ones between 1950s and 1970s. Analysis shows that these events are induced by volcanic activity. The variance of contribution of CO2 variation is 38.55%. C. The variation in CO2 concentration and the volcanic activity has a significant influence on the variation in surface air temperature of the NH. The variance contribution of the two factors reaches 77.76%.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5171327","CO2 concentration;Information retrieval;climate change;volcanic activity","Computer science;Cooling;Data engineering;Filtration;Global warming;Information retrieval;Ocean temperature;Sea surface;Volcanic activity;Volcanoes","carbon compounds;environmental science computing;global warming;information filtering;volcanology","CO<sub>2</sub>;Northern Hemisphere;climate variability;cooling event;greenhouse gas;inactive volcanic activity;information retrieval;successive filtration;surface air temperature;volcanic activity index;warming event","","0","","43","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a user query, OBIRE computes the degree of matches to indicate the similarity of a published record to the query. When searching for information, users can incorporate their domain knowledge into their queries which guides OBIRE to discover the bibliographic records that are of most interest of users.

Nevertheless, the results obtained confirm that in a content-based IR system it is more desirable to give more weight to the documents retrieved by the speech-based IR subsystem than those retrieved by the image-based IR subsystem.","","POD:978-1-4244-4138-9","10.1109/SNLP.2009.5340915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340915","","Automatic speech recognition;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;System testing;XML","content-based retrieval;data analysis;speech processing;text analysis;video retrieval","content-based IR system;content-based information retrieval system;image retrieval;speech content;speech-based retrieval module;text data;video searching;visual data","","0","","12","","","20-22 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this setting, human inspection and annotation is subjective and, more importantly, impractical. In this letter, we propose a knowledge-discovery algorithm that uses content-based methods to link low-level image features with high-level visual semantics in an effort to automate the process of retrieving semantically similar images. Our algorithm represents geospatial images by using a high-dimensional feature vector and generates a set of association rules that correlate semantic terms with visual patterns represented by discrete feature intervals. We also provide a mathematical model to customize the relevance of feature measurements to semantic assignments as well as methods of querying by semantics and by example.","1545-598X;1545598X","","10.1109/LGRS.2009.2017214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4914801","Data mining;geospatial;image database;semantic query","","data mining;geophysical image processing;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);visual databases","associative mining techniques;automatic learning;content-based geospatial information retrieval;feature measurements;geospatial intelligence;high-level visual semantics;human inspection;image database;knowledge-discovery algorithm;low-level image features;mathematical model;querying by example;querying by semantics;semantic assignments;visual-semantic modeling","","13","","23","","20090512","Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Latent semantic indexing (LSI) techniques applied to the training set to obtain the language relations. After the training, we have performed set of tests (queries) to measure the effectiveness of LSI based retrieval on Turkish-English parallel corpus.

In this paper, we present a mechanism for gauging similarity of Arabic documents using fuzzy IR model. Similarity degree of two documents is the averaged similarity among statements treated as equal although they have been restructured or reworded. We introduced some fuzzy similarity sets such as near duplicate, very similar, similar, slightly similar, dissimilar and very dissimilar. These similarity sets can be implemented as a spectrum of values ranges from 1 (duplicate) and 0 (different). Our corpus collection has been built in which all stop words were removed and nonstop words were stemmed using typical Arabic IR techniques. The corpora has 100 documents with 4477 statements and 54346 non-stop-word, stemmed words in total. Another 15 query documents with 303 statements and 1620 words were specifically constructed for our test. Experimental results show that fuzzy IR can be used to define the extent documents are similar or dissimilar, where similarity can be mapped to one of the proposed fuzzy sets. The performance of our fuzzy IR system, measured in fuzzy precision and fuzzy recall, shows that it outperforms Boolean IR in retrieving more documents that have similar content but with different synonyms.","","POD:978-1-4244-4456-4","10.1109/ICADIWT.2009.5273835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5273835","Arabic;Fuzzy IR;Information Retrieval;Similarity","Aggregates;Content based retrieval;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;HTML;Humans;Information retrieval;Testing;Uncertainty","document handling;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;natural languages","Arabic document similarity gauging;fuzzy information retrieval;fuzzy similarity sets;human language;nonstop-word stemmed words;statements","","2","","13","","","4-6 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Agents in our system are required to endow with the full range of cognitive abilities, including perception, use of natural language, learning and the ability to understand the user query. The speed and accuracy of retrieval and the usefulness of the retrieved data depends on a number of factors including constant or frequent changes in its content or status, the effects of environmental factors such as the weather and traffic and the techniques that are used to categorize the relevance of the retrieved data. In this paper, we propose semantic TFIDF, an agent-based system for retrieving location-aware information that can improves the speed of retrieval while maintaining or even improving the accuracy by making use of semantic information in the data to develop smaller training sets. In our method, intelligent agents first gather location-aware data and then, using semantic graphs in the WordNet English dictionary, they classify, match and organize the information to find a best match for a user query.

Only results that have not appeared in some earlier selected resource are focused on in later selected resources. The score of each resource is decided by the total weights of those merged results included in, and only the resource with max score is selected in each selecting step.

When appropriate settings are chosen, it is possible to mimic classical systems, thus yielding results rivaling those of state-of-the-art systems. These positive results validate the proposed approach, while negative ones give some insights on the properties needed by such a model.

We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method for the topic model, and introduce the notion of acoustic words for supporting modeling within this framework.

However currently, the existing information retrieval methods are mainly based on keyword matching, which can not fully take advantage of the information context and potential knowledge. All of these methods are particularly inefficient as to geospatial information which is more complex and unstructured. Nevertheless, geospatial ontology (Geo-ontology) has been used to enrich geospatial objects with semantic information which could be very helpful in the geospatial information retrieval and integration. And there is a wealth of relations between objects (such as the relation between bay and the inter-tidal zone) in bay field. Thus in this paper, an intelligent bay geo-information retrieval approach based on bay geo-information ontology has been proposed. Firstly, the procedure of establishing the bay geo-information ontology database is introduced. Secondly, both the intelligent retrieval mechanism and approach in bay geo-information are expatiated, which are used to convert the user retrievals request to semantic request and map the semantic request to concrete query of actual data source by adopting the knowledge that's explicitly expressed in formal ontology modeling language (OWL). Finally, the method was applied in the bay information management system, and the feasibility and efficacy of the geo-information retrieval approach is well verified.","2161-024X;2161024X","POD:978-1-4244-4562-2","10.1109/GEOINFORMATICS.2009.5293524","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5293524","Bay Geo-Information System;Geo-Ontology;Information Retrieva","Concrete;Databases;Explosions;Helium;Informatics;Information management;Information retrieval;Natural languages;OWL;Ontologies","geographic information systems;information retrieval;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);visual databases","geo-information ontology database;geospatial information;information explosion;information integration;information sharing;intelligent bay geo-information retrieval;keyword matching;ontology modeling language","","0","","25","","","12-14 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we convert the translation of query sentence to the weight computation of the translations of the query keyword based on large-scale bilingual parallel corpora, and thereafter reconstruct the query sentence in target language. The experimental results show that the approach achieves an average retrieval accuracy of 93.4% in the front 10 retrieval results and 89.1% in the front 100 retrieval results, while the retrieval error rate is reduced by 63.62% over the purely dictionary-based baseline.","","POD:978-1-4244-4754-1","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358174","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358174","CLIR;query sentencee;translation of query keyword;weight computation","Computational linguistics;Concurrent computing;Error analysis;Information retrieval;Internet;Large-scale systems;Natural languages;Optical computing;Performance analysis;Testing","natural language processing;query formulation","bilingual parallel corpora;cross-language information retrieval;query keywords translation;query sentence;translation weight computation","","0","","8","","","20-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is difficult to avoid involving noise information and inappropriate related terms with ambiguous sense in the process of finding related terms and computing mutual information. To solve this problem, we propose to add context information in a document when choosing related terms by clustering method, and use Mahalanobis distance instead of Euclidean distance in re-ranking query result with term mutual information.

Therefore, we proposed an MIR system that utilizes the userpsilas acoustic signal from a singing voice and retrieves the music information using both lyrics and melody information. The lyrics recognition module uses a keyword spotting system based on text-content of the lyrics by an HMM comparison engine. The melody recognition module extracts pitch and MFCC features from the user singing input and then retrieves music by a GMM comparison engine. Consequently, the proposed MIR system consists of fusing the lyrics and melody recognition module in which the melody recognition especially operates to restrict recognition candidates.

Computational linguistics proposes two main methods to cope with word ambiguity: sense disambiguation and sense discrimination.

This text could not always be adherent to the discussed subject. The main motivation leads to the need of developing methods that would allow the extraction of relevant information in such scenario. A result system was designed upon ideas from the semantic Web combined with an adaptation of the classic vector model for information retrieval. The semantic information is not embedded in the media but within a structurally independent ontology. It was implemented using Java and a MySQL database. The objective was the achievement of, at least, 80% for recall and precision on the system results. The system was considered successful by achieving rates of 100% of recall and approximately 93% of precision.","","POD:978-1-4244-5334-4","10.1109/CSE.2009.285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283263","Information retrieval;Ontology;Social media;Wiki","Customer satisfaction;Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Java;Natural languages;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Software tools;Terminology","Java;SQL;information retrieval;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Java;MySQL database;information retrieval;natural language;ontology;semantic Web;social media;wikis","","0","","11","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Guan","Ryerson Multimedia Research Laboratory, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada","2009 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","20090818","2009","","","830","833","In this paper, a multimodal image retrieval framework integrating the information in both audio and visual domain via Bayesian decision level fusion is proposed. In both domains, a statistical model for each semantic class is learned. Based on the Bayes' theorem, the a posteriori probability of each class given a query is calculated in the audio domain, which is propagated to the images classified into the corresponding semantic class in the visual domain. These probabilistic measures are utilized as the a priori probability in the overall framework, which is combined with the likelihood evaluated based on nearest neighbor content-based image retrieval. Through the Bayes' theorem again, the images are ranked based on their a posteriori probabilities given the audio and visual feature of a query. To further improve the system, we also propose a relevance feedback scheme in the audio domain. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over the retrieval simply based on visual features.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202623","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202623","Multimodal Bayesian image retrieval","Bayesian methods;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Natural languages;Nearest neighbor searches;Probability","Bayes methods;content-based retrieval;image classification;image retrieval;maximum likelihood estimation","Bayes theorem;Bayesian decision level fusion;Bayesian information fusion;a posteriori probability;audio domain;image classification;multimodal image retrieval;nearest neighbor content-based image retrieval;semantic class;statistical model;visual domain","","0","1","16","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper provides a basic resource construction technique for semantic web information processing. Firstly it puts forward a Chinese domain knowledge composition model. Then it introduces how to construct special domain knowledge-base. The construction mainly based on database schemas, web query page interfaces and traditional knowledge construction methods Techniques about knowledge acquisition, knowledge representation, knowledge storage and reasoning are discussed in detail. The main knowledge architecture is a semantic network which is constituted by many kinds of knowledge units. We have worked on it for web Chinese information in several domains and achieved tangible results. The research is valuable to large scale applications of intelligent information integration and information retrieval on the Web.","2155-6083;21556083","POD:978-0-7695-3571-5","10.1109/GCIS.2009.449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5209302","Information searching;Knowledge enginerring;Web information integration","Computer science;Databases;Dictionaries;Educational institutions;Information processing;Information retrieval;Intelligent structures;Intelligent systems;Knowledge engineering;Ontologies","Internet;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition;knowledge representation","Web information integration;Web information retrieval;Web query page interfaces;database schemas;intelligent Web structured information processing;intelligent information integration;knowledge acquisition;knowledge architecture;knowledge composition model;knowledge representation;knowledge storage;knowledge-base construction;resource construction technique;semantic Web information processing","","0","","11","","","19-21 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By a certain metric of similarity, Web clustering groups the similar Web documents. But the classical algorithms of clustering are aimless in searching the solution space and absent of semantic characters. In this paper, the probabilistic latent semantic indexing (PLSI) models which using word segmentation, two-grams and key words extraction separately are compared. As comparison, vector models using different Chinese information retrieval technologies are also tested in the same time. The experimental results show that the correct word segmentation can improve precision of information retrieval obviously to PLSI model. But it isn't effective to vector space model. And index based on key words extraction obtains highest accuracy rate to PLSI model.","","POD:978-0-7695-3600-2","10.1109/IFITA.2009.532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232186","Chinese information retrieval;N-Grams retrieval;probabilistic latent semantic indexing;word segmentation","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Educational institutions;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Machine assisted indexing;Space technology","Internet;data mining;indexing;information retrieval","Chinese information retrieval;Internet;PLSI model;Web clustering;Web documents;Web mining;key words extraction;probabilistic latent semantic indexing model;word segmentation","","0","","5","","","15-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The accurate determination of the identity of the script is paramount to many post-processing steps such as document sorting, translation and in determining the choice of linguistic resources to use for OCR or handwriting recognition. However, few works exist with regards to the identification of online handwritten scripts, partly due to the large variations and challenges innate in handwritten scripts. This paper proposes a novel approach for online handwritten script identification based on the information retrieval model. We attempt to identify among three script families; Arabic, Roman and Tamil scripts, which attained an average accuracy of 93.3% from our results. This signifies promising potential in utilizing information retrieval models for script identification.","1520-5363;15205363","POD:978-1-4244-4500-4","10.1109/ICDAR.2009.162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5277680","Information retrieval;Online handwriting;Script identification","Computer science;Delay;Handwriting recognition;Information retrieval;Ink;Robustness;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text analysis;Voting","document image processing;handwriting recognition;handwritten character recognition;image retrieval;optical character recognition","OCR;document analysis;document sorting;document translation;handwriting recognition;information retrieval model;linguistic resource;online handwritten script identification","","3","","17","","","26-29 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
