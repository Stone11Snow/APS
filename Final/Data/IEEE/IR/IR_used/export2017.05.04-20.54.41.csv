Emphasis is placed on ranking problems in question answering, where the frequency of correct candidates is very low but a single correct answer at one of the top ranks is often sufficient. Since existing tree learners handle this task poorly, decision tree induction is reformulated in such a way that it directly optimizes a given measure of ranking quality (such as mean reciprocal rank or mean average precision). This change also makes it possible to incorporate a priori knowledge about the positive or negative effect of an attribute on ranking quality. Results are further improved by applying a stratified form of bagging. In a passage reranking task using factoid questions from the QA.CLEF evaluations, the new method outperforms existing tree induction techniques by a large margin.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381836","focused retrieval;learning to rank;mean reciprocal rank (MRR);probability estimation tree (PET);question answering (QA)","Bagging;Current measurement;Decision trees;Frequency estimation;Induction generators;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Machine learning;Positron emission tomography;Training data","decision trees;information retrieval;probability","answer passages;decision tree induction;mean average precision;mean reciprocal rank;passage reranking task;probability-based ranking;question answering system","","0","","17","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the problem of enabling effective peer-to-peer resource sharing in this type of networks. Starting from the well-known Chord protocol for resource sharing in wired networks, we propose a specialization that accounts for peculiar features of wireless mesh networks: namely, the availability of a wireless infrastructure, and the 1-hop broadcast nature of wireless communication, which bring to the notions of location awareness and MAC layer cross-layering. Through extensive packet-level simulations, we investigate the separate effects of location awareness and MAC layer cross-layering, and of their combination, on the performance of the P2P application. The combined protocol, MeshChord, reduces message overhead of as much as 40 percent with respect to the basic Chord design, while at the same time improving the information retrieval performance. Notably, differently from the basic Chord design, our proposed MeshChord specialization displays information retrieval performance resilient to the presence of both CBR and TCP background traffic. Overall, the results of our study suggest that MeshChord can be successfully utilized for implementing file/resource sharing applications in wireless mesh networks.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2009.134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196675","Wireless mesh networks;community networks;cross-layering.;distributed hash tables;peer-to-peer resource sharing","Availability;Broadcasting;Communications technology;Information retrieval;Mobile radio mobility management;Peer to peer computing;Resource management;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks","mobility management (mobile radio);peer-to-peer computing;wireless mesh networks","MAC layer cross-layering;file/resource sharing applications;location awareness;peer-to-peer resource sharing;wireless infrastructure;wireless mesh networks","","33","","25","","20090807","March 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Studies of human perception on the tasks of scene classification and visual search have shown that human visual system makes extensive use of contextual information as postprocessing in order to index objects. Several recent computer vision approaches use contextual information to improve object recognition performance. They mainly use global information of the whole image by dividing the image into several predefined subregions, so called fixed grid. In this paper we propose an alternative approach to retrieval of contextual information, by customizing the location of the grid based on salient objects in the image. We claim this approach to result in more informative contextual features compared to the fixed grid based strategy. To compare our results with the most relevant and recent papers, we use PASCAL 2007 data set.

Employing statistics, metadata and query log, we construct a dynamic termset corpus, and the index is built based on termset. When processing query, the peer extracts the termsets from the query terms, and each termset is treated as a key. Several methods are applied to reduce bandwidth consumption.

"Security model for resource availability - subject and object type enforcement","O. E. Hedenstad","Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Norway","MILCOM 2009 - 2009 IEEE Military Communications Conference","20100115","2009","","","1","7","Confidentiality, integrity and availability are the three basic aspects of information security. The purpose of the paper is to refine the availability dimension. In the context of security an object is the passive entity to be protected. ""Object"" can refer to both an information object and to a resource, e.g. the program (or service) that retrieves the information and enables access to it. Thus, we make a distinction between information and resource availability. We propose a new security model for resource availability called ""subject and object type enforcement"" (SOTE). The model can express policies for information flow between resources of different administrative domains. It controls the types of resources that are allowed to interact. The ability to express the security requirements and conditions a resource must fulfill, is also part of the model. SOTE is a variation of type enforcement. The main difference is that SOTE is a model for information flow control instead of operating system access control. Type enforcement is well suited for restricting information flows. In particular type enforcements can express intransitive (indirect) information flows. The SOTE model can express such information flow policies at a fine-grained level. This is a prerequisite for flexible and secure information flow in heterogeneous environment where the domains do not implement the same set of security policies and security levels. We also describe how multiple security models can be combined in order to express a composite security policy for information flow. We combine the classic multilevel security models (Bell-LaPadula and Biba) with the SOTE resource availability model.","2155-7578;21557578","POD:978-1-4244-5238-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5380077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380077","","Access control;Availability;Computer security;Information retrieval;Information security;Multidimensional systems;Multilevel systems;Operating systems;Protection;Unified modeling language","data integrity;resource allocation;security of data","Bell-LaPadula security model;Biba security model;SOTE model;information availability;information flow control;information security model;object type enforcement;resource availability;subject type enforcement","","0","","15","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, this paper concludes existing researches and divides the way of high-level semantic processing into three main categories: (1) using relevance feedback based on-line learning to integrate effectively users' high level semantic knowledge; (2) using off-line machine learning methods to narrow the gap between high-level semantic knowledge and low-level object representation; (3) using object ontology to define high-level concepts.

It is the purpose of this paper to show how to adapt the √Ç¬øbagging√Ç¬ø approach, originally introduced in the classification/regression context, in order to improve the performance of tree-based ranking rules with regard to these disadvantages. Whereas the notion of majority voting scheme applies to a local prediction problem such as classification or regression in a natural fashion, it is much less straightforward to determine how to average the orderings predicted by many ranking trees. Here we propose various strategies for bagging tree ranking rules inspired by recent advances in the field of rank aggregation for the Web. Strong empirical evidence supporting the fact that they may drastically reduce the variability of unstable statistical procedures such as the TREERANK method is also provided through a simulation study.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381367","Bipartite ranking;ROC optimization;bagging;consensus ranking;decision trees;rank aggregation","Bagging;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Medical diagnosis;Predictive models;Regression tree analysis;Risk management;Telecommunications","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis","TREERANK method;World Wide Web;bagging ranking trees;bipartite ranking;classification context;decision tree induction algorithms;local prediction problem;majority voting scheme;rank aggregation;regression context;statistical procedures;tree-based prediction rules;tree-based ranking rules","","0","","23","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most traditional classification systems represent the contents of documents with vector space model (VSM) which represents documents with a set of index terms. However, this model needs a high dimensional space to represent the documents and it does not take into account the semantic relationship between terms, which could lead to poor classification performance. In contrast, SVD can represent relations among very large number of words and very large number of natural text passages in which they occur. It can not only greatly reduce the dimensionality but also discover the important relationships between terms. Based on this idea, we use singular value decomposition (SVD) to represent our documents in this paper. Then we use neural network constructed by cascade correlation (CC) algorithm to classify these represented documents. The experiments show that our method helps to accelerate the training speed and improves the classification accuracy as well.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-3836-5; POD:978-1-4244-3835-8","10.1109/AICI.2009.257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376519","SVD;cascade correlation;text categorization","Artificial intelligence;Computational intelligence;Content management;Information management;Information retrieval;Matrix decomposition;Neural networks;Singular value decomposition;Space technology;Text categorization","classification;neural nets;singular value decomposition;text analysis","SVD;cascade correlation algorithm;neural network;singular value decomposition;text categorization","","1","","6","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ontologies are defined using OWL (Web ontology language) which is based on XML. All the OWL documents are stored in the form of specialized XML files. With the increase in the semantic Websites number of ontologies describing different domains also grow and with their growth there comes a problem of storing these ontologies. With the passage of time it has been established that RDBMS (relational database management systems) is the most efficient and reliable data structure in terms of storage and retrieval. To store OWL documents in RDBMS multiple techniques have been proposed, but they still lack the advantages of RDBMS. All the databases in RDBMS are closed in nature, but OWL documents are inherently dynamic and semi-structured. So, there is a need to preserve the dynamic OWL documents in the relational structure in such an way that no data or relationship is lost and advantages of RDBMS are also gained. This paper briefly presents the survey of existing ontologies with comparative analysis on the basis of load time and query performance. Secondly, this paper makes a contribution by proposing a rule based approach to improve the downside of earlier techniques.","","POD:978-1-4244-4872-2","10.1109/INMIC.2009.5383093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383093","","Data structures;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Information systems;OWL;Ontologies;Performance analysis;Relational databases;Terminology;XML","Web sites;XML;data structures;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);relational databases;semantic Web","OntRel;Web ontology language;XML;data structure;dynamic OWL-DL ontologies;optimized relational structure;relational database management systems;rule based approach;semantic Web sites;semantic based information systems","","1","","20","","","14-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then a set of additional reliable training data for data-sparse categories can be retrieved based on such representation and particular similarity metrics. This training data enhancement strategy is classifier independent and can improve the classification of categories without adequate training data. Second, we propose the occurrence probability based strategy for hierarchical text classification which can reduce error propagation efficiently. Cooccurrence probability is then introduced to correct the errors occurred on higher levels of the hierarchy.

This can be easily done in pivot tables by using time as one of the dimensions, usually across columns. However, the trending information itself is insufficient to make any quick and insightful observations. Ranking the time series to identify the similar units of information can accelerate the analysis process. Similarly projection of the time series to the future will help the decision maker to proactively build alternate plans for differing scenarios. For doing such an analysis and modeling it becomes necessary to have aggregated data on demand. Current breed of row store database have limited capabilities to provide the response time required for such an analysis and modeling. Hence, column store database are expected to be better alternatives, for these types of problems. In this work the attempts made by the authors to develop such a system named as `rePivot' are presented. The proposed frame work consists of three modules namely - a column store database to provide quick access to data, a time series ranking module and a probabilistic forecasting module. A case study of the proposed frame work in churn analysis and modeling in telecom has been carried out to test the suitability of framework for industrial applications. Application of the framework has shown promising results.

Meanwhile, they are also bewildered by the huge amount of information routinely presented to them. This talk presents our research on finding video answers to two types of questions the ""how-to"" and ""topic-based"" questions. For answering ""how-to"" type questions, the focus is on returning precise answers when available. This is accomplished in two steps by first performing the recall-driven video search, which aims to increase the coverage of question by supplementing it with other similar textual questions found on the Web; follow by precision-based video ranking, which performs visual, opinion and video redundancy analysis to locate the most relevant video answers from YouTube. For the ""topic-based"" questions which tend to return a large ranked list of diverse videos, the focus is on summarizing the results in order to present an overview to the users. Our multi-video summarization framework first finds key-shots through near-duplicate video analysis and ranking; extracts semantic tags associated with key shots through representativeness and descriptiveness analysis with random walk; and formulates summary through an optimization procedure that takes into account of users' preference and time limit. We conduct user studies on a wide variety of questions for over one hundred hours of videos crawled from YouTube. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed solutions. The talk also discusses directions for future research.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3866-2; POD:978-1-4244-5297-2","10.1109/DICTA.2009.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5384874","","Biographies;Computer graphics;Data mining;Image retrieval;Information processing;Information retrieval;Multimedia computing;Performance analysis;Videoconference;YouTube","Internet;video retrieval","Web video retrieval;Web video summarization;World Wide Web;YouTube;multivideo summarization framework;near-duplicate video analysis;precision-based video ranking;recall-driven video search;semantic tags;textual questions;video answers;video redundancy analysis","","0","","","","","1-3 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Texture analysis is a popular operation for CBIR. In this paper we propose a texture analysis based scheme for Color Image Retrieval. We use Haar wavelet to decompose color images into multilevel scale and wavelet coefficients. From the data of low frequency channel we extract features by means of F-norm theory and from data of high frequency channels we extract statistical features by computing gradient directions. Feature vectors extracted from images are then subjected to fuzzy logic based similarity comparison to obtain degree of similarity. A database of 100 color images each of size 256 ?? 256 pixels is used for evaluation.

This study explores a simple strategy for determining the approximate geographical location of the photographer from a series of images without considering the image contents. Two models are explored. The basic model is based on an image time-stamp profile alone, and the enhanced model improves the accuracy by incorporating the optical camera settings for the images and compares these with the elevation path of the sun. The strategy is applied to three image collections whereupon the approximate locations, i.e., the latitude and longitude, of the photographer were determined.","1087-4089;10874089","Electronic:978-1-4244-5404-4; POD:978-1-4244-5403-7","10.1109/I-SPAN.2009.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381936","EXIF;celestial navigation;digital camera;geo-spatial image tagging;image retrieval;photo browsing","Clocks;Digital cameras;Global Positioning System;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Navigation;Satellites;Sun;Tagging","cameras;image retrieval;visual databases","GPS enabled cameras;Global Positioning System;geo-spatial image tagging;geographical location approximation;image retrieval;image search;image storage","","1","","13","","","14-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated on audio classification and retrieval tasks. In particular, the experiments are performed on a benchmark music data set. The results are compared to those previously obtained on the same data base. We show that our approach improved classification and retrieval results by more then 3%, and for the case of retrieval reached almost perfect retrieval rate of 99:36%.

Different from the original topic-search which employs the keyword-based topic to retrieve and aggregate relevant information, Foxinfo1.0 could organize information from different abstraction level by employing tag to describe the topics of queries and information. Further, in order to predict tags from queries and web documents, a tag prediction algorithm named as CTAG is proposed, which could concern tags from different levels, and performs much better than the baseline method like AutoTag.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3904-1; POD:978-1-4244-5318-4","10.1109/IALP.2009.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5380777","CTAG;Tag Recommendation;Topic-oriented Search Engine","Aggregates;Blogs;Computer science;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Navigation;Prediction algorithms;Search engines;Sun;Tagging","information retrieval;search engines","AutoTag;Chinese topic-oriented search engine;Foxinfol.O;information retrieval service;magazine-style topic page;query keywords;web documents","","0","","22","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is an urgent demand of image management tools as efficient as those text search engines. Decades of research on image retrieval has found there is a significant gap between the existing content based image retrieval and semantic interpretation of images by human. As a result, recent research on image retrieval has shifted to semantic image retrieval. Many semantic image retrieval models have been proposed, however, these methods are still alienated from the widely accepted text based retrieval method. In this paper, we propose to unite the semantic image retrieval model with text based retrieval using a novel region based inverted file indexing method. For this purpose, images are translated into textual documents which are then indexed and retrieved the same way as the conventional text based search. Results show that our method not only provides text based search efficiency, but also better performance than the conventional low level image retrieval.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-3866-2; POD:978-1-4244-5297-2","10.1109/DICTA.2009.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5384974","CBIR;decision tree;inverted file;semantic image retrieval","Australia;Computer applications;Content based retrieval;Digital images;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;indexing;search engines;text analysis","image management tools;inverted file indexing;region-based inverted file;semantic image retrieval;text search engines;textual documents","","2","","15","","","1-3 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be easily done in pivot tables by using time as one of the dimensions, usually across columns. However, the trending information itself is insufficient to make any quick and insightful observations. Ranking the time series to identify the similar units of information can accelerate the analysis process. Similarly projection of the time series to the future will help the decision maker to proactively build alternate plans for differing scenarios. For doing such an analysis and modeling it becomes necessary to have aggregated data on demand. Current breed of row store database have limited capabilities to provide the response time required for such an analysis and modeling. Hence, column store database are expected to be better alternatives, for these types of problems. In this work the attempts made by the authors to develop such a system named as 'rePivot' are presented. The proposed frame work consists of three modules namely - a column store database to provide quick access to data, a time series ranking module and a probabilistic forecasting module. A case study of the proposed frame work in churn analysis and modeling in telecom has been carried out to test the suitability of framework for industrial applications.

We fill this gap and present results of an extensive case study of attacks against an MDPL prototype chip. In contrast with other practical works, we demonstrate successful DPA attacks and show that MDPL implementations, resistant to standard DPA attacks, can be broken in practice. Further, we show that the underlying concept of the folding attack, i.e. analysis of probability densities, indeed exposes MDPL's greatest weakness: the masking renders the circuit more vulnerable to attacks than a circuit with a fixed mask.

One of the approaches in data-centric storage is that the nodes that collected data will transfer their data to other neighboring nodes that store the similar type of data. However, when the nodes are mobile, type-based data distribution alone cannot provide robust data storage and retrieval, since the nodes that store similar types may move far away and can not be easily reachable in the future. In order to minimize the communication overhead and achieve efficient data retrieval in data-centric mobile environments, we propose a fully distributed neighborhood prediction scheme that utilizes past node trajectory information to determine the near likely node in the future as the best content distributee. We developed two methods that predict the future neighborhood based on the correlations of the past trajectories. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate that our prediction approaches can effectively and efficiently predict the future neighborhood with high accuracy.","2155-7578;21557578","POD:978-1-4244-5238-5","10.1109/MILCOM.2009.5379936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5379936","","Content based retrieval;Energy efficiency;Energy storage;Information retrieval;Memory;Mobile communication;Predictive models;Robustness;Trajectory;Wireless networks","information dissemination;information retrieval;mobile computing;mobile radio;storage management","data organization;data retrieval;data transfer;data-centric mobile wireless networks;data-centric storage;distributed neighborhood prediction scheme;energy-efficient data dissemination;near likely nodes prediction;past node trajectory information;pervasive applications;type-based data distribution","","0","","14","","","18-21 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most efforts to date were focused on a very small number of languages with large number of speakers, economic potential, and information technology needs of the population. However, speech technology has a lot to contribute even to those languages that do not fall into this category. Languages with a small number of speakers and few linguistic resources may suddenly become of interest for humanitarian and military reasons. Furthermore, a large number of languages are in danger of becoming extinct, and ongoing projects for preserving them could benefit from speech technology. With more than 6900 languages in the world and the need to support multiple input and output languages, the most important challenge today is to port speech processing systems to new languages rapidly and at reasonable costs. In my talk I will introduce state-of-the-art techniques for rapid language adaptation and present solutions to overcome the ever-existing problem of data sparseness and the gap between language and technology expertise. I will describe the building process for speech and language processing components for new unsupported languages and introduce tools to do this rapidly and at lost costs. I describe the Rapid Language Adaptation Tools (RLAT) which built on existing projects like SPICE, GlobalPhone, and FestVox and enable users to develop speech processing components, to collect appropriate speech and text data for building and improving these components, and to evaluate the results allowing for iterative improvements.","","POD:978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373503","","Costs;Information retrieval;Information technology;Laboratories;Natural languages;SPICE;Speech analysis;Speech processing","natural language processing;speech processing","FestVox;GlobalPhone;SPICE;information retrieval systems;information technology;language processing technologies;multilingual speech processing;rapid language adaptation tools;speech summarization;speech translation systems;spoken dialog systems","","1","","","","","Nov. 13 2009-Dec. 17 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method firstly builds lattices to describe potential data sharing opportunities among queries, and then constructs new queries accordingly to exploit them.

"Hardware Accelerator for Full-Text Search (HAFTS) with Succinct Data Structure","N. Tanida; M. Inaba; K. Hiraki; T. Yoshino","Univ. of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan","2009 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","20100115","2009","","","155","160","Efficient utilization of massive data, such as full-text search has become important in view of the growing needs for Web search and genome analysis. High-speed search and small storage space are required to handle massive amounts of data. For high-speed search, generally, a data structure such as index which needs additional storage space is required. Recently, compressed suffix array, which is a data structure with an indexable dictionary that can be used to compress data to its information-theoretic lower bound, has been proposed. The distinctive feature of this array is that it enables direct data retrieval without decompression from the compressed data. Further, theoretically, the computational complexity of data retrieval is the same for both compressed and uncompressed data when we assume that rank operation involving the bit vector can be executed in constant time; this rank operation returns the number of occurrences of smaller elements. Practically, rank operation involves many bit-manipulations and random access to the memory. Hence, this constant time is not negligible, and as a result, data retrieval using compressed suffix array is relatively slower than that using plain suffix array. Although compression to create an indexable dictionary is performed only once, data retrieval queries occur repeatedly. Hence, high speed rank operations involving bit vectors are essential for compressed suffix arrays. We propose a FPGA-based hardware accelerator for full-text search (HAFTS) with compressed suffix array. FPGA helps speedup rank operation for compressed suffix array by enabling many bit calculations performed simultaneously and controlling the order of memory accesses. We conduct performance simulations of HAFTS. We consider a development board on which FPGA is connected to DDR2-800 SDRAM by a 64-bit bus as our model. We evaluate the performance of HAFTS by comparing it with that of software implementation. As a result, we conclude that the search speed o- f FPGA-based HAFTS is seven times faster than that of software implementation.","2325-6532;23256532","Electronic:978-0-7695-3917-1; POD:978-1-4244-5293-4","10.1109/ReConFig.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5382044","FPGA;compressed suffix array;full-text search;succinct data structure","Bioinformatics;Computational complexity;Data structures;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Genomics;Hardware;Information retrieval;SDRAM;Web search","computational complexity;data compression;data structures;field programmable gate arrays;information theory;query formulation","FPGA-based hardware accelerator;Web search;bit vectors;compressed suffix arrays;computational complexity;data retrieval;full-text search;genome analysis;high speed rank operation;high-speed search;indexable dictionary;information-theoretic lower bound;plain suffix array;small storage space;succinct data structure","","1","","13","","","9-11 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Transcribing music audio into chord sequences is essential for harmonic analysis, and would be an important component in content-based retrieval and indexing, but accuracy rates remain fairly low. In this paper, the existing 2008 LabROSA Supervised Chord Recognition System is modified by using different machine learning methods for decoding structural information, thereby achieving significantly superior results. Specifically, the hidden Markov model is replaced by a large margin structured prediction approach (SVMstruct) using an enlarged feature space. Performance is significantly improved by incorporating features from future (but not past) frames. The benefit of SVMstruct increases with the size of the training set, as might be expected when comparing discriminative and generative models. Without yet exploring non-linear kernels, these improvements lead to state-of-the-art performance in chord transcription. The techniques could prove useful in other sequential learning tasks which currently employ HMMs.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381404","acoustic features;chord transcription;classification and prediction;structured and relational data","Content based retrieval;Decoding;Harmonic analysis;Hidden Markov models;Indexing;Kernel;Labeling;Machine learning;Music information retrieval;Predictive models","audio coding;content-based retrieval;harmonic analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);music;support vector machines","HMM;LabROSA supervised chord recognition system;chord transcription;content-based retrieval;harmonic analysis;hidden Markov model;indexing;machine learning methods;music audio;nonlinear kernels;structural information;structured prediction models","","9","","21","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
