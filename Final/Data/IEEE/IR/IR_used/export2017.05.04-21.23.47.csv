Firstly, we represent local file content of a peer with vector space model. After that, space vector is clustered to obtain interest class of this peer. And then, interest similar degree is computed among peers to build interest indexical table locally. When search occurs, query requests are forwarded to the peers with similar interest directly according to the interest indexical table. Experimental results show that Isearch doesn't have much influence on retrieval results, but also can reduce the number of query peers so that make routing more efficient.","","POD:0-7695-2705-1","10.1109/WAIMW.2006.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4027162","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Communication system software;Educational institutions;Information resources;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Prototypes;Routing;Topology","","","","2","","25","","","17-19 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data repositories are implemented using hierarchical storage structures (HSS). One of the components of HSS is tertiary storage, which provides a cost-effective storage for the vast amount of data manipulated by these applications. To bridge the access-gap between the tertiary storage and the secondary storage, we propose a data placement technique, namely WARP: Wrap ARound data Placement. WARP may reduce the access time by 1 order of magnitude, depending on the tape device specifications and object sizes. An important feature of WARP is that it optimizes access-time independently of the retrieval order. We have implemented this technique on an IBM 3590 tape drive and have observed up to 5 times improvement in access-time as compared to other data placement techniques. Moreover, we report on the use of WARP with multiple load/unload position tapes (of the future).","2160-195X;2160195X","Paper:0-7695-0849-9","10.1109/MSS.2001.10028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4022203","","Application software;Bridges;Data engineering;Educational institutions;Explosions;Information retrieval;Magnetic heads;Maintenance engineering;Petroleum;Switches","","","","0","","10","","","17-20 April 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By mapping lexically different but semantically similar words into features in the domain ontology that underlies the words, we can achieve at least two benefits: the dimensionality of the feature space can be reduced effectively, and the semantic information that underlies the lexical words can be incorporated into the classification process, leading to better classification accuracies. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based feature weighting strategy for the biomedical literature classification problem. We assign weights to the features into which the lexical words are mapped, according to the structure of the domain ontology, and further optimize the weights using cross-validation. Our experiments on MEDLINE-indexed journal abstracts demonstrate that our method can achieve a significant improvement on the classification accuracies, especially when the classification task is hard","","POD:0-7803-9788-6","10.1109/IRI.2006.252426","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4018503","","Abstracts;Classification algorithms;Computer science;Frequency estimation;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Ontologies;Text categorization","biology computing;classification;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","MEDLINE-indexed journal abstract;biomedical literature classification;lexical words;ontology-based feature weighting","","4","","11","","","16-18 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a combined classification approach, which takes advantages of exclusive and continuous classification by performing the continuous classification after the exclusive classification. To circumvent the problems of small number of classes in the traditional exclusive classification, a clustering technique is proposed that exploits the similarities among the database templates and partitions them into much larger number of non-overlapping clusters than the conventional exclusive classification. Clustering technique serves as a coarse level classification which speeds up the followed continuous classification.

The primary aim of QoS-MUBOR is to maintain long link durations, whilst meeting QoS constraints. The routing protocol proposed is based on data retrieval from nodes, where nodes act as content providers. This simulates scenarios such as downloading a file, a web page, or any form of data from other nodes which can provide it.

One reason is the lack of appropriate methods to retrieve and reuse relevant information when re/designing products. In this paper, we propose a framework to (1) collect information on product families, (2) store it using ontology, (3) retrieve relevant information on a product family using graph query, (4) reuse this information to redesign a product family using a genetic algorithm-based optimizer and (5) represent the redesigned product family using a product family concept lattice, which we call a networked bill of material (NBOM).

With the scale that the Internet has provided, databases are being exposed to an ever increasing number of queries on data. More commonly these queries are based on information retrieval rather than modification. As advances in hardware bring about larger storage devices, there is greater potential of caching queries in order to reduce processing time. This paper presents the novel concept of Smart Queries. Smart Queries go beyond caching, and not only cache query results but automatically update those results as their input tables change over time. Furthermore, Smart Queries allow traditional stored procedures much more flexibility with improved simplicity.

Based on the binary combinatorial grammar, a parsing algorithm for Chinese natural language is proposed which takes operator precedence computing as its basic ideas. Four basic operations and one extended operation are defined in the algorithm. The order of combinatorial operations in parsing is controlled according to the priority between adjacent binary relations, and eventually the recognition of chunks and whole syntactic structures is achieved.

This paper proposes a new method for determining the sentiment orientation of the Chinese words by using bilingual lexicons. Given a Chinese word, we observe the occurrences of English sentiment words in its interpretations, to predict the sentiment orientation of the Chinese word. The whole process can be illustrated logically as follows: (1) translate a Chinese word into Chinese-English interpretation; (2) generate an English word sequence by parsing the interpretation; (3) calculate the sentiment vector from the English word sequence; (4) use a classifier to predict the sentiment orientation for the Chinese word. The performance of two kinds of classifiers (SVM and C4.5) is studied.

First, nowadays the way that users retrieve information is quite different from the previous way when web search engine was not extensively used. Second, inter-site links and intra-site links should not be treated equally. A link from a different site is more important for a page than that within the same site. Third, most users start their browsing from a homepage, which should be given more weight than other pages. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking algorithm called XRank as a solution to these problems.

The development of a metric-PAM substitution matrix enables metric-distance based indexing for peptide sequences. The performance of distance-based indexing for homologous protein retrieval entails trade-off among accuracy, scalability and computational cost. We investigate the application of the multi-vantage point (MVP) tree algorithm to index peptide k-mers based on global mPAM alignment.

But the requirements for the plasma physics experiments and specifically Tokamaks are unique and different. Most of the plasma physics experiments operates in a pulse mode and capture the data during the plasma discharge and retrieve it later on for analysis and display. Next generation of Tokamaks are steady state where the discharge duration is of the order of 1000s of seconds. Such device demands a data acquisition system, which is capable of acquiring data without losing from plasma diagnostics so that no physics information is lost and no unnecessary data is acquired. The needs of loss less continuous acquisition have a significant effect on selection of acquisition hardware. The internal architecture of data acquisition board plays a very important role in meeting the goal of lossless acquisition for steady state. Specifically the data management due to large amount of data generated by experiment and online display of data during experiment becomes very crucial. Usually in case of large physics experiments the data acquisition system has been normally based on VME and CAMAC bus. But with an advent of newer technology many options are available for implementing loss less continuous data acquisition.

This increased processing power and memory allows disks to execute more than just the basic disk operations, sometimes, even run user defined codes. Offloading part of the application processing to the disks can help reducing the latency of data manipulation as well as the amount of data transferred across the network. Such disks are called active disks. In this paper, a file system for the active-disk-based data server (ADFS) is proposed. All data files stored on active disks are provided with operations, forming objects. For some applications such as database, application-specific operations can be run by disk processors so that only the results are returned to clients, rather than whole data file is read by the clients. Therefore, ADFS is able to reduce the application-processing overhead of the system. In ADFS, part of file system functionality of the file manager can be delegated to active disks. Our implementation is based on CORBA specification. A set of file system interfaces is implemented for each module of each file system component. Part of the file system functionality, such as lookup, is embedded in the modules for active disks. We tested the performance of ADFS with 64 files in three-layer directory system. The performance results are obtained in a limited manner and presented in this paper. Our ADFS is basically stateful, but the delegation of file system functionality to disks allows our file system to be more scalable and helps to overcome some of the limitations of current prevailing file systems, like NFS, by greatly reducing the work of the central file manager. In addition, it is conceivable that the central file manager could be eliminated altogether.","2160-195X;2160195X","Paper:0-7695-0849-9","10.1109/MSS.2001.10010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4022187","","Cache memory;Computer science;Databases;Disk drives;File servers;File systems;Information retrieval;Network servers;Rivers;Utility programs","","","","9","","14","","","17-20 April 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of relying upon manually constructed and maintained traces, links are generated dynamically on an 'as-needed' basis using information retrieval techniques. Prior work in this area has indicated that in order to retrieve between 90% to 95% of the correct traces, only low precision levels can be obtained, which means that analysts must spend time filtering out unwanted links. This paper describes a method for improving the precision of trace results through incorporating the use of phrases detected and constructed from requirements using a part-of-speech tagger. A project glossary is also used to find additional phrases and weight the contributions of key phrases and terms. The approach is implemented in a probabilistic trace retrieval tool and evaluated through a series of experiments. The results show that phrasing can significantly increase the accuracy of the dynamic trace retrieval tool by generally increasing precision, and also by moving good trace links towards the top of the candidate links list","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-2655-1","10.1109/COMPSAC.2006.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4020086","","Computer science;Filtering;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information systems;Inspection;Large scale integration;Probability;Terminology","glossaries;information retrieval;probability","dynamic trace retrieval;information retrieval technique;part-of-speech tagger;probabilistic trace retrieval tool;project glossary","","9","","18","","","17-21 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper analyses approaches for XML data storage in traditional DBMS and its extension to GML. We propose an approach for GML storage based on the analysis of the underlying application schema. A semi-automatic mapping mechanism is proposed for the application schema to relational schemas of standard database with the utilization of common concepts for the domain i.e. the ontology of the domain.

In this work, a probabilistic approach to location verification in dense sensor networks is proposed. The proposed Probabilistic Location Verification (PLV) algorithm leverages the probabilistic dependence of the number of hops a broadcast packet traverses to reach a destination and the Euclidean distance between source and destination. A small number of verifier nodes determine the plausibility of the claimed location, which is represented by a real number between zero and one. Using the calculated plausibility metric, it is possible to create arbitrary number of trust levels in the location claimed. Simulation studies verify that the proposed solution provides high performance in face of various types of attacks.","1550-3607;15503607","CD-ROM:1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4025013","Localization;Location Verification;Wireless Sensor Networks","Broadcasting;Data security;Euclidean distance;Hardware;Information retrieval;Information security;Position measurement;Protocols;Robustness;Wireless sensor networks","","","","12","","12","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web digital library is an instrument that provides various types of information required for e-learning. It is necessary to formulate a new technique, by taking into account various user communities and their personal requirements. This paper describes a new technique for design and development of a user-interface system called ""a user adaptive self-proclamative multi-agent based recommendation system design"" for e-learning digital libraries. This system is mainly designed for research people to collect the research literature. Basically this is a multi-agent based recommendation system that provides necessary suggestions by learning user-personal profiles and actions. The user has the provision to search the information and while searching, the system recommends the list of research literature that the user is interested. The profiles are concept patterned and a concept matrix is designed to represent each user as well as the subject. An ACM Computational Review Classification hierarchy along with conceptual matrix is used to represent the agent internal semantic model and to support the best inference. It is based on formulating a concept matrix, which consists of technical phrases and indexes occurring in the title and abstract of the paper. These phrases and indexes are picked up from the ACM computing review classification index, keywords as well as using phrases of Microsoft on-line computer dictionary. The columns of the matrix represent phrases and the rows represent the frequency of occurrences of the specified phrases in the document or query. The system is also doing concept relativity analysis. The usage of concept matrix enables the system to recommend/retrieve the exact information. It does a behavior prediction for various types of users and builds the user profile accordingly. It builds a global as well as personal prof- le.

This would inevitably lead to reduced server's revenue. We investigate the effectiveness in using pricing as a strategy for the server to indirectly regulate the amount of P2P sharing.

Many prototype applications providing mobile agent capability have been proposed for being used in network management. E-commerce and information retrieval are some of them. The motive behind the agent mobility is that, it addresses some limitations faced by traditional centralized client-server architecture, which are mainly, minimizing bandwidth consumption, supporting network load balancing, enhancing scalability as well as flexibility, increase fault tolerance and solve problems caused by unreliable network connections. However, despite its benefits, mobile agent systems still pose security threats. In this paper we propose a mobile agent architecture that supports flexible and reliable interaction of autonomous components in a distributive network environment.

This paper describes a statistical distribution approach to reuse and integrate information from the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO), WordNet and FrameNet. The mapping between word-meanings, frame-semantics and world concepts suggests a heuristic approach for linking WordNet verbs and FrameNet frames providing a knowledge base for Semantic Role Labeling(SRL), identifying the appropriate range of possible semantic roles with respect to the event evoked by verb. This is accomplished through the verbs covered by both FrameNet and WordNet, taking the shared lexical knowledge as learning data to map SUMO concepts with FrameNet frames. The exploitation of the mapping aims at automatic populating WordNet data to FrameNet frames constructing a knowledge base for semantic parsing.","","POD:0-7695-2722-1","10.1109/MICAI.2006.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4022160","","Artificial intelligence;Databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Labeling;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Ontologies;Statistical distributions","","","","0","","12","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A clustering depends on the chosen clustering algorithm as well as on the algorithm's parameter settings; for that reason it is necessary to find the best among several clustering techniques. However, it is very difficult to evaluate a given clustering of documents. There are external, internal and relative measures. The disadvantage of external measures is the necessity of a human reference classification to evaluate the clustering. In this paper we propose the use of rough-set-based measures for document clustering evaluation, basing our calculations solely on the clustering that has to be evaluated. Thus, two advantages of rough set theory are used: it does not need any preliminary or additional information about data, and it is a tool for use in computer applications in circumstances which are characterized by vagueness and uncertainty (this is the case of document clustering). We illustrate the use of the novel measures.","","POD:0-7695-2722-1","10.1109/MICAI.2006.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4022150","","Area measurement;Clustering algorithms;Computer applications;Computer science;Density measurement;Humans;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Set theory;Text mining","","","","1","","17","","","13-17 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the expensive server-to-sensor communications, the large amount of sensors and the limited storage space at each tiny sensor, continuous data collection becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we present partial network coding (PNC) as a generic tool for the above applications. PNC generalizes the existing network coding (NC) paradigm, an elegant solution for ubiquitous data distribution and collection. Yet, PNC enables efficient storage replacement for continuous data, which is a major deficiency of the conventional NC.

Storage and access to such XML encoded data is needed. Many approaches have been proposed: (i.) Storing XML data in its native form (native XML databases), (ii.)Use of existing DBMSs to store XML encoded data (XML-enabled databases). ORDBs integrate the rich object-oriented modeling capabilities as well as leverage the mature relational database technologies in storing and accessing data. Therefore, use of ORDBs to store XML encoded data enables us to exploit these rich powerful features. Extracting semantics that exists in XML schema enables us to exploit rich OO modeling capabilities of ORDBs during mapping. This is especially beneficial when storing large amounts of structured XML data. In this paper, we outline techniques to identify superclass/subclass relationship in XML Schema and propose guidelines to map XML Schema to ORDB schema utilizing such semantic information.","","POD:0-7695-2687-X","10.1109/CIT.2006.192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019857","","Data mining;Data models;Guidelines;Information retrieval;Information technology;Object oriented databases;Object oriented modeling;Relational databases;Spatial databases;XML","","","","0","","19","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ontology has been proposed as an important tool for expressing real world knowledge by conceptual modeling, and provides a basis for effectively managing the knowledge. In this work, an ontology for R&D project management meeting is designed and established. Various meetings and related data accompanied in the progress of R&D projects are to be managed for successful projects. Information sharing and data retrieval are difficult for meeting attendants, and management for meeting data is not systematic. An ontology is designed and implemented by analyzing and classifying the meeting and related data in R&D project meeting systematically. Thereafter this can be applied to meeting management and service provision of an intelligent meeting examples","","POD:0-7695-2674-8","10.1109/ICHIT.2006.253521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4021124","","Costs;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;OWL;Ontologies;Productivity;Project management;Research and development;Research and development management;Semantic Web","business data processing;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);research and development management;semantic Web","OWL ontology;data retrieval;information sharing;research and development project management meeting;semantic Web","","0","","13","","","9-11 Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cardoso","University of Madeira, Portugal","2006 IEEE Services Computing Workshops","20061211","2006","","","183","190","This paper presents an algorithm to match a semantic Web service request against semantic Web service advertisements. The algorithm is to be used by systems to discover semantic Web services, such as the UDDI. Matching is based on the assessment of the similarity among semantic Web service properties, such as inputs and outputs. Semantic Web services have their inputs and outputs annotated or described by ontological concepts. The algorithm is able to match a semantic Web service request against advertisements that are annotated with concepts with and without a common ontology commitment. The similarity of inputs and outputs is evaluated based on concepts (classes), their semantic relations, and their common and distinguishing features (properties)","","POD:0-7695-2681-0","10.1109/SCW.2006.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4027034","","Computerized monitoring;Conferences;Information retrieval;Mathematics;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Taxonomy;Web and internet services;Web services","Web services;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Web service request matching;ontology commitment;semantic Web service discovery","","19","","28","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New methods and technologies have been developed and we can say that we have currently reached a state-of-the-art in this field. Most of the latest speech recognizers are based on hidden Markov models since it has been proved that this is the best method to model speech. This paper presents the steps involved in building this kind of a speech recognition system, together with a few results obtained in the recognition of isolated words (digits from zero to nine) in Romanian language","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0361-8; POD:1-4244-0360-X","10.1109/AQTR.2006.254561","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4022883","","Application software;Automatic speech recognition;Electronic mail;Feedback;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Speech analysis;Speech recognition","hidden Markov models;natural languages;speech recognition","Romanian language;automatic speech recognition;hidden Markov models","","0","","11","","","25-28 May 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the resource limitation of sensor nodes (processing, memory, bandwidth, and energy), the collected information of sensor nodes has to be compressed quickly and precisely for transmission. In this paper, we propose a new technique -- the ALVQ (Adoptive Learning Vector Quantization) algorithm to compress this historical information. The ALVQ algorithm constructs a codebook to capture the prominent features of the data and with these features all the other data can be piece-wise encoded for compression. In addition, with two-level regression of the codebook's update, ALVQ algorithm saves the data transfer bandwidth and improves the compression precision further. Finally, we consider the problem of transmitting data in a sensor network while maximizing the precision. We show how we apply our algorithm so that a set of sensors can dynamically share a wireless communication channel.","1550-3607;15503607","CD-ROM:1-4244-0355-3","10.1109/ICC.2006.255237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4024710","","Acoustic sensors;Bandwidth;Biosensors;Chemical and biological sensors;Communication channels;Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","","","","2","","13","","","June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
