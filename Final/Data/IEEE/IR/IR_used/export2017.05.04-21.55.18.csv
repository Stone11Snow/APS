No.02EX505)","20031027","2003","","","117","123","One important measurement of a sensor network's performance is how well the sensor network can monitor a covered area, namely network coverage. We propose a scheme to improve the network coverage of a sensor network. We assume that each sensor can probabilistically detect a nearby event, and build a probabilistic model of network coverage by considering the data correlation among neighboring sensors. We also define the sensing denomination (SD) of a sensor using the network coverage model. A sensor's SD is regarded as the measurement of its contribution to the network coverage. The more the contribution of a sensor to the network coverage, the higher the sensor's SD is. Based on the location information of neighboring sensors, each sensor can calculate its SD value in a distributed manner. We then propose coverage-aware self-scheduling, in which sensors periodically calculate their SD values and probabilistically schedule their active and hibernating states according to their SD values, so that sensors with higher SD values have more chance to stay active. With the same amount of energy consumed, better network coverage can be achieved by applying the scheme. We then demonstrate through a numerical study that the scheme improves sensor network coverage considerably.","","POD:0-7803-8239-0","10.1109/CCW.2003.1240799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240799","","Animals;Base stations;Capacitive sensors;Chemical sensors;Event detection;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Monitoring;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks","power consumption;probability;scheduling;wireless sensor networks","active state;coverage-aware self-scheduling;data correlation;energy consumption;hibernating state;network coverage;sensing denomination;wireless sensor networks","","9","","16","","","20-21 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under the proposed framework, typical problems in CBIR such as the semantic gap and the perception subjectivity can be alleviated. Three major components, including: (1) image representation; (2) query expression; and (3) feature matching, are discussed and solutions are introduced. For the image representation, we formulate a mapping from low-level numerical features to high-level linguistic terms by the use of fuzzy membership functions. For the query expression, we define a query description language that provides a flexible query expression for users to specify their information need at various semantic levels. For the feature matching, our CBIR system can construct a unique personalized similarity function that measures similarity between the query and an image according to the user's query and his/her preference. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of our CBIR system.","","POD:0-7695-1957-1","10.1109/ICCIMA.2003.1238147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238147","","Computational intelligence;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Feedback;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Image representation;Image retrieval;Information retrieval","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;fuzzy logic;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;query formulation","CBIR;content-based image retrieval;feature matching;fuzzy logic framework;image representation;linguistic term;numerical features;query expression;semantic gap","","0","","5","","","27-30 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system has been developed using the basic features supplied by the Jade platform for agent creation, coordination and control. The system is composed of four agents: the trainer agent, the neural classifier mobile agent, the interface agent, and the librarian agent. The sub-symbolic knowledge of the neural classifier mobile agent is automatically updated each time a new, previously not included, document topic is requested by the user. The neural classifier mobile agent also interacts with the librarian agent for retrieving the documents in the repositories and with the interface agent for user interaction. The proposed system is particularly useful for classifying documents stored in private networked document repositories that, for various reasons (i.e. privacy, security, and so on), cannot be indexed by an external search engine. The system is very efficient: the preliminary experimental results show that in the best case a classification error of 9.98% is obtained.","","POD:0-7695-1931-8","10.1109/IAT.2003.1241073","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241073","","Automatic control;Chromium;Control systems;Councils;HTML;Information retrieval;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Neural networks;Search engines","classification;digital libraries;hypermedia markup languages;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;neural nets","EalphaNet architecture;Jade platform;activation function;agent control;agent coordination;agent creation;document retrieval;hidden unit;interface agent;librarian agent;neural classifier mobile agent;neural multiagent-based system;neural network;private networked document repository;search engine;security;smart HTML page retrieval;trainer agent;user interaction","","0","1","18","","","17-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Web directories are compiled or classified folders of Web pages and are usually organized into a hierarchical structure. The classification of Web pages into proper directories and the organization of directory hierarchies are generally performed by human experts. We provide a method to apply a kind of text mining techniques on a set of Web pages to automatically create Web directories and organize them into hierarchies.

However, it has been noted that deletions degrade the structure over time, so the structure cannot be regarded as fully dynamic in the sense that deletions are not sustainable for long periods of time. In this paper, we propose and study a new method to handle deletions over the dsa-tree, which is shown to be superior to the former in the sense that it does not affect search time at all. Indeed, we show that the resulting tree is exactly as if the deleted element had never been inserted. The outcome is a fully dynamic data structure that can be managed through insertions and deletions over arbitrarily long periods of time without any reorganization.","1522-4902;15224902","POD:0-7695-2008-1","10.1109/SCCC.2003.1245441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245441","","Computer science;Data structures;Databases;Degradation;Extraterrestrial measurements;Indexes;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Performance evaluation;Tree data structures","tree data structures","data structure;dsa-tree;dynamic spatial approximation tree;metric space","","1","","11","","","6-7 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to achieve 3D data, range finders can be used. Coded structured light approach is one of the most widely used techniques to retrieve 3D information of an unknown surface. An overview of the existing techniques as well as a new classification of patterns for structured light sensors is presented. This kind of systems belong to the group of active triangulation method, which are based on projecting a light pattern and imaging the illuminated scene from one or more points of view. Since the patterns are coded, correspondences between points of the image(s) and points of the projected pattern can be easily found. Once correspondences are found, a classical triangulation strategy between camera(s) and projector device leads to the reconstruction of the surface. Advantages and constraints of the different patterns are discussed.","1050-4729;10504729","POD:0-7803-7736-2","10.1109/ROBOT.2003.1241585","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241585","","Application software;Cameras;Computer vision;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Inspection;Layout;Mobile robots;Quality control;Surface reconstruction","computer vision;image classification;image reconstruction;image retrieval;stereo image processing;surface reconstruction","3D information retrieval;automatic 3D profiling;camera;coded light projection techniques;pattern classification;projector device;structured light sensors;surface reconstruction;triangulation method","","22","7","27","","","14-19 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evidence of QuikSCAT σ<sub>0</sub> dependence on wind direction for >30-m/s wind speeds is presented. The QuikSCAT σ<sub>0</sub>s show a peak-to-peak wind direction modulation of ∼1 dB at 35-m/s wind speed, and the amplitude of modulation decreases with increasing wind speed. The decreasing directional sensitivity to wind speed agrees well with the trend of QSCAT1 model function at near 20 m/s. A correction of the QSCAT1 model function for above 23-m/s wind speed is proposed. We explored two microwave radiative transfer models to correct the attenuation and scattering effects of rain for wind retrievals. One is derived from the collocated QuikSCAT and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) dataset, and the other one is a published parametric model developed for rain radars. These two radiative transfer models account for the effects of volume scattering, scattering from rain-roughened surfaces and rain attenuation. The models suggest that the σ<sub>0</sub>s of wind-roughened sea surfaces for 40-50-m/s winds are comparable to the σ<sub>0</sub>s of rain contributions for up to about 10-15 mm/h. Both radiative transfer models have been used to retrieve the ocean wind vectors from the collocated QuikSCAT and SSM/I rain rate data for several tropical cyclones. The resulting wind speed estimates of these tropical cyclones show improved agreement with the wind fields derived from the best track analysis and Holland's model for up to about 15-mm/h SSM/I rain rate. A comparative analysis of maximum wind speed estimates suggests that other rain parameters likely have to be considered for further improvements.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.814913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245249","","Amplitude modulation;Attenuation;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Microwave sensors;Radar scattering;Rain;Sea surface;Tropical cyclones;Wind speed","atmospheric techniques;meteorological radar;ocean waves;radiative transfer;spaceborne radar;storms;wind","QSCAT1 model function;QuikSCAT wind retrievals;SSM/I dataset;SSM/I rain rate data;Special Sensor Microwave/Imager dataset;attenuation;directional sensitivity;hurricane;microwave radiative transfer models;ocean wind vectors;radiative transfer models;rain attenuation;rain-roughened surfaces;scattering;tropical cyclones;volume scattering;wind direction;wind speed","","32","","21","","","Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a novel descriptor for the 3-D object retrieval system, the regular polyhedral descriptor or regular polyhedron, is proposed. The proposed descriptor, which consists of the selection of equally distributed view positions and matching strategy using the regular polyhedron, is based on the multiple view, but it can improve the multiple view by using the property of the regular polyhedron.

At the bottom layer of this framework, event HMMs output basic hypotheses based on low-level features. The upper layers are composed of composition HMMs, which add constraints on those hypotheses of the lower layer. Instead of isolated event recognition, the hypotheses at different layers are optimized in a bottom-up manner and the optimal semantics are determined by top-down process.

The product data that is typically required for maturation analysis is generally stored in disparate heterogeneous data systems - this makes access, retrieval, and integration of the requisite information a costly and often incomplete process. A key issue when accessing heterogeneous information sources is how to bridge the differences in conceptual vocabulary that exist. This suggests a degree of semantic integration is required that allows the extraction and combination of information provided by the data sources. The approach should also provide a means to support the fusion of the information obtained from those sources with the knowledge of the system design and diagnostic engineers. This paper describes a metadata architecture that (1) supports mediated semantic integration of heterogeneous product data systems and (2) enables development of knowledge representations to support development of analytical maturation applications. The resulting synthesis of logical and ontological principles provides a strong basis for effective computational support for maturation application development.","1080-7725;10807725","POD:0-7803-7837-7","10.1109/AUTEST.2003.1243633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1243633","","Bridges;Costs;Data analysis;Data mining;Data systems;Design engineering;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Vocabulary","data warehouses;meta data;semantic networks;vocabulary","conceptual vocabulary differences;data warehouse;diagnostic maturation analysis;disparate heterogeneous data systems;information combination;information extraction;information fusion;knowledge representations;metadata architecture;ontology;product usage data mediated integration;product usage knowledge base;semantic integration;semantic mapping;virtual warehouse","","2","","10","","","22-25 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, the relevance region in the feature space expands rapidly and covers arbitrarily shaped spaces with a small number of parameters.

The characterization of complex features such as shape can be performed in a new lower-dimensional basis, in which the variables account for the correlation among regions of interest. The similarity between images is computed based on a set of vector variables obtained from image registration.

Services can thus be rapidly deployed over such overlays. Primitive P2P overlays only support searches with single keywords.

We propose a similarity information retrieval system called Meteorograph for structured P2P overlays without relying on message flooding. Meteorograph is fault-resilient, scalable, responsive and self-administrative, which is particularly suitable for an environment with an explosion of information and a large number of dynamic entities. An information item stored in Meteorograph is represented as a vector. A small angle between two vectors means that the corresponding items are characterized by some identical keywords. Meteorograph further stores similar items at nearby locations in the P2P overlay. To retrieve similar items, only nodes in nearby locations are located and consulted. Meteorograph is evaluated with simulation. The results show that Meteorograph can effectively distribute loads to the nodes. Discovering a single item and a set (in size k) of similar items takes O(log N) and (k/c)middotO(log N) messages and hops respectively, where N is the number of nodes in the overlay and c is the storage capacity of anode","0190-3918;01903918","POD:0-7695-2017-0","10.1109/ICPP.2003.1240632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1240632","","Aggregates;Computer science;Costs;Delay;Explosions;Floods;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Power system management;Tornadoes","distributed processing;information retrieval systems;query formulation;resource allocation","Meteorograph;end system resources;message flooding;peer-to-peer overlays;similarity information retrieval system;structured P2P overlays;unstructured P2P systems","","5","","20","","","9-9 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is assumed that these positive examples are related in semantic content. IISM computes comprehensive pair-wise mutual information for all images through analyzing the results of relevance feedback image retrieval. An association with a high mutual information means that one image is semantically associated with another.

Several combination techniques are used to achieve the precise goal. This is due, firstly, to the fact that users often do not present queries to information retrieval systems that optimally represent the information they want, and secondly, the measure of a document's relevance is highly subjective and variable between different users. We address this problem with an approach that relies on evolutionary user-modelling, in order to retrieve domain-specific information. We describe an adaptive information retrieval system that learns user needs from user-provided relevance feedback. The method combines qualitative feedback measures using fuzzy inference, and quantitative feedback using genetic algorithms (GA) fitness measures. We utilise the multiagent design approach for designing an information retrieval system (IRS). The system consists of following combination of complex processes: document indexing, learning strategic for relevant feedback and user modelling using genetic algorithm, filtering and ranking the retrieve documents based on the user model. We show the design of the IRS consists of several agents that cooperate with each other and may perform in parallel to achieve the system goal.","","POD:0-7695-1932-6","10.1109/WI.2003.1241301","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241301","","Biological cells;Frequency;Indexing;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Internet;Output feedback;Search engines;Service oriented architecture","Internet;genetic algorithms;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;relevance feedback;search engines;user modelling","GA fitness measure;IRS design;Internet;document indexing;document relevance measure;evolutionary reinforcement;fuzzy inference;genetic algorithm;information retrieval system;multiagent design approach;search engine;user model;user-provided relevance feedback","","0","","16","","","13-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since Chinese text retrieval has just been developed lately, and due to various specific characteristics of Chinese language, the approaches of its retrieval are quite different from those studies and researches proposed to deal with Western language. Thus, we have developed an architecture that augments existing search engines so that they support Chinese natural language question answering.

Large image databases require an index structure in order to reduce nearest neighbor computation. However, flexible metrics can alter an input space in a highly nonlinear fashion, thereby rendering the index structure useless. Few systems have been developed that address the apparent flexible metric/indexing dilemma. This paper proposes kernel indexing to try to address this dilemma. The key observation is that kernel metrics may be nonlinear and highly dynamic in the input space but remain Euclidean in induced feature space. It is this linear invariance in feature space that enables us to learn arbitrary relevance functions without changing the index in feature space. As a result, kernel indexing supports efficient relevance feedback retrieval in large image databases. Experimental results using a large set of image data are very promising.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1247066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1247066","","Content based retrieval;Extraterrestrial measurements;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Kernel;Nearest neighbor searches","content-based retrieval;database indexing;image retrieval;invariance;relevance feedback;video databases","Euclidean feature space;content-based retrieval;flexible metric;image data;image database;image retrieval;index structure;indexing dilemma;kernel indexing;kernel metric;linear invariance;relevance feedback;relevance function learning;video database","","2","","10","","","14-17 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a simple hierarchical object descriptor scheme, which is compact, flexible, and inherently suited for hierarchical search, is described. By integrating a suitable segmentation algorithm into the descriptor generation schema, the proposed approach becomes object oriented. Basically, features used for the extraction of image regions belonging to single physical objects are used in the definition of object descriptors.

At the Rockley Group, we work with many organizations that are implementing single sourcing or ""unified content"" strategies. We start by conducting an audit of their current information products and content life cycles, followed by building information models that reflect clients' desired reuse strategy. Information modeling is critical to a unified content strategy. Information models depict the structure of information products; they show how and where elements are reused, and they include the metadata that further describes how elements are used, retrieved and tracked. Information models are the specification for a unified content strategy, but information modeling brings a new set of challenges to those creating, reviewing, and implementing the models. This paper provides a brief overview of unified content, then explores some of the issues specific to information modeling, including: teaching authors to create, read, review, and implement models; distinguishing between reusable structure and reusable content; visually representing information structure; and implementing models, specifically, understanding how writing to a model affects the writing process.","","POD:0-7803-7949-7","10.1109/IPCC.2003.1245458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245458","","Assembly;Buildings;Content management;Costs;Documentation;Education;Information retrieval;Professional communication;Visualization;Writing","content management;information management;meta data;professional communication","content life cycle;content management;information modeling;information product;information structure;metadata;professional communication;reusable content;reusable structure;single sourcing;technical writing;unified content","","0","","1","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Simulations show that a satisfactory retrieval performance can be obtained from the compressed databases with 10% compression quality (i.e. 97.6% compression ratio in JPEG). Image retrieval based on HSV color histogram performs better than retrieval based on YUV color histogram in the uncompressed domain, and the other way around in the compressed domain. In general, video retrieval based on color histogram in MPEG-4 compressed databases performs better compared to H.263+ compressed databases. However, retrieval performance from H.263+ compressed databases at lower bit rates is more stable, where it drastically decreases in MPEG-4 compressed databases below 128 Kb/s. Retrieval based on texture features produces more robust performance than retrieval based on color. Subjective tests show that 25% compression quality achieves high compression ratio without loosing significant retrieval performance.

Reputation assignment and use cajole cooperation from the nodes in the network even if they do not share the same goal. This paper provides a mechanism that can use reputations in ad hoc network for trusting routers and relays. In addition, it enumerates the issues involved in using reputation in ad hoc networks. The simulations show that the throughput of the network increases by 0% - 71.6% when the neighbor reputations and shortest path are considered, for deciding the next hop.

Once users find such an answer, presentation of the results is very rigid, i.e., not tailored to the users' needs, and it does not enable users to manipulate the data. Thus, this retrieval activity often becomes tedious. To improve user-information interaction, a major issue is to give search-engines the ability to access data semantics. We propose a framework to address the issue. Our framework combines database and multimedia data mining to endow Web-based applications with the ability to let users manipulate the data at different levels of interest.

"Web image retrieval re-ranking with relevance model","W. H. Lin; R. Jin; A. Hauptmann","Language Technol.

Since content-based image retrieval is still considered very difficult, most current large-scale Web image search engines exploit text and link structure to ""understand"" the content of the Web images. However, local text information, such as caption, filenames and adjacent text, is not always reliable and informative. Therefore, global information should be taken into account when a Web image retrieval system makes relevance judgment. We propose a re-ranking method to improve Web image retrieval by reordering the images retrieved from an image search engine. The re-ranking process is based on a relevance model, which is a probabilistic model that evaluates the relevance of the HTML document linking to the image, and assigns a probability of relevance. The experiment results showed that the re-ranked image retrieval achieved better performance than original Web image retrieval, suggesting the effectiveness of the re-ranking method. The relevance model is learned from the Internet without preparing any training data and independent of the underlying algorithm of the image search engines. The re-ranking process should be applicable to any image search engines with little effort.","","POD:0-7695-1932-6","10.1109/WI.2003.1241200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241200","","Content based retrieval;HTML;Image analysis;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Internet;Joining processes;Large-scale systems;Search engines","Web sites;image retrieval;probability;relevance feedback;search engines","HTML document linking;Web image retrieval re-ranking;Web image search engine;Web text retrieval;content-based image retrieval;link structure analysis;probabilistic model;relevance model;training data","","28","9","22","","","13-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach employs a fully unsupervised segmentation algorithm to divide images into regions. Low-level features describing the color, position, size and shape of the resulting regions are extracted and are automatically mapped to appropriate intermediate-level descriptors forming a simple vocabulary termed object ontology. The object ontology is used to allow the qualitative definition of the high-level concepts the user queries for (semantic objects, each represented by a keyword) in a human-centered fashion. When querying, clearly irrelevant image regions are rejected using the intermediate-level descriptors; following that, a relevance feedback mechanism employing the low-level features is invoked to produce the final query results. The proposed approach bridges the gap between keyword-based approaches, which assume the existence of rich image captions or require manual evaluation and annotation of every image of the collection, and query-by-example approaches, which assume that the user queries for images similar to one that already is at his disposal.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1246729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246729","","Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Shape;Spatial databases;Vocabulary","feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;relevance feedback;visual databases","image collection;intermediate-level descriptors;low-level features;object ontology;object-based image retrieval;relevance feedback mechanism;unsupervised segmentation algorithm","","28","3","8","","","14-17 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And these results also showed that the HMM model is helpful to captures the semantic cohesions properly.","1062-922X;1062922X","POD:0-7803-7952-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2003.1244653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1244653","","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Hidden Markov models;Information processing;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Laboratories;Speech;Statistical analysis;Taxonomy","computational linguistics;grammars;hidden Markov models;semantic networks;unsupervised learning","HMM model;HowNet system;WSD problem;class based semantic cohesion computation;hidden Markov model;individual word;noun collocation;semantic classification methods;semantic meanings;semantic relation;unsupervised learning;verb collocation;word sense disambiguation","","1","1","10","","","5-8 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But currently, most of description methods of multimedia document, such as MPEG-7, have some shortage in providing the description of content information in different layers and different granularities. In this paper, we locate the content information of the multimedia documents into three proper layers and define MDU (Multimedia Document basic Unit) to collect this information in different granularities. And then, we also discuss the relationships among MDUs. Combining the discussion above, we can formalize the presentation of the multimedia documents. An example is provided to explain how to use this presentation method, and we also compare this method with related works.","","POD:0-7695-1957-1","10.1109/ICCIMA.2003.1238161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1238161","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Optical computing;Streaming media;XML","document handling;information retrieval;multimedia systems","MDU;MPEG-7;content information;multimedia data;multimedia document basic unit;multimedia information retrieval","","2","","11","","","27-30 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of using a combination of weighted Euclidean distances as a shot similarity measure, we base the retrieval process on the likelihood of a video frame under the generative model trained on the query sequence. This allows for automatic separation and balancing of various causes of variability, such as occlusion, appearance change and motion. In previous work, this usually required complex user intervention. The likelihood models we study in this paper are based on appearances of multiple, possibly occluding objects in a video clip. Given a query, the video is played at a higher rate until similar frames are found. The playback speed is linked to the frame likelihood, so that the speed drops as the likely target frames are starting to come in.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1246756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246756","","Aggregates;Cameras;Computational efficiency;Games;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Search engines;User interfaces","image retrieval;image sequences;video signal processing","adaptive video fast forward;browsing;multiple object scene;playback speed;query sequence;retrieval process;statistical scene generative model;target frame;video clip;video frame likelihood model;video search","","1","2","5","","","14-17 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the SPY-TEC, an efficient algorithm for processing hyperspherical range queries was introduced with a special partitioning strategy. However, the technique for processing k-nearest-neighbor queries, which are frequently used in similarity search, was not proposed. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for processing nearest-neighbor queries on the SPY-TEC by extending the incremental nearest-neighbor algorithm. We also introduce a metric that can be used to guide an ordered best-first traversal when finding nearest neighbors on the SPY-TEC. Finally, we show that our technique significantly outperforms the related techniques in processing k-nearest-neighbor queries by comparing it to the R*-tree, the X-tree, and the sequential scan through extensive experiments.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1245286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245286","","Costs;Data mining;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Nearest neighbor searches;Partitioning algorithms;Query processing;Spatial databases","data structures;database indexing;query processing","R*-tree;SPY-TEC;X-tree;d-dimensional data space;high-dimensional data spaces;hyperspherical range query processing;incremental nearest-neighbor algorithm;indexing method;metric;nearest-neighbor query processing;ordered best-first traversal;partitioning strategy;sequential scan;spherical pyramid technique","","2","","30","","","Nov.-Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An eigenspace decomposition of high-dimensional trajectory data leads to very compact representation, which is then used as indexing structure. To cutback on PCA computation during indexing, we first segment the trajectories into atomic subtrajectories using a curvature zero-crossing based approach followed by clustering of these subtrajectories. A two-level PCA operation with coarse-to-fine retrieval for query trajectory is then performed to generate retrieval results. Our experimental results show that our global PCA based approach performs better when input query trajectory is of similar length compared to the matching trajectories in the database. However, when partial trajectories are posed as queries our segmented trajectory based approach provides superior results for all precision-recall ratios.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7750-8","10.1109/ICIP.2003.1246757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1246757","","Content based retrieval;Databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;Motion analysis;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Video compression;Wavelet transforms","content-based retrieval;database indexing;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;matrix decomposition;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;video databases","atomic subtrajectory;coarse-to-fine retrieval;compact representation;content-based video indexing;curvature zero-crossing based approach;eigenspace decomposition;high-dimensional trajectory data;indexing structure;input query trajectory;matching trajectory;motion modeling;object trajectory modeling;precision-recall ratio;principal component analysis;segmented trajectory based indexing;subtrajectory clustering;trajectory database;two-level PCA operation;video clip;video data retrieval","","37","3","5","","","14-17 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a system developed for video browsing and retrieval based on multimedia integration. First, a basic structure of the system is defined. Second, a robust scene segmentation method is presented, which analyzes audio and visual information and accounts for their interrelations and coincidence to semantically identify video scenes. We then extract text from key frames with video OCR technique and extract text transcriptions by speech recognition to classify video scenes and form the full-text indices. Finally, natural language understanding technique is used to automatically classify video scenes on the basis of the texts obtained from close caption, video OCR process and speech recognition. In this way, we have developed the content-based video database system which integrates multimodality to browse and retrieve video data. The experimental results show that multimodal integration is effective for video scene segmentation. Our system built on the idea of multimodal integration makes content-based browsing and retrieval of video data, key-frame-based video abstract and search by keywords practical.","","POD:0-7695-1932-6","10.1109/WI.2003.1241288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1241288","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Multimedia systems;Natural languages;Optical character recognition software;Robustness;Speech recognition","content-based retrieval;image segmentation;multimedia databases;natural languages;optical character recognition;speech recognition;text analysis;video databases","audio information;content-based video browsing;content-based video database system;full-text indices;key-frame-based video abstract;multimedia data;multimedia integration;multimodal integration;natural language understanding technique;speech recognition;text transcriptions;video OCR technique;video retrieval;video scene segmentation;video scenes classification;visual information","","3","","11","","","13-17 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yet, the knowledge embedded in these databases is tacit and remains so because, until now, there was no way to capture this knowledge and to integrate it into a suitable knowledge representation. We introduce a new knowledge structure and authoring system that bridges this gap. This knowledge structure organizes database content into a network of topic lists and paths that serves as a knowledge representation of how the database content is organized. The database schema provides the conceptual structure for this knowledge representation and the database content gives it meaning. Using automatic mapping tools, developers navigate over a database to capture lists of database values that serve as topics in the knowledge structure. They can also add topics and paths to the structure by hand. When this knowledge representation is complete, developers generate data files for a user navigation structure. In turn, this navigation structure enables users to browse and to explore database content and to pinpoint the information they need. Using this knowledge structure to organize content details paves the way for a new generation of information retrieval technologies that include agent-based capabilities.","","POD:0-7803-7958-6","10.1109/KIMAS.2003.1245131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1245131","","Authoring systems;Bridges;Content based retrieval;Databases;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Knowledge representation;Navigation;Paper technology;Telecommunication traffic","deductive databases;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;knowledge management;knowledge representation","agent-based capability;automatic mapping tool;database retrieval;information retrieval technology;knowledge intensive system;knowledge management;knowledge representation;kowledge-based model","","2","","15","","","30 Sept.-4 Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
