However, it is generally accepted that for security reasons, each embedder should better have its own secret key.

Its speciality is its ability to handle the Japanese language. It uses the most powerful information search engine for the Japanese language so it provides a comfortable environment for the users who want or who must read Japanese information. Unlike the manually structured directory style of “Yahoo!”, the computer-based robot-style search mechanism in “goo” automatically retrieves information from the net. Furthermore, “goo” provides the most up-to-date information through its original service “mogitate goo” which means “freshly-squeezed goo”. Information categories such as the news site “Nikkei goo”, also work perfectly to help the user find what he is looking for. We describe the key technologies behind the “goo” site and its services. The keys are the “InfoBee” information handling technologies, such as the information retriever, crawler, indexer and Japanese analyzer. The system described doesn't require a high performance super-computer. It works effectively on a workstation-cluster, even a whitebox-based personal computer cluster.

The logics are obtained by combining the multiagent epistemic logic and multi-sources reasoning systems. Every ordering for the reliability of the agents is represented by a modal operator, so we can reason with the merging information under different situations The approach is conservative in the sense that if an agent's belief is in conflict with those of higher priorities, then his belief is completely discarded front the merged result. We consider two strategies for the conservative merging of beliefs. In the first one, if inconsistency occurs at some level, then all beliefs at the lower levels are discarded simultaneously, so it is called level cutting strategy. For the second one, only the level at which the inconsistency occurs is skipped, so it is called level skipping strategy. The formal semantics and axiomatic systems for these two strategies are presented.","","POD:2-7257-0000-0","10.1109/IFIC.2000.862649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862649","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet;Logic;Merging;Multiagent systems;Search engines;Table lookup","formal logic;inference mechanisms;multi-agent systems","distributed belief fusion;merging beliefs;multi-sources reasoning systems;multiagent epistemic logic","","0","","15","","","10-13 July 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the chosen vertex-based representation, we solve the problem of determining the number and locations of approximating vertices for all scalable layers jointly and optimally. The number of scalable layers is not constrained, but, rather, is a by-product of the proposed optimization. The algorithm employs two different coding strategies: one for the base layer and one for the enhancement layers. By carefully defining scalable layer recursion and base layer segment costs the problem is solved by executing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) shortest path algorithm.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-6297-7","10.1109/ICIP.2000.899864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=899864","","Constraint optimization;Costs;Decoding;Encoding;Image databases;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Rate-distortion;Shape","approximation theory;data compression;directed graphs;image coding;image representation;optimisation;rate distortion theory","approximating vertices;base layer coding;bit budget constraint;directed acyclic graph;efficient recursive algorithm;enhancement layers;image coding;image reconstruction;object contours;optimal intra-mode scalable layer decompositions;optimization;rate distortion;recursive scalable layer generation;shape approximation;shape distortion minimisation;shortest path algorithm;vertex-based representation","","3","","9","","","10-13 Sept. 2000","10 Sep 2000-13 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The wind directions are extracted from wind induced streaks, e.g. from boundary layer rolls, Langmuir cells, or wind shadowing, which are approximately in line with the mean wind direction. The wind speeds are derived from the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) and image geometry of the calibrated ScanSAR images, together with the local wind direction. Therefore the semi-empirical C-band model CMOD4, which describes the dependency of the NRCS on wind and image geometry, is inverted. CMOD4 was originally developed for the scatterometer operating at C-band with vertical polarization and has to be modified for horizontal polarization, which is performed by considering the polarization ratio according to Kirchhoff scattering. To verify the algorithm, wind fields were computed from several RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR images and compared to collocated results from the Danish high resolution limited area model. To estimate relative errors of wind speed due to uncertainties in wind direction and NRCS, sensitivity studies were performed","","POD:0-7803-7031-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2001.977058","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=977058","","Data mining;Geometry;Information retrieval;Polarization;Radar cross section;Satellites;Sea measurements;Shadow mapping;Solid modeling;Wind speed","remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","C-band model CMOD4;C-band scatterometer;Canadian satellite RADARSAT-1;Danish high resolution limited area model;Kirchhoff scattering;Langmuir cells;RADARSAT-1 ScanSAR data;boundary layer rolls;coastal high resolution wind fields;horizontal polarization;image geometry;normalized radar cross section;retrieval algorithm;scanning synthetic aperture radar;sensitivity studies;vertical polarization;wind direction;wind induced streaks;wind shadowing;wind speeds","","2","","11","","","2001","09 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A condition which determines whether tenary or bit tries should be used is found. Even though bit tries have better storage reduction in some cases, tenary tries access faster than bit tries. We show that the morphic trie images use less space than minimal prefix tries.

In this paper, we propose an automatic navigation scheme to store and retrieve XML documents through object-relational databases. We have designed a system architecture, called XMG (XML Meta-Generator), which, after reading a specific DTD (document type definition), automatically generates the corresponding object-relational database schema (OR-schema), a document instance (DI) decomposer and a DI reconstructor. These modules automatically decompose and reconstruct XML documents into/from object-relational databases in a seamless manner. Moreover, documents stored in the object-relational databases can be managed and queried more easily than they could be in file systems or relational databases.

It is common knowledge that most of the images are dominated by a small number of colors, called dominant colors. We propose dominant color matrices for representing the spatial distribution of dominant colors in an image, which can serve as a basis for measuring the spatial similarity between images. In order to calculate the spatial similarity on dominant color matrices, we use two-dimensional DP matching technology extended from conventional DP matching.

Biomass retrieval algorithms have been developed for airborne P-band data collected over both boreal and tropical forests. Radar measurements are insensitive to cloud cover and can be operated during day and night. Hence a space-borne radar system, operating at low frequency, will permit the measurement, mapping, and understanding of these parameters with a spatial and temporal resolution suitable for modeling ecosystem processes at regional, continental, and global scales. Based on experience with airborne campaigns, a polarimetric low frequency or P-band SAR has been shown to be the most appropriate instrument to this purpose. One of the disadvantages of the P-band is that in this frequency band ionospheric distortion off the images is expected to be high. A quantitative estimation of the ionospheric influences on P-band imagery needs to be derived, which can lead to orbit parameters, which minimizes the impact of the ionosphere on biomass measurements","","POD:0-7803-7031-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2001.976080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976080","","Backscatter;Biomass;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Information retrieval;Ionosphere;Radar imaging;Radar measurements;Spaceborne radar;Wavelength measurement","forestry;geophysical aspects of cosmic rays;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","P-band;SAR;UHF;VHF;biomass;forest;geophysical measurement technique;ionosphere;radar polarimetry;radar remote sensing;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","","7","","2","","","2001","09 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

He showed that a single tightly focussed laser beam could be used to hold a microscopic particle in three dimensions near the focus of the beam. This employs what is commonly known as the dipole (""gradient"") light force. This method has now become established as a powerful non-invasive technique known as ""optical tweezers."" Optical tweezers have found widespread application especially in biology and have been used to manipulate dielectric spheres, DNA and metallic particles.

Our method is based on extracting a set of limited but meaningful frames (key-frames), able to represent the video content. The temporal variation of feature vectors for all frames within a shot, which form a trajectory in a high dimensional space, is used for key-frame selection. In particular, key-frames are extracted by estimating appropriate curve points, able to characterize the feature trajectory. The magnitude of the second derivative of the frame feature vectors with respect to time is used as a curvature measure in our approach. Due to low complexity of the algorithm, the proposed method can be easily implemented in hardware devices of even low processing capabilities thus can be embedded in many consumer electronics systems. For feature vector formulation, the video is first analyzed and several descriptors are extracted using a multiscale implementation of the recursive shortest spanning tree (RSST) algorithm, which significantly reduces the segmentation complexity. In addition, the whole procedure exploits information that exists in MPEG video databases so as to achieve a faster implementation. Finally, the extracted descriptors are classified using a fuzzy formulation scheme.

Nowadays there exists a tremendous amount of uncharacterised text documents, due to the Internet and also to old paper based archives. It is important that the information can be managed and the knowledge can be retrieved. It would be desirable to retrieve the information without reading the document. We propose a new technology based on multilevel hierarchies. Here we concentrate only on the highest level. The technology is based on a hierarchy of self-organizing maps (SOM) and on smart encoding of words. Our experiment with a text document (an annual report) shows that it is possible to separate between different types of paragraphs. It is possible to separate between the original paragraph and the one containing the same words but in random order. It is also possible to categorise the paragraphs or for instance, to find all unauthorised citations of paragraphs within a long text document. The only requirement is that there be a considerable amount of text documents for the training process. Finally the text documents can be classified based on the trained types of paragraphs. This means that unknown documents can be categorised without reading them.

SCC structures video objects through video partitioning, keyframe selection and segment clustering. SMC organizes video segments/clusters into semantically meaningful hierarchies with annotated feature indices. QPC provides flexible query specification and processing, and supports external video application development.

Probability theory provides a well-known and well understood way of representing uncertainty and may thus be used to provide a mechanism for storing uncertain information in a database. We consider the problem of aggregation using an imprecise probability data model that allows us to represent imprecision by partial probabilities and uncertainty using probability distributions. Most work to date has concentrated on providing functionality for extending the relational algebra with a view to executing traditional queries on uncertain or imprecise data. However, for imprecise and uncertain data, we often require aggregation operators that provide information on patterns in the data. Thus, while traditional query processing is tuple-driven, processing of uncertain data is often attribute-driven where we use aggregation operators to discover attribute properties. The aggregation operator that we define uses the Kullback-Leibler information divergence between the aggregated probability distribution and the individual tuple values to provide a probability distribution for the domain values of an attribute or group of attributes. The provision of such aggregation operators is a central requirement in furnishing a database with the capability to perform the operations necessary for knowledge discovery in databases","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.971186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=971186","","Algebra;Data models;Database systems;Deductive databases;Information retrieval;Probability distribution;Query processing;Relational databases;Stochastic processes;Uncertainty","data mining;data models;database theory;probability;query processing;relational databases;uncertainty handling","Kullback-Leibler information divergence;aggregation operators;attribute properties;databases;imprecise information aggregation;imprecise probability data model;individual tuple values;knowledge discovery;partial probabilities;probability distributions;probability theory;query processing;relational algebra;uncertain information aggregation;uncertain information storage","","32","2","24","","","Nov/Dec 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In view of this, we propose and explore in this paper the approach of rate staggering, i.e., staggering video data in the disk array based on data rates. It is noted that the advantages of the proposed rate staggering method enable a video server to provide feasible solutions to some video stream requests which cannot be met otherwise. The system throughput can thus be increased. Performance studies on the methods proposed are conducted. It is empirically shown that a VOD system employing rate staggering can significantly outperform a system employing time staggering for the playout of scalable video","","POD:0-7803-6536-4","10.1109/ICME.2000.871014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=871014","","Bandwidth;Data communication;Decoding;Encoding;Information retrieval;Load management;Multimedia communication;Network servers;Streaming media;Throughput","video on demand;video servers","data placement method;disk array;disk-array-based video server;full video bit stream;layered multiple resolutions;low quality videos;low resolution videos;rate staggering;scalable video data storage;scalable video playout;scalable video storage;video on demand system","","0","1","18","","","2000","30 Jul 2000-02 Aug 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, video composition is performed for the purposes of video production and analysis of video data. However, there are no software tools that provide the end user facility to compose, manipulate and query videos on an ad hoc basis. We propose a new method for video composition and retrieval, which presents many opportunities for structuring video segments. This enables users to compose and manipulate video on the basis of the objects that appear in them. Each video object represents a VOP (video object plane) as provisioned in MPEG-4.

In QoS distribution monitoring, the distribution of QoS experienced by a real-time flow in different network segments is monitored.

In a temporal object database system (TODB), this OIDX also contains the timestamps of the object versions. OIDX maintenance can be very costly, and can easy become the bottleneck of such a system. The main reason for this, is that in a TODB the OIDX needs to be updated every time an object is updated. In order to reduce the access costs, a new index structure, particularly suitable to TODB requirements, is necessary. In this paper, we describe an OIDX for TODBs, the Vagabond Temporal OID Index (VTOIDX). The main goals of the VTOIDX are: 1) support for temporal data, while still having index performance close to a non-temporal (one-version) database system, 2) efficient object-relational operation, and 3) flexible tertiary storage migration of partitions of the index.

However, scene segmentation from video data is not an easy task. We propose a novel hierarchical scene segmentation method which consists of three steps: initial segmentation, refinement, and adjustment. First, we detect initial scene boundaries using a continuous coherence computing model. As a coherence computing model, we use a short-term memory-based model in which the memory size and attention span size are not fixed. In our model, there are times when the removal of shots from the memory buffer may not follow a First-In-First-Out rule. After detection of initial scene boundaries, we execute the refinement process for each scene using k-means clustering algorithm to find misses not detected in scene boundary detection. The cluster-validity analysis technique is used to find the optimal number of clusters. If a new scene boundary is found within a scene by the analysis of clustering results, the scene is split into two sub-scenes. After that, we execute the adjustment process. We choose two consecutive scenes to detect whether the scene boundary is false or not. For shots of two consecutive scenes, we also perform a k-means clustering algorithm and detect desirable scene boundaries. Finally, accurate scene segmentation results are obtained and experimental results are presented","","POD:0-7695-1354-9","10.1109/IVL.2001.990858","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990858","","Cities and towns;Clustering algorithms;Coherence;Data engineering;Data mining;Gunshot detection systems;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Video sequences","edge detection;image segmentation;pattern clustering;video signal processing","First-In-First-Out rule;adjustment process;attention span size;cluster-validity analysis technique;continuous coherence computing model;hierarchical approach;hierarchical scene segmentation method;initial scene boundary detection;k-means clustering algorithm;memory size;optimal number;refinement process;semantic unit;semantic-based video indexing;short-term memory-based model;video data access;video retrieval","","1","","8","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The user's high level query and perception subjectivity can be captured to some extent by dynamically updated low-level feature weights based on the user's feedback. However, in MARS (Y. Rui et al., 1997), only the positive feedbacks, i.e., relevant images are considered. A novel approach is proposed by providing both positive and negative feedbacks for support vector machine (SVM) learning. The SVM learning results are used to update the weights of preference for relevant images. Priorities are given to the positive feedbacks that have larger distances to the hyperplane determined by the support vectors.

As a basis for algorithm development, backscattering properties of snow-free and snow-covered alpine surfaces were investigated using ERS SAR data and field measurements at test sites in the Austrian Alps. The incidence angle dependence of backscattering derived from SAR data is compared with simulations for snow-free surfaces and for surfaces covered by dry snow and wet snow. Significant seasonal changes of backscattering are observed, which are mainly caused by variations of the snow liquid water content and of the surface roughness. The importance of surface roughness for backscattering of wet snow is demonstrated by a surface roughness experiment. The algorithm for mapping wet snow applies change detection using ratios of wet snow versus snow-free or dry snow surfaces. The main steps include coregistration, speckle reduction, thresholding of ratio images, geocoding, and, optionally, combination of crossing passes to reduce the loss of information due to layover. A threshold of -3 dB was found to be appropriate for both Radarsat and ERS SAR to separate wet snow from other surfaces. Postprocessing steps, based on historic snow maps or topographic information, are used to correct for dry snow areas at high elevations. Effects of imaging geometry are investigated by comparing ERS SAR images with a look angle of 19° and Radarsat SAR Beam Mode S7 images with a look angle of 40°. The comparison of snow maps from SAR and Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper images shows good agreement in areas of closed snow cover, whereas near the snow line/SAR tends to slightly underestimate the snow extent","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.842004","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=842004","","Backscatter;Change detection algorithms;Information retrieval;Rough surfaces;Snow;Surface roughness;Surface topography;Synthetic aperture radar;Terrain mapping;Testing","backscatter;geophysical signal processing;hydrological techniques;radar cross-sections;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;snow;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","Austria;Austrian Alps;algorithm;alpine surface;backscattering;coregistration;hydrology;image sequence;incidence angle;liquid water content;measurement technique;mountainous terrain;multitemporal SAR;radar remote sensing;repeat pass;seasonal change;snow cover;snowcover;snowpack;speckle reduction;surface roughness;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping;thresholding;wet snow","","101","","26","","","Mar 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is important that a video model models the characteristics of objects and their relationships in time and space. J.F. Allen's (1983) 13 temporal relationships are often used in formulating queries that contain the temporal relationships among video frames. For the spatial relationships, most of the approaches are based on projecting objects on a two or three-dimensional coordinate system. However, very few attempts have been made formally to represent the spatio-temporal relationships of objects contained in the video data and to formulate queries with spatio-temporal constraints. The purpose of the work is to design a model representation for the specification of the spatio-temporal relationships among objects in video sequences. The model describes the spatial relationships among objects for each frame in a given video scene and the temporal relationships (for this frame) of the temporal intervals measuring the duration of these spatial relationships. It also models the temporal composition of an object, which reflects the evolution of object's spatial relationships over the subsequent frames in the video scene and in the entire video sequence. Our model representation also provides an effective and expressive way for the complete and precise specification of distances among objects in digital video.

Adaptive applications can cope with these differences in connectivity by choosing alternate representations of objects or streams or by downloading the objects from alternate locations. In order to effectively adapt, applications must discover the condition of the network before communicating with distant hosts. Unfortunately, the ability to predict or report the quality of connectivity is missing in today's suite of Internet services. To address this limitation, we have developed SPAND (shared passive network performance discovery), a system that facilitates the development of adaptive network applications. In each domain, applications make passive application specific measurements of the network and store them in a local centralized repository of network performance information. Other applications may retrieve this information from the repository and use the shared experiences of all hosts in a domain to predict future performance. In this way, applications can make informed decisions about adaptation choices as they communicate with distant hosts. In this paper, we describe and evaluate the SPAND architecture and implementation. We show how the architecture makes it easy to integrate new applications into our system and how the architecture has been used with specifics types of data transport. Finally, we describe LookingGlass, a WWW mirror site selection tool that uses SPAND. LookingGlass meets the conflicting goals of collecting passive network performance measurements and maintaining good client response times.

PARELEC 2000","20020806","2000","","","121","127","The image retrieval from the distributed image servers using a sketched image as a key was confirmed to be superior to that using keywords. In accordance with experimental and analytical studies, the total processing time of the image retrieval using a sketched image was much shorter than that of the image retrieval using keywords, and the total volume of data required for the image retrieval using a sketched image was much smaller than that for the image retrieval using keywords. On the image retrieval using a sketched image, the processing time was found to be reduced to one half of that in the conventional system when the image directories were installed in the new system. A mathematical model to derive the waiting time W from the processing time P was obtained as W=λP<sup>2</sup>/(1-λP), where λ is the rate of occurrence of the requests for the image retrieval. The calculated values were confirmed to agree with experimental data. Based on the studies, a high-speed image retrieval system was constructed using an image directory. Based on the experimental studies, the increases in success rate, reduction of processing time, total volume of data transmitted through the communication lines, and waiting time are theoretically derived to define the characteristics of the image database systems constructed using image directories","","POD:0-7695-0759-X","10.1109/PCEE.2000.873614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=873614","","Color;Control systems;Engines;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems","image retrieval;visual databases","distributed image servers;image database systems;image directories;image retrieval;retrieving images;sketched image","","0","","17","","","2000","27 Aug 2000-30 Aug 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difference in models of received echoes backscattered from the extended scene and point like moving target between the SAR and airborne early warning (AEW) system is investigated and it shows that the quadric phase can not be ignored in the SAR system as in the AEW system due to its long coherent processing period. A modified STAP is put forward to suppress the clutter whilst retaining the phase history of the moving target. The concept of the “weight signal” is proposed to retrieve the phase history of the moving target, which is damaged by the STAP due to the optimum SAR clutter cancellation. Computer simulation results, which lend support to the conclusions reached through theoretical analysis, are presented throughout the paper","","POD:0-7803-5776-0","10.1109/RADAR.2000.851884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=851884","","Airborne radar;Azimuth;History;Information retrieval;Object detection;Phased arrays;Radar clutter;Signal processing;Synthetic aperture radar;Time frequency analysis","airborne radar;backscatter;interference suppression;optimisation;phased array radar;radar clutter;radar detection;radar imaging;radar theory;radar tracking;space-time adaptive processing;synthetic aperture radar;target tracking","AEW system;SAR imaging;airborne early warning system;airborne radar;backscattering;coherent processing period;computer simulation;joint STAP-WVD detection;optimum clutter cancellation;phase history;phased array radar;quadric phase;received echoes;slowly moving target detection;weight signal","","0","","5","","","2000","07 May 2000-12 May 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We don't parse the video data in the whole region but in each region (anchor person shots and five news shots), and also we use the encoded data to improve the processing time. Firstly, we detect anchor person shot using the luminance DC mean value of all I-frames. This provides us with the first and end frame of anchor person frames. As a result, anchor person shots and, live news shots parse in different methods, and the accuracy and processing time of parsing the data are improved.

The spatial media fusion project started last year (2000) to construct a framework of multimedia content circulation based on spatial keys. A geographic coordinate (x,y) is one kind of spatial data, but there are other kinds of spatial data, called spatial referenced data, which can be converted to geographic coordinates.

This expression enables performance analysis of the proposed frequency offset estimator as a function of the number of estimated cyclic correlation coefficients used.

In this work we derive the complete class of local transformations that preserve the histogram or simply scale its magnitude. To achieve this the transformations are represented as solutions to families of vector fields acting on the image. It is then shown that weak perspective projection and paraperspective projection belong to this class and simply scale the histogram. The results on weak perspective projection, together with the effect of illumination, are used to compute the histogram of the projection of 3D polyhedral objects.
