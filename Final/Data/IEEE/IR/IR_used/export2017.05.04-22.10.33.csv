Using public transport, although is cheaper and efficient, entails that only fixed places of boarding/exiting may be used which, in turn, implies walking to (from) a particular location from (to) a given station. Given the impact of the weather on the mood and activities, preferences for a certain type of services may need to be dynamically adjusted based on the current weather or the near-future forecast, modulo travel-routes to preferred locations. In this work, we develop a model to predict a user's preferred mode of transport (car, or public transit) from their old check-ins and incorporate the weather context into the recommendation process. We use event-based modeling to control the extent of walking depending on user-defined tolerance information and live weather conditions. We implemented a web application (both desktop and mobile platforms), utilizing existing tools such as Google Maps Direction API and Open Weather Map API for retrieving real-time information.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0883-4; POD:978-1-5090-0884-1","10.1109/MDM.2016.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517814","Context-aware Recommendation Systems;Location Context;Public Transit;Unsupervised Learning;Weather Context","Context;Context modeling;Dispersion;Legged locomotion;Meteorology;Predictive models;Transportation","information retrieval;public transport;recommender systems;traffic engineering computing;user interfaces","Google Maps Direction API;Open Weather Map API;Web application;Yelp-like recommendation sites;application program interfaces;live weather conditions;public transportation users;realtime information retrieval;recommendation systems;transport mode;travel-time;user preferences;user-defined tolerance information;weather updates","","","","","","","13-16 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the crowdsourced data from smartphones are generally with low quality, which induce crucial challenges and hurt the applicability of crowdsourcing applications. This paper presents our study to address such challenges in a concrete application, namely floorplan generation. In order to utilize pedestrians' traces for indoor location inference, existing proposals mostly rely on infrastructural references or accurate data sources, which are by nature restricted in terms of applicability and pervasiveness. Our proposal called SenseWit is motivated by the observation that people's behavior offers meaningful clues for location inference. The noise, ambiguity, and behavior diversity contained in the crowdsourced data, however, mean non-trivial challenges in generating high-quality floorplans. We propose 1) a novel concept called Nail to identify featured locations in indoor space and 2) a heuristic pathlet bundling algorithm to progressively discover the internal layouts. We implement SenseWit and conduct real-world experiments in different spaces. Our work offers an efficient technique to obtain high-quality structures (either logical or physical) from low-quality data. We believe it can be generalized to other crowdsourcing applications.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1460-6; POD:978-1-5090-1461-3","10.1109/DCOSS.2016.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536286","","Crowdsourcing;Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Mobile communication;Sensors;Smart phones;Turning","cartography;information retrieval;mobile computing;smart phones","Nail concept;SenseWit;crowdsourcing applications;floorplan generation application;heuristic pathlet bundling algorithm;location inference;mobile crowdsourcing;only inertial sensing;smart phones","","","","","","","26-28 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To cope with the syntactic diversities of the corpus, we propose four improved candidate answer score algorithms. Each of them is based on the lexical function of hot terms and their syntactic relationships with the candidate answers.

The datasets usually are encrypted before outsourcing to preserve the privacy. However, the common practice of encryption makes the effective utilization difficult, for example, search the given keywords in the encrypted datasets. Many schemes are proposed to make encrypted data searchable based on keywords. However, keyword-based search schemes ignore the semantic representation information of users retrieval, and cannot completely meet with users search intention. Therefore, how to design a content-based search scheme and make semantic search more effective and context-aware is a difficult challenge. In this paper, we proposed an innovative semantic search scheme based on the concept hierarchy and the semantic relationship between concepts in the encrypted datasets. More specifically, our scheme first indexes the documents and builds trapdoor based on the concept hierarchy. To further improve the search efficiency, we utilize a tree-based index structure to organize all the document index vectors. Our experiment results based on the real world datasets show the scheme is more efficient than previous scheme. We also study the threat model of our approach and prove it does not introduce any security risk.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9953-1; POD:978-1-4673-9954-8","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524606","","Cloud computing;Computers;Cryptography;Feature extraction;Indexes;Semantics;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;document handling;information retrieval;outsourcing;ubiquitous computing;user interfaces;vectors","cloud computing;content-aware search;context-awareness;document index vectors;encrypted outsourced data;innovative semantic search;privacy preservation;security risk;semantic representation information;tree-based index structure;users retrieval","","","","","","","10-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distinctive methods and methodologies are used in such sites for identifying best answers and ranking the quality answers. We identified two major problems in leading CQA sites. The first problem is majority of best answers identified by CQA sites are from the users who already had many followers. The second is if a question is posted and if the best answer is written by a user late after many answer, the probability of the answer getting ranked as top answer with high rank is very less. This paper introduces RewardRank algorithm to rank the answers provided by users in CQA sites. The RewardRank algorithm treats users with more followers and less followers equally. Also, the answer written at various time intervals by different users is also treated equally. On short ranking is based on only quality of answers.

In this paper, we propose a novel method based on audio signal processing techniques. We represent binary bytes as audio signals and then apply Music information retrieval (MIR) techniques to find musical patterns using MFCC and chromagram features in them. Then, we create machine learning model based on extracted features in order to classify new samples. Our technique is light weight and consumes low memory.

However, concerns exploding the frequency of use of documents in many office managers have driven increasing interests in Document Image Analysis (DAI) system. An automated tool that can distinguish photographs, textual and mixed documents in heterogeneous dataset can be effective to reduce the complexity measure in archiving process. Otherwise, instead of applying the same archiving strategy on the all documents dataset, a machine vision system can be used for identifying only the archiving process which can be used for each input document. This paper examines the use of support vector machine (SVM) algorithm for the helpful classification of documents in heterogeneous digital documents dataset. Our purpose is to investigate if a sufficient classification rate can be achieved when SVM is employed as a classification model in an automated document archiving system. In our experiments, a mixture of low-level features that characterizes documents in dataset was tested to build the aforementioned classification model.

In this work we propose a followee recommendation approach, which takes advantage of the increasing amount of available social data and specifically the semantic relatedness of topics that interest users. In order to accomplish this we use a Topic Graph, containing a wide variety of topics that will be used for the recommendation process. Today knowledge graphs provide a solid basis for us to construct a full and reliable Topic Graph. Our approach takes advantage of the semantic information retrieved from users' tweets, in order to build an interest profile for each user.

Throop","1610 Wavecrest Lane, Houston, TX 77062","2016 IEEE Aerospace Conference","20160630","2016","","","1","7","Risk assessment depends on data from problem reports (PRs), yet analysis of these reports is difficult. Finding all the pertinent reports is a challenge. Full-text search is commonly used to retrieve groups of similar PRs, but this method typically misses many reports because of variations in spelling, synonyms and technical jargon. Metadata codes are used to classify the content of each PR according to features such as the type of failure mode, defect or cause. However, manual PR coding schemes are difficult to follow and there are frequent coding errors. NASA reports have made recommendations to improve the quality of content codes, but these recommendations have not been adequately addressed. During an assessment for the International Space Station (ISS), alternative solutions to metadata coding were explored. Automatic concept extraction from the content of text descriptions was used to assign concept tags to each PR. The concepts were drawn from large ontology of aerospace language. An automatic rule-based approach was developed to generate interoperable “proxy” codes. The rules associated the extracted concepts with manual PR codes. The work to automatically define proxy codes was abandoned because of the poor quality of the manual content codes. Lessons learned and recommended corrective and preventive actions for manual coding errors are discussed.

This generalized phase retrieval (GPR) problem is a fundamental task in various disciplines. Natural nonconvex methods often work remarkably well for GPR in practice, but lack clear theoretical explanations. In this paper, we take a step towards bridging this gap. We show that when the sensing vectors a<sub>k</sub>'s are generic (i.i.d. complex Gaussian) and the number of measurements is large enough (m ≥ Cn log<sup>3</sup> n), with high probability (w.h.p.), a natural least-squares formulation for GPR has the following benign geometric structure: (1) all local minimizers are global-they are the target signal x and its equivalent copies; and (2) the objective function has a negative directional curvature around each saddle point. Such structure allows a number of algorithmic possibilities for efficient global optimization. We describe a second-order trust-region algorithm that provably finds a global minimizer in polynomial time, from arbitrary initializations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1806-2; POD:978-1-5090-1807-9","10.1109/ISIT.2016.7541725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7541725","","Extraterrestrial measurements;Geometry;Ground penetrating radar;Information theory;Optimization;Phase measurement;Radio frequency","concave programming;information retrieval;least squares approximations;vectors","GPR problem;algorithmic possibilities;arbitrary initializations;benign geometric structure;generalized phase retrieval problem;global minimizer;global optimization;i.i.d. complex Gaussian;local minimizers;natural least-squares formulation;natural nonconvex methods;negative directional curvature;nonlinear measurements;objective function;second-order trust-region algorithm;sensing vectors","","3","","","","","10-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we propose a novel Multiple Semantic Fusion (MSF) model where various semantic properties and relationship information from knowledge base are encoded into the continuous distributed vectors derived from corpus. To capture and understand latent semantics of words, this model retrofits the semantic features in distributed representations and carries out a sense vector per word. On basis of the MSF model, we evaluate the semantic similarity between concepts by calculating the cosine similarity of the corresponding sense vectors. Our evaluation has been validated against different similarity methods in terms of Pearson correlation coefficient between computational results with human judgments.

Most of these services have a program retrieval system that helps users find the TV programs they would like to watch. The conventional systems retrieve TV programs by keyword matching of the query and the TV program summary. However, it is difficult for these systems to retrieve TV programs from small databases (e.g. databases where the broadcasting companies select the programs) because there are only a few programs featuring summaries that include the query. As a result, retrieval systems often output very few programs. To tackle this problem, we propose a new retrieval method using a semantic relations dictionary (SRD). We first generate a graph structure from the SRD and TV programs and then calculate the similarity scores between an input query and all TV programs. We use four metrics - the distance in the graph structure, the number of paths from query to TV program, word similarity and word ambiguity - to calculate similarity scores effectively and efficiently. The system then retrieves TV programs that have a high similarity score with the query.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9044-6; POD:978-1-4673-9045-3","10.1109/BMSB.2016.7521931","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7521931","Evaluation results showed that our method can output more programs than the baseline method using okapi BM25;while maintaining a competitive accuracy rate","Broadcasting;Companies;Databases;Dictionaries;Measurement;Semantics;TV","graph theory;information retrieval systems;semantic networks;television broadcasting;video on demand;word processing","SRD;TV program summary;broadcasting companies;graph structure;input query;keyword matching;program retrieval system;semantic relations dictionary;similarity scores;video-on-demand services;word ambiguity;word similarity","","","","","","","1-3 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In both approaches, the Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs) are used to describe the relation of radar scattering, wind speed, and the geometry of observations. By knowing radar scattering and geometric parameters, it is possible to invert the GMFs to retrieve wind speed.

Ubiquitous and pervasive computing can contribute to overcoming such challenges; however the device impersonation problem should be carefully addressed in this scenario. To deal with such problem, this paper presents a secure architecture based on ubiquitous and pervasive computing for medical records retrieval and maintenance. Such architecture relies on Near Field Communication (NFC) for message exchange between smartphones and tags. An authentication mechanism is presented and validated to ensure device authentication. Analytical results reveal that such mechanism is efficient in providing mutual authentication.

"MASC: A bitmap index encoding algorithm for fast data retrieval","Y. Wen; H. Wang; Z. Chen; J. Cao; G. Peng; W. L. Huang; Z. Hu; J. Zhou; J.

A bitmap index is a data structure enabling fast search over large data collections in a limited time, but the space consumption is always a problem. WAH, PLWAH and COMPAX are proposed for compressing bitmap indexes for less storage. In this paper, a new bitmap index encoding scheme, named MASC, is proposed to further improve the compression ratio without impairing the query performance. Instead of being limited to a fixed length (31 bits) in PLWAH and COMPAX, the stride size can be as long as possible to encode consecutive zero bits and nonzero bits in a more compact way. Instead of piggyback used in PLWAH, a new structure in MASC called carrier is introduced as piggyback in PLWAH only carries an individual nonzero bit. We also generalize the traditional literal word concept in PLWAH and COMPAX. The validity of MASC encoding scheme is demonstrated with the application in Internet Traffic Archival system. Based on experiments with real Internet traffic data set from CAIDA, MASC has a better compression ratio than PLWAH and COMPAX2 without the penalty in query performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6664-6; POD:978-1-4799-6665-3","10.1109/ICC.2016.7510827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7510827","COMPAX;PLWAH;bitmap index compression;bitmap index encoding;network forensic;network security;traffic archival","Acceleration;Data collection;Encoding;Forensics;Indexes;Information technology;Internet","Internet;encoding;indexing;information retrieval systems;query processing;telecommunication traffic","CAIDA;COMPAX2;Internet traffic archival system;Internet traffic data set;MASC encoding scheme;PLWAH;archival traffic data;bitmap index encoding algorithm;compressed adaptive index;data collections;data retrieval;data structure;forensic analysis;maximised stride with carrier;network security;nonzero bits;position list word-aligned hybrid;query performance;space consumption","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A rule mining algorithm apriori is widely used for rule generation. But Apriori is used many times on categorical data, it is seldom used for numerical data. This leads to an idea that with proper data pre-processing, a lot of intangible rules can be derived from such numerical datasets. Since the algorithm will check each and every datasets, we used a simple k-means clustering approach for dividing the processing space of Apriori and thus rules are generated for each cluster. The accuracy of the algorithm is calculated using hamming loss and is presented in the paper.

However, the sole storage service cannot satisfy all desirable requirements of users. Over the last decade, privacy-preserving search over encrypted cloud data has been a meaningful and practical research topic for outsourced data security. The fact of remote cloud storage service that users cannot have full physical possession of their data makes the privacy data search a formidable mission. A naive solution is to delegate a trusted party to access the stored data and fulfill a search task. This, nevertheless, does not scale well in practice as the fully data access may easily yield harm for user privacy. To securely introduce an effective solution, we should guarantee the privacy of search contents, i.e., what a user wants to search, and return results, i.e., what a server returns to the user. Furthermore, we also need to guarantee privacy for the outsourced data, and bring no additional local search burden to user. In this paper, we design a novel privacy-preserving functional encryption-based search mechanism over encrypted cloud data. A major advantage of our new primitive compared with the existing public key based search systems is that it supports an extreme expressive search mode, regular language search. Our security and performance analysis show that the proposed system is provably secure and more efficient than some searchable systems with high expressiveness.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2581316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492188","Regular language;cloud;secure data search","Cloud computing;Encryption;Indexes;Keyword search;Receivers;Servers","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;formal languages;information retrieval","cloud-based storage service;encrypted cloud data;high quality data retrieval services;novel privacy-preserving functional encryption-based search mechanism;regular language search;trusted party","","","","","","20160615","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Initially this data is mainly in English language so majority of data mining research work is on the English text documents. As the internet usage increased, data in other languages like Marathi, Tamil, Telugu and Punjabi etc. increased on the internet. This paper presents the retrieval system for Marathi language documents based on the user profile. User profile considers the user's interests, user's browsing history. The system shows the Marathi documents to the end user based on the user profile. Automatic text categorization is useful in better management and retrieval of these text documents and also makes document retrieval as simple task. This paper discusses the automatic text categorization of Marathi documents and literature survey of the related work done in automatic text categorization of Marathi documents. Various learning techniques exist for the classification of text documents like Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine and Decision Trees etc. There are different clustering techniques used for text categorization like Label Induction Grouping Algorithm, Suffix Tree Clustering, and K- means etc. Literature survey shows that for non-English documents VSM [Vector Space Model] gives the better results than any other models. The system provides text categorization of Marathi documents by using the LINGO [Label Induction Grouping] algorithm. LINGO is based on the VSM [Vector Space Model]. The system uses the dataset which contains 200 documents of 20 different categories. The result represents that for Marathi text documents LINGO clustering algorithm is efficient.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6817-9; POD:978-1-4673-6818-6","10.1109/ICESA.2015.7503438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7503438","Categorization;Clustering;LINGO;Marathi Documents;User profile","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Internet;Matrix decomposition;Search engines;Text categorization","Bayes methods;decision trees;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern clustering;support vector machines;text analysis","English language;English text documents;Internet usage;K-means;LINGO clustering algorithm;Marathi documents;Punjabi;Tamil;Telugu;automatic text categorization;clustering techniques;decision trees;document retrieval;label induction grouping;label induction grouping algorithm;learning techniques;naïve Bayes;nonEnglish documents VSM;suffix tree clustering;support vector machine;vector space model","","","","10","","","Oct. 30 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DTNs introduce several security and privacy challenges with regard to the attribute revocation, key escrow, and coordination of attributes issued from different authorities. This paper proposes a reliable route selection on the basis of Misbehavior Detection Algorithm and the source encrypts the data using Attribute Specified Identity Based Encryption Algorithm. The DTN is used to authorize the nodes and DTN registers the node details to Trust Authority. The Trust Authority generates Secret Key and the route to transfer packet to destination.

Literature reviewing comprises a fundamental part of the scientific writing, in which publications are evaluated and selected by relevance. Different approaches for relevance are possible, whether a more qualitative (semantic) approach with text-based techniques either more quantitative (numerical) approaches that use article's metadata, such as bibliometric measures. Bibliometrics provide direct evidences of relevance and could represent good attributes for automatic classification. Our insight is that if a bibliometric-based cannot outperform text-based approaches, a hybrid model using both could benefit from it enhancing the classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision and recall). In this paper we presented a novel approach, using Machine Learning (ML), namely the ID3 algorithm for a classification model that learn from specialist annotated data and recommend relevant papers for a specific research.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for data placement in cloud storage systems addressing the above challenges. With the security constraint, we first formulate the data placement problem as a linear programming model that minimizes the total retrieval time of a data, which is divided and distributed over storage nodes. We then develop a heuristic algorithm namely Security-awarE Data placement mechanism for cLOUd storage Systems (SEDuLOUS) to solve the problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through comprehensive simulations. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the retrieval time by up to 20% for the random-network-topology systems and 19% for the Internet2-topology system compared to baseline methods, which consider only the security requirement.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2403-2; POD:978-1-5090-2404-9","10.1109/BigDataSecurity-HPSC-IDS.2016.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502311","Security;T-coloring;cloud storage system;data placement;minimum retrieval time","Cloud computing;Data models;Distributed databases;Encryption;Memory;Silicon","Big Data;cloud computing;information retrieval;linear programming;security of data;storage management","Big Data cloud storage systems;Internet2-topology system;SEDuLOUS;data retrieval time;heuristic algorithm;intelligent methods;linear programming model;public clouds;random-network-topology systems;security constraint;security-aware data placement mechanism for cloud storage systems;storage nodes","","","","","","","9-10 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cognitive computing resolves the situation where ambiguity and uncertainty is present and attempts to mimic the mechanism of human brain. Recent information requirements need an efficient mechanism which should be capable of interacting with users in a more natural way. Our system is intended to manage large amount of textual data and mining suitable knowledge. Thus resulting in a new level of refinement to search results for the user by providing exact answer to the natural language query that are specified by users. Our system will be helpful to the users because system is able to provide succinct answers which do not require end users to wade through a huge amount of data present on the Internet.

Thus, wrappers maintenance is necessary for detecting whether wrapper is extracting erroneous data. The solution consists of using verification models to detect whether wrapper output is statistically similar to the output produced by the wrapper itself when it was successfully invoked in the past. Current proposals present some weaknesses, as the data used to build these models are supposed to be homogeneous, independent, or representative enough, or following a single predefined mathematical model. In this paper, we present MAVE, a novel multilevel wrapper verification system that is based on one-class classification techniques to overcome previous weaknesses.

Deploying instances everywhere to achieve a fast response time results in high costs, especially when these services are used infrequently and remain idle most of the time. One way to avoid needless over-provisioning is to deploy instances on-demand but this requires every component to be available upon request arrival. We propose a placement algorithm to maximize the amount of clients we can serve on-demand using the Docker layered filesystem. Docker facilitates automated deployment of services in lightweight software containers, allowing almost instantaneous deployment. Our algorithm finds the optimal storage location for layers so we can retrieve all service layers, deploy a service instance and provide a first response to a request within the desired time. We solve this problem using integer linear programming (ILP) and present techniques to improve the scalability of ILP while minimizing the performance loss. Results show that our approximation performs better with large scale problems than the classic ILP case.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0223-8; POD:978-1-5090-0224-5","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7503011","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7503011","Docker;long-tail;on-demand;provisioning;services","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Conferences;Heuristic algorithms;Linear programming;Servers;Time factors","Web services;cloud computing;information retrieval;information storage;integer programming;linear programming","Docker layered filesystem;ILP;Internet;Web services;distributed clouds;integer linear programming;lightweight software containers;long-tail services;on-demand provisioning;optimal storage location","","","","12","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main goal is to facilitate the task of reading and searching information in large documents. Text summarization is the most challenging task in information retrieval especially for Arabic language. Unlike English and European languages, researches in Arabic text summarization are very few and still in their beginning. Summarization systems for Arabic are however still not as mature and as reliable as those developed for languages like English. In this paper, we introduce a new method for Arabic text summarization based on graph theory and semantic similarity between sentences to calculate importance of each sentence in document and most important sentences are extracted to generate document summary. In addition, because words sharing a root are semantically related, feature selection techniques based on the root can improves the semantic similarity between sentences and increases the weight of the semantic feature in the sentence. We will first review the related works in this field and especially in Arabic text summarization. Then we will present the architecture of our system, its components and its features. The last section will evaluate the system and compare it to other existing methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0478-2; POD:978-1-5090-0479-9; USB:978-1-5090-0477-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2015.7507254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507254","Arabic Text Summarization;Graph model;Maximal Marginal Relevance;Weighted PageRank","Pragmatics;Reliability;Semantics;Syntactics","feature selection;graph theory;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","Arabic language;Arabic text summarization;automatic text summarization;document summary;feature selection techniques;graph theory;information retrieval;information searching;semantic similarity","","","","","","","17-20 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Predictions need to keep track of history data to analyze the usage behavior of the users. Web Usage behavior of a user can be analyzed using the web log file of a specific website. User behavior can be analyzed by observing the navigation patterns. This approach requires user session identification, clustering the sessions into similar clusters and developing a model for prediction using the current and earlier accesses. Most of the previous works in this field have used K-Means clustering technique with Euclidean distance for computation. The drawbacks of K-Means is that deciding on the number of clusters, choosing the initial random center are difficult and the order of page visits are not considered. The proposed research work uses hierarchical clustering technique with modified Levenshtein distance, Page Rank using access time length, frequency and higher order Markov model for prediction.

An interesting challenge within the aforementioned task is the efficient combination of different modalities in a multimedia object and especially the fusion between textual and visual information. The fusion of multiple modalities for retrieval in an unsupervised way has been mostly based on early, weighted linear, graph-based and diffusion-based techniques. In contrast, we present a strategy for fusing textual and visual modalities, through the combination of a non-linear fusion model and a graph-based late fusion approach. The fusion strategy is based on the construction of a uniform multimodal contextual similarity matrix and the non-linear combination of relevance scores from query-based similarity vectors. The proposed late fusion approach is evaluated in the multimedia retrieval task, by applying it to two multimedia collections, namely the WIKI11 and IAPR-TC12.

We developed for the CμP a preprocessor tool that turns a target algorithm into two (or more) separate queues like Q0 and Q1 that can run in alternation. Q0 and Q1 fulfill the same operation as the original target algorithm. Power-analysis resistance is achieved by randomly alternating the execution of Q0 and Q1, with different runs resulting in different interleavings.

But this judgment, made by people is complex as it ponders unconsciously a lot of knowledge about the world in which we live, past experiences that ultimately are summarized in a perceived reputation on the source and the information being provided. The representation of this judgement has been studied by many disciplines, which have developed various ways to represent it. One of the most popular is to use mathematical formulas to try to emulate the trust that an entity has over another. The main purpose of this research was to assess the impact of coding semantically the variables certification, evaluation and time to represent trust, making use of the social network as the main generator of information.

The performances of two different feature selection methods namely Gini Index and Distinguishing Feature Selector are analyzed using two pattern classifiers. These pattern classifiers are Bayesian network and C4.5 decision tree. As this study deals with single-label classification, a subset of documents inside OHSUMED and a self-constructed dataset is used for assessment of feature selection methods. Due to having low amount of documents for some categories in self-compiled dataset, only documents belonging to 10 different disease categories are used in the experiments for both datasets.

This paper describes an approach developed to combine information from disparate data sources in order to identify relevant relationships in heterogeneous environments. The objective is to discover entities and the relationships they share by a joint combination of sensor and soft data. By analyzing patterns of sensor-based communications and content of reports, the solution highlights entity associations which are indicative of social relationship. First, the approach identifies a set of entity relations thanks to sensor data. Then, association rules extract relations from texts by using a combination of part of speech features provided by natural language processing tools and the entity type, as labeled by a domain ontology. The overall approach is designed for domains such as intelligence analysis, where the analyst attempts to build a picture of relations holding between individuals by combining sensor streams that can refer to real-world ongoing events and more complex reports provided by human sources. Results are evaluated over a heterogeneous data set and experiments show that the combination of soft and hard data outperforms individual approaches in terms of recall.","","Electronic:978-0-9964-5274-8; POD:978-1-5090-2012-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528147","heterogeneous fusion;relation identification;semantics and ontology;soft data","Context;Data mining;Feature extraction;Ontologies;Organizations;Social network services","data mining;identification;information retrieval;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion","OIE;domain ontology;entity discovery;natural language processing;open information extraction;part of speech feature;relation identification;sensor data;sensor-based communication;social relationship;soft data","","","","","","","5-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, we examine feasibility of the proposed architecture by carrying out a basic experiment using a prototype of an FR.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6664-6; POD:978-1-4799-6665-3","10.1109/ICC.2016.7511439","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511439","","Computer architecture;Data processing;Electronic mail;Joining processes;Logic gates;Prototypes;Routing","information networks;information retrieval","CCN;FR;ICN;UAV;autonomously-flying routers;communication architecture design;content name;content-centric networking router;data processings;end nodes;flying router;information retrieval;information-centric networking;physical behaviors;routing control;unmanned air vehicle","","","","","","","22-27 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, different researchers may have their own features and there might be corresponding methods for them resulting in better recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel recommendation method which incorporates information on common author relations between articles (i.e., two articles with the same author(s)). The rationale underlying our method is that researchers often search articles published by the same author(s). Since not all researchers have such author-based search patterns, we present two features, which are defined based on information about pairwise articles with common author relations and frequently appeared authors, to determine target researchers for recommendation. Extensive experiments we performed on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the defined features are effective to determine relevant target researchers and the proposed method generates more accurate recommendations for relevant researchers when compared to a Baseline method.","","","10.1109/TBDATA.2016.2555318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458844","Common author relations;article recommendation;citation recommendation;collaborative filtering;random walk","Australia;Big data;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Context;Libraries;Recommender systems","Big Data;information retrieval;recommender systems;research and development;scientific information systems","author relations;author-based search patterns;big scholarly data;historical preferences;relevant target researchers;scientific article recommender systems;scientific article retrieval","","","","45","","20160425","June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditional social recommendation algorithms are often based on batch machine learning methods which suffer from several critical limitations, e.g., extremely expensive model retraining cost whenever new user ratings arrive, unable to capture the change of user preferences over time. Therefore, it is important to make social recommendation system suitable for real-world online applications where data often arrives sequentially and user preferences may change dynamically and rapidly. In this paper, we present a new framework of online social recommendation from the viewpoint of online graph regularized user preference learning (OGRPL), which incorporates both collaborative user-item relationship as well as item content features into an unified preference learning process. We further develop an efficient iterative procedure, OGRPL-FW which utilizes the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, to solve the proposed online optimization problem. We conduct extensive experiments on several large-scale datasets, in which the encouraging results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms obtain significantly lower errors (in terms of both RMSE and MAE) than the state-of-the-art online recommendation methods when receiving the same amount of training data in the online learning process.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2016.2569096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470266","Online social recommendation;low rank;user preference learning","Collaboration;Optimization;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Recommender systems;Social network services;Training data","data mining;graph theory;information retrieval;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;social networking (online)","Frank-Wolfe algorithm;OGRPL;data mining;information retrieval;iterative procedure;machine learning methods;online graph regularized user preference learning;online learning process;online social recommendation;real-world online applications;social recommendation system;unified preference learning process;user preference learning;user ratings","","","","","","20160516","Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The challenge in this regard is to deliver energy to the RFID sensors that are embedded inside the structures in a manner that they can continuously sense for occurrence of any rare structural events. This paper summarizes some of the progress that has been made to-date in the area of self-powered RFID sensor networks within the concept of IoT. The core sensor uses a self-powering method which directly harvests computational and storage energy from slight strain-variations in the structure. The event signatures can then be stored on a non-volatile memory and remotely retrieved at a later period of time. In this “sense now retrieve later” paradigm, self-powering is only used for continuous sensing and data-logging of essential statistics; whereas, data retrieval and reconfiguration is achieved using a low-cost commercial RFID system. Another advantage of using a commercial RFID system for data retrieval is that the related standards and FCC compliance are well established and the technology can be easily integrated with other IoT network infrastructure.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5341-7; POD:978-1-4799-5342-4; USB:978-1-4799-5340-0","10.1109/ISCAS.2016.7538983","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7538983","Fatigue prediction;Internet-of-Things;NFC;RFID;infrastructural health monitoring;piezo-floating gate sensor;self-powered sensor","Logic gates;Mechanical sensors;Monitoring;Radio frequency;Radiofrequency identification;Strain","Internet of Things;condition monitoring;data loggers;energy harvesting;information retrieval;radiofrequency identification;structural engineering computing;wireless sensor networks","FCC compliance;IoT network infrastructure;civil infrastructure;computational energy harvesting;continuous sensing;data reconfiguration;data retrieval;data-logging;infrastructural health monitoring;low-cost commercial RFID system;nonvolatile memory;radio-frequency identification tagging technology;self-powered Internet-of-Things;self-powered RFID sensor networks;sense now retrieve later paradigm;storage energy harvesting;strain-variations","","","","","","","22-25 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To evaluate CLANdroid we created a benchmark consisting of 14,450 apps along with information on similar apps provided by Google Play. We also compared effectiveness of different semantic anchors for detecting similar apps as perceived by 27 users. The results show that using Android-specific semantic anchors are useful for detecting similar Android apps across different categories.

Misinformation dissemination may lead to undesirable effects, especially in cases where the non-credible information concerns emergency events. Therefore, it is essential to timely limit the propagation of misinformation. Towards this goal, we suggest a novel propagation model, namely the Dynamic Linear Threshold (DLT) model, that effectively captures the way contradictory information, i.e., misinformation and credible information, propagates in the network. The DLT model considers the probability of a user alternating between competing beliefs, assisting in either the propagation of misinformation or credible news. Based on the DLT model, we formulate an optimization problem that aims in identifying the most appropriate subset of users to limit the spread of misinformation by initiating the propagation of credible information. Through extensive experimental evaluation we demonstrate that our approach outperforms its competitors.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0883-4; POD:978-1-5090-0884-1","10.1109/MDM.2016.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7517790","","Computational modeling;Electronic mail;Informatics;Integrated circuit modeling;Social network services;Time factors","information retrieval;optimisation;probability;social networking (online)","OSN;contradictory information;cost-effective limitation;credible news;dynamic linear threshold model;misinformation dissemination;misinformation propagation;online social network;optimization problem;word-of-mouth effect","","","","","","","13-16 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We are interested in retrieving information from multilingual speech data, from spoken documents such as broadcast news, video archives or even telephone conversations. The ultimate goal of a Spoken Document Retrieval System is to enable vocabulary-independent search over large collections of speech content, to find written or spoken “queries” or reoccurring speech data. If the language is known, the task is relatively simple. One could use a large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tool to produce highly accurate word transcripts, which are then indexed and query terms are retrieved from the index. However, if the language is unknown, hence queries are not part of the recognizers vocabulary, the relevant audio documents cannot be retrieved. Thus, search metrics are affected, and documents retrieved are no longer relevant to the user. In this paper we investigate whether the use of input features derived from multi-language resources helps the process of unsupervised spoken term detection, independent of the language. Moreover, we explore the use of multi objective search, by combining both language detection and LVCSR based search, with unsupervised Spoken Term Detection (STD). In order to achieve this, we make use of multiple open-source tools and in-house acoustic and language models, to propose a language independent spoken document retrieval system.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8695-1; POD:978-1-4673-8696-8","10.1109/CBMI.2016.7500262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7500262","","Acoustics;Feature extraction;Heuristic algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Speech processing;Speech recognition","information retrieval;natural language processing;speech recognition;unsupervised learning;vocabulary","LVCSR tool;STD;language detection;large vocabulary continuous speech recognition;multilingual speech data;open-source tools;unsupervised language independent spoken document retrieval system;unsupervised spoken term detection;vocabulary-independent search","","","","28","","","15-17 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In other cases, if the data is unavailable in the local repository, the searching mechanism is directly carried on to the web database. Stack of PDF oriented medical resources are implemented in web, where it searches with the lexical similarities. The user can also directly report the medical issues with the medical experts in the case, where the medical data is hard to locate within the stack of PDF.","","DVD:978-1-5090-1276-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-1277-0; POD:978-1-5090-1278-7","10.1109/ICCPCT.2016.7530344","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530344","Local Repository;Machine Learning;Question Answering;Web;e-Health","Biomedical imaging;Blogs;Computers;Databases;Encoding;Medical services;Terminology","Internet;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);question answering (information retrieval)","PDF oriented medical resources;Web database;cross-system operability;health care system;instant answering;interuser reusability;local repository database;machine learning","","","","","","","18-19 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Tology-Aware Optimal Data Placement Algorithm for Network Traffic Optimization","W. Chen; I. Paik; Z. Li","School of Computer Science and Engineering University of Aizu, Fukushima, Japan","IEEE Transactions on Computers","20160707","2016","65","8","2603","2617","We propose a new optimal data placement technique to improve the performance of MapReduce in cloud data centers by considering not only the data locality but also the global data access costs. We first conducted an analytical and experimental study to identify the performance issues of MapReduce in data centers and to show that MapReduce tasks that are involved in unexpected remote data access have much greater communication costs and execution time, and can significantly deteriorate the overall performance. Next, we formulated the problem of optimal data placement and proposed a generative model to minimize global data access cost in data centers and showed that the optimal data placement problem is NP-hard. To solve the optimal data placement problem, we propose a topology-aware heuristic algorithm by first constructing a replica-balanced distribution tree for the abstract tree structure, and then building a replica-similarity distribution tree for detail tree construction, to construct an optimal replica distribution tree. The experimental results demonstrated that our optimal data placement approach can improve the performance of MapReduce with lower communication and computation costs by effectively minimizing global data access costs, more specifically reducing unexpected remote data access.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2015.2485230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7286787","Geo-distributed data centers;MapReduce;heuristic algorithm;optimal data allocation;topology-aware","Data transfer;Distributed databases;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Rats;Servers;Telecommunication traffic","cloud computing;computer centres;information retrieval;optimisation;parallel processing;topology;tree data structures","MapReduce;NP-hard problem;abstract tree structure;cloud data centers;data locality;global data access cost;global data access costs;network traffic optimization;replica-balanced distribution tree;replica-similarity distribution tree;tology-aware optimal data placement algorithm;topology-aware heuristic algorithm","","","","25","","20151001","Aug. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

As a result, refugees in South Africa are not always able to gain access to invaluable legal advice offered by nonprofit organisations. To improve the access of such information, we examine the design of a mobile information system aimed at improving the dissemination of basic legal information for such individuals. Our design considers the profile of refugees assisted through legal clinics in order to establish the selection of appropriate technologies that not only empower its users through knowledge, but enable organisations to better monitor refugee trends in order to better plan the deployment of resources to enhance the impact of any aid offered.","","Electronic:978-1-9058-2455-7; POD:978-1-5090-1955-7","10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2016.7530696","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7530696","ICT4D;access to information;legal rights","Information systems;Law;Mobile communication;Pregnancy;Sociology","information dissemination;information retrieval;information systems;law administration;mobile computing","ICT4D;South Africa;asylum seeker;information access;invaluable legal advice;legal clinics;legal information dissemination;migrants;mobile information system design;nonprofit organisations;refugees;resources deployment","","","","","","","11-13 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
