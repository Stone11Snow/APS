"IPSILON: Incremental Parsing for Semantic Indexing of Latent Concepts","S. H. Bae; B. H. Juang","Center for Signal and Image Processing, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","20100614","2010","19","7","1933","1947","A new framework for content-based image retrieval, which takes advantage of the source characterization property of a universal source coding scheme, is investigated. Based upon a new class of multidimensional incremental parsing algorithm, extended from the Lempel-Ziv incremental parsing code, the proposed method captures the occurrence pattern of visual elements from a given image. A linguistic processing technique, namely the latent semantic analysis (LSA) method, is then employed to identify associative ensembles of visual elements, which lay the foundation for intelligent visual information analysis. In 2-D applications, incremental parsing decomposes an image into elementary patches that are different from the conventional fixed square-block type patches. When used in compressive representations, it is amenable in schemes that do not rely on average distortion criteria, a methodology that is a departure from the conventional vector quantization. We call this methodology a parsed representation. In this article, we present our implementations of an image retrieval system, called IPSILON, with parsed representations induced by different perceptual distortion thresholds. We evaluate the effectiveness of the use of the parsed representations by comparing their performance with that of four image retrieval systems, one using the conventional vector quantization for visual information analysis under the same LSA paradigm, another using a method called SIMPLIcity which is based upon an image segmentation and integrated region matching, and the other two based upon query-by-semantic-example and query-by-visual-example. The first two of them were tested with 20 000 images of natural scenes, and the others were tested with a portion of the images. The experimental results show that the proposed parsed representation efficiently captures the salient features in visual images and the IPSILON systems outperform other systems in terms of retrieval precision and distortion - obustness.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2010.2045019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5427117","Feature extraction;Lempel–Ziv;image retrieval;incremental parsing;latent semantic analysis;vector quantization","Content based retrieval;Image coding;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Source coding;Testing;Vector quantization","image matching;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;indexing;source coding;vector quantisation","IPSILON;LSA paradigm;Lempel-Ziv incremental parsing code;content-based image retrieval;image distortion robustness;image matching;image segmentation;intelligent visual information analysis;latent semantic analysis;linguistic processing technique;multidimensional incremental parsing algorithm;query-by-semantic-example;query-by-visual-example;semantic indexing parsing;source characterization property;universal source coding scheme;vector quantization","","5","","65","","20100308","July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, the more comprehensible these relations are observed, the more relevance can be expected for the retrieved web pages. Taking this point into account, in this paper, a framework is represented for query expansion based on viewpoint- oriented manipulation of the related query terms. Comparison between the relevant retrieved documents, on proposed queries with Google results, illustrate how more relevant results are obtained in the situations where the very viewpoints type relations existing between the query terms are clearly detectable and in the meantime no semantic relation may at the first look exists between the query terms.

A top-k query retrieves the k data objects with the highest scores evaluated by a scoring function on interested features of sensor readings. Our study shows that existing techniques for processing top-k query, e.g., Tiny AGgregation Service (TAG), are not energy efficient due to deficiencies in their routing structures and data aggregation mechanisms. To address these deficiencies, we propose to develop a new cross pruning (XP) aggregation framework for top-k data collection in wireless sensor networks. The XP framework incorporates several novel ideas to facilitate efficient in-network aggregation and filtering, including 1) building a cluster-tree routing structure to aggregate more objects locally; 2) adopting a broadcast-then-filter approach for efficiently suppressing redundant data transmissions; and 3) providing a cross pruning technique to enhance in-network filtering effectiveness.

There are various descriptions, structures and behaviors on the solution for a design problem in a design pattern. However, there is not much visual aid on the internal workings of a design pattern in a visual design modeling tool. Currently, it is difficult to determine the pattern role and the variant of interaction groups of a design pattern in an UML diagram as the design pattern information is not represented in the interaction diagram. There is a need to have a consistent way to define the pattern role participating in a design pattern interaction and whether there is a variant in each interaction group. This paper proposes to extend the UML sequence diagram via UML profile to allow designers to define and visualize the pattern roles and the different types of interaction groups for a design pattern. An example of the approach is then applied to the observer design pattern.

The latter is a cheat sensitive quantum protocol to perform a private search on a classical database. It allows a user to retrieve an item from the database without revealing which item was retrieved, and at the same time it ensures data privacy of the database (the information that the user retrieves in a query is bounded). The security analysis is based on information-disturbance tradeoffs which show that whenever the provider tries to obtain information on the query, the query (encoded into a quantum system) is disturbed so that the person querying the database can detect the privacy violation. The security bounds are derived under the assumption that a unique answer corresponds to each query. To remove this assumption, some simple variants of the protocol are illustrated, and it is conjectured that analogous security bounds apply to them.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2010.2048446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5484976","Privacy;quantum algorithm;quantum communication;quantum information theory;security","Communication system security;Data privacy;Data security;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information theory;Mechanical engineering;Protocols;Quantum mechanics","protocols;query processing;telecommunication security","cheat sensitive quantum protocol;quantum communication;quantum information theory;quantum private queries;security analysis","","31","","28","","","July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

XML query languages such as XQuery, XPath and NEXI, they use label paths to traverse the irregularly structured data. Without efficient indexes, query processing can be quite inefficient due to an exhaustive traversal on XML data. To overcome the inefficiency, we propose a novel index method, quick terse path index (named QTPI), which contain the content and structure of the XML documents. Unlike index methods that disassemble a query into multiple sub-queries, and then join the results of these sub-queries to provide the final answers, QTPI uses tree structures as the basic unit of query to avoid expensive join operations. Furthermore, QTPI provides a terse index that can quickly derive the keyword query and generate a set of effective structured queries by analyzing the given keyword query and scanning the index, hence it has a performance advantage over methods indexing either. We have conducted an experimental study on real-life XML data sets and the experimental results show that QTPI is effective, and efficient in supporting structural queries when compared with existing proposals.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6349-7; POD:978-1-4244-6347-3","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5486251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5486251","Keyword Search;Path Index;Structured Query;XML","Computer science;Database languages;Electronic mail;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Query processing;Web sites;XML","Internet;XML;document handling;indexing;query languages;query processing;tree data structures","NEXI;QTPI;Web emergence;XML data;XML document;XML keyword search;XML query language;XPath;XQuery;index method;index scanning;novel index method;query processing;quick terse path index;real life XML data set;structured data;tree structure","","0","","14","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SMAP radar backscatter coefficients are simulated using radar scattering models and land surface hydrology model output generated over the contiguous United States (CONUS). A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to assess the error budget of the soil moisture retrievals in the presence of radar measurement error and error in surface roughness. The estimated soil moisture retrieval accuracy is better than 0.06 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> for vegetation water content less than 1.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and soil moisture in the range of 0 to 0.3 cm<sup>3</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup>. The retrieval performance improves if radar speckle is reduced by additional observations (e.g., including both fore- and aft-scan data). It is currently assumed that the surface roughness is known with 10% error, but a time-series method is under development to estimate the roughness. The surface freeze/thaw state retrieval is simulated using a surface hydrology process model forced with climatology.

This histogram is attached with query messages and replies so that other mobile nodes can estimate the score distribution and k-th score more accurately. When transmitting a reply, each mobile node sends back only data items whose scores that are larger than the estimated k-th score to reduce traffic as much as possible.

Hence, linear HDC can be thought of as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The synthesis problem for this LTI system is to design its parameters such that the system converges to a desired pre-specified state. We cast this synthesis problem as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOP) to which we apply Pareto-optimality. We show that the optimal solution of the synthesis problem is a Pareto-optimal (P.O.) solution of the MOP.

Since the network consists of low-cost nodes with limited battery power, it is a challenging task to design an efficient routing scheme that can collect massive data and offer good performance in energy efficiency, and long network lifetimes. Grid structure was proposed for energy efficient data routing. Instead of propagating query messages from sink to all sensors to set up data forwarding information, the grid structure uses only sensors located at the grid points needed to acquire the forwarding information. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient routing technique, called Steiner Points Grid Routing (SPGR) protocol, to improve the performance of previous grid routing protocols.

Previous researches either have poor response speed, or generate too much network overhead. In order to reduce the traffic load and improve the availability of the sharing resources in unstructured P2P networks, a key-peers based topology control mechanism is presented in this paper. Due to inherent heterogeneity of peers in P2P network, a few peers (called key-peers) directly affect the connectivity of P2P overlay topology. Therefore, it is particularly important to explore these peers. Here, we regard P2P overlay topology as an undirected graph, and analyze the similarities and differences between cut-nodes in graph theory and key-peers in P2P networks. Then we use the related principles about cut-nodes and the reachability relationship of nodes to detect the key-peers of P2P network. Furthermore, we adjust P2P overlay topology based on these key-peers. Finally, experimental results show that compared to the original P2P overlay topology, the modified topology using our approach can perform much better in success rate and respond speed, especially for rare resources.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5824-0; POD:978-1-4244-5821-9","10.1109/ICFCC.2010.5497700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5497700","connectivity;key-peer;peer-to-peer (P2P) network;reachability relationship;topology control","Availability;Communication system traffic control;Computer networks;Delay;Electronic mail;Graph theory;Information retrieval;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Telecommunication traffic","directed graphs;peer-to-peer computing;reachability analysis;telecommunication control;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic","P2P overlay topology;graph theory;inherent heterogeneity;key-peers based topology control mechanism;network overhead;reachability relationship;resource retrieval;traffic load;undirected graph;unstructured P2P networks;unstructured peer-to-peer network","","0","","18","","","21-24 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our research we address the first approach, we explore topics of image matching (image alignment), however in terms of image fragments. The goal of image fragment matching is to find similar parts of two images, without a given model of particular objects present on images. It is also assumed that the number of similar objects (image fragments) is not known. In this paper we present a novel method for image fragment matching. It uses two ellipse pairs as an elementary object for image geometry reconstruction. The method is an extension of the previously proposed approach based on triangles. We have decided to replace triangles with a different geometrical structure to reduce computational complexity from O(n<sup>3</sup>) to O(n<sup>2</sup>), where n is the number of coherent key regions.

The challenge is to update the operators during the runtime with the preservation of their states. We developed a data stream processing solution which is capable of adapting the logic on-the-fly. States are copied while migrating from the original to new logic. For implementation, we utilized the dynamic component system OSGi.

Dedicated design for security techniques have been proposed so far, ranging from the development of specific cell libraries to the implementation of extra functions for preventing the leakage of useful information for key identification. On the other hand, users can expect high quality product for secure applications and this expectation requires the development of test solutions for every component of the secure device. However, testing those devices faces a double dilemma: (i) how to test and, possibly, develop design-for-testability schemes providing high testability (high controllability/observability) while maintaining high security (no leakage), (ii) how to provide high security using dedicated design rules while maintaining high testability.

The IEEE 802.11e introduced an architecture named as Scheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (S-APSD) aiming at delivering buffered traffic to PS stations while meeting QoS requirement. In S-APSD, the access point (AP) of wireless LAN schedules the service periods (SP) of stations periodically. It is clear that the overlapping of SPs should be avoided to increase the power saving performance. An algorithm named Overlapping-Aware S-APSD (OAS-APSD) was proposed to find the service start time (SST) for a new traffic stream to minimize the chance of SP overlapping. However, it takes high on-line computational complexity and thus could be infeasible for real system. Reserving the optimality of finding the suitable SST, this paper presents an efficient scheduling algorithm to utilize the periodic nature of the service schedules. Therefore, with much less complexity, the AP can respond to the joining of new traffic streams in a much feasible fashion when implementing the S-APSD.","1550-2252;15502252","Electronic:978-1-4244-2519-8; POD:978-1-4244-2518-1","10.1109/VETECS.2010.5493773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5493773","","Batteries;Computational complexity;Computer buffers;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Power engineering and energy;Processor scheduling;Quality of service;Scheduling algorithm;Wireless LAN","","","","4","2","8","","","16-19 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a general solution which addresses the main design problems of caching policies for RM in Ad Hoc networks.

In this system, documents are clustered by using fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm. FCM clustering is one of well-know unsupervised clustering techniques. However FCM algorithm requires the user to pre-define the number of clusters and different values of clusters corresponds to different fuzzy partitions.

Such environments with permanent churning of peers require self-organizing mechanisms that should deal with sudden peer failures, arrivals of new peers, and continual changes of data or network topology. In this paper, we build a self-organizing search system that operates in an unstructured P2P network and allows users to search for multimedia data by their content. In order to efficiently route queries to relevant peers, we define and evaluate several techniques for joining new peers to the existing network. These techniques create new relationships between peers - on the basis of answers returned to queries - so that a new peer will be able to efficiently forward queries and other peers will be immediately informed about its data. In addition, we demonstrate resilience of the system to sudden peer failures by studying system performance and quality of returned answers after a large number of peers is disconnected. The experiments, evaluated on a synthetic and real-life multimedia dataset, confirm that the proposed techniques are suitable for dynamic environments.","2159-7006;21597006","Electronic:978-1-4244-6950-5; POD:978-1-4244-6948-2","10.1109/FUTURETECH.2010.5482652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482652","","Content based retrieval;Costs;Informatics;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Network topology;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Routing;Search engines","content-based retrieval;multimedia databases;peer-to-peer computing;query processing","content-based retrieval;multimedia retrieval;peer-to-peer network;self-organizing mechanisms;self-organizing search system;unstructured P2P networks","","0","","16","","","21-23 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advent of computers improved the range of applicability or the steganography. Nowadays both the secret and the carrier may vary from pictures to music. By means of complex computation it is also possible to embed, or to detect, large secrets into huge carriers.

An image-based retrieval method is used to identify the best candidate images in the database by matching image's perspective structure. The initial estimation of input image's vanishing point is calculated from the pre-labeled vanishing points of the best candidates. Probabilistic refinement (PR) is then used to optimize the vanishing point estimate.
