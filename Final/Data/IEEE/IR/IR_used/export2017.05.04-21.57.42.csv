An area that is often overlooked is the importance of knowledge held by individuals associated with the organisation. This is also true in an educational setting, where learners can often contribute real-world and personal experiences. The difficulty of capturing this knowledge provides many challenges, in both business and educational settings. In order to be of any use, this knowledge has to be captured at its source and easily disseminated among those who will be interested or affected by this knowledge. The World Wide Web may be a potential technology platform. The research in progress looks at whether this data/information can be effectively and efficiently captured, managed and retrieved, in an educational context. It will further look at whether generalisations can be made across different domains, including business and government.","","POD:0-7695-1509-6","10.1109/CIE.2002.1186308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1186308","","Business;Collaboration;Databases;Government;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Prototypes;Space exploration;Space technology;Web sites","computer aided instruction;database management systems;information resources;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition","World Wide Web;collaborative shared resources;database;financial data capture;information capture;information management;information retrieval;knowledge capture;personal experiences;real-world experiences;technology platform","","2","","2","","","3-6 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm takes as its input a 2D field of surface normal estimates, delivered, for instance, by a shape-from-shading or shape-from-texture procedure. The method borrows ideas from routing theory. We exploit the well-known fact that the leading eigenvector of a Markov chain transition probability matrix is the steady-state random walk on the equivalent weighted graph. We use this property to find the minimum total curvature path through the available surface normals. To do this, we construct a transition probability matrix whose elements are related to the differences in surface normal direction. By threading the surface normals together along the path specified by the magnitude order of the components of the leading eigenvector, we perform surface integration. The height increments along the path are simply related to the traversed path length and the slope of the local tangent plane. The method is evaluated on data delivered by a shape-from-shading algorithm.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.990467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990467","","Computer science;Constraint theory;Graph theory;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Integral equations;Routing;Shape;Surface reconstruction;Surface structures","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;graph theory;image reconstruction;image representation;matrix algebra;minimisation","2D field;3D surface integration;Markov chain transition probability matrix;available surface normals;eigenvector;equivalent weighted graph;graph-spectral method;height increments;local tangent plane;magnitude order;minimum total curvature path;needle-maps;routing theory;shape-from-shading algorithm;shape-from-shading procedure;shape-from-texture procedure;steady-state random walk;surface height recovery;surface integration;surface normal direction;surface normal estimates;transition probability matrix;traversed path length","","2","","17","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a model-driven method that distinguishes four steps: data retrieval, application model generation, application model instance generation, and presentation data generation. Data retrieval populates the conceptual model with data. In the application model generation the navigational aspects of the application are specified in the application model. Also, the application model needs to be adapted for different user/channel profiles. In the third step of the Hera method, the application model is populated with the retrieved data. The last step considers the physical aspects of the presentation: the retrieved data wrapped in application logic is translated to different implementation platforms (e.g. HTML, WML, SMIL). Having in mind the advantage of Web application interoperability we chose to implement an experimental prototype for the Hera method using RDF(S), the foundation of the semantic Web.","","POD:0-7695-1916-4","10.1109/ITCC.2003.1197564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197564","","Communication cables;Copper;Design methodology;Information resources;Information retrieval;Information systems;Navigation;Object oriented modeling;Optical fiber cables;Resource description framework","XML;information retrieval;information systems;semantic Web","HTML;Hera;RDF(S);RDF/XML-based automatic generation;SMIL;WML;Web information systems;adaptable hypermedia presentations;application interoperability;application model generation;application model instance generation;data retrieval;presentation data generation;semantic Web;user/channel profiles","","1","","16","","","28-30 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study used a 3T fMRI system with BOLD contrast sequences to explore the brain activation differences between the abacus-based experts and the normal subjects through three designed problem paradigms: the covert reading, one-digit and two-digit contiguous additions. All the acquired data were analyzed by using SPM99 software and a MNI template. From the study results, several basic and complex cognitive processes observed in the two groups were fairly consistent, because they all required numerical numbers to be held and manipulated through visual imagery procedures while applying their individual resolution algorithm. However, in the abacus experts, one unique area was observed at nucleus (putamen) area, suggesting control of voluntary movement in cognitive process was involved in mental computation. And also, after a long time training and practice, the experts might modify (or buildup) their cognitive processes involving in computations through a more effective calculation network. They tended to use simple memory retrieval procedure to deal with certain parts of complex processes in mental computations, by performing all the computation steps through finger-manipulating the abacus beads (in control of voluntary movement) from a virtual abacus (a traditional Chinese calculator).","","POD:0-7803-7579-3","10.1109/CNE.2003.1196886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196886","","Biomedical imaging;Computer networks;Data analysis;Encoding;Hospitals;Image resolution;Information retrieval;System testing","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;neurophysiology","3 T;3T fMRI system;BOLD contrast sequences;MNI template;SPM99 software;abacus beads;abacus experts;abacus-based mental calculation;brain activation;cognitive process;cognitive processes;complex cognitive skill;computation processing;computation-based problems;covert reading;dedicated resolution algorithm;fMRI;finger-manipulating;memory retrieval procedure;mental computation;mental computations;neural bases;normal subjects;nucleus area;one-digit contiguous additions;putamen;short-term representational medium;traditional Chinese calculator;two-digit contiguous additions;virtual abacus;visual imagery procedures;voluntary movement","","0","","3","","","20-22 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The amount of solder paste that is deposited significantly affects both process yields and product reliability. In order to monitor the solder deposition process, surface mount printed circuit board assembly incorporates vision systems with 3D paste inspection capability. But the possibility of capturing both data and the resulting knowledge that represents fluctuations in production mix and volume (to ensure effective continuous real-time monitoring) becomes infeasible because (i) inspection data is not archived and (ii) the inspection tools are not combined with active statistical process control. Having an information systems solution to access and retrieve the historical data from the inspection stations and perform statistical analysis on the available data set would aid continuous monitoring/improvement of the process. This paper provides an insight into the importance of historical data and a software model ('Cyberstat Advisor') that facilitates statistical process control (SPC) and data analysis in the solder deposition process. In order to assist process improvement, data generated by the solder deposition inspection machine was converted and mapped into a relational database format. The 'Cyberstat Advisor' retrieves and utilizes the information from this database. This tool uses heuristics to search and sift through the extensive database. Based on historical data, the 'CyberStat Advisor' can (i) calculate the control limits for a site in the Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) that had been inspected and (ii) compute the process capability of the solder paste printer with respect to a particular site. This module can also plot run charts, range charts, and bar charts for any site. These visual representations help to better understand the process, facilitating in process improvement.","","POD:0-7803-7435-5","10.1109/EPTC.2002.1185670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185670","","Assembly systems;Continuous production;Fluctuations;Information retrieval;Inspection;Machine vision;Monitoring;Printed circuits;Process control;Relational databases","heuristic programming;inspection;printed circuit manufacture;process monitoring;reflow soldering;relational databases;statistical analysis;statistical process control;surface mount technology","3D paste inspection;Cyberstat Advisor;PCB assembly line;PCB site control limits;SMT;SPC;bar charts;continuous real-time monitoring;heuristic search;historical data analysis;information systems;process improvement;process yield;process-related defects;product reliability;range charts;relational database;run charts;solder paste deposition;solder paste printer;statistical analysis;statistical process control;visual inspection systems;yield enhancement","","2","1","8","","","10-12 Dec. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most previous analysis attempts have made certain simplifying assumptions about the data sets and/or queries to keep the analysis tractable. As a result, they may not be universally applicable. This paper proposes a set of five analysis techniques to estimate the selectivity and number of index nodes accessed in serving a range query. The underlying philosophy behind these techniques is to maintain an auxiliary data structure, called a density file, whose creation is a one-time cost, which can be quickly consulted when the query is given. The schemes differ in what information is kept in the density file, how it is maintained, and how this information is looked up. It is shown that one of the proposed schemes, called cumulative density (CD), gives very accurate results (usually less than 5 percent error) using a diverse suite of point and rectangular data sets, that are uniform or skewed, and a wide range of query window parameters. The estimation takes a constant amount of time, which is typically lower than 1 percent of the time that it would take to execute the query, regardless of data set or query window parameters.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1185836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185836","","Application software;Costs;Data structures;Image databases;Information retrieval;Information systems;Multidimensional systems;Parameter estimation;Performance analysis;Spatial databases","query processing;visual databases","auxiliary data structure;cumulative density;density file;index nodes;multidimensional data;point data sets;query window parameters;range query;range query analysis;rectangular data sets;selectivity;spatial data","","3","2","35","","","March-April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It realizes location-and-direction-based interaction; a user can get appropriate information for his/her position and direction. The most significant feature of the CardBIT is its high portability because it is easily implanted into widely-used IC cards. Based on information accumulated in the CardBIT, personalized information in the form of sound, such as speech or music, is provided.

Observations from the combined suite of AIRS, AMSU, and HSB are processed into retrievals of atmospheric parameters such as temperature, water vapor, and trace gases under all but the cloudiest conditions. A more limited retrieval set based on the microwave radiances is obtained under heavy cloud cover. Before measurements and retrievals from AIRS/AMSU/HSB instruments can be fully utilized they must be compared with the best possible in situ and other ancillary ""truth"" observations. Validation is the process of estimating the measurement and retrieval uncertainties through comparison with a set of correlative data of known uncertainties. The ultimate goal of the validation effort is retrieved product uncertainties constrained to those of radiosondes: tropospheric rms uncertainties of 1.0 degC over a 1-km layer for temperature, and 10% over 2-km layers for water vapor. This paper describes the data sources and approaches to be used for validation of the AIRS/AMSU/HSB instrument suite, including validation of the forward models necessary for calculating observed radiances, validation of the observed radiances themselves, and validation of products retrieved from the observed radiances. Constraint of the AIRS product uncertainties to within the claimed specification of 1 K/1 km over well-instrumented regions is feasible within 12 months of launch, but global validation of all AIRS/AMSU/HSB products may require considerably more time due to the novelty and complexity of this dataset and the sparsity of some types of correlative observations.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.808293","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196058","","Acoustic noise;Clouds;Extraterrestrial measurements;Gases;Humidity;Information retrieval;Instruments;Microwave radiometry;Planets;Temperature","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric measuring apparatus;atmospheric temperature;remote sensing","AIRS/AMSU/HSB validation;Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit;Aqua satellite;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder;Humidity Sounder for Brazil;atmospheric parameter retrievals;atmospheric temperature;cloud cover;data sources;infrared radiances;microwave radiances;trace gases;water vapor","","65","","55","","","Feb. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specially tailored radiance and retrieval products derived from AIRS/AMSU/HSB data are being prepared for NWP centers. There are two types of products - thinned radiance data and full-resolution retrieval products of atmospheric and surface parameters. The radiances are thinned because of limitations in communication bandwidth and computational resources at NWP centers. There are two types of thinning: (1) spatial and spectral thinning and (2) data compression using principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is also used for quality control and for deriving the retrieval first guess used in the AIRS processing software. Results show that PCA is effective in estimating and filtering instrument noise. The PCA regression retrievals show layer mean temperature (1 km in troposphere, 3 km in stratosphere) accuracies of better than 1 K in most atmospheric regions from simulated AIRS data. Moisture errors are generally less than 15% in 2-km layers, and ozone errors are near 10% over approximately 5-km layers from simulation. The PCA and regression methodologies are described. The radiance products also include clear field-of-view (FOV) indicators.

However, most prior studies on broadcasting dependent data are restricted to a single broadcast channel environment which imposes an impractical limitation. In view of this, we explore in this paper the problem of broadcasting dependent date in multiple broadcast channels. By analyzing the model of dependent data broadcasting, we derive several theoretical properties for the average access time in a multiple channel environment. In light of the theoretical results, we develop a genetic algorithm to generate broadcast programs. Our experimental results show that the theoretical results derived are able to guide the search of the genetic algorithm very effectively, thus leading to solution broadcast programs of very high quality.","","POD:0-7803-7632-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1188222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188222","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Genetic algorithms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information systems;Mobile computing;Scalability;System performance","broadcast channels;data communication;genetic algorithms;land mobile radio;mobile computing","average access time;bandwidth utilization;broadcast channel;broadcast programs;broadcast-based information system;dependent data broadcasting;genetic algorithm;mobile computing;multiple channel environment;multiple channel mobile environment;power consumption;unordered queries","","2","","17","","","17-21 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In specific, this research focuses on the requirement to steer an autonomous car along a curvy and hilly road course with no intersections and no other vehicle or obstacle but with the strict requirement to self-improve driving behaviour. A camera is used to build quickly an abstract complete description (ACSD) of vehicle's current situation. This combines traditional edge finding operators with a new technique of Bayes prediction for each part of the video image. Those ACSD's are being stored together with the steering commands issued at that time and serve as the pattern database of possible driving behaviour which are being retrieved using an approximate nearest neighbour pattern matching algorithm with a O(n log m) characteristic compared to O(n·m) for the conventional nearest neighbour calculation. In addition to this, any feedback on the quality or appropriateness of the driving behaviour has to be self-created (e.g. time measurement for a whole road section) and is therefore delayed and unspecific in relation to single issued steering commands. Consequently, a machine learning algorithm coping with those conditions is being implemented based on Reinforcement Learning.","","POD:0-7803-7346-4","10.1109/IVS.2002.1187941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187941","","Cameras;Feedback;Image databases;Information retrieval;Learning;Mobile robots;Pattern matching;Remotely operated vehicles;Road vehicles;Vehicle driving","Bayes methods;computational complexity;edge detection;feedback;image matching;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;road vehicles","ACSD;Bayes prediction;abstract complete situation description;approximate nearest neighbour pattern matching algorithm;autonomous vehicle driving;camera;curvy road course;driver assistance systems;edge finding operators;hilly road course;pattern database;pattern matching;reinforcement learning;self-improvement","","1","","13","","","17-21 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since most of the documents available on the web are machine-readable but not machine-understandable, ensuring the retrieval of relevant information continues to be a difficult task. In the traditional text representation approach, high frequency keywords are used as term representatives of text. However, the main drawbacks in this approach are lack of direct relationship between word frequency and its importance, and the effect of the word ambiguities. Considering these shortcomings of the keyword-based method, this paper presents a phrase-based text representation approach that uses rule-based natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Extraction of key-phrases from text documents is based on a process of partial parsing. By making the indexing terms more meaningful through reduction of the ambiguity in words considered in isolation, improvement in retrieval effectiveness is sought to be achieved.","","POD:0-7695-1916-4","10.1109/ITCC.2003.1197520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1197520","","Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Libraries;Resource description framework;Semantic Web;Technology management;Web sites;XML","grammars;indexing;information retrieval;natural languages;text analysis","Web document management;World Wide Web;indexing terms;key phrase extraction;keyword-based method;partial parsing;phrase-based text representation;rule-based natural language processing techniques;text documents;word ambiguities;word frequency","","6","5","7","","","28-30 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work generalizes the work of Wong et al. in the following two aspects: various updating functions may be used in our algorithm; and multiplicative updating for a weight is dependent on the value of the corresponding index term, which is more realistic and applicable to real-valued vector space. The algorithm MG boosts the usefulness of an index term exponentially, while the algorithm of Wong et al. does so linearly.

Unfortunately, even with the aid of the commonly used indexing schemes, the performance of nearest-neighbor (NN) queries deteriorates rapidly with the number of dimensions. We propose a method, called Clustering with Singular Value Decomposition (CSVD), which supports efficient approximate processing of NN queries, while maintaining good precision-recall characteristics. CSVD groups homogeneous points into clusters and separately reduces the dimensionality of each cluster using SVD. Cluster selection for NN queries relies on a branch-and-bound algorithm and within-cluster searches can be performed with traditional or in-memory indexing methods. Experiments with texture vectors extracted from satellite images show that CSVD achieves significantly higher dimensionality reduction than plain SVD for the same normalized mean squared error (NMSE), which translates into a higher efficiency in processing approximate NN queries.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1198398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198398","","Clustering algorithms;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Satellites;Singular value decomposition","data mining;database indexing;mean square error methods;multimedia databases;pattern clustering;query processing;singular value decomposition;tree searching","CSVD;approximate similarity search;branch-and-bound algorithm;clustering;content-based retrieval;data mining;experiments;high-dimensional spaces;indexing;multimedia databases;nearest-neighbor classification;nearest-neighbor search;normalized mean squared error;query processing;satellite images;singular value decomposition","","31","","29","","","May-June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They will help identify the meteorological state of the atmosphere and any AIRS soundings potentially contaminated by precipitation. These retrieval methods can also be applied to the AMSU 23-191-GHz data from operational weather satellites such as NOAA-15, -16, and -17. The global extension and calibration of these methods are subjects for future research. The precipitation-rate estimation method presented is based on the opaque-channel approach described by Staelin and Chen (2000), but it utilizes more channels (17) and training data and infers 54-GHz band radiance perturbations at 15-km resolution. The dynamic range now reaches 100 mm/h. The method utilizes neural networks trained using the National Weather Service's Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) precipitation estimates for 38 coincident rainy orbits of NOAA-15 AMSU data obtained over the eastern United States and coastal waters during a full year. The rms discrepancies between AMSU and NEXRAD were evaluated for the following NEXRAD rain-rate categories: <0.5, 0.5-1, 1-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16, 16-32, and >32 mm/h. The rms discrepancies for the 3790 15-km pixels not used to train the estimator were 1.0, 2.0, 2.3, 2.7, 3.5, 6.9, 19.0, and 42.9 mm/h, respectively.

"An operational forecast modeling system for the Mississippi Sound/Bight","A. F. Blumberg; Quamrul Ahsan; Honghai Li; J.

The system integrates a triple nested coastal ocean forecast modeling systems and a meteorological forecast model. The Mississippi Sound/Bight model based on ECOMSED, forms the central core of the operational forecast system. At its eastern and southern boundaries, the ECOMSED is coupled to a regional Gulf of Mexico (GOM) model in a manner that ensures seamless energy transfer between the two models. Meteorological forcing is provided by the Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System, COAMPS. The forecast system automatically retrieves all available real-time river discharge data along the Gulf coast to be imposed as coastal boundary conditions. The operational MS Sound/Bight forecast model produces two 12-hour hindcast and two 48-hour forecasts everyday at 0000 and 1200 hours. The system is scheduled to run for 12 hours in a hindcast mode and then 48 hours in a forecast mode. However, these simulation periods can vary. Depending on the availability and lengths of inputs from the coupled GOM and COAMPS models, the operational system automatically sets the periods for hindcast and forecast simulations. The model saves the proper hydrodynamic information for a restart so that a smooth and seamless execution is possible to start the next cycle. All of the simulations of the model are performed and archived on the Major Shared Resource Center (MSRC) high-performance computers resident at NAVOCEANO, Stennis Space Center, MS. The archived model output includes hourly three-dimensional fields of salinity, temperature and currents and water level across the model domain. Quality control is performed before the results go to a post-processing phase. A post-processing routine, which runs autonomously, generates surface current, temperature and salinity distributions after the completion of each cycle of forecast. The model results are available on the NGLI website (www.navo.navy.mil/NGLI) for public use.","","POD:0-7803-7534-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1192074","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192074","","Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Energy exchange;Information retrieval;Meteorology;Ocean temperature;Predictive models;Real time systems;Sea measurements;Weather forecasting","atmospheric techniques;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;tides;weather forecasting","12 hours;48 hours;COAMPS;COAMPS model;Coupled Ocean/Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System;ECOMSED;GOM model;Gulf coast;Gulf of Mexico;MSRC;Major Shared Resource Center;Mississippi Sound/Bight model;NAVOCEANO;Stennis Space Center;coastal boundary condition;coastal ocean forecast modeling system;energy transfer;forecast mode;hindcast mode;meteorological forcing;meteorological forecast model;ocean water level;operational forecast system;post-processing phase;post-processing routine;river discharge data;surafce salinity distribution;surface current distribution;surface temperature distribution","","0","","9","","","29-31 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such applications, two or more handheld devices, physically close to each other, can communicate and exchange data in a secure way. Proximity applications rely on the use of both different mobile devices and heterogeneous wireless networks. Thus, these applications need a high degree of flexibility, for an easy and rapid application development. In this context, our purpose is to study the interest of the Hybrid Peer-To-Peer (P2P) architecture model use specially for the extensibility, the fault-tolerance management and the scalability of proximity applications.

Digital watermarking, which is an information hiding technique where the embedded information is robust against malicious or accidental attacks, might offer new possibilities to enforce the copyrights of multimedia data. In this paper, the specific case of information embedding into independent identically distributed (IID) data and attacks by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is considered. The original data is not available to the decoder. For Gaussian data, in 1983, Costa proposed a scheme that theoretically achieves the capacity of this communication scenario. However, Costa's scheme is not practical. Thus, several research groups have proposed suboptimal practical communication schemes based on Costa's idea. The goal of this paper is to give a complete performance analysis of the scalar Costa scheme (SCS), which is a suboptimal technique using scalar embedding and reception functions. Information theoretic bounds and simulation results with state-of-the-art coding techniques are compared. Further, reception after amplitude scaling attacks and the invertibility of SCS embedding are investigated.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2003.809366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1188745","","AWGN;Additive white noise;Data security;Decoding;Information retrieval;Information security;Noise robustness;Performance analysis;Watermarking","AWGN;channel coding;data encapsulation;decoding;encoding;information theory;multimedia communication;security of data;watermarking","AWGN;Gaussian data;accidental attacks;additive white Gaussian noise;amplitude scaling attacks;channel coding;coding;copyright;decoder;digital watermarking;i.i.d. attacks;i.i.d. data;independent identically distributed data;information embedding;information hiding techniques;information theoretic bounds;malicious attacks;multimedia data;multimedia security;performance analysis;reception functions;scalar Costa scheme;scalar embedding;simulation results;suboptimal practical communication schemes","","201","6","38","","","Apr 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sponsored by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR, PMW-155), PUMA-TEDS represents a significant advancement in the collection and assimilation of environmental data at global, regional or local levels. Although VGRID has been developed for PUMA bathymetry, its generic implementation makes it suitable for use with any type of environmental data grid through the definition of a product specification. Built on NCSA's Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5), the VGRID model inherits the HDF5 file format and library implementation that is optimized for large-scale scientific data storage. The VGRID model provides a hierarchy of environmental storage objects: files, constituents, and grids. A VGRID file can contain VGRID constituents enabling multiparameter data storage. VGRID constituents can contain VGRID grids that are identified by resolutions and have grid increments specified in arc minutes, metres, or polar stereographic grid units. The grid interface supports the storage of geographic, polar stereographic, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), and Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) projected grids. Behind the scenes of the VGRID API, a tile scheme is applied to data written to the VGRID file. When VGRID grids are created, compression options can be set for all tiles created in the resolution. The VGRID tile scheme provides the framework for a robust tile caching mechanism, which minimizes the time required to read data from a VGRID file. The VGRID API uses a ""bounce"" algorithm to search each resolution and extract the highest resolution data for a point query. In addition, three interpolation options are available for point queries: nearest neighbor, bilinear and minimum curvature spline. The minimum curvature spline algorithm provides a ""feathering"" capability that effectively reduces the artifacts that often occur at the resolution boundaries of multiple resolution datasets.","","POD:0-7803-7534-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1192087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192087","","Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Layout;Libraries;Memory;Oceanographic techniques;Spline;Tiles;Turing machines;Uninterruptible power systems","bathymetry;content-based retrieval;data acquisition;geophysics computing;grid computing;information retrieval system evaluation;information storage;splines (mathematics);visual databases","DBDB-V;Digital Bathymetric Data Base-Variable;NAVOCEANO;Naval Oceanographic Office;PMW-155;PUMA System;PUMA bathymetry;PUMA-TEDS;SPAWAR;Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command;UTM;Universal Transverse Mercator;VGRID API;VGRID storage model;VGRID tile scheme;bathymetric data retrieval;bathymetric data storage;bilinear interpolation;bounce algorithm;dynamic HDF5 storage model;generic HDF5 storage model;georeferenced grid data;grid interface;hierarchical data format version 5;minimum curvature spline interpolation;nearest neighbor interpolation;precision underwater mapping;robust tile caching mechanism;tactical environmental data server;universal polar stereographic projected grids;variable resolution GRID","","1","5","11","","","29-31 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two most prominent features of zFS are its cooperative cache and distributed transactions. zFS integrates the memory of all participating machines into one coherent cache. Thus, instead of going to the disk for a block of data already in one of the machine memories, zFS retrieves the data block from the remote machine. zFS also uses distributed transactions and leases, instead of group-communication and clustering software.

M-tree is one such data structure specialized for the management of large data sets on disk. We explore the application of M-trees to the storage and retrieval of peptide sequence data. Exploiting a technique first suggested by Myers (1994), we organize the database as records of fixed length substrings. Empirical results are promising. However, metric-space indexes are subject to ""the curse of dimensionality"" and the ultimate performance of an index is sensitive to the quality of the initial construction of the index. We introduce new hierarchical bulk-load algorithm that alternates between top-down and bottom-up clustering to initialize the index.

These algorithms must offer capabilities related to browsing, indexing, and retrieval of relevant data. A crucial step in multimedia processing is that of reliable video segmentation into visually coherent video shots through scene change detection. Video segmentation enables subsequent processing operations on video shots, such as video indexing, semantic representation, or tracking of selected video information. Since video sequences generally contain both abrupt and gradual scene changes, video segmentation algorithms must be able to detect a large variety of changes. While existing algorithms perform relatively well for detecting abrupt transitions (video cuts), reliable detection of gradual changes is much more difficult. A novel one-pass, real-time approach to video scene change detection based on statistical sequential analysis and operating on a compressed multimedia bitstream is proposed. Our approach models video sequences as stochastic processes, with scene changes being reflected by changes in the characteristics (parameters) of the process. Statistical sequential analysis is used to provide an unified framework for the detection of both abrupt and gradual scene changes.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2003.808819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196740","","Availability;Change detection algorithms;Gunshot detection systems;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Sequential analysis;Stochastic processes;Video compression;Video sequences","image retrieval;image segmentation;image sequences;indexing;multimedia systems;real-time systems;statistical analysis;stochastic processes","abrupt scene changes;browsing;compressed multimedia bitstream;gradual scene changes;multimedia processing algorithms;one-pass real-time video scene change detection;reliable video segmentation;retrieval;statistical sequential analysis;stochastic processes;video indexing;video semantic representation;video sequences;video tracking;visually coherent video shots","","40","11","24","","","March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Spatial information concerning lesions in medical images is critically important in disease diagnosis and plays an important role in image retrieval. Unfortunately, images are rarely indexed properly for clinically useful retrieval. One example is the well-known R-tree and its variants which index image objects based on their physical locations in an ""absolute"" way. However, such information is not meaningful in medical content-based image retrieval systems, and the approaches suffer from problems caused by variations in object size and shape, imprecise image centering, etc. A more appropriate approach, which does not require object registration, is to model the spatial relationships between lesions and anatomical landmarks. To convey diagnostic information, lesions must exist in certain locations with regard to landmarks. In this paper, we show that the histogram of forces (which represents the relative position between two objects) provides an efficient spatial indexing mechanism in the medical domain.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-1272-0","10.1109/CVPR.2001.991018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991018","","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Diseases;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Lesions;Medical diagnostic imaging","content-based retrieval;database indexing;diseases;lung;medical image processing;visual databases","R-tree;anatomical landmarks;disease diagnosis;force histograms;image retrieval;medical content-based image retrieval systems;medical image databases;spatial lesion indexing","","2","","28","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is therefore an imperative for methods for simplifying histograms. This paper presents a new method for simplifying histograms based on a cascade of increasing-scale graph morphology filters. The system we choose preserves scale space causality and so preserves the modes of the histogram. The method is quick to compute so is therefore a practically useful feature.

Sometimes this complexity is not matched by increase in performance. Motivated by these ideas, we take a step back and look at simpler approaches to indexing multimedia data. In this paper we propose a simple, (not simplistic) yet efficient indexing structure for high-dimensional data Points of variable dimension, using dimension reduction. Our approach maps multidimensional points to a 1D line by computing their Euclidean Norm and use a B/sup +/-Tree to store data points. We exploit B/sup +/-Tree efficient sequential search to develop simple, yet performant methods to implement point, range and nearest-neighbor queries. To evaluate our technique we conducted a set of experiments, using both synthetic and real data. We analyze creation, insertion and query times as a function of data set size and dimension. Results so far show that our simple scheme outperforms current approaches, such as the Pyramid Technique, the A-Tree and the SR-Tree, for many data distributions. Moreover, our approach seems to scale better both with growing dimensionality and data set size, while exhibiting low insertion and search times.","","POD:0-7695-1895-8","10.1109/DASFAA.2003.1192391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192391","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data structures;Image databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Spatial databases;Technical drawing","content-based retrieval;database indexing;multimedia databases;tree data structures;very large databases;visual databases","A-Tree;B+ tree;Euclidean Norm;Pyramid Technique;SR-Tree;content-based retrieval;data set size;dimension reduction;experiments;high-dimensional data indexing;high-dimensional data points;large databases;multidimensional points;multimedia data;nearest-neighbor queries;performance;sequential search","","10","","15","","","26-28 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data can then be used to generate spatially-explicit assessments of commercially important species and foster the development of more sustainable fisheries. The technologies for collecting and reporting data from a study fleet is important, as is the way in which fishermen and management scientists utilize the system. A pilot groundfish study fleet has been established in the Gulf of Maine by CFER to evaluate a novel reporting system. This paper describes the electronic logbook and data reporting system developed for this multi-species application and the Web-based interface used by fishermen to enter data on their fishing operation and to retrieve GIS maps of their reported data. The issues associated with the recruiting of study fleet participants are also discussed. The protection of proprietary interests is very important to fishermen, and data management techniques are needed that will protect such interests if accurate reporting is expected. The distrust that often exists between industry and federal authorities suggests that a study fleet may not be useful unless the data are archived by an independent organization that pledges to maintain the ownership rights of each fisherman. If properly set up, the structure will encourage detailed and accurate reporting and will facilitate the generation of reports useful to the fisherman. These reports effectively compensate the fisherman for the effort required in entering the data.","","POD:0-7803-7534-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1193296","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193296","","Aquaculture;Computational Intelligence Society;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Manuals;Production;Protection;Recruitment;Technology management;Video recording","aquaculture;data acquisition;graphical user interfaces","GIS;Gulf of Maine;Web-based interface;commercially important species;data collection;data management;data reporting system;electronic logbook;fishery;groundfish study fleet;multi-species application;proprietary interests;reporting system;spatially-explicit assessments","","0","","6","","","29-31 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a straightforward approach to clustering massive amounts of data on this storage requires considerable computational and storage resources that usually exceed the capabilities of even the richest super-computing centers. This paper develops a new approach to hierarchical storage management in data grid environments, which calls for two levels of clustering data on tertiary storage. Applying a mix of static and dynamic decisions, this approach achieves the benefits of clustering at reasonable costs. However, an effective realization of the approach in generic data grid environments requires advances in the areas of indexing and clustering large scientific data collections on tertiary storage. The paper describes some novel indexing and clustering techniques that can cope well not only with extremely large volumes but also with very high dimensionalities of scientific data. The basic principles of a new clustering technique for large volumes of multi-dimensional data are introduced in the paper for the first time.","","POD:0-7695-1914-8","10.1109/MASS.2003.1194863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1194863","","Computer science;Costs;Databases;Engines;Environmental management;Indexing;Information retrieval;Linear particle accelerator;Physics;US Department of Energy","database indexing;scientific information systems;storage management;very large databases","data clustering;data grid environments;dynamic decisions;hierarchical storage management;high retrieval performance;indexing;large scientific data collections;static decisions;tertiary storage","","1","","20","","","7-10 April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The GSF data file format has the ability to store various types of data, but in this system only bathymetry, specifically, single-beam and multi-beam bathymetry, is indexed. Bathymetric data is used by NAVO to generate various oceanographic information products. Presently, to obtain bathymetric data for a particular area of interest (AOI) for product generation, NAVO personnel must determine which oceanographic surveys generated bathymetric data files in the AOI and where these files are physically located. Next, they have to download all of these files and process them. Each of these files may have large amounts of data (potentially hundreds of megabytes) that are outside of the given AOI. It is also possible that some files may not have any data in the AOI. Using the spatial indexing ability of Oracle, the NRL-developed system allows NAVO to quickly determine and retrieve only the bathymetric data that are relevant to the AOI, completely automating the process of data acquisition. This system provides benefits by substantially reducing the amount of data that must be considered when producing a product and also by providing users with an intuitive interface to use for data retrieval purposes. This paper discusses the spatial indexing scheme, spatial querying, the interface for retrieving data, and other components of the NRL system. In addition, problems that were encountered and the time savings provided by this system are discussed.","","POD:0-7803-7534-3","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1192085","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192085","","Data processing;Geodesy;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Oceanographic techniques;Oceans;Sensor systems;Spatial databases","Internet;bathymetry;content-based retrieval;data acquisition;geophysics computing;information retrieval systems","Digital Mapping Charting and Geodesy Analysis Program;GSF;NRL system;Naval Oceanographic Office;Naval Research Laboratory;Oracle;bathymetric data;data acquisition;data processing;data retrieval;generic sensor format;multibeam bathymetry;naval oceanographic office;oceanographic survey;single-beam bathymetry;spatial indexing scheme;spatial querying","","0","","3","","","29-31 Oct. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In two dimensions, we prove that whenever M is a Fibonacci number, the average performance of the scheme is within 14 percent of the (generally, unachievable) strictly optimal scheme and its worst-case response time is within a multiplicative factor three of the optimal response time for any query, and within a factor 1.5 of the optimal for large queries.

The aggregator herein exhibits flexibility in its logical behaviour through parameters that can be set by the designer as well permitting the exclusion of specific colors from queries.

We apply the Haar wavelet transform technique and propose the use of a proper normalization so that the method can guarantee no false dismissal for Euclidean distance. We found that this method has competitive performance from our experiments. Euclidean distance measurement cannot handle the time shifts of patterns. It fails to match the same rise and fall patterns of sequences with different scales. A distance measure that handles this problem is the time warping distance. However, the complexity of computing the time warping distance function is high. Also, as time warping distance is not a metric, most indexing techniques would not guarantee any false dismissal. We propose efficient strategies to mitigate the problems of time warping. We suggest a Haar wavelet-based approximation function for time warping distance, called Low Resolution Time Warping, which results in less computation by trading off a small amount of accuracy. We apply our approximation function to similarity search in time series databases, and show by experiment that it is highly effective in suppressing the number of false alarms in similarity search.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1198399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1198399","","Biomedical measurements;Data mining;Databases;Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Euclidean distance;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Time measurement","Haar transforms;data mining;discrete Fourier transforms;query processing;statistical databases;time series","Euclidean distance;Haar wavelets;Low Resolution Time Warping;discrete Fourier transform;experiments;indexing;normalization;time series databases;time series similarity search;time warping distance","","78","","32","","","May-June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In small packet switches, multicast traffic is typically handled by prepending a local multicast label (LML) to each cell. The LML consists of a bitmap with as many bits as switch ports. The bitmap identifies the set of ports to which copies of the cell must be transferred. The bitmap approach is no longer feasible in switches with 128 ports or more, where the LML length cannot be smaller than 16 bytes, an intolerable overhead when the internal cell payload is only 64 bytes. We devise several compression algorithms, both static and adaptive, to reduce the size of the LML's to be attached to multicast cells. The algorithms define compressed representations of the distribution sets of the multicast cells, trading the additional bandwidth needed to transfer redundant cell copies (i.e., copies directed to outputs that do not belong to the actual distribution sets) for the cell header overhead otherwise needed to deliver the cells only to the proper outputs. We use simulation experiments to compare the performance of the compression algorithms.","","POD:0-7803-7632-3","10.1109/GLOCOM.2002.1189070","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1189070","","Bandwidth;Compression algorithms;Information retrieval;Multicast algorithms;Packet switching;Payloads;Routing;Switches;Unicast","adaptive codes;data compression;multicast communication;packet switching;telecommunication network routing;transport protocols","IP routers;LML length;adaptive codes;bandwidth;bitmap;cell header overhead;compressed representations;compression algorithms;efficient multicast support;fixed-size data units;internal cell payload;local multicast label;multicast cells;multicast traffic;packet switches;structured codes;switch fabric ports","","1","","2","","","17-21 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A system called XQP (XQuery Processor) is proposed in this paper to meet the need. XQP represents XML data using the encoding of element tags (ET-encoding) and the encoding of element contents (EC-encoding). The path expression presented in the input XQuery statement could be therefore represented as a sequence of encodings, termed as the ET-encoding path. We could similarly get EC-encoding paths by applying the path expression to the XML data. XQP accepts a typical XQuery statement, which consists of the selection construct to impose constraints, and the projection construct to return the content of an arbitrary element. To process an XQuery statement, XQP will first retrieve the EC-encoding paths which satisfy the selection constraint and the projection requirement respectively, and then perform matching on them to obtain the correct data. Using encoding paths could simplify and fasten the matching process. Several experiments are conducted, and the results show the efficiency and scalability of our approach.","","POD:0-7695-1895-8","10.1109/DASFAA.2003.1192388","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1192388","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Database languages;Encoding;Information representation;Information retrieval;Oceans;Query processing;Scalability;XML","data models;hypermedia markup languages;query processing","XML query processing;XQP;XQuery statement;element contents;element tags;encoding paths;selection-projection XQuery processing","","0","","14","","","26-28 March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distance in the feature space associated with a kernel is used to rank relevant images. An adaptive quasiconformal mapping based on relevance feedback is used to generate successive new kernels. The effect of the quasiconformal mapping is a change in the spatial resolution of the feature space. The spatial resolution around irrelevant samples is dilated, whereas the spatial resolution around relevant samples is contracted. This new space created by the quasiconformal kernel is used to measure the distance between the query and the images in the database. An interesting interpretation of the metric is found by looking at the Taylor series approximation to the original kernel. Then the squared distance in the feature space can be seen as a combination of a parzen window estimate of the squared Chi-squared distance and a weighted squared Euclidean distance.

This paper proposes an interactive approach for spoken interactive ODQA systems. When the reliabilities for answer hypotheses obtained by an ODQA system are low, the system automatically derives disambiguous queries (DQ) that draw out additional information. The additional information based on the DQ should contribute to distinguishing effectively an exact answer and to supplementing a lack of information by recognition errors. In our spoken interactive ODQA system, SPIQA, spoken questions are recognized by an ASR system, and DQ are automatically generated to disambiguate the transcribed questions.

A node in a P2P network can access information present in the network using peer discovery followed by a search and retrieval phase. At present, most P2P systems employ message communication to implement the operations in a P2P network. In this paper, we propose the use of mobile software agents to implement the protocols in a P2P system. Mobile software agents are autonomous, economic in terms of size and bandwidth consumption, and can operate remotely without the continuous supervision of a central server. Our research indicates that mobile software agents provide a suitable paradigm for implementing P2P systems that is both scalable and robust.","","POD:0-7803-7523-8","10.1109/MWSCAS.2002.1187308","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1187308","","Access protocols;Collaborative work;Computer science;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Peer to peer computing;Software agents","groupware;information retrieval systems;information systems;knowledge acquisition;mobile agents;protocols","P2P network node;P2P system protocols;autonomous software entities;decentralized cooperative work;information access;information sharing;knowledge acquisition;mobile intelligent agents;mobile software agents;peer discovery;peer-to-peer systems;real-time collaboration;retrieval phase;search phase","","0","3","9","","","4-7 Aug. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, we exploit the enormous bandwidth of optical fibers for broadcast delivery, so that the system can provide many video programs and maintain a small access delay. In addition, we design and adopt an interleaved broadcast delivery scheme, so that every video stream only requires a small buffer size for temporary storage. A simple proxy is allocated to each ongoing customer, and it retrieves video from optical channels and delivers video to the customer through an information network. The proposed VOD system is suitable for large scale applications with many customers, and has several desirable features: 1) it can be scaled up to serve more concurrent customers and provide more video programs, 2) it provides interactive operations, 3) it only requires point-to-point communication between the VOD warehouse and the customer and involves no network control, 4) it has a small access delay, and 5) it requires a small buffer size for each video stream.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2003.808818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1196742","","Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Buffer storage;Delay;Information retrieval;Multimedia communication;Optical buffering;Optical fiber networks;Optical fibers;Streaming media","buffer storage;client-server systems;information networks;multimedia communication;multimedia computing;optical fibre communication;television broadcasting;video on demand","broadcast delivery paradigm;buffer size;client-server paradigm;concurrent customers;information network;interactive video-on-demand system;interleaved broadcast delivery scheme;optical channels;optical fiber bandwidth;point-to-point communication;proxy;small access delay;temporary storage;video retrieval;video stream;video-on-demand warehouse","","14","1","28","","","March 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Research to improve query response times has been largely concentrate on indexing XML documents and processing regular path expressions. Another approach is to discover frequent query patterns since the answers to these queries can be stored and indexed. Mining frequent query patterns requires more than simple tree matching since the XML queries involves special characters such as ""*"" or ""//"". In addition, the matching process can be expensive since the search space is exponential to the size of XML schema. In this paper, we present two mining algorithms, XQPMiner and XQPMinerTID, to discover frequent query pattern frees from a large collection of XML queries efficiently.

We present an approach to computing semantic similarity that relaxes the requirement of a single ontology and accounts for differences in the levels of explicitness and formalization of the different ontology specifications. A similarity function determines similar entity classes by using a matching process over synonym sets, semantic neighborhoods, and distinguishing features that are classified into parts, functions, and attributes. Experimental results with different ontologies indicate that the model gives good results when ontologies have complete and detailed representations of entity classes. While the combination of word matching and semantic neighborhood matching is adequate for detecting equivalent entity classes, feature matching allows us to discriminate among similar, but not necessarily equivalent entity classes.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2003.1185844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1185844","","Automatic logic units;Cities and towns;Computational modeling;Computer Society;Database languages;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Management information systems;Ontologies","information retrieval;knowledge engineering;knowledge management","information integration;information retrieval;ontology integration;semantic interoperability;semantic matching;similarity measures","","337","7","61","","","March-April 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
