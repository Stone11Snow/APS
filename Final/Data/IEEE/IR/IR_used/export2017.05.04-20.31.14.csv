But the spatial data are generally reorganized using index techniques like R-tree to improve the efficiency of query answering in spatial information systems, especially geographic information system (GIS), and the spatial data are approximated by their minimum bounding rectangles (MBRs), so the spatial configuration information retrieval is actually based on the MBRs and some special techniques should be studied. This paper studies the mapping relationships among the spatial relations for real spatial objects, the corresponding spatial relations for their MBRs and the corresponding spatial relations between the intermediate nodes and the MBRs in R-tree.

We refer to such queries as spatial-keyword queries or SK queries for short. In recent times, a lot of interest has been generated in efficient processing of SK queries for a variety of applications from Web-search to GIS decision support systems. We refer to systems built for enabling such applications as Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR) Systems. An example GIR system that we address in this paper is a search engine built on top of hundreds of thousands of publicly available GIS databases. Building a search engine over such large repositories is a challenge. One of the key aspects of such a search engine is the performance. In this paper, we propose a framework for GIR systems and focus on indexing strategies that can process SK queries efficiently. We show through experiments that our indexing strategies lead to significant improvement in efficiency of answering SK queries over existing techniques.","1551-6393;15516393","CD-ROM:0-7695-2868-6","10.1109/SSDBM.2007.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4274961","","Business;Geographic Information Systems;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Protection;Search engines;Shape;Spatial databases;Web pages","Internet;geographic information systems;indexing;query processing;search engines;visual databases","GIR systems;GIS databases;Web-search;geographic information retrieval systems;indexing strategies;location-based information;processing spatial-keyword queries;search engine;textual descriptions","","37","1","22","","","9-11 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose a new generic ontology mapping approach based on profile propagation and information retrieval techniques. The features used to establish the profile of a concept include all lexical information (i.e., its name, label, comments, property restriction, etc.). Profile propagation then is used to integrate structural information by adding the profiles of its ancestors, descendants and siblings to the profile of a concept, with different weights. Afterwards profiles are compared in a vector space model and the most relevant one will be returned as mapping results. A search engine is integrated as profile mapper when the size of ontologies is large.

One way to increase the communication between user and system is to take advantage of the user's action with a system, e.g. to infer the relevance or otherwise of a video shot viewed by the user. In this paper we introduce a novel video retrieval system and propose a model of implicit information for interpreting the user's actions with the interface.

Then all the component results and data fusion results can be explained using geometrical principles. In such a framework, it becomes clear why quite often data fusion can bring improvement in effectiveness and accordingly what the favourable conditions are for data fusion algorithms to achieve better results.

The algorithm is derived under the assumption that the only information on areal tree density and mean value of the forest reflection coefficient is available. Performance of the algorithm is investigated by means of Monte-Carlo simulation for different scenarios in terms of statistical distributions for the trunk volume and forest reflection coefficient.

However, there are still several critical problems with this technology. In this study, we focus on two important issues. The first issue is related to automatic gridding and spot segmentation for microarray images. It has been reported that the quality of spot segmentation significantly influences data precision in the subsequent data analysis. However, nowadays microarray image analysis software still requires users' fine tuning to obtain acceptable results. Another important issue is how to automatically collect related information regarding all genes on the microarray slide for subsequent data analysis and data mining.

The bases are obtained by the Principal Component Analysis and/or the Independent Component Analysis. On the image compression, PCA and ICA outperform the JPEG's DCT This superiority holds even if the bases and superposition coefficients are quantized and encoded. On the 12I retrieval, the precision-recall curve is used to measure the performance. It is found that adding the basis information always increases the baseline ability of the color information. Besides the retrieval evaluation, a unified image format called RIM (Retrieval-aware IMage format) for effective packing of codewords including bases is specified. Furthermore, an image search viewer called Wisvi (Waseda Image Search Viewer) is developed and exploited.

At the same time, the variety of images produced can be confusing even for trained specialists causing an information overload exists for many medical doctors. This suggests that content-based image retrieval can be a valuable tool for helping manage these data and access the right information at the right time. This article gives a short state of the art of content-based medical image retrieval followed by a description of the medGIFT project on image retrieval with its main components. Then, several challenges are used to illustrate areas where much more work is currently needed to advance biomedical image retrieval. This shows that we have now progresses beyond the phase, where medical doctors transfer a database to computer scientists to only evaluate their algorithms.

Especially, the ambiguities of natural languages and abstract concepts are handled inadequately by full-text search engines. Ontologies provide a solution to these problems.

For a fixed collection interval, two types of MAC schemes are considered: the deterministic scheduling, which collects data from predetermined sensors locations, and random access, which collects data from random locations. We compare the signal estimation performance of the two MACs, using the expected maximum distortion as the performance measure. For large sensor networks with fixed density, we show that there is a critical threshold on the sensor outage probability P<sub>out</sub>-For _P<sub>out</sub> < e<sup>-lambda(1+o(1))</sup>, where lambda is the throughput of the random access protocol, the deterministic scheduling provides better reconstruction performance.

To represent word sense, we proposed conceptual fuzzy sets (CFSs). A CFS is a framework that represents word concepts and that changes dynamically with fuzzy sets. In this paper, we experiment with concept retrieval for documents using conceptualized queries using CFSs.

Many variants of the basic PIR model have been proposed, including such modifications as computational vs. information-theoretic privacy protection, correctness in the face of servers that fail to respond or that respond incorrectly, and protection of sensitive data against the database servers themselves. In this paper, we improve on the robustness of PIR in a number of ways. First, we present a Byzantine-robust PIR protocol which provides information-theoretic privacy protection against coalitions of up to all but one of the responding servers, improving the previous result by a factor of 3. In addition, our protocol allows for more of the responding servers to return incorrect information while still enabling the user to compute the correct result. We then extend our protocol so that queries have information-theoretic protection if a limited number of servers collude, as before, but still retain computational protection if they all collude. We also extend the protocol to provide information-theoretic protection to the contents of the database against collusions of limited numbers of the database servers, at no additional communication cost or increase in the number of servers. All of our protocols retrieve a block of data with communication cost only O(lscr) times the size of the block, where lscr is the number of servers. Finally, we discuss our implementation of these protocols, and measure their performance in order to determine their practicality.","1081-6011;10816011","POD:0-7695-2848-1","10.1109/SP.2007.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4223220","","Computer science;Costs;Data privacy;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Polynomials;Power system protection;Protocols;Robustness","data privacy;database management systems;information retrieval;information theory","Byzantine-robust PIR protocol;computational privacy protection;database servers;information-theoretic privacy protection;private information retrieval","","26","1","17","","","20-23 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the same direction in this study we try to design, implement and examine a complete architecture for a customized software intelligent agent which is able to retrieve information from multiple sources based on user interests. The designed architecture is able to use information fusion methods to achieve this goal. Here, the OWA, which is a member of the fuzzy integral operators family, has been used.

However, not much work has been done on providing information access in such challenging network scenarios. Existing client/server paradigm for information access will not be feasible in such scenarios since end-to-end path does not exist. Thus, in this paper, we explore how a content-based information retrieval system can be designed for DTNs. There are three important design issues, namely (a) how should data be replicated and stored at multiple nodes, (b) how should a query be disseminated in sparsely connected networks, (c) how should a query response be routed back to the querying node. We first describe two data caching schemes: (a) K-copy random caching, (b) K-copy intelligent caching. Then, we describe an L-hop Neighborhood Spraying (LNS) scheme for query dissemination. For message routing, we either use Prophet routing scheme or Highest Encounter First Routing (HEFR) scheme. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate different combinations of these algorithms. Our results reveal that the scheme that performs the best is the one that uses the K-copy intelligent caching combined with the LNS query dissemination and HEFR scheme.","2155-7578;21557578","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1513-7; POD:978-1-4244-1512-0","10.1109/MILCOM.2007.4455020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4455020","content-based routing;disruption tolerant networking;network performance","Batteries;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Disruption tolerant networking;Energy storage;Information retrieval;Intelligent sensors;Mobile computing;Routing;Spraying","","","","3","","17","","","29-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the CLR is only based on the shortest path linking the query to the documents. It is not well defined. To resolve the existing problem, first, this paper presents a concept lattice based user model to represent user interest in concept lattice structure. A novel concept lattice based user modeling algorithm is also provided. Second, this paper proposes a concept lattice based personalized ranking model (CLPR), which measures the similarity among query, user interest model and documents according to the relation between query and user interest based on concept lattice. The similarity computation of CLPR contains more information than traditional information retrieval models, and moreover, the CLPR can identify the new interest of users and find the documents of new interest. Our experiments show that documents retrieved by CLPR achieve steadily higher measures of precision than the CLR and the traditional vector space model.

The properties of vegetation's surfaces are usually estimated by remotely sensed data through regression models or physical-based models, which simulates the interactions of solar radiation with the vegetation medium. In real domain, the spectral responses measured by the sensor in forested area are strongly influenced by the different understory natural conditions that limit the possibility of applying both retrieval methods to predict overstory vegetation parameters. Understory information is therefore needed for estimating trees' parameters; moreover from a biodiversity point of view and perspective of forest management, understory represents a critical component of forest ecosystem that needs a better characterization. An experiment has been conducted using hyperion and panchromatic QuickBird data to explore the status of different vegetation's understory under a sparse forest in the Longmenhe Nature Reserve, China. Understory vegetation information of study area is classified into five classes. The novel aspect of the method is the integration of spectral (hyperspectral) domain fusion and spatial domain fusion techniques within a multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network model. Real data from the experiment on a limited ground as well as hyperion and QuickBird data are used as input dataset. A nonlinear artificial neural network achieved a classification accuracy of 80% despite the presence of co-occurring mid-story and understory vegetation. The achieved results show that this method is able to identify the different vegetation information under the tree canopy. Our studies suggest that it is necessary to incorporate the geographic and vegetation community prior information to further improve the accuracy in order to monitor understory vegetation.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423806","","Area measurement;Artificial neural networks;Biodiversity;Biosensors;Ecosystems;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Parameter estimation;Solar radiation;Vegetation","atmospheric radiation;ecology;forestry;geophysics computing;neural nets;remote sensing;sensor fusion;vegetation","China;Hyperion imaging;Longmenhe Nature Reserve;climate change process;forest ecosystem;multilayer perceptron artificial neural network model;panchromatic QuickBird data;regression model;remote sensing;solar radiation;spatial domain fusion;spectral domain fusion;understory vegetation information;vegetation cover;vegetation mapping","","0","","15","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed approach, LSI is used to map the concepts expressed in queries written by the programmer to relevant parts of the source code, presented as a ranked list of search results. Given the ranked list of source code elements, our approach selects most relevant attributes from these documents and organizes the results in a concept lattice, generated via FCA. The approach is evaluated in a case study on concept location in the source code of eclipse, an industrial size integrated development environment. The results of the case study show that the proposed approach is effective in organizing different concepts and their relationships present in the subset of the search results. The proposed concept location method outperforms the simple ranking of the search results, reducing the programmers' effort.","1092-8138;10928138","POD:0-7695-2860-0","10.1109/ICPC.2007.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4268239","","Computer science;Documentation;Indexing;Industrial relations;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Lattices;Programming profession;Search engines","information retrieval;reverse engineering","formal concept analysis;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;source code","","79","2","36","","","26-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, the “information retrieval” means the sentence extraction based on our preference specification. In contrast to the conventional keyword-based approach, our discussion puts emphasis on the enrichment of the preference representation capability. We represent preference as a pattern on the syntactic and semantic features. Three preference representation methods are described: One is the rule-based method that requires the direct coding of the preference in the form of the constraints on the syntactic and semantic features. Though this approach enables us to specify the preference in a specification, more intuitive and simpler methods are desired from the viewpoint of application. In order to achieve this, we extend the rule-based method to the example-based and the unification-based methods. Both methods are simple in that preference is specified by example sentence presentation. In the unification-based method, part of the sentences can be left unspecified so that the search engine can fill the appropriate word in the course of search. Illustrative examples are also shown using the actual minutes texts.","1062-922X;1062922X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0991-4; POD:978-1-4244-0990-7","10.1109/ICSMC.2007.4414245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414245","","Assembly systems;Cathode ray tubes;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Database systems;Displays;Information retrieval;Local government;Search engines;Speech","","","","0","","12","","","7-10 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the better and stronger function, the sequence of search result queue and the correlation of query expression are the key problems that could be computed by similarity algorithm. Now we recommend a new method which is ontology-based weighted semantic tree similarity algorithm (OWSTS). In this paper, we introduce the construction method of OWSTS and the implementation of similarity algorithm. Then we use a deep groove ball bearing as an example to show how to implement intelligent retrieval system for machinery production. Finally the relative accuracy of retrieval results by OWSTS and generally used cosine vector space based similarity algorithm (TF*IDF) are compared. Experiment result shows that OWSTS algorithm is feasible for information retrieval and the similarity algorithm makes the sequence of search result queue fit for users semantic requirement.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0963-2; POD:1-4244-0962-4","10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281525","bearing production;domain ontology;intelligent retrieval;similarity algorithm;weighted semantic tree","Collaborative work;Computer aided manufacturing;Information retrieval;Information systems;Logic;Logistics;Manufacturing automation;Ontologies;Production systems;Space technology","Internet;ball bearings;information retrieval;information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);production engineering computing;trees (mathematics)","Internet;bearing production information system;cosine vector space;deep groove ball bearing;information retrieval;intelligent retrieval;machinery production;ontology;weighted semantic tree similarity algorithm","","0","","9","","","26-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the existing fragile watermarking techniques with recovery are susceptible to random noise. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a chaos-based fragile watermarking scheme with recovery. In the proposed algorithm, the original image is divided into 2times2 blocks. The watermark embedding position of every image block is randomly generated based on chaotic system. These strategies can effectively improve the ability of our algorithm against not only random noise but also the synchronous counterfeiting attack. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed scheme can detect and localize any malicious alterations and can recover a tampered image to an intelligible one even if the tested image is polluted by the random noise.","","POD:0-7695-2874-0","10.1109/FSKD.2007.324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4406092","","Additive noise;Chaos;Counterfeiting;Cryptography;Databases;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Information security;Partitioning algorithms;Watermarking","chaos;image coding;noise;watermarking","channel additive noise;chaos-based fragile watermarking scheme;digital image;malicious alterations;random noise;synchronous counterfeiting attack;tampered image recovering","","0","","12","","","24-27 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Keywords are valuable indexing tools and if they can be identified at the image level, extensive computation during recognition will be avoided. Printed documents can be scanned to produce document images. Instead of converting entire document images into text equivalent, word profiles are identified to match the word images in Bilingual document images.(English and Tamil). During retrieval, the same profile could be extracted from the user specified word and can be matched with the word images in the document. This yields a faster result even in a quality-degraded document. This kind of Information Retrieval (Keyword Based Search) can be adapted in Digital Libraries, which employs digitized documents instead of text processing. This promotes efficient search in document images irrespective of the language.","","POD:0-7695-2928-3","10.1109/CGIV.2007.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4293683","Document Images;Word Profiles.","Character recognition;Image converters;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Optical character recognition software;Pixel;Software libraries","digital libraries;document image processing;information retrieval","bilingual document images;digital libraries;keyword based search;printed document images;profile based information retrieval;text processing","","2","","18","","","14-17 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, beacons determine how to route queries based on information cached from sources&#8217; responses to queries. In this paper, we examine alternative architectures for routing queries between beacons and to data sources. We also examine how to improve the routing by probing sources in an informed way to learn about their content. Results of experiments using a beacon network to search 2,500 information sources demonstrates the effectiveness of our system; for example, our techniques require contacting up to 71 percent fewer sources than existing peer-to-peer random walk techniques.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2007.1107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4359395","information search and discovery;peer-to-peer systems","","","","","6","","37","","","Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
