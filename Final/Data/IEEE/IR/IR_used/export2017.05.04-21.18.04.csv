This paper presents a hybrid method to calculate the concept relatedness of heterogeneous ontologies. It is divided into two parts: The first is a fixed weighted measure based on the concept of the tree which was combined by multiple heterogeneous ontologies in a mapping way; the other variable calculation is based on users' communications.

In this paper, we evaluate the contribution of a method which considers a polyphonic context. We propose an algorithm that computes a similarity measure between polyphonic musical sequences. All the notes are taken into account, even if they sound at the same time. Melodies are represented by quotiented sequences. A quotiented sequence is a sequence graph defined with an additional equivalent relation on its vertices and such that the quotient graph is also a sequence graph. The core of the method relies on an adaptation of edit-distance metrics, regularly applied in bioinformatic context. These methods are currently being used to evaluate the similarity between a monophonic query and a database of polyphonic musical pieces. First experiments show that the adaptation to polyphony does not degrade the quality of the algorithm with monophonic musical pieces.

"Coupling RDF/RSS, WSRP and AJAX for Dynamic Reusable Portlets: An Approach and a Use Case","S. Padmanabhuni; K. Kunti; L. Sahoo; S.

Often individual aggregators create content from such feeds however, every single aggregator needs to render UI content separately. Avoiding this via reuse requires creation of presentation-oriented services for dynamic generation of content from same base XML data. Web services for remote portlets (WSRP) provides standards based interfaces for creation of presentation oriented services using web services technology .However, any WSRP based remote portlet needs to be refreshed every time when even a single data element changes in the portlet. Complementarity, technologies like Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) also allow for content aggregation and asynchronous data retrieval. Unlike WSRP, in AJAX only the required control needs to be refreshed, whenever data changes. In AJAX too,, every aggregator is required to include AJAX control accessing the same back end service leading to considerable replication of effort. These two technologies complement each other in terms of ease of sharing of aggregated content and better usability of such content. Overall, often there is a requirement to dynamically generate UI content from XML data, customize and share aggregated content with remote consumers and finally allow for partial updates of remote aggregated content for better usability. We take a holistic view of the problem statement and propose an end to end architectural approach that combines usage of WSRP, AJAX along with XML syndication feeds like RSS for creation of standards based, customizable, and dynamically generated reusable UI that has better interactivity, speed and usability.","","POD:0-7695-2925-9","10.1109/SCC.2007.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278734","","Feeds;Information retrieval;Java;Portals;Rendering (computer graphics);Resource description framework;Usability;Vocabulary;Web services;XML","Web services;Web sites;XML;information retrieval","AJAX;Web services for remote portlets;Web sites;XML;asynchronous JavaScript;asynchronous data retrieval;content aggregation;coupling really simple syndication;domain specific syntactic syndication;dynamic reusable portlets;services oriented","","1","","29","","","9-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Local trees are interconnected to form one big tree in the network. Local trees are also built based on any algorithm that is energy consumption aware at each sub-root node in a locally centralized way. We use an existing two dimensional indexing technique for energy efficient query dissemination. We show that our proposed scheme is energy efficient for query and data processing heuristically.

The combination of geometric and photometric information yields a significant improvement in a feature's discriminative power. A cascading matching algorithm is used for feature matching and evaluation. To demonstrate the descriptor's image matching capabilities, a voting algorithm for similar scene retrieval is implemented utilizing results from the feature matches.

In our distributed architecture, images are partitioned to multiple servers and an index is built. Administrated by a controlling server, each distributed server matches query image in its own image sub-collection in parallel and returns the intermediate search results, a list of images similar to query image, to the controlling server for further re-ranking and merging. An evaluation of the results shows that our distributed architecture removes the limitation of a centralized image retrieval system.

Most current approaches for web service discovery cater to semantic web services, i.e., web services that have semantic tagged descriptions. It is difficult, however, to expect all new services to have semantic descriptions associated. Furthermore, the descriptions of the vast majority of already existing services do not have explicitly associated semantics. There are also severe restrictions on the prospective conversion of existing, non-semantic, descriptions, e.g., Web service description language (WSDL), to corresponding semantic descriptions, e.g., OWL-based Web service ontology (OWL-S). In this paper we present a novel approach for web service discovery that combines ontology linking with latent semantic indexing (LSI). The basic idea is to build the service request vector according to the domain ontology, have the training set of the LSI classifier based on features extracted from selected WSDL files, and finally project the description vectors and the request vector and utilize the cosine measure to determine similarities and to retrieve relevant WSDL service descriptions.","","POD:0-7695-2925-9","10.1109/SCC.2007.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278644","Latent Semantic Indexing;expansion;service discovery;service request","Automation;Feature extraction;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Large scale integration;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Web services","Web services;indexing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Web service discovery;latent semantic indexing;ontology;semantic Web;service request expansion","","13","","29","","","9-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TVM is a sequence of 3D mesh models made for real-world 3D objects. TVM is generated using multiple-view images taken with multiple cameras. Since TVM can record shape, color, and motion of the real-world 3D objects, it has been drawing a lot of attention these days. In order to realize practical archiving systems for TVM, efficient retrieval systems are indispensable. The retrieval systems for TVM developed so far are based on query-by-example. This means additional TVM generation is required for constructing queries, which is computationally demanding and time consuming. On the other hand, motion capture systems are widely used to capture 3D human motion. However, the data structure is very different from that of TVM. Therefore, the two kinds of 3D human motion data are incompatible to each other.

The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method precisely discriminate different events and effectively discover Sols.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284777","","Computer science;Data analysis;Event detection;Frequency;Information retrieval;Memory;Prototypes;Sun;Surveillance;Unsupervised learning","image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing;video surveillance","computer techniques;data management;data retrieval;data storage;event-oriented method;pixel change modeling;prototype-event models;segment-of-interest discovery;surveillance video;temporal-spatial space;unsupervised learning","","0","","7","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Domain-specific search engine (DSSE) is one of solutions to alleviate such inefficient situation. This paper proposes a new method for building DSSE based on meta-search engine (MSE) on Internet. First, odds ratio method is used to refine the domain-specific keywords, which are weighted by means of TF-IDF method. Second, domain query expression is constructed with the keywords by Decision Tree method to reflect the features of domain documents. Combining user's plain query with the domain query expression, the MSE constructs a domain-specific query expression and submits it to general-purpose search engines (GSE). The Extended Boolean Model is employed to rank the search results back from the GSE. Finally, the ranked results are returned to the query user. The experiment results show that the proposed domain-specific search method is effective in searching domain documents. The designed DSSE is more simple and efficient than the dedicated domain-specific search engines.","","CD-ROM:7-900718-14-1; POD:7-302-13922-9","10.1109/CESA.2006.4281981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281981","decision tree;domain-specific search engine;extended boolean model;meta-search engine;odds ratio","Decision support systems;Decision trees;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Internet;Metasearch;Search engines;Search methods;Systems engineering and theory;Web pages","Internet;decision trees;query processing;search engines","Internet;decision tree method;domain query expression;domain-specific keywords;domain-specific search method;extended Boolean model;general-purpose search engines;meta-search engine;odds ratio method","","1","","21","","","4-6 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This implies that the same type of descriptors is used for all feedback iterations. Therefore, such approaches cannot improve the retrieval performance beyond the efficiency of the descriptors used to represent the multimedia content. In this paper, an alternative concept is to adopt a progressive descriptor organization and to allow dynamic modification of the type of descriptors (expansion or shrink) at each retrieval iteration by exploiting the current user's information needs. In other words, descriptors that best fit the current user's preferences are expanded into more details, in constant to the descriptors that are far way from the user's needs which are shrinking. In this case, instead of using a large set of descriptors, most of them inappropriate with respect to the current user's information needs, a small number of dominant descriptors is selected for the retrieval process. Thus, the proposed approach significantly increases the precision performance by discarding descriptors that yield noise in the retrieval.","","CD-ROM:0-7695-2818-X","10.1109/WIAMIS.2007.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279186","","Computational complexity;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Electronic mail;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Shape;State feedback","content-based retrieval;information needs;information retrieval systems;multimedia computing;relevance feedback;vocabulary","content-based multimedia retrieval system;information need;multimedia retrieval;optimal estimation;progressive descriptor organization;relevance feedback scheme","","1","","12","","","6-8 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To characterize the color content we use a fuzzy symbolic representation of several low-level statistical parameters which are extracted from the movie global color distribution (color signature). The derived semantic/symbolic information is regarding the movie's predominant hues, the Itten's color contrasts, the color harmony schemes and color relationship. The interest in these descriptions is twofold: first we provide a content analysis tool for the animation experts and second we provide the movie semantic content annotation which is required by the indexing task. The discriminating power of our features as prospective semantic indexes is tested using a k-means clustering. Moreover, to overcome the difficulty of comparing various types of data, also required by the content-based retrieval task, we have developed an efficient methodology for comparing movie content.

Often individual aggregators create content from such feeds however, every single aggregator needs to render UI content separately. Avoiding this via reuse requires creation of presentation-oriented services for dynamic generation of content from same base XML data. Web services for remote portlets (WSRP) provides standards based interfaces for creation of presentation oriented services using Web services technology.However, any WSRP based remote portlet needs to be refreshed every time when even a single data element changes in the portlet. Complementarity, technologies like Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) also allow for content aggregation and asynchronous data retrieval. Unlike WSRP, in AJAX only the required control needs to be refreshed, whenever data changes. In AJAX too, every aggregator is required to include AJAX control accessing the same back end service leading to considerable replication of effort. These two technologies complement each other in terms of ease of sharing of aggregated content and better usability of such content. Overall, often there is a requirement to dynamically generate UI content from XML data, customize and share aggregated content with remote consumers and finally allow for partial updates of remote aggregated content for better usability. We take a holistic view of the problem statement and propose an end to end architectural approach that combines usage of WSRP, AJAX along with XML syndication feeds like RSS for creation of standards based, customizable, and dynamically generated reusable UI that has better interactivity, speed and usability.","","POD:0-7695-2926-7","10.1109/SERVICES.2007.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278794","","Feeds;Information retrieval;Java;Portals;Rendering (computer graphics);Resource description framework;Usability;Vocabulary;Web services;XML","Java;Web services;XML;authoring languages;portals;software reusability;user interfaces;vocabulary","AJAX;Asynchronous JavaScript;RDF;Web services for remote portlets;Web sites;XML vocabularies;asynchronous data retrieval;content aggregation;domain specific syntactic syndication frameworks;dynamic reusable portlets;presentation-oriented services;really simple syndication;user interface content","","1","","29","","","9-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we are motivated to investigate the problem of improving the streaming quality of service (QoS) of those systems by two universal recognitions: one is that the understanding to practical service experiences would benefit the performance enhancement, while the other is ""the more, the better"" design philosophy in P2P networks. As an interesting approach, we first retrieve the practical online duration information of end users from service traces in our GridMedia system, and then intentionally extend the online duration of each peer, which would result in a more stable peer overlay. The comparative simulations with original real-world traces and modified ones demonstrate that the quality of streaming service would be better if peers stay longer in the community. We claim that, this simple but positive result essentially validates both the influence of end users' behaviors and the need of an incentive to encourage users to spend more time in P2P live streaming systems.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4285111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285111","","Computer science;IP networks;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Large-scale systems;Peer to peer computing;Quality of service;Streaming media;Sun;Web and internet services","Internet;grid computing;media streaming;peer-to-peer computing;quality of service","GridMedia system;Internet;P2P live streaming systems;P2P networks;live media streaming systems;peer overlay;peer to peer;performance enhancement;quality of service;streaming service;user online duration","","4","","14","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dictionary and information retrieval based techniques have proven useful in disambiguating the semantics of service descriptions, but they are limited in their capability to consider the relationships between the words describing the Web services. Current ontology-based approaches typically require a user to explicitly create domain ontologies. This paper presents a novel technique that significantly improves the quality of semantic Web service matching by (1) automatically generating ontologies based on Web service descriptions and (2) using these ontologies to guide the mapping between Web services. Our approach differs from earlier work on service matching by considering the relationship between words rather than treating them as a bag of unrelated words. The experimental results indicate that with our unsupervised approach we can eliminate up to 70% of incorrect matches that are made by dictionary-based approaches.","","POD:0-7695-2924-0","10.1109/ICWS.2007.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4279590","","Computer science;Dictionaries;Impedance matching;Information retrieval;Middleware;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Web services;Wrapping","Web services;dictionaries;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","automatic Web service matching;dictionary;information retrieval;ontologies;semantic Web service matching quality","","8","2","15","","","9-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The SCORDRA engine makes use of the sharable content object reference model (SCORM) to bring together relevant data stored in the form of sharable content objects (SCOs). The Data Layer consists of data stored as SCO's. These SCO's are built on the SCORM standards, and their location is resolved by the content object repository discovery and registration/resolution architecture (CORDRA). SCORM defines how information is referenced and used, by packaging data with metadata. CORDRA aims to locate and reference SCORM repositories over the web. The application layer provides the reasoning platform of the system, it makes use of SCOs discovered by CORDRA by crawling and indexing the SCO's on the Web. The user interface layer allows the user to enter queries and view these as multimedia presentations. This semantic web search engine will allow the user to enter a query, and deliver a multimedia presentation that answers the query.","","POD:0-7695-2841-4","10.1109/ICIS.2007.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276483","Multimedia;Semantic Search;Semantic Web;Systems;Visualisation.","CADCAM;Computer aided manufacturing;Content based retrieval;Electronic learning;Information retrieval;Search engines;Semantic Web;Standards development;User interfaces;Web sites","content management;information retrieval;multimedia computing;search engines;semantic Web","SCORDRA engine;SCORDRA model;content object repository discovery;multimedia content retrieval;registration/resolution architecture;semantic Web search engine;semantic search engine;sharable content object reference model","","6","","19","","","11-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Shallow soil layers affect the surface reflection and lead to constructive or destructive interferences which result, respectively, in overestimated and underestimated surface dielectric permittivity values. Synthetic GPR Green's functions were generated for a series of model configurations with different contrasts and different layer thicknesses. Green's function inversions were then performed to retrieve the initial parameters and analyze the sensitivity of the different parameters in the inverse problem. Two global optimization algorithms were used and compared, namely, a genetic algorithm and the multilevel coordinate search. The results showed that, depending on the contrast and layer thickness, it is not always possible to identify the original soil model. This depends in particular on the width of the frequency range. Both algorithms led to comparable results and did not converge properly in all cases, given their standard parameterization. Yet, the proposed method appears to be promising to improve real-time mapping of surface water content using off-ground GPR and full-wave inversion.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0886-5","10.1109/AGPR.2007.386530","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4278853","Ground-penetrating radar;inverse modeling;soil electric properties;soil layering;surface water content","Dielectrics;Green's function methods;Ground penetrating radar;Information retrieval;Interference;Inverse problems;Performance analysis;Permittivity;Reflection;Soil","","","","0","","27","","","27-29 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To deal with queries that are similar to but not exactly same as the cached ones, a novel technique named query rewriting is adopted. This technique is able to handle four kinds of similar queries namely exact matching, exact containment, semantic matching and semantic containment. A cache replacement scheme that utilizes both the query pattern support and query pattern accessing time is employed to perform a fine-grained region purging.

This paper presents a case for using ""business activity"" (e.g. a sale) as a contextual basis to meet the challenge. We developed a tool based on this approach to address the needs of services professionals. The tool is designed to support role-specific concept based queries that return the most relevant business activities first and subsequently enable retrieval of the most relevant documents and information for the business activity. Any relevant knowledge privy to an expert can be obtained by first finding the most relevant sale, followed by corresponding participant information, and finally by communicating with the participant expert. Business activity as a critical context enhances the search quality while bringing in the social network and business process.

The road network contained in an image is one example. The properties of road networks vary considerably from one geographical environment to another, and they can therefore be used to classify and retrieve such environments. In this paper, we define several such environments, and classify them with the aid of geometrical and topological features computed from the road networks occurring in them. The relative failure of network extraction methods in certain types of urban area obliges us to segment such areas and to add a second set of geometrical and topological features computed from the segmentations.

Although successful applications have been reported, it lacks the capability to model the spatial dependency and the correspondence between the patches and visual parts. Moreover, quantization deteriorates the descriptive power of patch feature. This paper proposes the hidden maximum entropy (HME) approach for modeling visual concepts. Each concept is composed of a set of visual parts, each part having a Gaussian distribution. The spatial dependency and image-level statistics of parts are modeled through the maximum entropy. The model is learned using the developed EM-IIS algorithm. We report the preliminary results on the 260 concepts in the Corel dataset and compared with the maximum entropy (ME) approach. Our experiments on concept detection show that (1) a relative increment of 10.3% is observed when comparing the average AUC value of HME approach with that of the ME approach and (2) the HME approach reduces the average equal error rate from 0.412 for the ME approach to 0.354.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284918","","Entropy;Feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Object recognition;Quantization;Statistical distributions;Statistics","Gaussian distribution;document image processing;expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;image coding;maximum entropy methods","Gaussian distribution;expectation maximisation algorithm;hidden maximum entropy;image-level statistics;improved iterative scaling;visual concept modeling","","2","","14","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an overlay structure based on m- binary search tree (BST) that provides an efficient and scalable solution for point and range query. We arrange the whole key space in lexicographic order and divide it into different key intervals. Each key interval is assigned to a BST. We have achieved intra-group and inter-group query processing in O(log |G<sub>j</sub>|) messages, where |G<sub>j</sub>| is the number of nodes in the destination group.

It makes the consumers free to compose services as they wish as well as simplifies the composition task. This paper makes two contributions. Firstly, we propose the mashup architecture, extend current SOA model with mashup and analyze how it facilitates service composition.

As a result, accessing such information and filtering out these documents can cause frustration and often result in waste of time and effort for the users while surfing the web. This is mainly because of the underlying techniques used in these engines. These techniques are mostly based in the frequency of the keywords of the query in the HTML code. In addition, issues such as dealing with classifying the pages found for a query according to previous visits along with features needed to make intelligent decisions regarding the access patterns of the users are not considered. This work presents an intelligent search engine, called ORCA that returns the most relevant documents for user's queries. This search engine analyses the queries and builds themes (models) to be used when the engine is confronted with similar queries. The intelligent component is used for constructing a model of the user behavior and using that model to fetch and even prefetch information and documents considered of interest to the user. It uses both latent semantic analysis and web page feature selection for clustering web pages. Latent semantic analysis is used to find the semantic relations between keywords, and between documents.","2378-1963;23781963","POD:0-7695-2913-5","10.1109/CEC-EEE.2007.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4285288","","Computer science;Explosives;Frequency;HTML;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","classification;decision making;information filtering;knowledge based systems;query processing;search engines","ORCA intelligent search engine;Web page classification;Web page clustering;Web page feature selection;document filtering;intelligent decision making;latent semantic analysis;theme-based search technique","","0","","11","","","23-26 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cooperative caching scheme can improve the accessibility of data objects. However, the cache hit ratio is reduced and access latency becomes longer significantly due to the mobility of MHs, energy consumption in battery, and limited wireless bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel cooperative caching scheme called GroupCaching (GC) which allows each MH and its 1-hop neighbors form a group. The caching status is exchanged and maintained periodically in a group. By using the proposed GroupCaching, the caching space in MHs can be efficiently utilized and thus the redundancy of cached data is decreased and the average access latency is reduced. We evaluate the performance of the GroupCaching by using NS2 and compare it with the existing schemes such as CacheData and ZoneCooperative. The experimental results show that the cache hit ratio is increased by about 3%~30% and the average latency is reduced by about 5%~25% compared with other schemes.","","POD:0-7695-2927-5","10.1109/NAS.2007.4","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4286409","Ad hoc;Cache placement;Cooperative caching;Group","Bandwidth;Batteries;Cooperative caching;Data communication;Delay;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network servers;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;cache storage;mobile radio","average access latency;cooperative caching scheme;energy consumption;mobile host;wireless ad hoc network","","25","3","15","","","29-31 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this method, faces of a person are firstly retrieved by finding in shots whose associated transcripts contain that person's name. Then, by using the RSC clustering, these faces are organized into clusters and only representative faces of these clusters are introduced to users. As a result, the retrieval performance is significantly increased since only a small number of faces belonging to the clusters relevant to the target person are returned instead of all initial retrieved faces. The contribution of new RSC clustering model for this problem is two-fold: First, it can automatically determine an appropriate number of clusters and discards a large number of irrelevant faces. Second, since the precision of clusters can be controlled easily by a threshold, high precision clusters can be obtained and treated as labeled sets so that they can be used for feature selection by using the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method. Experiments on the TRECVID 2004 dataset showed that the retrieval performance of the proposed method outperforms other existing methods.","1945-7871;19457871","CD-ROM:1-4244-1017-7; POD:1-4244-1016-9","10.1109/ICME.2007.4284702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4284702","","Automatic control;Boosting;Broadcasting;Feature extraction;Informatics;Information retrieval;Linear discriminant analysis;Multimedia communication;Spatial databases;Videos","face recognition;image retrieval;pattern clustering","TRECVID 2004 dataset;boosting face retrieval;feature selection;linear discriminant analysis;relevant-set correlation clustering model;retrieval performance","","1","2","7","","","2-5 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The client-server model of distributed computing in vogue is increasingly becoming inefficient in coping with the rising demand of information services. Faded information field (FIF) architecture with Push and Pull mobile agent technologies was proposed recently addresses these issues effectively. FIF balances the cost of information service provision and utilization where service provider (SP) fades the information contents through Push-MAs and the user sends in Pull-MAs to search the requisite information. In this work, a simulation engine was programmed to mimic the physical parameters of the system in terms of routers, servers and the level of information faded. Simulations were performed to determine the average delay of information distribution in the system under varying parameters of the system like servers, and the number of levels in which the information is faded in the system. It is demonstrated that the size of FIF along with the levels of information fading have a direct influence on the information retrieval function in the information service system.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0963-2; POD:1-4244-0962-4","10.1109/CSCWD.2007.4281469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4281469","CSCW;Collaborative Design;Internet","Availability;Computer architecture;Costs;Delay;Distributed computing;Engines;Fading;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Mobile agents","Internet;client-server systems;data mining;groupware;information retrieval;mobile agents;search engines","client-server model;distributed computing;faded information field architecture;information discovery delay analysis;information retrieval function;information service system;mobile agent;service provider","","0","","16","","","26-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a method that uses the approximation of the information need distilled from the user classification as the basis for multiple distinct retrievals. The final result set that is presented as the subsequent iteration to the user is obtained by fusing the result sets from the different retrievals. The method is demonstrated in the context of a simple test image collection for clarity. An analysis of the sample iterations of feedback is presented. The method presented remains independent of the retriever, relies on a conceptually appealing model of the user feedback and serves to establish the utility of the general framework.","","POD:0-7695-2841-4","10.1109/ICIS.2007.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276500","","Content based retrieval;Engines;Feedback;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Radio frequency;Set theory;Testing","content-based retrieval;image classification;image fusion;image retrieval;information needs;relevance feedback;rough set theory","CAFe rough set based framework;CBIR;content-based image retrieval;information need;re-weighting strategy;reduct-based result set fusion;relevance feedback;sample feedback iterations;semantic gap;user subjectivity","","1","","14","","","11-13 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
