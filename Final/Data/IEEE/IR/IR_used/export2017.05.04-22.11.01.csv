Meanwhile, the increasing popularity of smartphones and mobile connectivity makes it an inevitable trend to use genomic data on mobile devices. However, since one's genomic information is the ultimate identifier of an individual and contains sensitive private data (e.g., disease predispositions, ancestry information, etc.), the use of genomic data may raise serious privacy concerns. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways of using genomic data on mobile devices without disclosure and abuse of the individual's privacy. In this paper, we provide a general framework for storing and processing genomic data privately, in which dynamic symmetric searchable encryption (DSSE) is employed for users to efficiently retrieve their needed genomic data from the Cloud Storage Provider (CSP). Then, users can implement the genetic disease susceptibility test with these genomic data on their mobile devices. Our proposed framework can achieve a higher privacy preserving level at a lower computation cost. Performance evaluation shows the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0243-6; POD:978-1-5090-0244-3","10.1109/ICCChina.2015.7448649","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448649","Dynamic Symmetric Searchable Encryption;Genomic Data;Medical Test;Privacy Protection","Bioinformatics;Decision support systems;Diseases;Encryption;Genomics;Mobile handsets","DNA;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;diseases;genomics;information retrieval;medical computing;mobile computing;smart phones","CSP;DNA sequencing progress;DSSE;ancestry information;cloud storage provider;disease predispositions;dynamic symmetric searchable encryption;genetic disease susceptibility test;genome sequencing;genomic data retrieval;healthcare;medical test;mobile connectivity;mobile devices;privacy-preserving use;smartphones","","","","19","","","2-4 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of challenging issues is to find the relevant information from web. Semantic web brings solution by meaningful information retrieval through unique semantic links. In this project, we propose a Self-Key Discovery algorithm based on Sematic Linking Network which allows systematically acquire keys to link RDF(Resource Description Framework) data resources with Semantic relationships among subject Ontologies. Data published on the WWW are usually generated automatically, thus may contain enormous information, duplicates or may be incomplete. RDF is used to represent web content which is the initial stage for semantic linking. SKD algorithm used for RDF data set only, Creation of RDF data is important step to implement semantic linking of data. Proposed Self Key Discovery technique is to performing semantic Linking on knowledge domain clusters using an Ontology Guided Data Linkage (OGDL) framework. This framework allows self-organization of contributing data resources through the discovery of semantic Keys, by performing Linking data of ontological domain knowledge relating to RDF resources. The framework thus automates the discovery of Key to link data across unrelated Resources, and different RDF data set for concept clustering and cluster mapping. In this project, demonstrate the feasibility of our Self Key Discovery algorithms through semantic links to set of RDF Resources, and run on real-world datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9781-0; POD:978-1-4673-9782-7","10.1109/GET.2015.7453825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7453825","Ontology;Person ontology;RDF;SAKey;Self Key Discovery Algorithm;Semantic web;knowledge based grep","Joining processes;OWL;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Urban areas","Web sites;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","OGDL;RDF data resources;SKD algorithm;TKBG;WWW;Web content;World Wide Web;information resources;information retrieval process;knowledge domain clusters;knowledge-based grep;online resources;ontological domain knowledge;ontology guided data linkage;resource description framework data resources;self-key discovery algorithm;semantic Web;sematic linking network","","","","29","","","27-27 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such data are difficult to compare, visualize, and analyze due to the nonmetric nature of data sequence similarity measures. In this paper, we propose a general manifold learning framework for arbitrary-length multivariate data sequences driven by similarity/distance (parameter) learning in both the original data sequence space and the learned manifold. Our proposed algorithm transforms the data sequences in a nonmetric data sequence space into feature vectors in a manifold that preserves the data sequence space structure. In particular, the feature vectors in the manifold representing similar data sequences remain close to one another and far from the feature points corresponding to dissimilar data sequences. To achieve this objective, we assume a semisupervised setting where we have knowledge about whether some of data sequences are similar or dissimilar, called the instance-level constraints. Using this information, one learns the similarity measure for the data sequence space and the distance measures for the manifold. Moreover, we describe an approach to handle the similarity search problem given user-defined instance level constraints in the learned manifold using a consensus voting scheme. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real tropical cyclone sequence data are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of our manifold learning framework and the robustness of performing similarity search in the learned manifold.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2399102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060711","Application;embedding;feature extraction;isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP);longest common subsequence (LCSS);metric learning;similarity learning;similarity search;tropical cyclone;tropical cyclone.","Manifolds;Measurement;Robustness;Time series analysis;Trajectory;Tropical cyclones;Vectors","data handling;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","arbitrary-length multivariate data sequences;consensus voting scheme;data sequence similarity measures;distance measures;feature vectors;general manifold learning framework;instance-level constraints;manifold learning;multivariate variable-length sequences;nonmetric data sequence space;real tropical cyclone sequence data;semisupervised setting;sequence space structure;similarity search;similarity/distance learning;synthetic data;user-defined instance level constraints","","1","","38","","20150313","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, feature extraction systems often do not provide an indication of the reliability of the corresponding feature. Nevertheless, the provision of a reliability or confidence measure can be critical for the usage of a given feature in complex systems and real-world applications. In the present study we investigate the relationship between the entropy of a rhythmogram, which has been proposed as a descriptor of tempo salience in previous work, and the reliability of the extraction of multiple high level rhythm related features. The results show that this single descriptor is viable for simultaneously estimating the reliability of multiple rhythm features extraction.

Errors can occur in the textual content of the data in the fields of the XML. Fixing these errors manually is time-consuming and expensive, especially for large amounts of data. There is increasing interest in the research, development, and use of automated techniques for assisting with data cleaning. Electronic dictionaries are an important form of data frequently stored in XML format that frequently have errors introduced through a mixture of manual typographical entry errors and optical character recognition errors. In this paper we describe methods for flagging statistical anomalies as likely errors in electronic dictionaries stored in XML format. We describe six systems based on different sources of information. The systems detect errors using various signals in the data including uncommon characters, text length, character-based language models, word-based language models, tied-field length ratios, and tied-field transliteration models. Four of the systems detect errors based on expectations automatically inferred from content within elements of a single field type. We call these single-field systems. Two of the systems detect errors based on correspondence expectations automatically inferred from content within elements of multiple related field types. We call these tied-field systems. For each system, we provide an intuitive analysis of the type of error that it is successful at detecting. Finally, we describe two larger-scale evaluations using crowdsourcing with Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform and using the annotations of a domain expert. The evaluations consistently show that the systems are useful for improving the efficiency with which errors in XML electronic dictionaries can be detected.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0662-5; POD:978-1-5090-0663-2","10.1109/ICSC.2016.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439308","","Cleaning;Context;Data models;Dictionaries;Optical character recognition software;Standards;XML","XML;information retrieval;natural language processing;outsourcing;statistical analysis;text analysis","Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform;XML electronic dictionaries;annotation analysis;character-based language model;crowdsourcing;data cleaning;digitally-stored data;domain expert;efficiency improvement;larger-scale evaluation;manual-typographical entry errors;optical character recognition errors;single-field systems;statistical anomalies;statistical anomaly detection;text length;textual content;tied-field length ratios;tied-field systems;tied-field transliteration models;uncommon characters;word-based language model","","","","21","","","4-6 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Graphics are a key component in technical documents as they are simplified representations of complex ideas. When the traditional optical character recognition (OCR) systems is used on digitized documents, we lose the ideas conveyed in these information graphics since OCRs typically work only on text. And although in more recent times, tools have been developed to extract information graphics from pdf files, they still do not intelligently interpret the contents of the extracted graphics. We therefore propose a method for identifying the intended messages of line plots using a Bayesian network. We accomplish this by first extracting a dense set of points in from a line plot and then represent the entire line plot as a sequence of trends. We then implement a Bayesian network for reasoning about the messages conveyed by the line plots and their trends. We validate our approach by performing experiments on a dataset obtained from computer science conference publications and evaluate the performance of the network against the messages generated by human end users. The resulting intended message gives holistic information about the line plot(s) as well as lower level information about the trends that make up the plot.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1792-8; POD:978-1-5090-1793-5","10.1109/DAS.2016.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490102","bayesian network;document analysis;graphics;line plots","Bayes methods;Computer science;Data mining;Graphics;Image color analysis;Market research;Media","belief networks;computer graphics;document image processing;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;optical character recognition","Bayesian network;OCR system;information graphics extraction;line plot;optical character recognition;reasoning;technical document","","","","16","","","11-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of these applications often depends on workload types I/O data-intensive or I/O computation, workload volume, CPU attributes on computing nodes CNs, the VMs number on the same CN and network status between storage nodes SNs and CNs. Therefore, the application jobs in the workload have different completion times based on the VM placement decision and large data retrieval. To gain high performance for the overall jobs' completion time and maximizing the throughput of cloud links, we propose VMs placement that considers both computation resources and I/O data. The aim of this algorithm is to reduce the overall jobs' completion time (computing time as well as data transferring time). The CloudSim Simulator results show that our algorithm can significantly maximize the overall application performance and reduce the average jobs' completion time compared among VMs placement approaches previously proposed in the literature.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9584-7; POD:978-1-4673-9585-4","10.1109/ICBDSC.2016.7460362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460362","Cloud Computing;Cloudsim;Data transfer time;Data-intensive;Job Completion time;Network aware;Processing;Queuing and Data transfer time;VM placement","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Data transfer;Mathematical model;Processor scheduling;Time factors;Virtual machining","cloud computing;digital simulation;information retrieval;storage management;virtual machines","CPU attributes;CloudSim simulator;IO computation;IO data-intensive;VM;VM placement decision;cloud computing;cloud links;cloud systems;computing resources;data retrieval;data-intensive applications;jobs completion time optimization;pay-as-you-go basis;storage resources;virtual machine placement;workload volume","","","","17","","","15-16 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ODPs have been lately the standard solution for governments willing to put their public data available for the society. Portal managers use several types of metadata to organize the datasets, one of the most important ones being the tags. However, the tagging process is subject to many problems, such as synonyms, ambiguity or incoherence, among others. As our empiric analysis of ODPs shows, these issues are currently prevalent in most ODPs and effectively hinders the reuse of Open Data. In order to address these problems, we develop and implement an approach for tag reconciliation in Open Data Portals, encompassing local actions related to individual portals, and global actions for adding a semantic metadata layer above individual portals. The local part aims to enhance the quality of tags in a single portal, and the global part is meant to interlink ODPs by establishing relations between tags.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0662-5; POD:978-1-5090-0663-2","10.1109/ICSC.2016.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7439307","open data portal;semantic web;tag","Measurement;Metadata;Organizations;Portals;Semantics;Standards organizations;Tagging","data handling;government data processing;information retrieval;meta data;portals","metadata curation;metadata linking;metadata reconciliation approach;open governamental data portal;public data;semantic metadata layer;tag reconciliation;tagging process","","","","25","","","4-6 Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use a comprehensive set of lexical, syntactical, and contextual features to build the classifier and the experimental results show satisfactory classification performance. By applying the classifier on a larger dataset, we then present in-depth analyses to compare subjective and objective questions, in terms of the way they are being asked and answered.

First, they evaluated the community perception that the emerging problems are heavily related to the growing amount of low-quality content created by undesired groups of users (help vampires, noobs, and reputation collectors). Reproducible data analyses of content and community evolution supported these findings.

The VBS aims at this whole search process, focusing in particular on its interactive aspects. Encouraged by previous years' results, we created a system that purely addresses the latter issue, i.e., interface and interaction design. By eliminating all kind of video indexing and query processing, we were aiming to demonstrate the importance of good interface design for video search and that its relevance is often underestimated by today's systems. This claim is clearly proven by the results our system achieved in the VBS 2015 competition, where our approach was on a par with the top performing ones.

One is based on bag of words, which only considers the words in the sentences and similarity degrees between words. The other type is based on word embedding and deep neural networks, which learns word vectors to sentence vectors in deep models, in these models, deep layers may represent deep information in a sentence like phrase information and syntactic information, but these models may also lose some sentence information.

In this work, we introduce the problem of green web crawling, where the objective is to devise a page refresh policy that minimizes the total staleness of pages in the repository of a web crawler, subject to a constraint on the amount of carbon emissions due to the processing on web servers. For the case of one web server and one crawling thread, the optimal policy turns out to be a greedy one. At each iteration, the page to be refreshed is selected based on a metric that considers the page's staleness, its size, and the greenness of the energy consumed at the web server premises. We then extend the optimal policy to the cases of 1) many servers; 2) multiple threads; and 3) pages with variable freshness requirements. We conduct simulations on a real data set that involves a large web server collection hosting around two billion pages. We present experimental results for the optimal page refresh policy as well as for various heuristics, in an effort to study the effect of different factors on performance.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2520246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389355","Crawling;carbon footprint;greenness;staleness","Carbon;Carbon dioxide;Crawlers;Energy consumption;Green products;Web pages;Web servers","energy consumption;green computing;information retrieval;search engines","HTTP request;Web page download;Web server;carbon footprint;computational resources;energy consumption;green Web crawling;hypertext transfer protocol;page refresh policy;scheduling policy;variable freshness requirements","","","","34","","20160121","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To address this challenge, we propose an original multi-modal clique graph (MCG) matching method in this paper.

Moreover, we propose an image set-based clique/edgewise similarity measure to address the issue of the set-to-set distance measure, which is the core problem in MCG matching. The proposed MCG provides the following benefits: 1) preserves the local and global attributes of a graph with the designed structure; 2) eliminates redundant and noisy information by strengthening inliers while suppressing outliers; and 3) avoids the difficulty of defining high-order attributes and solving hyper-graph matching. We validate the MCG-based 3D model retrieval using three popular single-modal data sets and one novel multi-modal data set. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed method through comparisons. Moreover, we contribute a novel real-world 3D object data set, the multi-view RGB-D object data set.

These methods are typically evaluated by comparing the computed alignments to given ground-truth annotations. Creating such annotations is usually very labor intensive. For many musical pieces, especially in classical music, there exists a multitude of different recordings. In this work, we investigate whether an evaluation of music alignment algorithms can be performed without ground-truth annotations when at least a triplet of recordings of the same piece of music is available. The main idea is to align the time points of a fixed reference version, in a circular way, back through a second and third version by using their pairwise alignments. A triple error is then computed by comparing these time points with their circularly aligned version.

In this paper, we present a new spectral-spatial classifier that uses multi-spectral image captured by the ZY-3 satellite to distinguish seven mangrove species in the Beihai ecological monitoring area, Guangxi, China. In order to extract the spatial information, a correlative filter is designed to incorporate neighborhood correlative information before classification. Moreover, a feature optimization algorithm based on dictionary learning is applied to reduce the noise and improve the discrimination of sample features. Finally, a classification method using joint sparse representation is proposed to extract the mangrove region and recognize seven mangrove species. The classification results show that the major species in the study area are Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicenna marina that conform to field investigations. The overall accuracy reaches 95.62% and the kappa coefficient achieves the value of 0.9380.

The system proposes a training method that learns a set of graph traversal rules to detect a question's focus. A standard set containing diverse classes of benchmark questions is used for the training purpose. The system proposes using a semantic memory to store a set of commonly used and unambiguous words that often occur with specific graph traversal rules. A modified technique of the Word Sense Disambiguation using WordNet detects the contextual meaning of a question's focus and maps it to a finer class. A substantial improvement achieved using the approach over other similar systems using similar benchmark data shows that the current approach can be used as a syntactically and semantically rich model in the area of question answering systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9930-2; POD:978-1-4673-9931-9","10.1109/ICCITechn.2015.7488039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7488039","","","graph theory;natural language processing;pattern classification;question answering (information retrieval)","WordNet;finer-classes;graph traversal rules;lexically minimalistic syntactic labelled graph;linguistic denotation;major-classes;question answering systems;question classification;semantic memory;semantic-based hybrid approach;word sense disambiguation","","","","23","","","21-23 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, state-of-the-art handwritten text recognition systems are far from being perfect. Therefore, to have perfect transcriptions, human expert revision is required to really produce a transcription of standard quality. In this context, an interactive assistive scenario, where the automatic system and the human transcriber cooperate to generate the perfect transcription, would allow for a more effective approach. In this paper we present a multimodal interactive transcription system where user feedback is provided by means of touchscreen pen strokes, traditional keyboard and mouse operations. The combination of both the main and the feedback data stream is based on the use of Confusion Networks derived from the output of the on-line and off-line handwritten text recognition systems.

To address this problem, in this letter, we propose a novel cross-view hashing method, where a common Hamming space is learned such that binary codes from different views are consistent and comparable. The quantization loss across views is explicitly reduced by two carefully designed regression terms from original spaces to the Hamming space. In our method, the l<sub>2,1</sub>-norm regularization is further exploited for discriminative feature selection. To obtain high-quality binary codes, we propose to jointly learn the codes and hash functions, for which an efficient iterative algorithm is presented.

In the form of a sophisticated modular analysis pipeline, complementary information sources are combined appropriately for capturing the sought objects. With a novel background removal algorithm and an additional candidate validation step, the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art localization approaches in case of PCB images.

These parameters help to retrieve the location information and the time of posting. We need to retrieve the topic from those geo-referenced documents and determine the local topics and events for a particular region. All these clusters are geospatial in arbitrary shape hence density based clustering is the most appropriate clustering algorithm. Here we used tweets from Twitter, while the DBSCAN method is used for generating clusters. Here for finding similarity between tweets cosine similarity is used, but because of its low value we increase its value by adding weight to it by matching the keywords in tweets. Also another parameter of time is used for separating clusters temporally. Results have shown that weighted keyword based method gives more specific clusters than DBSCAN method, while using the time parameter in it we get clusters time separated.

However, how to effectively use label information and local geometric structure is still a challenging problem for these approaches. To address this issue, we propose a cross-modal hashing method based on collective matrix factorization, which considers both the label consistency across different modalities and the local geometric consistency in each modality. These two elements are formulated as a graph Laplacian term in the objective function, leading to a substantial improvement on the discriminative power of latent semantic features obtained by collective matrix factorization. Moreover, the proposed method learns unified hash codes for different modalities of an instance to facilitate cross-modal search, and the objective function is solved using an iterative strategy.

The accurate measures of semantic similarity between any two words is the difficult task. A new approach to measure similarity between words is based on text snippets and page count. These two measures are taken from the results of a search engine like Google. The lexical patterns are extracted from text snippets and word co-occurrence measures are defined using page count. The results of these two are combined. Moreover, the pattern clustering and pattern extraction algorithm are used to find various relationships between any two given words. Support Vector Machines is used to optimize the result. The empirical results reveal that the techniques are finding the best results that can be compared with human ratings and accuracy in web mining activity.

However, when the user-item rating record matrix is sparse, traditional recommendation algorithms perform poor, which is known as the cold-start problem. Recently, more and more contextual features have been proven to be valuable information for improving the accuracy of recommendation, and newly formed context-aware recommendation systems (CARS) provide a way to solve the cold-start problem by using some certain features such as users location, mood and social relationship. In order to handle multidimensional context, this paper first extracts relevant contextual information by calculating the information entropy, then divides the contextual information into three categories - user context, item context and interaction context. Finally, we extend the matrix factorization (MF) model to integrate the context information. Experimental results on LDOS-CoMoDa dataset have shown that our approach provides improvement in terms of recommendation accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0243-6; POD:978-1-5090-0244-3","10.1109/ICCChina.2015.7448725","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7448725","","Automobiles;Context;Context modeling;Mood;Motion pictures;Prediction algorithms;Sparse matrices","entropy;information retrieval;matrix decomposition;recommender systems","CARS;LDOS-CoMoDa dataset;cold-start problem;context-aware recommendation systems;contextual features;contextual information extraction;information entropy;interaction context;item context;matrix factorization model;multidimensional context situation;recommendation accuracy;user context;user-item rating record matrix","","2","","18","","","2-4 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This textual content is centered around software-specific entities, and their usage patterns, issues-solutions, and alternatives. However, existing approaches to analyzing software engineering texts treat software-specific entities in the same way as other content, and thus cannot support the recent advance of entity-centric applications, such as direct answers and knowledge graph. The first step towards enabling these entity-centric applications for software engineering is to recognize and classify software-specific entities, which is referred to as Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the literature. Existing NER methods are designed for recognizing person, location and organization in formal and social texts, which are not applicable to NER in software engineering. Existing information extraction methods for software engineering are limited to API identification and linking of a particular programming language. In this paper, we formulate the research problem of NER in software engineering. We identify the challenges in designing a software-specific NER system and propose a machine learning based approach applied on software engineering social content. Our NER system, called S-NER, is general for software engineering in that it can recognize a broad category of software entities for a wide range of popular programming languages, platform, and library. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate our machine learning based S-NER against a well-designed, and to study the effectiveness of widely-adopted NER techniques and features in the face of the unique characteristics of software engineering social content.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1855-0; POD:978-1-5090-1856-7","10.1109/SANER.2016.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476633","Mining software repositories;named entity recognition","Androids;Computer languages;Libraries;Organizations;Software;Software engineering;Software standards","information retrieval;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);software engineering;text analysis","API identification;S-NER;entity-centric applications;information extraction methods;issues-solutions;machine learning based approach;programming language;rule-based baseline system;software engineering social content;software engineering text analysis;software-specific NER system;software-specific entities;software-specific named entity recognition;usage patterns","","","","48","","","14-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been well known that social media such as the Twitter play crucial roles in transmitting important information at the time of natural disasters. In particular, since the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, the Twitter has been considered as one of the most efficient and convenient communication tools. However, because much redundant information is contained in the tweets, it is usually difficult to obtain important information from the flows of the tweets. Thus, it is urgently needed to develop some methods to extract the important and useful information from redundant tweets. To cope with complex and redundant data, a new neural potential learning has been developed to extract the important information. The method aims to find some highly potential neurons and enhance those neurons as much as possible to reduce redundant information and to focus on important information. The method was applied to the real tweets data collected in the earthquake and it was found that the method could classify the tweets as important and unimportant ones more accurately than the other conventional machine learning methods. In addition, the method made it possible to interpret how the tweets could be classified, based on the examination of highly potential neurons.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9360-7; POD:978-1-4673-9361-4","10.1109/SOCPAR.2015.7492798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7492798","Twitter;classification;interpretation;neural network;potentiality","Biological neural networks;Earthquakes;Electronic mail;Neurons;Supervised learning;Training","emergency services;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;redundancy;social networking (online)","Great East Japan Earthquake;NPL method;communication tools;complex data;natural disasters;neural potential learning;redundant data;redundant information reduction;social media;tweets classification;tweets interpretation;twitter;useful information extraction","","1","","24","","","13-15 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, recent methods are conducted mostly depending on user's log or app's contexts, which can only detect whether two apps are downloaded, installed meanwhile or provide similar functions or not. In fact, apps contain many deep relationships other than similarity, e.g., one app needs another app to cooperate to fulfill its work. Obviously, app's reviews contain user's viewpoint. They are useful to help dig deep relationship between apps. Therefore, to calculate relationship between apps via reviews, we propose an iterative process by combining review similarity calculation and app relationship calculation together.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498414","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498414","","Computer science;Context;Correlation;Dictionaries;Iterative methods;Semantics;Thesauri","information retrieval;iterative methods;mobile computing;recommender systems","App relationship calculation;app recommendation;app retrieval;high-quality retrieval;iterative process;mobile phones","","","","6","","","16-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the large amount of online users and their diverse and dynamic interests possess great challenges to support recommendation of friends on SNS's for each of the users. In this paper, we proposed a novel friend recommendation framework (FRF) based on the behavior of users on particular SNS's.

"Cross-Modal Retrieval via Deep and Bidirectional Representation Learning","Y. He; S. Xiang; C. Kang; J. Wang; C. Pan","National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Beijing, China","IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","20160615","2016","18","7","1363","1377","Cross-modal retrieval emphasizes understanding inter-modality semantic correlations, which is often achieved by designing a similarity function. Generally, one of the most important things considered by the similarity function is how to make the cross-modal similarity computable. In this paper, a deep and bidirectional representation learning model is proposed to address the issue of image-text cross-modal retrieval. Owing to the solid progress of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing, it is reliable to extract semantic representations from both raw image and text data by using deep neural networks. Therefore, in the proposed model, two convolution-based networks are adopted to accomplish representation learning for images and texts. By passing the networks, images and texts are mapped to a common space, in which the cross-modal similarity is measured by cosine distance. Subsequently, a bidirectional network architecture is designed to capture the property of the cross-modal retrieval-the bidirectional search. Such architecture is characterized by simultaneously involving the matched and unmatched image-text pairs for training. Accordingly, a learning framework with maximum likelihood criterion is finally developed. The network parameters are optimized via backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. A great deal of experiments are conducted to sufficiently evaluate the proposed method on three publicly released datasets: IAPRTC-12, Flickr30k, and Flickr8k. The overall results definitely show that the proposed architecture is effective and the learned representations have good semantics to achieve superior cross-modal retrieval performance.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2558463","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460254","Bidirectional Modeling;Bidirectional modeling;Convolutional Neural Network;Cross-Modal Retrieval;Representation Learning;Word Embedding;convolutional neural network;cross-modal retrieval;representation learning;word embedding","Computational modeling;Convolution;Correlation;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Semantics;Training","backpropagation;computer vision;convolution;gradient methods;information retrieval;knowledge representation;maximum likelihood estimation;natural language processing;neural nets;optimisation;stochastic processes;text analysis","backpropagation;bidirectional network architecture;bidirectional representation learning;computer vision;convolution-based network;cosine distance;deep neural network;image-text cross-modal retrieval;maximum likelihood criterion;natural language processing;network parameter optimization;similarity function;stochastic gradient descent","","1","","61","","20160427","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Another popular approach to model the multimodal data is through deep neural networks, such as the deep Boltzmann machine (DBM). Recently, a new type of topic model called the Document Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator (DocNADE) was proposed and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for text document modeling. In this work, we show how to successfully apply and extend this model to multimodal data, such as simultaneous image classification and annotation. First, we propose SupDocNADE, a supervised extension of DocNADE, that increases the discriminative power of the learned hidden topic features and show how to employ it to learn a joint representation from image visual words, annotation words and class label information.

The multimodal nature of multimedia data is the big barrier for knowledge extraction. The representation of multimodal data in a unimodal space will be more advantageous for any mining task. We initially represent the multimodal multimedia documents in a unimodal space by converting the multimedia objects into signal objects. The dynamic nature of the glowworms motivated us to propose the Glowworm Swarm Optimization based Multimedia Document Clustering (GSOMDC) algorithm to group the multimedia documents into topics. The better purity and entropy values indicates that the GSOMDC algorithm successfully clusters the multimedia documents into topics. The goodness of the clustering is evaluated by performing the cluster based retrieval of multimedia documents with better precision values.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0379-2; POD:978-1-5090-0380-8; USB:978-1-5090-0378-5","10.1109/ISM.2015.94","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7442338","Clustering;Glowworm Swarm Optimization;Multimedia Document;Multimodal;Unified Representation","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Entropy;Heuristic algorithms;Media;Multimedia communication;Particle swarm optimization","data mining;document handling;information retrieval;multimedia computing;pattern clustering","GSOMDC algorithm;cluster based retrieval;glowworm swarm optimization based clustering algorithm;knowledge extraction;multimedia knowledge discovery systems;multimodal multimedia documents","","","","17","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After the analysis of LSA-based approach's framework, we improved the approach by enhancing the approach's performance in accuracy. First, we utilized TOPIC SIGNATURE algorithm to extract the terms' novel information and incorporated the information to the process of evaluating topic's novelty score, which makes the evaluation more accuracy.

On the one side, ITER's high pulse length requires that any data archiving implementation include a steady state archiving mechanism with continuous storage of the data acquired and processed throughout the experiment. On the other side, all these data must be safely archived and continuously available for read systems on the client side in a short time from their acquisition. On the side of client systems, a new software library has been developed with two main goals. The first one is to provide simple and complete data archiving functionality, while the second pursues to implement a continuous and efficient data distribution engine including different data sources as well as a diversity of potential consumer systems.

In this paper, we first analyze real traces to confirm the importance and necessity of considering both content and contact in file search. We then propose Cont<sup>2</sup>, a social-aware file search method that exploits both node contents and contact patterns. First, considering people with common interests tend to share files and gather together, Cont<sup>2</sup> virtually groups common-interest nodes into a community to direct file search. Second, considering human mobility follows a certain pattern, Cont<sup>2</sup> exploits nodes' contact frequencies with a community to expedite file searching.

In this thesis, we present a unified, multi-disciplinary viewpoint for goal management that covers many different cases where goals can be used and techniques with which they can be exploited. We are dealing with the problem of selecting and recommending items that will fulfill, or contribute towards the fulfillment of user goals. Specifically, we suggest a goal-aware solution for the problem of finding related forum posts to a post at-hand within a user-community. Our solution is based on the detection of intention shifts captured through text features. Furthermore, we suggest a general purpose solution for recommending items of any kind by leveraging knowledge about goals that users managed to fulfill in the past through interactions with these items.

To deliver ads to potentially interested users, these social network platforms learn a prediction model for each user based on their personal interests. However, as user interests often evolve slowly, the user may end up receiving repetitive ads. In this paper, we propose a context-aware advertising framework that takes into account the relatively static personal interests as well as the dynamic news feed from friends to drive growth in the ad click-through rate. To meet the real-time requirement, we first propose an online retrieval strategy that finds k most relevant ads matching the dynamic context when a read operation is triggered. To avoid frequent retrieval when the context varies little, we propose a safe region method to quickly determine whether the top-k ads of a user are changed. Finally, we propose a hybrid model to combine the merits of both methods by analyzing the dynamism of news feed to determine an appropriate retrieval strategy. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real social networks and ad datasets verified the efficiency and robustness of our hybrid model.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498266","","Advertising;Context;Databases;Facebook;Feeds;Twitter","advertising data processing;information retrieval;recommender systems;social networking (online);ubiquitous computing","ad click-through rate;context-aware advertisement recommendation;high-speed social news feeding;online retrieval strategy;relevant ads matching;static personal interests","","1","","27","","","16-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The human capital is connected to form the social capital to resolve the routing problems. Although the human capital dominates the particular information system, it is difficult to capture it to fulfill requirements of users. For that, the social capital, which is shaped in the three graphs, i.e., the data, the channel and the human, is leveraged to perform the primary tasks since the human capital is difficult to be exploited directly. Those graphs represent the comprehensive perspectives to the environment and they are constructed in accordance with users' information accessing behaviors. In the early phase, the seed graphs are constructed to initialize the system. The routing does not expect to find their exactly required information resources. Instead, it aims to provide users with relevant consequences through exploring the nearby human capital.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-1220-6; Electronic:978-1-5090-1224-4; POD:978-1-5090-1225-1","10.1109/ICIST.2016.7483397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483397","channels;data;human capital;humans;large-scale heterogeneous information systems;routing;social capital","Distributed databases;Information systems;Internet;Navigation;Routing;Search engines;Web sites","Internet;graph theory;information retrieval;network routing","Internet;heterogeneous information access;human capital;information accessing quality;information system;resource types;seed graphs;social capital;social graph routing","","","","35","","","6-8 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity and diversity of these applications emerges the need of flexibility and combining operations with existing models to create other new, more complex models. As more complex models are used, the importance of transformations between models grows. This paper presents the application of the MDA (Model Driven Architecture) to generate, from the UML model, the code following the MVP (Model-View-Presenter), DI (Dependency Injection) and DAO (Data Access Object) patterns for a RIA (Rich Internet Application) using the standard MOF 2.0 QVT (Meta-Object Facility 2.0 Query-View-Transformation) as a transformation language. We adopt GWT (Google web Toolkit), Spring and Hibernate as a Frameworks for creating a target meta-model to generate an entire GWT-based N-tiers web application. That is why we have developed two meta-models handling UML class diagrams and N-tiers Web applications, then we have to set up transformation rules. The transformation rules defined in this paper can generate, from the class diagram, an XML file containing the Presentation, the Business, and the Data Access package. This file can be used to generate the necessary code of a RIA N-tiers web application.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8712-5; POD:978-1-4673-8713-2","10.1109/WICT.2015.7489648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489648","GWT;MOF 2.0 QVT;Model Transformation;Model View Presenter;dependency Injection;transformation rules","Business;Computational modeling;Data models;Java;Standards;Unified modeling language;User interfaces","Internet;Unified Modeling Language;XML;information retrieval","DAO patterns;DI;GWT-based N-tiers Web application;Google Web toolkit;Hibernate;MDA;MVP;RIA N-tiers Web application;Spring;UML model;Web applications;XML file;application complexity;application diversity;data access object;data access package;dependency injection;meta-models handling UML class diagrams;meta-object facility 2.0 query-view-transformation;model driven architecture;model-to-model transformation;model-view-presenter;rich internet application;standard MOF 2.0 QVT;transformation language;user interfaces","","","","49","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the information available on web pages is either represented in XML, or HTML, or XHTML format that mostly contains semi-structured text documents, which lacks formatted document structure. This document does not discriminate between the text and the schema, and the amount of structure used to represent the text depends on the purpose. No semantic is applied to semi-structured documents. This requires extracting core contents of text document to analyse words or sentences for retrieving relevant information. Although there are many existing methods that formulate the actual content identification problem as a DOM tree node selection problem, each one has some sort of lacunae. Here we proposed an approach based on pattern matching technique. This technique uses simple heuristic for extraction of core contents from web pages which are mostly semi-structured in nature. It requires visiting the appropriate news web site using their URL, accessing the links related to each news page of specified category, extracting the data including metadata from each of these news web pages. The approach uses devised algorithm that applies regular expressions (regexes) to identify the correct pattern for extracting the actual text contents from these news documents. Proposed approach deals with news web pages of any size and extracts core contents with efficiency and high accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2166-6; POD:978-1-5090-2167-3","10.1109/ICWR.2016.7498440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498440","Document Object Module;Information extraction;Pattern matching;tags","Data mining;Feature extraction;HTML;Pattern matching;Uniform resource locators;Visualization;Web pages","Web sites;information retrieval;pattern matching;text analysis","URL;banners;content identification;copyright information;core contents extraction;data extraction;external links;information retrieval;metadata;navigational elements;news Web pages;news Web site;noisy content;pattern matching;regexes;regular expressions;text document","","","","15","","","27-28 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

XML search engines are no different. But the search engines consider XML file as single unit completely ignoring the fact that XML document contains records in the form of semi-structured data. This hierarchal structure of XML inherits a parent/child relationship. This relationship make two tags semantically related, if they share same parent. Indexing document as a whole, result in low precision. This paper proposes an indexing scheme that preserves the parent/child relation information using document structure. The information is then used to identify the semantic relation between items. Semantic based search and retrieval on XML documents can provide more accurate results. The paper uses RDBMS to store these indices in the form of table. To check the accuracy of the proposed scheme, a case study is also performed using two queries on a sample XML file that share semantically related data.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8907-5; POD:978-1-4673-8908-2","10.1109/ICICT.2015.7469578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7469578","Indexing;RDBMS;Semantics;XML","Indexing;Search engines;Semantics;Standards;XML","XML;document handling;indexing;information retrieval;relational databases;search engines","RDBMS;XML documents;XML search engines;document indexing;parent-child relationship;retrieval process;search engines;search process;semantic indexing;semantically related data;semistructured data","","","","27","","","12-13 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Without deep knowledge about the data graph, users can create `failing' queries, which deliver empty answers. Analyzing the causes of these empty answers is a time-consuming and complicated task especially for graph queries. To help users in debugging these `failing' queries, there are two common approaches: one is focusing on discovering missing subgraphs of a data graph, the other one tries to rewrite the queries such that they deliver some results. In this demonstration, we will combine both approaches and give the users an opportunity to discover why empty results were delivered by the requested queries. Therefore, we propose DebEAQ, a debugging tool for pattern matching queries, which allows to compare both approaches and also provides functionality to debug queries manually.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2020-1","10.1109/ICDE.2016.7498355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498355","","Data models;Databases;Debugging;Engines;Pattern matching;Topology;Urban areas","data handling;graph theory;pattern matching;program debugging;query processing;question answering (information retrieval)","DebEAQ;data graph missing subgraphs;empty-answer query debugging;failing query debugging;large data graphs;pattern matching queries","","","","11","","","16-20 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the outsource encrypted data to cloud can increase the difficulty of the data retrieval, because data owner or unauthorized users can't search correctly the data they need, and also it is impractical to download all of the data to local side from the cloud, which will result in huge communication an computation overhead. Hence, some cloud data retrieval schemes has been proposed to solve this problem, these schemes not only can search the data they need correctly, but also can prevent sensitive data leaked out.

The problem is usually approached by computational methods to model the gene behaviour or its networked interactions with the others by a set of latent parameters. The model parameters can be estimated through a meta-analysis of available data obtained from other relevant experiments. The key question here is how to find the relevant experiments which are potentially useful in analysing current data. In this study, the authors address this problem in the context of time-course gene expression experiments from an information retrieval perspective. To this end, they introduce a computational framework that takes a time-course experiment as a query and reports a list of relevant experiments retrieved from a given repository. These retrieved experiments can then be used to associate the environmental factors of query experiment with the findings previously reported. The model is tested using a set of time-course Arabidopsis microarrays. The experimental results show that relevant experiments can be successfully retrieved based on content similarity.","1751-8849;17518849","","10.1049/iet-syb.2015.0042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7470973","","","associative processing;bioinformatics;botany;data analysis;data mining;genetics;information retrieval;lab-on-a-chip","computational framework;computational method;data analysis;environmental factor;experimental content similarity;gene behaviour model;gene networked interaction;information retrieval;latent parameter;meta-analysis;model parameter estimation;query experiment;relevant experiment list;relevant time-course experiment retrieval;repository;stimulus response;systems biology;time-course Arabidopsis microarray;time-course experiment query;time-course gene expression experiment;time-course gene regulation","","","","","","","6 2016","","IET","IET Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a new method is proposed to learn an assessment model for the (visual) aesthetics of Web pages. First, multimodal features (structural, local visual, global visual, and functional) of a Web page that are known to significantly affect the aesthetics of a Web page are extracted to construct a feature vector. Second, the interuser disagreement of aesthetics is analyzed and novel aesthetic representations are obtained from the multiuser ratings of a page. A structural learning algorithm is proposed for the new aesthetic representations. Third, as a Web page's functional purpose also affects the perceived aesthetics, we divide Web pages into different types using functional features, and a soft multitask fusion learning strategy is introduced to train assessment models for pages with functional purposes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method: 1) the combination of structural, local, and global visual features outperforms existing state-of-the-art Web aesthetic features; 2) the proposed structural learning algorithm achieves good results for the new aesthetic representations; and 3) the proposed soft multitask fusion learning strategy improves the performances of aesthetics assessment models.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2016.2538722","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7426384","Aesthetic features;Visual aesthetics;Web pages;fusion;local features;multi-task learning;visual aesthetics;web pages","Feature extraction;Human computer interaction;Image color analysis;Measurement;Usability;Visualization;Web pages","Internet;human computer interaction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion;support vector machines;user interfaces;vectors","SVM;Web page aesthetic assessment;Web page extraction;feature vector;human-computer interaction;multitask fusion learning;structural learning algorithm;support vector machine;user experience","","","","71","","20160304","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Web-based technologies have facilitated this endeavour by offering tools that are specifically designed for this task. Throughout this paper, the authors will present a novel type of platform, which is designed to support users in their quest to share knowledge. It consists of a question and answer platform, with a built in recommendation system for knowledge carriers. The hybrid design ensures that questions be answered in a timely manner and by most suitable users. The developed prototype and an evaluation of application domains are presented in the final section of this paper.","","Electronic:978-3-9075-8912-0; POD:978-1-5090-2090-4","10.1109/ICEDEG.2016.7461705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7461705","Q&A platform;granular computing;knowledge assessment;knowledge profiling","Companies;Databases;Engines;Graphical user interfaces;Knowledge based systems;Periodic structures;Search engines","question answering (information retrieval);recommender systems","knowledge carrier finder system;question and answer platform;recommendation system","","","","16","","","March 30 2016-April 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Proposed application of big data analytics in healthcare at Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital","M. Ojha; K.

This paper is fully focused towards the Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital (M.Y.) located in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. M.Y hospital is the central India's largest government hospital. It generates large amount of heterogeneous data from different sources like patients health records, laboratory test result, electronic medical equipment, health insurance data, social media, drug research, genome research, clinical outcome, transaction and from Mahatma Gandhi Memorial medical college which is under MY hospital. To manage this data, data analytics may be used to make it useful for retrieval. Hence the concept of ""big data"" can be applied. Big data is characterized as extremely large data sets that can be analysed computationally to find patterns, trends, and associations, visualization, querying, information privacy and predictive analytics on large wide spread collection of data. Big data analytics can be done using Hadoop which plays an effective role in performing meaningful real-time analysis on the large volume of this data to predict the emergency situations before it happens. This paper also discusses about the EHR and the big data usage and its analytics at M.Y. hospital.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9584-7; POD:978-1-4673-9585-4","10.1109/ICBDSC.2016.7460340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460340","Analytics;Big data;EHR;Hadoop;Healthcare","Big data;Government;Hospitals;Insurance;Medical diagnostic imaging;Smart cities","Big Data;electronic health records;health care;information retrieval","EHR;Hadoop;Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital;big data analytics;clinical outcome;drug research;electronic health record;electronic medical equipment;genome research;government hospital;health insurance data;healthcare;laboratory test result;patient health record;social media","","","","18","","","15-16 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Issues arising from the specification of an information acquisition and analysis toolkit for policy makers in governmental and legislative institutions","S. Taylor; R. Uzdavinyte; T. Wandhoefer; R. Fox","University of Southampton IT Innovation Centre, UK","eChallenges e-2015 Conference","20160328","2015","","","1","10","We describe the issues arising from the initial specification of a web-based toolkit that comprises different types of information retrieval and analysis tools. It is specifically intended for policy makers in governmental and legislative institutions, to help them research subjects of a policy in question, but the tool is general in its nature and could be applied to other domains. The major focus of this paper concerns issues arising from the initial requirements gathering for the toolkit, by consultation with its target user community. Sifting through a deluge of information available in the Internet and whether search results can be trusted are key important themes. There is also the challenge of ""unknown unknowns"" - relevant information exists that the policy maker simply does not know about, so there is no way of even beginning to search for it. The paper discusses how these challenges can be met.","","Electronic:978-1-9058-2453-3; POD:978-1-5090-2331-8","10.1109/eCHALLENGES.2015.7440969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7440969","","Databases;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Government;Internet;Media","Internet;government data processing;government policies;information analysis;information retrieval;legislation","Internet;Web-based toolkit;governmental institutions;information acquisition and analysis toolkit;information analysis tools;information retrieval tools;legislative institutions;policy makers;target user community","","","","15","","","25-27 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To characterise the dynamics of reaching the news event, we introduce the concepts of decreasing and increasing trends of domain varying. The analysis of self-similarity in behaviour of directors and trends on the basis of the proposed model can allow detecting the periodicity of domain approaching or moving away from the point of the predicted event.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1893-2; POD:978-1-5090-1894-9","10.1109/SmartCity.2015.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7463833","domain director;information domain;news cluster;self-similarity of processes in information domains","Arrays;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Feeds;Forecasting;Market research;Predictive models","data mining;forecasting theory;information retrieval;vectors","information domain;news clusters centroids;news events forecasting;self-similarity;vectors","","","","8","","","19-21 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
