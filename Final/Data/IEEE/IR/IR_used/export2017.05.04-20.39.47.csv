Text mining is a process by which interesting information is derived from text through the discovery of patterns and trends. Text mining algorithms are used to guarantee the quality of extracted knowledge. However, the extracted patterns using text or data mining algorithms or methods leads to noisy patterns and inconsistency. Thus, different challenges arise, such as the question of how to understand these patterns, whether the model that has been used is suitable, and if all the patterns that have been extracted are relevant. Furthermore, the research raises the question of how to give a correct weight to the extracted knowledge. To address these issues, this paper presents a text post-processing method, which uses a pattern co-occurrence matrix to find the relation between extracted patterns in order to reduce noisy patterns. The main objective of this paper is not only reducing the number of closed sequential patterns, but also improving the performance of pattern mining as well. The experimental results on Reuters Corpus Volume 1 data collection and TREC filtering topics show that the proposed method is promising.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4880-7; POD:978-1-4673-6057-9","10.1109/WI-IAT.2012.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6511885","Closed Sequential pattern;Information retrieval;Pattern co-occurrence matrix;Text mining","","Internet;data mining;information filtering;matrix algebra;text analysis","Reuters Corpus Volume 1 data collection;TREC filtering topics;Web;closed sequential pattern cleaning;data mining algorithms;knowledge extraction;pattern co-occurrence matrix;pattern discovery;pattern mining;text mining;text post-processing method;trend discovery","","1","","14","","","4-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several Semantic Search Engines (SSEs) have been proposed and deployed till date and each is inherently different from the other. As such, the objective of this paper is to present a discussion on semantically enhanced search engines for intelligent web content discovery.

This remarkable growth in the size of the web has led to in-depth studies on every element of information retrieval systems such as web page ranking algorithms. The accuracy of these algorithms plays a critical role in the search engines, whereas the ranker is responsible for accuracy. Thus, the ranker is a principal module of each search engine. In this paper, a new framework based on web graph and content similarity is presented in order to improve the accuracy of PageRank. This framework is implemented using Jaccard index and cosine similarity measures, and as a result of our empirical analysis, we shall show that putting page content similarity in action increases the accuracy of web ranking in some candidate ranking algorithms.

These feature functions are defined as dissimilarity measures between the audio observations and template vectors corresponding to the score. By expressing the template construction as a linear mapping from the symbolic to the audio representation, one can learn the feature functions by optimizing the linear transformation. In this paper, we explore two different learning strategies. The first one uses a best-fit criterion (minimum divergence), while the second one exploits a discriminative framework based on a Conditional Random Fields model (maximum likelihood criterion). We evaluate the influence of the feature functions in an audio-to-score alignment task, on a large database of popular and classical polyphonic music. The results show that with several types of models, using different temporal constraints, the learned mappings have the potential to outperform the classic heuristic mappings. Several representations of the audio observations, along with several distance functions are compared in this alignment task. Our experiments elect the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence. Moreover, both the spectrogram and a CQT-based representation turn out to provide very accurate alignments, detecting more than 97% of the onsets with a precision of 100 ms with our most complex system.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2013.2266794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6525340","Music information retrieval;audio-to-score alignment;conditional random fields;discriminative learning","Concurrent computing;Databases;Harmonic analysis;Hidden Markov models;Noise;Smoothing methods;Vectors","audio signal processing;maximum likelihood estimation;signal representation","CQT-based representation;audio observations;conditional random fields model;discriminative framework;feature functions design;heuristic mappings;learning optimal features;linear transformation;maximum likelihood criterion;musical recording;polyphonic audio-to-score alignment;polyphonic music;spectrogram;symbolic representation;symmetric Kull-back-Leibler divergence;template construction;template vectors;temporal constraints","","7","","38","","20130606","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to identify such keywords, we consider web context, assuming that the blogs documents are generated from web contexts by proposed generative model. Therefore, if the contexts of keyword on the web are reflected well in the blog, then we may regard the keyword is essential because the blog is rich on the keyword.

A significant drawback of this technique is that a large number of hash functions require lots of hash computation time. To resolve this issue, the paper presents a new index construction algorithm called boundary-expanding LSH, where the boundary of each bucket is expanded so that each point may be mapped to multiple adjacent buckets in each hash table. The proposed algorithm can map points near to the two sides of the boundary into the same bucket, which increases the collision probability of neighbors. To achieve the same search accuracy, boundary-expanding LSH needs fewer hash tables and less hash computation time, so it can provide us a higher acceleration factor. To obtain the best performance, the paper also presents a parameter optimization method.

The relevance feedback is quite effective and performs significantly better than pseudo-relevance feedback, which needs the user explicitly provides information on relevant documents to a query.

Consequently, efficient and effective techniques to retrieve visual information are sought after, especially as it can be usefully employed to augment textual information. Since users rarely annotate images, this proves to be a challenging task, however much progress has been reported in the area of content-based image retrieval which is based on visual features extracted from images for retrieval purposes. In this paper, we present two strategies for very fast image retrieval which use solely information contained in the header of JPEG compressed files. One is based on the tables that are responsible for the lossy quantisation step in JPEG, while the other is related to the Huffman tables used for entropy coding. In both cases, we employ the tables directly as image features in the context of online image retrieval. We then utilise them to discard irrelevant images, while a compressed-domain image retrieval technique is used for ranking the remaining image set. Experimental results convincingly show that our algorithms lead to a significant reduction of overall retrieval time while maintaining retrieval accuracy. They could thus be integrated into web-based recommender systems to augment and improve search results.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4911-8; POD:978-1-4673-5152-2","10.1109/SITIS.2012.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6395154","Huffman table;JPEG;image retrieval;information retrieval;quantisation table","Feature extraction;Image coding;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Quantization;Transform coding;Visualization","Internet;data compression;entropy codes;feature extraction;filtering theory;image coding;image retrieval","Huffman tables;JPEG compressed files;JPEG header information;Web visual information retrieval;Web-based recommender systems;compressed-domain image retrieval technique;content-based image retrieval;entropy coding;lossy quantisation step;online image retrieval;retrieved image filtering;visual feature extraction","","1","","21","","","25-29 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead of considering unnecessary mel-scale or any interests of non-harmonic components, we selectively focus on the changes in particular cepstral coefficients that represent the harmonic structure of an input signal. In comparison with a conventional time-frequency analysis, the advantage of using cepstral coefficients is that it shows the harmonic structure more clearly, and gives a robust detection function even when the envelope of waveform fluctuates or slowly increases. As a detection function, harmonic cepstrum regularity (HCR) is derived by the summation of several harmonic cepstral coefficients, but their frequency indices are defined from the previous frame so as to reflect the temporal changes in the harmonic structure. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves significant improvement in performance over other algorithms, particularly for pitched instruments with soft onsets, such as violin and singing voice.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-0015-2; POD:978-1-4799-0014-5; USB:978-1-4799-0013-8","10.1109/ICME.2013.6607461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6607461","Onset detection;cepstral analysis;music information retrieval","Abstracts;Harmonic analysis;Instruments;Transient analysis","cepstral analysis;harmonic analysis;information retrieval;music;signal detection;signal representation;time-frequency analysis;waveform analysis","HCR;cepstral analysis;harmonic cepstral coefficients;harmonic cepstrum regularity;mel scale;music information retrieval;nonharmonic component;note onset detection algorithm;signal harmonic structure representation;time-frequency analysis;waveform envelope fluctuation","","2","","11","","","15-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the optimization algorithm used by the NocancerSpace. 2PROM is designed to optimize the Dataspace retrieval process with two main phases. Its first phase consists of building a pipeline to find the best retrieval strategies. In fact, the pipeline explores the set of alternative execution strategies to determine the cheapest one. The retrieval strategies are initial nodes of the next phase. As for the second phase, retrieval strategies are combined with predictive model to determine the most efficient way to execute a query. In order words, the optimizer considers the possible retrieval strategies for a given input query, and attempts to determine which of those strategies will be the most efficient. The retrieval strategies are represented as XML tree of “strategy nodes”. The output of the second phase is the best results found.

This paper is based on a doctoral research and the aim of this research is to study the tutor-students' interactions in order to unfold their way of interactions and their learning needs. The methodology used was based on the content analysis of the logged tutor-students textual interactions. Qualitative analysis based on the activity theory of Engeström at macro level, and the Panchoo/Jaillet grid at micro level, were used to analyze a thousand lines of interactions pertaining to a particular module at Master's level in the UNIV-Rct online campus. Surprisingly it has been found that the students interact less on cognitive issues and more on matters pertaining to rules and procedures. Considering the students' learning needs and the tutor's manner of supporting them at real time in their studies, it is desirable to exploit further the technological and the social network capabilities to help enhance the educational processes. For quality learning to take place, not only students should be given adequate pedagogical supports, but tutors should also be assisted to enable them give relevant feedback and guidance in time.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4959-0; POD:978-1-4673-5832-3","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516368","Social network analysis;content analysis;elearning;information retrieval;interaction;knowledge management;virtual environment","","Internet;computer aided instruction;social networking (online)","Internet;World Wide Web;activity theory;content analysis;doctoral research;education sector;educational process;fertile grounds;online community;online interactions;online teaching;pedagogical tool;qualitative analysis;quality learning;social network analysis;tutor student interaction;tutor students textual interaction","","0","","25","","","26-28 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach is to record an audio signal from the user's mobile device, and match it with one in a reference database. However, reverberation and exogenous noise distort a recorded audio signal, making accurate identification more difficult. This paper presents a new fingerprinting method for content identification that is robust against reverberation and noise. It employs pseudo-sinusoidal components, which are components that can be regarded as sinusoidal over a short period of time. The method generates a fingerprint that represents the distribution of pseudosinusoidal components in the time-frequency domain. Experimental results show that the method can match a 5-s-long input signal against 792 hours of reference signals in 1.29 s on a single PC, and can identify the correct program with a recall of over 92% and a precision of 100% in a realistic setting.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-0015-2; POD:978-1-4799-0014-5; USB:978-1-4799-0013-8","10.1109/ICME.2013.6607520","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6607520","TV synchronization;audio fingerprinting;broadcast;information retrieval;second screen;streaming media","Abstracts;Fingerprint recognition;Iron","acoustic distortion;audio signal processing;fingerprint identification;information retrieval;reverberation;time-frequency analysis","audio fingerprinting;audio signal recording;broadcast program;content identification;exogenous noise distortion;pseudo-sinusoidal component distribution;reverberation;second-screen service;sinusoidality quantification;time-frequency domain","","3","","10","","","15-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to exploit this information can be potentially useful for several tasks. For example, when querying ""Football World Cup Germany"", it would be interesting to have two separate clusters {1974,2006} corresponding to each of the two temporal instances. However, clustering of search results by time is a non-trivial task that involves determining the most relevant dates associated to a query. In this paper, we propose a first approach to flat temporal clustering of search results. We rely on a second order co-occurrence similarity measure approach which first identifies top relevant dates. Documents are grouped at the year level, forming the temporal instances of the query. Experimental tests were performed using real-world text queries. We used several measures for evaluating the performance of the system and compared our approach with Carrot Web-snippet clustering engine.

Manual bug localization is labor intensive since developers must consider thousands of source code entities. Current research builds bug localization classifiers, based on information retrieval models, to locate entities that are textually similar to the bug report. Current research, however, does not consider the effect of classifier configuration, i.e., all the parameter values that specify the behavior of a classifier. As such, the effect of each parameter or which parameter values lead to the best performance is unknown. In this paper, we empirically investigate the effectiveness of a large space of classifier configurations, 3,172 in total. Further, we introduce a framework for combining the results of multiple classifier configurations since classifier combination has shown promise in other domains. Through a detailed case study on over 8,000 bug reports from three large-scale projects, we make two main contributions. First, we show that the parameters of a classifier have a significant impact on its performance. Second, we show that combining multiple classifiers--whether those classifiers are hand-picked or randomly chosen relative to intelligently defined subspaces of classifiers--improves the performance of even the best individual classifiers.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2013.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6520844","LDA;LSI;Software maintenance;VSM;bug localization;classifier combination;information retrieval","Indexes;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Measurement;Resource management;Vectors","information retrieval;pattern classification;program debugging","bug localization classifiers;bug report;classifier combination;classifier configuration;classifier parameter;information retrieval models;parameter value;source code entity determination","","18","","62","","20130527","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we focus on the ERF in which Feedback information is given. With regards to the lack of information in ERF, we apply Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF) to enhance retrieval effectiveness. However, the instability of PRF can result in a negative impact on retrieval performance. We use feedback information to define features and propose a classification model to predict which query can benefit from PRF. Then, we form relevance feedback fusion by the prediction of PRF performance. This method is designed to exploit the strengths of PRF and ERF while avoiding some weaknesses of these approaches.

A major drawback is, whenever a new extraction goal emerges or a module is improved, extraction has to be reapplied from scratch to the entire text corpus even though a small part of corpus might be affected. By using database queries, information extraction enables the generic extraction and minimizes re-processing of data. Furthermore, this provides automated query generation components so that, casual users no need to learn the query language in order to perform extraction. To demonstrate the feasibility of our incremental extraction approach, experiments can be performed to highlight two important aspects of an information extraction system: efficiency and quality of extraction results. The existing extraction frameworks do not provide the capabilities of managing intermediate processed data such as parse trees and information. It is also extended to per-sentence extraction, it is important to notice that the query language itself is capable of defining patterns across multiple sentences.

Forums organized and moderated by topics of discussion tend to host messages on related subjects and, overall, provide a classification of message threads which eases information search. In this paper we propose a semi-automatic approach to detect topics of discussion in a forum and to enhance its organization by providing a hierarchical topic-driven navigation view on its messages. We adopt Information Retrieval (IR) techniques, such as topic modeling, and formal concept analysis (FCA) to identify discussion topics and to provide a hierarchical topic-centered view on messages. We tested the validity of our approach on four forums of the e-learning platform of an Italian distance-learning university which provides around 20 moderated and unmoderated main forums followed actively by almost 5000 users, including students and teachers, each year.

Since the resulting audio classification and indexing is meant for direct human consumption, it is highly desirable that it produces perceptually relevant results. This can be obtained by integrating specific knowledge of the human auditory system in the design process to various extent. In this paper, we highlight some of the important concepts used in audio classification and indexing that are perceptually motivated or that exploit some principles of perception. In particular, we discuss several different strategies to integrate human perception, including: 1) the use of generic audition models; 2) the use of perceptually relevant features for the analysis stage that are perceptually justified either as a component of a hearing model or as being correlated with a perceptual dimension of sound similarity; and 3) the involvement of the user in the audio indexing or classification task. In this paper, we also illustrate some of the recent trends in semantic audio retrieval that approximate higher level perceptual processing and cognitive aspects of human audio recognition capabilities, including affect-based audio retrieval.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2013.2251591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6560388","Affect-based audio retrieval;audio classification;audio indexing;music indexing;music information retrieval;musical timbre recognition;perceptual audio features;perceptual signal representations;semantic audio retrieval","Acoustics;Auditory system;Filter banks;Frequency modulation;Indexing;Labeling;Time-frequency analysis","audio signal processing;cognition;indexing;information retrieval;pattern classification","acoustic events;affect-based audio retrieval;approximate higher level perceptual processing;cognitive aspects;direct human consumption;generic audition models;human audio recognition capabilities;human auditory system;perceptually motivated audio classification;perceptually motivated audio indexing;perceptually relevant features","","4","","138","","20130716","Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

CF tries to predict the user's rating on an unseen item based on other similar users' ratings. Computing similarity between users is dominantly carried out using correlation methods such as the Pearson correlation coefficient. These methods compute similarity only based on co-rated items. Due to sparsity of rating data, it is probable for similarity values to be computed based on only few co-rated items. These values do not necessarily reflect real users' preferences. In other words, they are insignificant. As earlier studies suggest, the weight of these values should be decreased. In this paper, we show that it is insufficient to consider cases where there are only few co-rated items. We propose an enhanced approach, which modifies the similarity weights in all cases proportionally to the number of co-rated items. Experimental results show that our proposed approach substantially improves the prediction performance compared with previous studies. Parameter independency is another improvement of this approach, which makes it easy to use.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2073-3; POD:978-1-4673-2072-6","10.1109/ISTEL.2012.6483164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6483164","Collaborative filtering;Information Retrieval;Recommender system;Significance weighting","Collaboration;Correlation;Equations;Recommender systems;Upper bound","collaborative filtering;recommender systems","Pearson correlation coefficient;collaborative filtering;rating prediction;recommender system;similarity computation;weighting approach","","0","","9","","","6-8 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So as the need for knowledge is trending, importance of knowledgebase is also growing. To create new knowledgebase, it is necessary that previous data should also be retained. Therefore transformation of a Database into a Knowledgebase is of equal importance, as a database or a knowledgebase have. Also it should be transformed in an effective manner, so that information content from database should not be lost. In this paper, we will discuss some method & technique to transform a database into a knowledgebase, so that it provides more value to the organization.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5986-3; POD:978-1-4673-5987-0","10.1109/ICISCON.2013.6524170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6524170","Data Sanitization;Database;Information Retrieval;Information base;Knowledgebase","Clustering algorithms;Databases;Encyclopedias;Filling;Mathematical model;Organizations;Standards organizations","database management systems;information retrieval;information technology;knowledge based systems","DB2KB;IT infrastructure;database;knowledgebase","","0","","7","","","9-10 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These improved approaches do not rely on a linearity assumption, and are hence capable of discovering more complex embeddings within different regions of the data sets. Despite their success on artificial datasets, it is not straightforward to predict which technique is the most appropriate for a given real dataset. In this paper, we empirically evaluate recent techniques on two real audio use cases: musical instrument loops used in music production and sound effects used in sound editing. ISOMAP and t-SNE are being compared to PCA in a visualization problem, where we end up with a two-dimensional view. Various evaluation measures are used: classification performance, as well as trustworthiness/continuity assessing the preservation of neighborhoods. Although PCA and ISOMAP can yield good continuity performance even locally (samples in the original space remain close-by in the low-dimensional one), they fail to preserve the structure of the data well enough to ensure that distinct subgroups remain separate in the visualization. We show that t-SNE presents the best performance, and can even be beneficial as a pre-processing stage for improving classification when the amount of labeled data is low.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-0015-2; POD:978-1-4799-0014-5; USB:978-1-4799-0013-8","10.1109/ICME.2013.6607550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6607550","Dimensionality reduction;audio and music analysis;multimedia information retrieval","Databases;Instruments;Manifolds;Measurement;Music;Principal component analysis;Standards","audio signal processing;information retrieval;multimedia computing;music;musical instruments;principal component analysis","ISOMAP;LDA;PCA;artificial datasets;classification performance;complex embeddings;continuity performance;linearity assumption;music production;musical instrument loops;nonlinear dimensionality reduction;real audio use cases;sound editing;sound effects;t-SNE;textural sounds;visualization problem","","1","","15","","","15-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model in community identification, two metrics were proposed: local and global performance. As a main result of experimentation, different uses for the model were found by combining the possible values for the local and global metrics. Such uses are the identification of new communities, identification of existing communities, expansion of existing communities, and the identification of teams. One of the main benefits of the model is providing an architectural pattern for developing this kind of application. Future works include the elimination of some manual steps in order to analyze larger communities than those observed ones; to look for other clues in e-texts and other types of resources that can help in identifying members of a community, make a temporal analysis of communities what can provide important information on the intellectual capital of an organization.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6085-2; POD:978-1-4673-6084-5","10.1109/CSCWD.2013.6580973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6580973","Abstract Model;Groups;Information Retrieval;Teams and community identification","Abstracts;Atmospheric measurements;Communities;Computational modeling;Context;Organizations;Vectors","groupware","AMACI;abstract computational model of awareness for community identification;architectural pattern;community identification;global metrics;identifying potential communities;identifying potential teams;intellectual capital;local metrics","","0","","26","","","27-29 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, despite its technical advances, cloud computing introduces many new security challenges that need to be addressed well. This is because, data owners, under such new setting, loss the control over their sensitive data. To keep the confidentiality of their sensitive data, data owners usually outsource the encrypted format of their data to the untrusted cloud servers. Several approaches have been provided to enable searching the encrypted data. However, the majority of these approaches are limited to handle either a single keyword search or a Boolean search but not a multikeyword ranked search, a more efficient model to retrieve the top documents corresponding to the provided keywords. In this paper, we propose a secure multi-keyword ranked search scheme over the encrypted cloud data. Such scheme allows an authorized user to retrieve the most relevant documents in a descending order, while preserving the privacy of his search request and the contents of documents he retrieved. To do so, data owner builds his searchable index, and associates with each term document with a relevance score, which facilitates document ranking. The proposed scheme uses two distinct cloud servers, one for storing the secure index, while the other is used to store the encrypted document collection. Such new setting prevents leaking the search result, i.e. the document identifiers, to the adversary cloud servers. We have conducted several empirical analyses on a real dataset to demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4897-5; POD:978-1-4673-4825-6","10.1109/APSCC.2012.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6478225","Bloom filter;Cloud computing;Paillier encryption;information retrieval;searchable encryption","Cloud computing;Encryption;Indexes;Privacy;Servers","authorisation;cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;document handling","Boolean search;Internet technology;cloud computing;data management service;data owner;document identifier;document ranking;empirical analysis;encrypted cloud data;multikeyword ranked search;multikeyword trapdoor;privacy preservation;search request;secure rank-ordered search;sensitive data confidentiality;sensitive data control;single keyword search;user authorization","","5","","18","","","6-8 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most existing methods need offline analysis of the whole tagged corpus, which is computationally expensive and cannot fit specific queries well. In this paper, we propose to use tags for document re-ranking. Specifically, we first estimate document similarity by combining words and tags and then adjust the document ranks with the assumption that similar documents should have similar retrieval scores. On similarity estimation, we present a new feature extraction method, called CRMF, from which document similarity can be derived. The CRMF can integrate the content and relation properties of multiple views and mine their correspondence. Besides, it does not require that all the documents to have tags. We tested the proposed approach on collections which are derived from Clue Web and contain Delicious tags.

China","2013 Proceedings IEEE INFOCOM","20130725","2013","","","2751","2759","Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is regarded as a promising way to address the increasing demand for wireless channel resources. It solves the channel resource shortage problem by allowing a Secondary User (SU) to access the channel of a Primary User (PU) when the channel is not occupied by the PU. The latest FCC's rule in May 2012 enforces database-driven CRNs, in which an SU queries a database to obtain spectrum availability information by submitting a location based query. However, one concern about database-driven CRNs is that the queries sent by SUs will inevitably leak the location information. In this study, we identify a new kind of attack against location privacy of database-drive CRNs. Instead of directly learning the SUs' locations from their queries, our discovered attacks can infer an SU's location through his used channels. We propose Spectrum Utilization based Location Inferring Algorithm that enables the attacker to geo-locate an SU. To thwart location privacy leaking from query process, we propose a novel Private Spectrum Availability Information Retrieval scheme that utilizes a blind factor to hide the location of the SU. To defend against the discovered attack, we propose a novel prediction based Private Channel Utilization protocol that reduces the possibilities of location privacy leaking by choosing the most stable channels. We implement our discovered attack and proposed scheme on the data extracted from Google Earth Coverage Maps released by FCC. Experiment results show that the proposed protocols can significantly improve the location privacy.","0743-166X;0743166X","Electronic:978-1-4673-5946-7; POD:978-1-4673-5944-3","10.1109/INFCOM.2013.6567084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567084","Location Privacy;Private Information Retrieval;database-driven Cognitive Radio Network","Availability;Data privacy;Databases;Privacy;Protocols;Vectors;Wireless communication","cognitive radio;data privacy;protocols;query processing;radio spectrum management;telecommunication security;wireless channels","FCC;Google Earth Coverage Maps;PU channel access;SU location;attack identification;blind factor;channel resource shortage problem;database queries;database-driven CRN;database-driven cognitive radio networks;location inferring algorithm;location privacy improvement;location privacy leakage possibility reduction;location-based query submission;prediction-based private channel utilization protocol;primary user;private spectrum availability information retrieval scheme;secondary user;spectrum availability information;spectrum utilization;wireless channel resources","","28","","15","","","14-19 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Motivated with the presence of this information, in a number of open source projects, an approach to recommend expert developers to assist with a software change request (e.g., a bug fixes or feature) is presented. It employs a combination of an information retrieval technique and processing of the source code authorship information. The relevant source code files to the textual description of a change request are first located. The authors listed in the header comments in these files are then analyzed to arrive at a ranked list of the most suitable developers. The approach fundamentally differs from its previously reported counterparts, as it does not require software repository mining. Neither does it require training from past bugs/issues, which is often done with sophisticated techniques such as machine learning, nor mining of source code repositories, i.e., commits. An empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach on three open source systems, ArgoUML, JEdit, and MuCommander, is reported. Our approach is compared with two representative approaches: (1) using machine learning on past bug reports, and (2) based on commit logs. The presented approach is found to provide recommendation accuracies that are equivalent or better than the two compared approaches.

The preparation plans for the Rio 2016 event should be carefully prepared and depend mostly on the ideas generated by specialists. However, this is not feasible, as most of the problems addressed in this kind of event are unique and should be a mix of old experiences and new ideas. The premise that many people are eager to contribute by sending new ideas and collaborating is not true and new approaches should be tried. Although many of the steps in the process will be discussed, this paper will concentrate on the definition of the Prospective Scenarios considered as the most appropriate for the use of the Large Group concepts.

Using acoustic features of the music, they align the live performance with that of a previously time-stamped recording. The aligned position is transmitted to an application on the users' handheld devices, which present the annotations using an intuitive and unobtrusive interface.

The TFC model consists of three distinctive steps, in each of which important innovative elements are proposed. More specifically, through its first step, the content information is exploited to propagate tags between conceptual similar items based on a relevance feedback mechanism, in order to solve sparsity and “cold start” problems. Through its second step, sparsity is further handled, by generating tag clusters and revealing topics, following an innovative <i>tf</i> ·<i>idf</i> weighting scheme. Furthermore, we experimentally prove that a few number of expert tags can improve the performance of quality recommendations, since they contribute to more coherent tag clusters. Through its third step, the latent associations among users, topics, and items are revealed by exploiting the TF technique of high order singular value decomposition. This way the proposed TFC model tackles problems of real-world applications, which produce noise and decrease the quality of recommendations. In our experiments with real-world social data, we show that the proposed TFC model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, which also exploit the TF technique of HOSVD.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2208186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301770","Content based information retrieval;expert tagging;recommender systems;relevance feedback;social tagging","Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Image color analysis;Recommender systems;Tagging;Tensile stress;Vectors","pattern clustering;singular value decomposition;social networking (online);tensors","TFC model;content information;innovative elements;item recommendation;quality recommendations;relevance feedback mechanism;singular value decomposition;social tagging systems;tensor factorization and tag clustering","","5","1","57","","20120912","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Classical methodological solutions proposed to cope with these issues, typically based on mathematical transforms, are characterized by strong limitations, such as a difficult interpretation of retrieval results for end users, reduced flexibility and interactivity, or inefficiency. In this paper, we describe a novel framework, in which time-series features are summarized by means of Temporal Abstractions, and then retrieved resorting to abstraction similarity. Our approach grants for interpretability of the output results, and understandability of the (user-guided) retrieval process. In particular, multilevel abstraction mechanisms and proper indexing techniques are provided, for flexible query issuing, and efficient and interactive query answering.

However, these systems rely on consistent user interaction patterns to predict items of interest. In contrast, we propose to adapt the classical information retrieval (IR) paradigm for the purpose of accessing catalog items in a context of un-predictable user interaction. Accordingly, we present a novel information access strategy based on the notion of interest rather than relevance. We detail the design of a scalable browsing system including learning capabilities joint with a limited-memory model. Our approach enables locating interesting items within a few steps while not requiring good quality descriptions. Our system allows customer to seamlessly change browsing objectives without having to start explicitly a new session.

However, it remains a challenging problem to quantify these two conditions. In this paper, we investigate these issues using live TREC datasets, TREC 2-6 (1993-97). Six systems in each dataset are selected either by random choice or by precision. We then compare performance of combining these six systems selected by random v.s. by precision from each of these datasets. It is demonstrated that, in each of the live datasets, the sum of x + y for positive cases (performance of combination of A and B is better than or equal to the individual systems) is larger than for negative cases (other than positive cases), where x is the performance ratio P<sub>l</sub>/P<sub>h</sub> and y is the diversity (between A and B), both normalized to [0, 1].

One of the key challenges in data-intensive science is development of enabling technologies to allow researchers to effectively utilize these large volumes of data in an effective manner. This paper introduces the concept of “data prospecting” to address the challenges of data intensive science. With data prospecting, we extend the familiar metaphor of data mining to describe an initial phase of data exploration used to determine promising areas for deeper analysis. Data prospecting enhances data selection through the use of interactive discovery engines. Interactive exploration enables a researcher to filter the data based on the “first look” analytics, discover interesting and previously unknown patterns to start new science investigations, verify the quality of the data, and corroborate whether patterns in the data match existing science theories or mental models. This paper describes our initial evaluation of the value of“data prospecting” to Earth Science researchers as part of their research process.

With the purpose of overcoming the pitfalls of the existing approaches, we have proposed architecture of semantic information retrieval to enhance the relevancy of search results. An algorithm is proposed to compute the rank of the documents and then semantic indexing is being performed by these ranked web pages. In our algorithm, we are considering the two factors for calculating the page rank; one is the frequency of the keyword occurred in the web page and another is associative factor of the same keyword with the meaningful interrogative words which are generally ignored by the existing search schemes.

Early tools reused the static analysis performed by the compiler. These were followed by dynamic analysis tools and more recently tools that exploit natural language. This later class has the advantage that it can incorporate not only the code, but artifacts from all phases of software construction and its subsequent evolution. Unfortunately, the natural language found in source code often uses a vocabulary different from that used in other software artifacts and thus increases the vocabulary mismatch problem. This problem exists because many natural-language tools imported from Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) implicitly assume the use of a single natural language vocabulary. Vocabulary normalization, which goes well beyond simple identifier splitting, brings the vocabulary of the source into line with other artifacts. Consequently, it is expected to improve the performance of existing and future IR and NLP based tools. As a case study, an experiment with an LSI-based feature locator is replicated.

"Automatic spell checker for Malay blog","S. B. Basri; R. Alfred; C. K.

Misspelled word is a word that exists in the existing lexicon that is not correctly spelled or in shortened form. These misspelled words often result in ineffective results of the Information Retrieval (IR) application such as document retrieval. This is because IR application should be able to recognize all words in a particular language in order to be more robust. The current spell checker for the Malay language uses a dictionary that contains pair of commonly misspelled word and its correctly spelled word in detecting and correcting misspelled word. However, this type of spell checker can only correct misspelled words that exist in the existing dictionary; otherwise it requires user interaction to correct it manually. This approach works well if the spell checker is a standalone system but it is not really an effective system when the spell checker is part of another IR application such as document retrieval for weblog. This is because there will be always new misspelled words created along with the increasing number of weblog pages. Thus, the number of misspelled words will also grow extremely. In this paper, we propose a new spell checker that detects and automatically corrects misspelled words in Malay without any interaction from the user. The proposed approach automatically replaces the misspelled word if it exists in the reSpellWord dictionary. Otherwise, it will go through the process of Selangor Slang Identification or Repetitive word Identification or Opposite Word Identification whichever is suitable. If the word cannot be identified as a misspelled word, a few alternative words will be suggested and they are ranked using the Levenshtein Distance in order to choose the most likelihood word for the misspelled word. The correctly-spelled word that has the highest ranking will be chosen as a replacement for the misspelled word. This misspelled word and its correctly-spelled word- are then added automatically into the dictionary in order to update the dictionary. The proposed approach is evaluated by using texts that are selected randomly from the popular Malay blog. Based on the experimental results obtained, the proposed approach is found to be effective in detecting and correcting the Malay misspelled word automatically.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-3143-2; POD:978-1-4673-3142-5","10.1109/ICCSCE.2012.6487198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487198","Malay weblog;information retrieval;misspelled word;spell checker","","Web sites;information retrieval;natural language processing","IR application;Levenshtein distance;Malay blog;Malay language;Selangor slang identification;document retrieval;information retrieval application;opposite word identification;repetitive word identification;spell checker;user interaction;weblog","","1","","15","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even when metadata are available, query results may remain far from the timbre expected by users. This problem stems from the nature of query specification, which does not account for the underlying complexity of audio data. The Query By Example (QBE) paradigm tries to tackle this shortcoming by finding audio clips similar to a given sound example. However, it requires users to have a well-formed soundfile of what they seek, which is not always a valid assumption. Furthermore, most audio-retrieval systems rely on a single measure of similarity, which is unlikely to convey the perceptual similarity of audio signals. We address in this paper an innovative way of querying generic audio databases by simultaneously optimizing the temporal evolution of multiple spectral properties. We show how this problem can be cast into a new approach merging multiobjective optimization and time series matching, called MultiObjective Time Series (MOTS) matching. We formally state this problem and report an efficient implementation. This approach introduces a multidimensional assessment of similarity in audio matching. This allows to cope with the multidimensional nature of timbre perception and also to obtain a set of efficient propositions rather than a single best solution. To demonstrate the performances of our approach, we show its efficiency in audio classification tasks. By introducing a selection criterion based on the hypervolume dominated by a class, we show that our approach outstands the state-of-art methods in audio classification even with a few number of features. We demonstrate its robustness to several classes of audio distortions. Finally, we introduce two innovative applications of our method for sound querying.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2013.2265086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6521366","Audio databases;Pareto optimization;classification algorithms;content-based retrieval;data mining;data structures;indexing;multimedia databases;music information retrieval;pattern matching;query processing;time series analysis","","Pareto optimisation;audio databases;audio signal processing;content-based retrieval;pattern classification;pattern matching;query processing;time series","MOTS matching;Pareto optimization;QBE paradigm;audio classification tasks;audio clips;audio data complexity;audio distortions;audio matching;audio retrieval systems;audio signals;content-based retrieval;generic audio database querying;metadata;multiobjective optimization approach;multiobjective time series matching;multiple spectral property;query by example;query specification;selection criterion;sound file;sound querying;timbre perception","","2","","88","","20130529","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Preliminary results showed an average of 86% accuracy for average relative frequency bin coefficients.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-3143-2; POD:978-1-4673-3142-5","10.1109/ICCSCE.2012.6487126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487126","Support vector machine;information retrieval;machine learning;relative frequency bin coefficients","","audio signal processing;emotion recognition;feature extraction;pattern classification;radial basis function networks;signal classification;speech processing;support vector machines","audio data;audio domain;average relative amplitude features;average relative bin frequency coefficient extraction;emotion detection;emotion identification system;frequency domain;human speech;noiseless signal;noisy environment;pattern classification;radial basis kernel;support vector machine","","0","","12","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the time the problem is caused by poor query formulation. This paper examines the effectiveness of the query word “durian” and its thesaurus as benchmark terms versus query formulation based on the characteristics of durian. Findings shows that using characteristic of durian in query formulation significantly improved the effectiveness of the query.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5160-7; POD:978-1-4673-5158-4","10.1109/SCOReD.2012.6518611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6518611","characteristics;durian;effectiveness;information retrieval;query formulation","","Internet;crops;query processing;thesauri","Web;benchmark terms;durian characteristics;information retrieval;query formulation;thesaurus","","2","","27","","","5-6 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It includes a complex metadata extraction system capable of extracting elements, such as author name, title, citations and citation contexts that are crucial bibliometric data and for building a citation graph. The workload faced by the exractor is dynamic in nature and this variability makes CiteSeer<sup>x</sup> attractive for hosting in a cloud computing environment. Given its application binary dependencies and its reliance on a specialized infrastructure, the current extractor has several limitations. These limitations motivated the design and implementation of the metadata extraction system proposed in this study. A message oriented middleware architecture is used with a publish/subscribe pattern to build a scalable, flexible system that can be deployed across a range of cloud infrastructure. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed system, we evaluate it in terms of its reference implementation across different scenarios of deployment and in regard to its scalability.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4945-3; POD:978-1-4673-6473-7","10.1109/IC2E.2013.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529279","Cloud Computing;Information Extraction;Information Retrieval;Message Oriented Middleware","Context;Crawlers;Data mining;Feature extraction;Message-oriented middleware;Portable document format","citation analysis;cloud computing;digital libraries;meta data;middleware;search engines","CiteSeer<sup>x</sup>;SeerSuite digital library search engine framework;application binary dependencies;bibliometric data;citation graph;cloud computing environment;complex metadata extraction system;message oriented middleware architecture;publish-subscribe pattern","","1","","26","","","25-27 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
