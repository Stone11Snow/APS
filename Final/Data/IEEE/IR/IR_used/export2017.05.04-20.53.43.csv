DHT has not only been applied to form user nodes' overlays, but also been proposed to form DHT-based server farms, such as DHT-based SIP server farm, HSS server farm, DNS server farm, CDN server farm, etc. However, seldom DHT algorithms consider server farm's stringent requirement on system capacity, and only a handful of DHT algorithms take server into consideration. This paper presents our DHT algorithm called SFDHT for high throughput DHT server farm. Compared with existing DHTs, SFDHT considers the characters and requirements of DHT server farm and maximizes system capacity. SFDHT is a one-hop DHT with novel built-in load balancing solution. The proposed load balancing solution produces much less overhead that existing solutions do.

"Automatic identification of specular detections in multistatic sonar systems","D. J. Grimmett","SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific, 53560 Hull Street San Diego CA 92152-5000 USA","OCEANS 2009","20100301","2009","","","1","10","Multistatic systems have the potential to provide increased ASW performance. However, effective fusion and tracking of multistatic active sonar contacts is challenging, due to high levels of false alarm clutter present on all sonar nodes. Such false alarms often overload the sensor-to-fusion-center communications links and fusion/tracking processes, thereby producing too many false tracks. A system concept referred to as Specular-Cued Surveillance Web (SPECSweb) has the potential to solve this overloading problem. This is done through the exploitation of very strong specular echoes from targets operating within a geometrically diverse sensor field. The strong specular echoes are used as cues for track initiation and track holding through selective extraction of additional detections stored locally on the individual sonar nodes. This approach significantly reduces the data rate at the input to the fusion/tracking algorithm, and reduces node-to-fusion-center communication link throughput requirements. A SPECSweb information fusion and target tracking algorithm has been designed, which has shown to be effectively in providing this unloading. Previously, the identification of specular detections was made by simply setting a higher-than-normal SNR detection threshold at the tracker input. This paper presents an alternate approach for detecting specular echoes, which is based on the identification of amplitude changes in the detection levels corresponding to a target passing through the specular geometric condition. The approach is data-adaptive and more robust that the method used previously. The algorithm is described and factors important for parameter value selection are discussed. The proposed identification scheme is applied to multistatic data, showing its effectiveness.","0197-7385;01977385","CD:978-0-933957-38-1; Paper:978-1-4244-4960-6","10.23919/OCEANS.2009.5422064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5422064","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Information retrieval;Oceans;Robustness;Sonar detection;Surveillance;Target tracking;Throughput;Underwater vehicles","clutter;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic techniques;sensor fusion;sonar tracking;target tracking","ASW performance;SPECSweb information fusion;Specular-Cued Surveillance Web;data-adaptive approach;false alarm clutter;fusion-tracking algorithm;higher-than-normal SNR detection threshold;multistage sonar systems;multistatic active sonar contacts;sensor-to-fusion-center communications links;sonar nodes;specular detections;specular echoes;target tracking algorithm;track holding;track initiation","","0","","14","","","26-29 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several methods have been proposed to retrieve these two parameters from hyperspectral data, some of which are based on the spectral smoothness of emissivity. To analyze the sensitivity of those methods to various measurement errors, hyperspectral TIR data are first simulated using radiative transfer model 4A/OP (Operational Release for Automatized Atmospheric Absorption Atlas) with different atmospheric profiles and surface parameters, and then the sensitivity of the Downwelling Radiance Residual Index method to different sources of error is analyzed. In terms of resulting errors in LST, results show that: 1) the method is not very sensitive to the uncertainties of atmosphere. An error of 1.47 g/cm<sup>2</sup> on water vapor content for a sub-arctic summer atmosphere (2.1 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) only leads to an error of 1.8 K for rock2 (the worst case). 2) Satisfactory results are obtained by this method over heterogeneous land surface.

High spectral resolution lidars (HSRL) now facilitate unambiguous, direct measurement of aerosol extinction and backscatter profiles, greatly augmenting the level of information available for determining aerosol type or other relevant parameters. In this paper, we explore a methodology for using HSRL data at one wavelength to facilitate retrievals from traditional elastic scatter data at other wavelengths. Further, we extend the scope of the technique to improving aerosol models used to constrain retrievals from multi-wavelength elastic scatter lidars.

Link quality estimation algorithms are used to retrieve information about the link quality, which is evaluated to choose the best available path. Concurrently, recent work has revealed severe inaccuracies in link quality estimations provided by modern short-range wireless devices. The sensitivity of routing protocols to such errors in the estimation of the link quality has not been considered so far. In this paper, we define two main classes of link quality-based routing metrics and examine these classes. We present a method to estimate the sensitivity of routing metrics to link quality estimation errors and confirm this method by simulations. Some routing metrics are surprisingly strong influenced by estimation errors. This finding questions the applicability of these protocols in large-scale networks and necessitates that the impact of link quality estimation errors is explicitly regarded in future developments of link-quality-based routing metrics to create more robust metrics. Our proposed method to estimate the sensitivity of routing metrics on link quality estimation errors shows to be helpful here.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-3516-6; POD:978-1-4244-3517-3","10.1109/ISSNIP.2009.5416804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5416804","","Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Estimation error;Information retrieval;Instruments;Large-scale systems;Robustness;Routing protocols;Taylor series;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","large-scale networks;link quality estimation errors;link quality-based routing protocols;modern short-range wireless devices;routing metrics;wireless sensor networks","","3","","19","","","7-10 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper a weighted similarity measurement approach for detecting the similarity between the homogeneous XML documents is suggested. Using this similarity measurement a new clustering technique is also proposed. The method of calculating similarity of document's structure and styling is given by number of researchers, mostly which are based on tree edit distances. And for calculating the distance between document's contents there are number of text and other similarity techniques like cosine, jaccord, tf-idf etc. In this paper both of the similarity techniques are combined to propose a new distance measurement technique for calculating the distance between a pair of homogeneous XML documents. The proposed clustering model is implemened using open source technology java and is validated experimentally.

As the at-sensor radiances are dependent on both the land surface parameters (temperature and emissivity) and atmospheric conditions, it is difficult to simultaneously retrieve these parameters with a high accuracy from multi-spectral radiances measured at satellite level. However, some studies have recently shown that hyperspectral thermal infrared data could be used to derive these parameters simultaneously from space. This paper tries to explore the possibilities to recover with an acceptable accuracy both the geophysical properties and the atmospheric parameters from the hyperspectral thermal infrared data using the neural network technique. The results show that the land surface temperature can be obtained with a RMSE=0.24 K and the atmospheric profiles can also be retrieved with relatively high accuracy.

Color histogram is the most commonly used color feature and has proved to be stable representation of an image, but it might be similar in different kinds of images because it describe the global intensity distribution of images. Inspired by human image classification behavior, in this paper, a new color feature representation method called order-based block color feature (OBCF) and its application in image retrieval is proposed. Firstly, RGB values of an image were transferred to HSI values. Secondly, each color channel (H, S and I) of an image is divided into M X N blocks and then statistical values are computed to characterize the block's color features. Thirdly, block features of the same statistical value in the same row are sorted in ascending order to form a row's features. Finally, all row features are concatenated to form an image's color feature. The experimental results show that the OBCF method provides high retrieval accuracy compared with color histogram method.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4775-6; POD:978-1-4244-4774-9","10.1109/ROBIO.2009.5420542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420542","","Color;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Humans;Image classification;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval","image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;statistical analysis","HSI color space;color feature representation method;histogram method;human image classification behavior;human-inspired order-based block feature;image color descriptor;image intensity distribution;image processing;image representation;image retrieval;order-based block color feature;statistical value","","1","","13","","","19-23 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A rare Earth material filter with a set of well-known absorption features is imaged through the IFC on APEX and recorded at several time positions. The shift of the center wavelengths covered by a spectral feature is estimated by means of curve matching algorithms. Two algorithms are evaluated: in the former the shift is determined by using the correlation coefficient as merit function to determine changes of the feature shape and position, while the latter evaluates the distance between centers of gravity. These methods have demonstrated an uncertainty in the order of 6-9 % of a pixel. A test case has been designed in which the APEX system was exposed to a temperature profile with a thermal excursion of 26Â°C, reproducing flight conditions.

Because of the low redundancy, few lossless compression methods have been applied in the research. Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) coding is a well-known lossless compression algorithm that is simple and does not require prior analysis of the source or send extra information to the decoder. In this paper, we propose a high-capacity data-hiding LZW (HCDH-LZW) method that hides data in LZW compression codes reversibly by shrinking the symbol length. The hiding scheme increases capacity for the number of symbols available to hide secrets but also the capacity of each symbol.

An advantage of ACs is that they are rule-based and thus lend themselves to an easier interpretation. However, it is common knowledge that association rule mining typically yields a sheer number of rules defeating the purpose of a human readable model. Hence, selecting and ranking a small subset of high-quality rules without jeopardizing the classification accuracy is paramount. This article introduces a new method for building associative classifier. In this method, only association rules based on closed itemsets are used for constructing classifier. Furthermore, certainty factor is used for ranking rules in classifier.

In many cases data is distributed, and bringing the data together in one place for analysis is not possible due to privacy laws (e.g. HIPAA) or policies. Privacy preserving data mining techniques have been developed to address this issue by providing mechanisms to mine the data while giving certain privacy guarantees. However, when these techniques are built on cryptographic primitives, while providing strong privacy, they are often too inefficient to be used in practical settings. To this end, we address the problem of efficiency by investigating trade-offs that can be made in the trust model. By making reasonable concessions in the trust model, that is, by adding a non-collaborative third party, we can achieve great gains in efficiency. We show this by creating a novel protocol for privately computing dot product, a foundational primitive for many private data mining activities. We also investigate how to extend our protocol in the case when a third party cannot be completely trusted by both participating parties, thus reducing the amount of trust needed in the third party. We then show experimentally the gains in efficiency that can be realized in the computation of the private dot product using this model.","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:978-1-4244-5510-2; POD:978-1-4244-5509-6","10.1109/HICSS.2010.172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5428669","","Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;Data privacy;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Protection;Protocols;Public key cryptography;Statistical analysis","cryptography;data mining;data privacy","cryptographic primitives;privacy preserving data mining techniques;private dot product;trust model","","5","","49","","","5-8 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many algorithms in literature require active measurements and are based on a single-sender multiple-receivers scheme, thus relying on the cooperation of a possibly wide number of nodes, which is a quite strong assumption. Moreover, many previous works adopt Expectation-Maximization algorithms to cope with large and under-determined equation systems, thus increasing the uncertainty of the final delay estimation. This paper, instead, proposes a technique to infer the cumulants of the delay distribution over each link of a given network path, based on two-points measurements only. The cumulants, in turn, can be used to approximate the distribution function through the Edgeworth series. The results of our approach are assessed through a wide series of model-based and ns2 based simulations and show fairly good performance under different network load conditions.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4244-4148-8; POD:978-1-4244-4147-1; POD:978-1-4244-4148-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425672","","Delay estimation;Design engineering;Distribution functions;Equations;Expectation-maximization algorithms;Information retrieval;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","delay estimation;interference (signal);queueing theory;series (mathematics)","Edgeworth series;delay distribution;distribution function;end-to-end inference;link level queueing delay statistics;single sender multiple receiver","","1","","16","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data de-duplication can eliminate multiple copies of the same file and duplicated segments or chunks of data within those files. In these days, therefore, data de-duplication becomes an interesting field in storage environments especially in persistent data storage for data centers. Many data deduplication mechanisms have been proposed for efficient data deduplication in order to safe storage space. Current issue for data deduplication is to avoid full-chunk indexing to identify the incoming data is new, which is time consuming process. In this paper, we propose an efficient indexing mechanism for this problem using the advantage of B+ tree properties. In our proposed system, we will first separate the file into variable-length chunks using Two Thresholds Two Divisors chunking algorithm. ChunkIDs are then obtained by applying hash function to the chunks. The resulted ChunkIDs are used to build as indexing keys in B+ tree like index structure. So the searching time for the duplicate file chunks reduces from O (n) to O (log n), which can avoid the risk of full chunk indexing.","2377-5327;23775327","Electronic:978-1-4244-5757-1; POD:978-1-4244-5754-0","10.1109/CTIT.2009.5423123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5423123","b+ tree;data deduplication;indexing","Cryptography;Indexing;Information retrieval;Law;Legal factors;Mechanical factors;Memory;Redundancy;Secure storage;Tin","data handling;indexing;tree data structures","B+ tree property;ChunklD;data deduplication;hash function;indexing mechanism;multiple copies elimination;redundant data;storage system;two thresholds two divisors chunking algorithm;variable length chunk","","6","10","17","","","15-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, Gaussian model was used to simulate daily crop LAI to get average LAI at each growth stage. Using these average LAI, the authors established relationships between LAI and yield of winter wheat at main growth stage. After optimization of yield estimation model, the best period of time and best model was selected out. Finally, the authors depended on retrieved LAI from MODIS-NDVI to estimate winter wheat yield.

The results suggest that successful usage may emphasize stationary capture relatively more than moving scenes, and may emphasize recording of full scenes rather than recording outwardly from the body of what one has seen.

In order to have detailed information on both spatial distribution of water constituents and their temporal variability, that is especially important for small aquatic objects like rivers and lakes, it is necessary to combine the data from several sensors. This creates certain problems as also spectral and radiometric resolutions of the sensors can be different.

With a similarity graph constructed by top results given by text based retrieval, we utilize Normalized Cut to select the part with the highest similarity density as concept model. We re-rank the rest images according to their similarities to the concept model. The advantages of our method are (i): Our method is unsupervised, and it doesn't need any pre-prepared query/training image or user's feedback, Thus it greatly facilitates users' retrieval.

On the one hand, there are gaps between the large number of parameters of physical models and the small amount of data obtained by single sensor, which may cause the decrease in accuracy that LAI products should have. On the other hand, there are gaps between instantaneous observation of remote sensing and parameters which have change rules. Custom methods to retrieve LAI from remote sensing data are just involving the transient observations, discarding the information about process. To resolve these problems, we develop a methodology to retrieve LAI by involving diverse data from multiple sensor and LAI change rule. The methodology can take full advantage of the different band and angle information of time series MODIS and MISR data to improve the accuracy of the retrieved LAI over the MODIS LAI product compared to the field measured LAI data.

Problems arise in querying data sources due to unstructured contents of web pages (HTML), we cannot directly extract data into a new structured form. To address this problem, we propose a system, called Xtractorz, that can perform web data extraction in a Mashup format.

For those location-unaware devices, detecting radio frequency signal strength from outdoor Base Station or indoor Access Point is the most popular method. However, traditional radio map matching scheme suffers from variation and error when the captured wireless signals significantly deviate from the measured samples stored in advance. To solve this problem, a neighbor-assisted location calibration mechanism with two-phase approach is proposed. Firstly, mobile terminal utilizes conventional pattern mapping to identify its general location; if the result includes some inconclusive fuzzy area, location information from its short distance neighbors will be retrieved as reference to calibrate location estimation in the second step. With the cooperation among mobile devices, a maximum shared border algorithm is designed to compress the fuzzy area, so that the location correction rate is improved and no additional hardware support is required. Such mechanism can be deployed in either outdoor or indoor environment, and the simulation results also show the proposed mechanism has stable performance in scalability under different density distribution of mobile nodes.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4244-4148-8; POD:978-1-4244-4147-1; POD:978-1-4244-4148-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425862","","Algorithm design and analysis;Calibration;Femtocell networks;Hardware;Indoor environments;Information retrieval;RF signals;Radio frequency;Signal detection;Wireless networks","calibration;mobile computing;radio networks;signal detection","location determination;mobile devices;neighbor-assisted location calibration;radio frequency signal strength detection;radio map matching;wireless network","","0","","10","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Theoretical approaches into traceback systems to counter these attacks have been actively researched. However, with no instances of actual application of traceback systems on the Internet, such a response has yet to achieve widespread adoption. This is because multiple autonomous systems (ASs) need to be linked to carry out end-to-end tracking, and this poses a number of issues, including (i) the operational and practical environmental constraints of installing equipment at a variety of Internet Exchange Points (IXPs), (ii) the need to establish operational procedures, and (iii) establishing the monitoring points needed to conduct the traceback. Given these factors, with the aim of achieving the widespread adoption of traceback systems on the Internet in Japan, in this paper we introduce the challenges posed by installing equipment at multiple ASs and report on tracking experiments conducted in response to simulated attacks. Specifically, in terms of (i) environmental constraints, this involved summarizing the size and access restrictions of installed equipment, and in terms of (ii) establishing operational procedures, this involved summarizing the role of operators from the outbreak of an incident to conducting traces and taking countermeasures. Additionally, we investigated the connection status of ASs in Japan to calculate (iii) the number of ASs in which equipment must be installed to satisfy the adoption rate required to carry out tracking.","2331-9852;23319852","Electronic:978-1-4244-5176-0; POD:978-1-4244-5175-3","10.1109/CCNC.2010.5421839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5421839","","Communications Society;Computer crime;Counting circuits;Data communication;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Monitoring;Research and development;Spine;Web and internet services","IP networks;Internet;computer network management;computer network security","Internet Exchange Points;distributed denial of service attacks;environmental constraints;equipment installation;multiple autonomous systems;practical IP traceback","","1","","13","","","9-12 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiments are performed by comparing the suggested retrieval algorithm with two conventional algorithms and some results are reported.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5544-7; POD:978-1-4244-5543-0","10.1109/ICICIC.2009.340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5412272","","Computer architecture;Costs;Data engineering;Databases;Electronic mail;Geographic Information Systems;Global Positioning System;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Navigation","Global Positioning System;cryptography;grid computing;image retrieval;visual databases","GPS navigation system;Hash algorithm;electronic map information retrieval;image data retrieval method;vector grid","","0","","2","","","7-9 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A statistical image retrieval method using color invariant","C. Jin","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China 200240","2009 IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation - (CIRA)","20100301","2009","","","521","525","Content based image retrieval is an essential task in many image processing applications, among which, color based methods have been receiving constant attentions in past years, because color information is a discriminative descriptor for image retrieval, especially in case of large database. A limitation of previous color based methods is their unsuitability for retrieving similar scenes under varying lighting conditions as color is sensitive to illuminations. Besides image descriptors of some existing methods are with large dimensionality and thus computational expensive. As betterment, an adaptive method is proposed in this paper, which integrates the color invariant with some spatial information of images. Different from previous work, the number of states during the quantization of the color space is not manually determined. Instead, it depends on the context of the image itself, using an adaptive clustering technique: Firstly, feature map consisting of color invariants is established for images. Secondly, the Markov chain model is employed to capture the image both color and spatial information. Thirdly, an image descriptor is computed for each image, not under the frame of the entire fixed color space. To practice our method, similar images are retrieved with a similarity measure based on a two-stage weighted distance. Experiments show that, this method has improved simplicity and compactness without the lost of efficiency and robustness.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-4809-8; POD:978-1-4244-4808-1","10.1109/CIRA.2009.5423151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5423151","","Color;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Lighting;Quantization;Robustness","Markov processes;image colour analysis;image retrieval;visual databases","Markov chain model;adaptive clustering;adaptive method;color information;color invariant;color space quantization;content based image retrieval;feature map;image database;image descriptors;image processing applications;images spatial information;robustness;statistical image retrieval method;two-stage weighted distance","","0","","26","","","15-18 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The work contributes to feasibility studies for the CoReH<sub>2</sub>O satellite mission of ESA for which a dual frequency SAR, operating at Ku-band (17.2 GHz) and X-band (9.6 GHz), VV and VH polarizations, is proposed. A main parameter to be measured is the snow water equivalent (SWE). For the retrieval of SWE it is necessary to separate the backscatter contributions of the snow volume and the background target and to account for effects of snow grain size. The current version of the SWE retrieval algorithm applies the maximum likelihood approach matching radiative transfer forward computations with measured backscatter data. An application example for SWE retrieval is shown for the Cold Land Processes Experiment (CLPX-II) in Alaska, using Ku-band data of the NASA-JPL PolScat and X-band data of the TerraSAR-X satellite as input.","2153-6996;21536996","Electronic:978-1-4244-3395-7; POD:978-1-4244-3394-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2009.5418024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5418024","SAR;Snow;backscatter;ice;inversion","Backscatter;Current measurement;Frequency;Grain size;Information retrieval;Polarization;Radar measurements;Satellites;Snow;Spaceborne radar","electromagnetic wave scattering;geophysical techniques;grain size;radiative transfer;remote sensing by radar;snow;synthetic aperture radar","CLPX-II;CoReH<sub>2</sub>O satellite mission;Cold Land Processes Experiment;KU-band radar backscatter measurements;NASA-JPL PolScat data;SWE retrieval algorithm;TerraSAR-X satellite;X-band data;X-band radar backscatter measurements;frequency 17.2 GHz;frequency 9.6 GHz;radiative transfer;snow grain size;snow parameters;snow water equivalent","","4","","6","","","12-17 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to prove these data are of the highest quality and standard, it is necessary to be able to trace, query and qualify details pertaining to the data. Metadata, or data about data, therefore plays a key role in this information discovery and traceability.

To reduce the flooding overhead raised by transmitting query and data information, several data-centric storage mechanisms are proposed. However, the locations of these data-centric nodes significantly impact the power consumption and efficiency for information queries and storage capabilities, especially in a multi-sink environment. This paper proposes a novel dissemination approach, which is namely the dynamic data-centric routing and storage mechanism (DDCRS), to dynamically determine locations of data-centric nodes according to sink nodes' location and data collecting rate and automatically construct shared paths from data-centric node to multiple sinks. To save the power consumption, the data-centric node is changed when new sink nodes participate when the WSNs or some queries change their frequencies. The simulation results reveal that the proposed protocol outperforms existing protocols in terms of power conservation and power balancing.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5228-6; POD:978-1-4244-5227-9","10.1109/JCPC.2009.5420202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5420202","","Bandwidth;Energy consumption;Event detection;Floods;Frequency;Information retrieval;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Storage automation;Wireless sensor networks","query processing;routing protocols;sensor fusion;wireless sensor networks","data centric mechanism;data collecting rate;dissemination approach;dynamic data centric routing mechanism;storage mechanism;weighted queries;wireless sensor networks","","1","","6","","","3-5 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Public-key cryptography, such as RSA and elliptic curve cryptosystem (ECC), is extensively used but conventional scan-based attacks cannot be applied to it, because it has a complicated algorithm as well as a complicated architecture. This paper proposes a scan-based attack which enables us to decipher a secret key in ECC. The proposed method is based on detecting intermediate values calculated in ECC. By monitoring the 1-bit sequence in the scan path, we can find out the register position specific to the intermediate value in it and we can know whether this intermediate value is calculated or not in the target ECC circuit. By using several intermediate values, we can decipher a secret key. The experimental results demonstrate that a secret key in a practical ECC circuit can be deciphered using 29 points over the elliptic curve E within 40 seconds.","2153-6961;21536961","Electronic:978-1-4244-5767-0; POD:978-1-4244-5765-6","10.1109/ASPDAC.2010.5419848","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5419848","","Circuits;Computer science;Elliptic curve cryptography;Galois fields;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Memory architecture;Polynomials;Public key cryptography;Registers","electronic design automation;large scale integration;public key cryptography","ECC circuit;LSI chip;RSA;cryptography circuit;elliptic curve cryptosystem;public-key cryptography;register position;scan-based attack;secret key decipher","","13","","19","","","18-21 Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
