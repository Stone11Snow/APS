The term of “solid state” means there are no moving parts involve in accessing, storing and retrieving required data on the drive. Several benefits offered by the SSD drives due to absent of moving mechanical components are high access speed, light weight, ruggedness, low latency, low power consumption, and silent operation. This paper discusses the architecture and the advantage offered by SSD in using the drive as a storage device in video server.","2155-8973;21558973","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2328-6; POD:978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631955","","Disk drives;EPROM;Flash memory;Information retrieval;Magnetic heads;Magnetic semiconductors;Read-write memory;Semiconductor memory;Solid state circuits;Spinning","","","","4","","22","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years various approaches to free-form keyword search over RDBMS have been proposed. They can produce results across multiple tuples in different relations according to a query consisting of a set of keywords. However, they just consider keyword search for values in tuple instances. In fact users have requirements to search keywords which may be part of the metadata of the database such as names of relations or attributes. In this paper, we extend keyword search on relational database. We define a tuple with annotation as an extension concept of a conventional tuple. In addition we add proposed weight to tuples. The weight function also cares about metadata information. We implement the query processing scheme in RDBMS in order to prove the proposed approach.","","POD:978-0-7695-3300-1","10.1109/INGS.2008.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627238","keyword search;metadata;relational database","Data engineering;Database languages;Indexes;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Keyword search;Query processing;Relational databases;Robustness;Systems engineering and theory","meta data;query processing;relational databases","information retrieval method;keyword search;metadata;relational databases","","3","","18","","","26-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"OOV words in an English-Arabic CLIR system","A. Bellaachia; G.

Their correct translation might be necessary to maintain a good retrieval performance in a cross language information retrieval (CLIR) system. However, dictionaries only include the most commonly used proper nouns, like major countries and capitals. As they are spelling variants of each other in most languages, using an approximate string matching technique against the target database index is the common approach taken to find the target language correspondents of the original query key. N-gram technique proved to be the most effective among other approximate string matching techniques. As we are dealing with an English-Arabic CLIR system which involves two languages of different alphabets, we decided to combine transliteration with the n-gram technique to generate the different spelling variants of out of vocabulary (OOV) words. We call this technique: Transliteration Ngram (TNG). One issue that arises with the Arabic language is that words that are spelled similarly can have different meanings depending on the context of the sentence. This is particularly true for proper names, which usually have a meaning if used as a verb or adjective. To further enhance our transliteration approach, we chose to use part of speech (POS) disambiguation to reduce the number of unrelated words from the set transliterations obtained using TNG.","1530-1346;15301346","POD:978-1-4244-2702-4","10.1109/ISCC.2008.4625724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4625724","","Computer science;Databases;Degradation;Dictionaries;Indexes;Information retrieval;Speech enhancement;Vocabulary","database indexing;information retrieval systems;language translation;natural language processing;query processing;string matching;vocabulary","English-Arabic CLIR system;N-gram technique;OOV words;POS;TNG;approximate string matching technique;cross language information retrieval system;original query key;out of vocabulary;part of speech disambiguation;target database index;transliteration Ngram;transliteration approach","","0","","18","","","6-9 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply Agrep algorithm in an indexing structure, the r-cut numerical substring array (r-NSA). The structure basically indexes all the substrings of length r. The advantage of using the r-NSA is two-fold: (1) The space requirement of the r-NSA is much smaller than that of the other existing indexing structures, such as the generalized suffix tree. (2) We propose an algorithm to apply Agrep in the r-NSA, in which the substrings are processed sequentially. Since the common substrings are processed only once, the cost of our algorithm is smaller than that of the full scanning search by Agrep. Consequently, the matching time of our algorithm is also reduced. We design experiments to validate and compare the performance of our algorithm against the full scanning search by Agrep. We define the speed-up of our algorithm as the time required by the full scanning search by Agrep over that of our algorithm. We use eight sets of real DNA sequences in our experiments, and the results show that our algorithm achieves significant speed-up.

The main advantages of our approach are: (1) the image of the embedded virtual models and their behaviors are understandable to a human without using an AR system, and (2) no database or network communication is required to retrieve the models. The latter is useful in scenarios with large numbers of users. We implemented an AR system that demonstrates the feasibility of our approach. Applications in education, advertisement, gaming, and other domains can benefit from our approach, since content providers need only to publish the printed content and all virtual information arrives with it.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2859-5; POD:978-1-4244-2840-3","10.1109/ISMAR.2008.4637339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4637339","Augmented Reality content;H.5.1 [Multimedia Information Systems]: Artificial, augmented, and virtual realities;I.4.0 [Image Processing and Computer Vision]: Image processing software;content transmission;dual perception encoding;model embedding","Augmented reality;Communication networks;Computer science;Humans;Image coding;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Libraries","augmented reality;image processing","augmented reality;image-processing techniques;printed content","","6","2","17","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper explores the impact of two antecedents of product innovation, i.e., organizational memory and market information processes. Based on organizational learning and market orientation theories, it is proposed that organizational memory and market information processes positively affect product innovations. Empirical evidences show that organizational memory plays the most important role in product innovations, and market information acquisition and dissemination both positively influence product innovations. Although market information interpretation has no direct impact on product innovation, information interpretation moderates the relationship of organizational memory and product innovation.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2330-9; POD:978-1-4244-2329-3","10.1109/ICMIT.2008.4654397","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4654397","Market information processes;Market orientation;Organizational memory;product innovation","Cognitive science;Environmental management;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Innovation management;Market research;Memory management;Sparks;Technological innovation","innovation management;knowledge management;market opportunities;organisational aspects","market information processes;market orientation theory;organizational learning;organizational memory;product innovation development","","1","","26","","","21-24 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Global distributions of CO<sub>2</sub> column abundances, retrieved from each GOSAT and OCO data, will be opened to researchers and public users, so it is important to clarify the precision of the data retrieval. If satellite observations are to improve over the existing ground network, monthly averaged column data at a precision of 1% or better, for an 8deg times 10deg footprint are needed [1]. The GOSAT mission was designed to observe CO<sub>2</sub> density with 1% relative precision averaged in a certain period and with 10 km times10 km footprint size. This paper describes an evaluation method of retrieved CO<sub>2</sub> column abundances considering internal and external error sources, respectively. Variance of the internal error, which is derived from spectral fitting residuals, is obtained analytically. Variance of the external error, which is caused by error of given parameters when column abundance is retrieved, is estimated by factorial design. Further, observation situation is set and noises occurred in sensor are generated, retrieval precision is evaluated by numerical simulation.

One limited resource is memory, and garbage collection has already been proposed for the standard LINDA with multiple tuple-spaces (TSs) to avoid memory exhaustion. The implementation, however, was restricted to garbage collection of TSs. Taking into account the need for garbage collection not only for TSs, but also for tuples, this paper demonstrates how the garbage collection mechanism can be extended to handle unusable tuples, with the introduction of multicapabilities, which generalise capabilities to collections of objects.","2155-8973;21558973","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2328-6; POD:978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631938","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631938","","Computer science;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Java;Kernel;Permission;Pervasive computing;Resource management;Sun","","","","1","","13","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our data collection analysis suggests that there should be a proportion of text in which the reasoning or explanation that constitutes an answer to a ldquowhyrdquo question is present in, or capable of extracting from, the source text. We report on an implemented component for the extraction of candidate answers from source text. This component uses an approach that combines lexical overlapping and lexical semantic relatedness (lexico-syntactic approach) for ranking possible answers to causal questions. On undifferentiated texts, we obtain an overall recall of 34.13% indicating that simple match is adequate for answering over 1/3 of ldquowhyrdquo questions.

The types of information that can be logged in life log system are the ones of surroundings (voice, image, etc) that are entered via every kind of sensors attachable to human bodies. These multimedia data have disadvantages such as requiring high-capacity memory space in saving and also acquiring inaccurate search results together with long searching times. Therefore, this paper defines the metadata for saving and searching the life log media in order to access these kinds of problems efficiently. This can be performed effectively from the aspects of saving and searching by recording in metadata such as EXIF(Exchangeable image file format) at logging stage of the information entered from each sensor. After defining these metadata, this paper generated virtual data fit for the schema and performed searching experiments. The searching results varied depending on the data storage spaces used.

In order to effectively and efficiently manage human motion database, human motion classification is necessary. In this paper, we propose an ensemble based human motion classification approach (EHMCA). Specifically, EHMCA first extracts the descriptors from human motion sequences. Then, singular value decomposition (SVD) is adopted to reduce the dimensionality of all the feature vectors. In the following step, a cluster ensemble approach is designed to construct the consensus matrix from the feature vectors. Finally, the normalized cut algorithm is applied to partition the consensus matrix and assign the feature vectors into the corresponding clusters. Experiments on the CMU database illustrate that the proposed approach achieves good performance.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:978-1-4244-1820-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2008.4633839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4633839","","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Humans;Information retrieval;Matrix decomposition;Partitioning algorithms;Robust stability;Singular value decomposition;Spatial databases;Statistics","feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image sequences;singular value decomposition","SVD;consensus matrix;ensemble based 3D human motion classification;feature vectors;human motion databases;human motion sequences;motion capture technology;singular value decomposition","","1","","19","","","1-8 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Launched in 2003 by the Institut Eurecom, this project is based on a worldwide distributed system of honeypots running in more than 30 different countries. The main objective of the project is to get a more realistic picture of certain classes of threats happening on the Internet, by collecting unbiased quantitative data in a long-term perspective. In the first phase of the project, the data collection infrastructure relied solely on low-interaction sensors based on Honeyd to collect unsolicited traffic on the Internet. Recently, a second phase of the project was started with the deployment of medium-interaction honeypots based on the ScriptGen technology, in order to enrich the network conversations with the attackers. All network traces captured on the platforms are automatically uploaded into a centralized database accessible by the partners via a convenient interface. The collected traffic is also enriched with a set of contextual information (e.g. geographical localization and reverse DNS lookups). This paper presents this complex data collection infrastructure, and offers some insight into the structure of the central data repository. The data access interface has been developed to facilitate the analysis of today's Internet threats, for example by means of data mining tools. Some concrete examples are presented to illustrate the richness and the power of this data access interface. By doing so, we hope to encourage other researchers to share with us their knowledge and data sets, to complement or enhance our ongoing analysis efforts, with the ultimate goal of better understanding Internet threats.","","POD:978-0-7695-3347-6","10.1109/WISTDCS.2008.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627314","Internet threats collection;honeynet;threats analysis","Data mining;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Information systems;Internet;Monitoring;Protection;Telecommunication traffic;Telescopes","Internet;information retrieval;security of data","Honeyd;Internet threats information;Leurre.com project;ScriptGen technology;data access interface;data collection;data mining tool;unsolicited traffic;worldwide distributed Honeynet","","6","","33","","","21-22 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Until now, most of the research activity in this field has been devoted to the attempt to retrieve geometric information on buildings in terms of their positions and sizes, by using simplified geometrical models. However, this approach does not allow us to fully exploit the large amount of information present in HR SAR images. In order to improve information retrieval from such images, and, hence, their interpretation, in this paper, we propose to employ a more refined model that accounts for both geometrical (including fine details) and electromagnetic properties of the building. A meaningful case study is presented to show that the main features appearing on the SAR image of a building can be interpreted by using our geometric and electromagnetic model. In addition, a first example of retrieval of the complex dielectric constant of building materials from a SAR image is presented.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2008.2001155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4637911","High resolution (HR);synthetic aperture radar (SAR);urban areas","Data mining;Electromagnetic modeling;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Radar imaging;Shape;Solid modeling;Synthetic aperture radar;Urban areas","building;feature extraction;synthetic aperture radar","building electromagnetic properties;building images;electromagnetic model;feature extraction techniques;high-resolution SAR images;model-based interpretation;simplified geometrical models;synthetic aperture radar;urban areas","","39","1","22","","20081003","June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In addition to that, there is more “noise” available than useful quality content. The research delves into the use of blogging as a fast, up-and-coming means of knowledge and quality content sharing amongst communities of bloggers with similar interests. Knowledge sharing implies a bi-directional exchange of information. To read blogs is not enough. One must preferably start a blog and engage other bloggers with shared interests.

Induction is the acquisition process that relations are learned and memorized in between the two memories as knowledge.

There are an enormous amount of LOR existed on the web and based on analysis conducted, it was discovered that in obtaining a particular learning object stored in every LOR, would require accessing each LOR in separately manner. This paper explains the mechanism that facilitates interoperability of Learning Object Repositories (LOR). The mechanism was designed to retrieve learning object from heterogeneous LOR by using semantic-interoperability framework utilizing metadata element. A prototype known as LORP is developed as a proof of concept to the mechanism established. LORP involves two main processes which are determining the metadata elements existed in every LOR and extracting these elements into one central repository, resulting in the development of one-stop search centre for learning objects. One-stop search centre for learning objects could retrieve learning object from various LOR and this would add values to the process of smart teaching where learning materials from various online LOR can be retrieved and shared using one search query on one occasion.","2155-8973;21558973","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2328-6; POD:978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4632054","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632054","","Content management;Databases;Education;Information retrieval;Information science;Internet;Management training;Materials science and technology;Portals;Prototypes","computer aided instruction;meta data;open systems;teaching","LORIuMET;central repository;digital database;learning materials;learning object repositories;metadata element;search query;semantic-interoperability framework;smart teaching","","2","","17","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On several benchmark datasets, our method (NNRank) outperforms a neural network classification method. Compared with the ordinal regression methods using Gaussian processes and support vector machines, NNRank achieves comparable performance. Moreover, NNRank has the advantages of traditional neural networks: learning in both online and batch modes, handling very large training datasets, and making rapid predictions. These features make NNRank a useful and complementary tool for large-scale data mining tasks such as information retrieval, Web page ranking, collaborative filtering, and protein ranking in bioinformatics.

The detailed analysis of the sources induced on a cylinder and their linear dependency on each other gives a distinct insight into the use of MUSIC algorithm to locate it.

Such questions are, for instance, ""is my data sufficiently anonymous?"", ""which information, if available from an outside source, threatens the anonymity of my data?"" In this paper we focus on anonymity and, in particular, k-anonymity. The algorithms that we propose leverage two properties of k-anonymity that we express in the form of two lemmas. The first lemma is a monotonicity property that enables us to adapt the a-priori algorithm for k-anonymity. The second lemma is a determinism property that enables us to devise an efficient algorithm for delta-suppression.

Our approach is based on associating a fuzzy membership function with the distribution of the featurespsila distances, and assigning a degree of worthiness to each feature based on its average performance. The memberships and the feature weights are then aggregated to produce a confidence that could be used to rank the retrieved images. We describe and experiment with two distinct aggregation methods. The first one is linear and is based on a simple weighted combination. The second one is non-linear and is based on the discrete Choquet integral. The proposed fusion methods were trained and tested using a large collection of images with several low-level visual and high-level textual features. The results were compared to other methods used in typical CBIR systems.","1098-7584;10987584","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1819-0; POD:978-1-4244-1818-3","10.1109/FUZZY.2008.4630643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4630643","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Navigation;Prototypes;Shape;Spatial databases;Testing","content-based retrieval;fuzzy set theory;image retrieval;integral equations","content-based image retrieval;discrete Choquet integral;distinct aggregation methods;fuzzy membership function;multimodal features fusion","","4","","39","","","1-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to store and query large amount of RDF data becomes an important issue of the semantic Web. In this paper, we first discuss the usage of concise bounded description (CBD). As an improvement, we define dynamic concise bounded description (DCBD) which is a general and dynamic version of CBD. We also propose a query language for RDF called DCBDQuery. DCBDQuery is used for constituting DCBD and finding meaningful reachable path or shortest path with respect to DCBD. Then we discuss an alternative approach for storing RDF data into relational database, called updated schema-aware representation. We store RDF data into database using this representation, and then create graph in main memory from internal link statements. The DCBDQuery query engine is designed to access a hybrid data model of the database and the graph in main memory. We also implement the DCBDQuery query engine to access Jena2. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by experiment using the RDF data of DBLP++.","","POD:978-0-7695-3300-1","10.1109/INGS.2008.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4627230","","Data models;Database languages;Electronic mail;Engines;Informatics;Information retrieval;Query processing;Relational databases;Resource description framework;Semantic Web","query processing;relational databases;semantic Web","RDF data querying;dynamic concise bounded description;query engine;relational database;semantic Web;updated schema-aware representation","","0","","8","","","26-26 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is particularly useful in many applications such as information retrieval, document browsing and document classification. One of the important tasks in the construction of concept hierarchy is the identification of suitable terms with appropriate size of domain vocabulary. One way of achieving such a size is by using term reduction. The aim of this paper is to examine the effectiveness of the reduction approach to reduce the size of vocabulary using term selection methods. An experiment has been conducted on the Quran which is assumed to be a literary text. The experiment compares the entropy method, the transition point method and the hybrid of transition point and entropy methods with the Vector Space Model (VSM). Results indicate the effectiveness of the Transition Point method as compared to the others in reducing the size of the vocabulary but at the same time preserve those important terms that exist in the literary documents.","2155-8973;21558973","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2328-6; POD:978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4631699","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4631699","","Data mining;Entropy;Frequency conversion;Indexes;Information retrieval;Text categorization;Vocabulary","","","","1","","12","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is the case when a sink of information, or a gateway, is only occasionally present in the network. We consider a network consisting of a set of motes that in order to save energy independently of each other go into offline mode, switching theirs radios off. We propose a cooperative mechanism for distributed data storage that allows complete data retrieval with high probability. Reliable data retrieval is crucial for data-critical applications. Reliability is achieved by introducing redundancy in the system by applying Reed-Solomon scheme for data encoding. This solution can tolerate the situation where a certain number of devices in the sensor cluster is unavailable at the moment of information retrieval. A probabilistic analytical model is developed to investigate the performance of the proposed algorithm. This model is verified by simulation and prototype testing. Prototyping is done on the OpenSensor platform developed at Aalborg University. Performance results indicate that the proposed cooperative data distribution method outperforms the non-cooperative one.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2036-0; POD:978-1-4244-2035-3","10.1109/ICTEL.2008.4652636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4652636","","Analytical models;Clustering algorithms;Encoding;Information retrieval;Memory;Redundancy;Reed-Solomon codes;Testing;Virtual prototyping;Wireless sensor networks","Reed-Solomon codes;information retrieval;probability;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","Aalborg University;OpenSensor platform;Reed-Solomon scheme;cooperative data distribution method;cooperative information storage reliability;data encoding;data retrieval;energy saving;gateway;information retrieval;offline mode;probabilistic analytical model;sensor cluster;temporal distributed data storage;wireless sensor network","","0","","9","","","16-19 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The semantic similarity between the query image and each database image can then be computed using the current feedbacks and the semantic values in the FTR. Furthermore, feature re-weighting is applied on the session-term feedback to learn weight of low level features. Then we use the weighted Euclidean distance metric to measure the distance between the query image and each database image. These two similarity measures are normalized and combined together to form the overall similarity measure.

"Query expansion using information scent","S. Chawla; P. Bedi","","2008 International Symposium on Information Technology","20080926","2008","3","","1","8","Web has grown to a huge mass of information resource and is diverse in content. To search such rich source of information one has to be very precise in using keywords in queries to retrieve the relevant documents. Most of the queries issued to search engines are short and have ambiguous context. One way to produce effective queries is by automatic query expansion. Work has been done in this field to use the local and global techniques. The global techniques examine word occurrences and relationships in the corpus as a whole and use this information to expand a particular query. Local context analysis examines the concept occurrences and relationship in top ranked documents retrieved by the original input query to expand the same query. Query log of search engines is used by researchers to expand the input queries using the clicked documents related to any of the terms of input query in query session of query log. In this paper a new local analysis technique is proposed which make use of information need of query sessions modeled using Information Scent and content of clicked documents to select the clicked documents for query expansion. Information scent is the subjective sense of value and cost of accessing a page based on perceptual cues with respect to the information need of the user. The input query issued in a particular domain is used to select the set of documents associated with the information need of the query sessions in the same domain and used as local corpora to provide related set of terms to be added to the input query. The resulting expanded query is used to retrieve the relevant documents from the same retrieval system. This approach is unique as it is using those documents in local corpora which belong to the information need associated with the domain in which input query is issued using Information Scent and content of clicked pages in the query sessions and direct the search in a fruitful direction by expanding initial input query using set of- - related terms. Experimental study of the proposed approach is done on the data set extracted from Web history of ldquoGooglerdquo search engine and improvement in the information retrieval precision with low computation complexity during online processing of input queries confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","2155-8973;21558973","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2328-6; POD:978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4632051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632051","","Costs;Data mining;Degradation;History;Information analysis;Information resources;Information retrieval;Search engines;Text analysis;Vocabulary","Internet;document handling;information resources;query processing","World Wide Web;ambiguous context;automatic query expansion;clicked documents;concept occurrences;concept relationships;documents retrieval;global techniques;information need;information resources;information scent;input query;local analysis;local context analysis;local techniques;query log;query sessions;retrieval system;search engine;top ranked documents","","2","","13","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems use the visual content of images for image retrieval in addition to conventional textual annotation, and have become a useful technique in biomedical data management. Existing CBIR systems are typically designed for use with single-modality images, and are restricted when multi-modal images, such as co-aligned functional positron emission tomography and anatomical computed tomography (PET/CT) images, are considered. Furthermore, the inherent spatial relationships among adjacent structures in biomedical images are not fully exploited. In this study, we present an innovative retrieval system for dual-modality PET/CT images by proposing the use of graph-based methods to spatially represent the structural relationships within these images. We exploit the co-aligned functional and anatomical information in PET/CT, using attributed relational graphs (ARG) to represent both modalities spatially and applying graph matching for similarity measurements. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that our dual-modal ARG enabled the CBIR of dual-modality PET/CT.

In this paper, we present a Case Based Reasoning (CBR) system for medical case retrieval, derived from the Dezert-Smarandache theory, which is well suited to handle those problems. We introduce a case retrieval specific frame of discernment θ, which associates each element of θ with a case in the database; we take advantage of the flexibility offered by the DSmT's hybrid models to finely model the database. The system is designed so that heterogeneous sources of information can be integrated in the system: in particular images, indexed by their digital content, and symbolic information. The method is evaluated on two classified databases: one for diabetic retinopathy follow-up (DRD) and one for screening mammography (DDSM). On these databases, results are promising: the retrieval precision at five reaches 81.8% on DRD and 84.8% on DDSM.","1094-687X;1094687X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1815-2; POD:978-1-4244-1814-5","10.1109/IEMBS.2008.4649173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4649173","Case based reasoning;Dezert-Smarandache theory;Diabetic Retinopathy;Image indexing;Mammography","Biomedical imaging;Delta-sigma modulation;Diabetes;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Mammography;Medical diagnostic imaging;Retina;Retinopathy","","","Database Management Systems;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiology Information Systems;Subtraction Technique","1","","9","","","20-25 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, many techniques have been developed for crosscutting concern identification activity. This crucial activity is useful at the requirements level; it avoids coupling between requirements, improves traceability among requirements, eases function modularization, reduces software complexity, enhances the correctness of the software design, and most importantly it saves the cost. However, existing studies do not provide us with a clear definition of the term crosscutting concern and aspect. In terms of tools, most of these techniques in the existing studies are only supported by semi-automated tool. It means human intervention is required to achieve the desired results. In this paper, we describe a tool that provides automated support for identifying crosscutting concern at the requirements level.

Therefore, sharing of product cases between collaborating partners becomes a research issue.

Small feature table based on color image features are proposed in this paper, because even an effective feature extraction algorithm requires a large amount of storage space and calculation.

In KMQGA, Q-bit based representation is employed for exploration and exploitation in discrete 0-1 hyperspace by using rotation operation of quantum gate as well as three genetic algorithm operations (selection, crossover and mutation) of Q-bit. Without knowing the exact number of clusters beforehand, the KMQGA can get the optimal number of clusters as well as providing the optimal cluster centroids after several iterations of the four operations (selection, crossover, mutation, and rotation). The simulated datasets and the real datasets are used to validate KMQGA and to compare KMQGA with an improved k-means clustering algorithm based on the famous variable string length genetic algorithm (KMVGA) respectively. The experimental results show that KMQGA is promising and the effectiveness and the search quality of KMQGA is better than those of KMVGA.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1823-7; POD:978-1-4244-1822-0","10.1109/CEC.2008.4630993","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4630993","","Biological cells;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data mining;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Quantum computing;Sun","genetic algorithms;pattern clustering;quantum computing","conventional k-means clustering algorithm;data clustering;discrete 0-1 hyperspace;quantum gate;quantum-inspired genetic algorithm;variable string length genetic algorithm","","3","","25","","","1-6 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We call this class unencumbered, because the cryptanalysis is achieved without breaking the cipher. The attacker will instead observe the resources of the system at the deciphering process (or its failure). From this observation of the resources used, she will conclude the key being processed at successful deciphering or authentication. In the case of a plaintext attack, the message can be retrieved without breaking the cipher itself. We will introduce the current state of research in this field, some measures to avoid such attacks, and outline our ongoing research to combat such attacks in a more systematic manner.","2155-8973;21558973","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2328-6; POD:978-1-4244-2327-9","10.1109/ITSIM.2008.4632028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4632028","","Authentication;Cryptography;Current measurement;Educational institutions;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information technology;Operating systems;Switches;Yarn","cryptography","authentication;cryptanalysis;cryptographic means;deciphering;deciphering process;plaintext attack;unencumbered cryptographic","","0","","16","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Regardless of the considerable research efforts, little work has been done on improving its restart latency. The time spent on retrieving and loading the checkpoint image during a recovery is non-trivial, especially in networked environments. With the ever-increasing application memory footprint and system failure rate, it is becoming more of an issue. In this paper, we present a fast restart mechanism called FREM. It allows fast restart of a failed process without requiring the availability of the entire checkpoint image. By dynamically tracking the process data accesses after each checkpoint, FREM masks restart latency by overlapping the computation of the resumed process with the retrieval of its checkpoint image. We have implemented FREM with the BLCR checkpointing tool in Linux systems. Our experiments with the SPEC benchmarks indicate that it can effectively reduce restart latency by 61.96% on average in networked environments.","1530-0889;15300889","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2398-9; POD:978-1-4244-2397-2","10.1109/DSN.2008.4630090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4630090","","Access protocols;Checkpointing;Computer networks;Delay;Fault tolerant systems;High performance computing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Linux;Runtime","checkpointing;protocols;software tools","Linux systems;checkpoint image;checkpoint-recovery protocols;fast restart mechanism;optimization techniques;restart latency","","4","","27","","","24-27 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
