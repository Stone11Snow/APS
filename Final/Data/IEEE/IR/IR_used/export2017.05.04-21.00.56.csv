A prominent feature of this transition is the spring thermal front, also known as the thermal bar, a boundary of 4degC water that extends from top to bottom and separates near-shore stratified water from colder, mixed water further off-shore. Three Pioneer II buoys were deployed in a west to east line at 20 m, 40 m and 60 m depths and at distances of 2 km, 6 km and 12 km from shore respectively. Each buoy was equipped with a string of temperature sensors spaced one meter apart from the bottom to about 3 meters below the surface. The buoys communicated with a shore station using 900 MHz radio modems. An Internet connection was established between the WATER Institute and the buoys via the shore station permitting two-way communication for real-time data retrieval and control of the buoys. The spring thermal transition was remotely observed at the 20 m buoy along with its characteristic 4degC thermal bar. This paper will present the data on the spring thermal evolution of the lake as measured by the GLUCOS observatory and will describe the design of the new Pioneer II buoy that made-up the buoy array for this experiment.","0197-7385;01977385","POD:978-1-4244-2619-5","10.1109/OCEANS.2008.5152000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5152000","","Information retrieval;Internet;Lakes;Modems;Observatories;Real time systems;Remote monitoring;Sea measurements;Springs;Temperature sensors","Internet;hydrological equipment;lakes;modems;temperature sensors","AD 2008;GLUCOS coastal observatory;Great Lakes Urban Coastal Observing System;Internet connection;Lake Michigan stratification;Pioneer II buoys control;WATER Institute;frequency 900 MHz;radio modems;real-time data retrieval;seasonal transition;spring thermal evolution;temperature sensors;thermal bar","","1","","15","","","15-18 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach for building detection in high resolution remotely sensed images incorporating structural information of spatial data into spectral information. The proposed approach moves along eliminating irrelevant areas in a hierarchical manner. As a first step, pan-sharpened image is obtained from multi-spectral and panchromatic bands of Quickbird image. Vegetation and shadow regions are masked out by using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ratio of hue to intensity in YIQ model, respectively. Then, panchromatic band is filtered by mean shift filtering for smoothing structures while preserving the discontinuities near boundaries. Next, differential morphological profile (DMP) is calculated for each pixel and a relative measure of structure size is recorded as the first maximum value of DMP which generates a labeled image representing connected components according to sizes of structures. However, there appear some connected components which are irrelevant to buildings in shape. To eliminate those connected components, their skeletons are obtained via thinning to get a relative length measure along with measuring areas of connected components. These measures are compared to a threshold individually, which provides a cue for a candidate building structure.","","POD:978-1-4244-3626-2","10.1109/RAST.2009.5158228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5158228","Building detection;DMP;NDVI;mean shift filtering;morphological profile;shadow detection","Area measurement;Buildings;Filtering;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Length measurement;Smoothing methods;Spatial resolution;Vegetation mapping","feature extraction;geophysical signal processing;image processing;remote sensing","Normalized Difference Vegetation Index;Quickbird image;YIQ model;building detection;data dimensionality;differential morphological profile;high resolution images;mean shift filtering;morphological operators;remotely sensed images","","7","","11","","","11-13 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extracting dominant colors that are prominent in a visual scenery is of utter importance since human visual system primarily uses them for perception. In this paper we address dominant color extraction as a dynamic clustering problem and use techniques based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for finding optimal (number of) dominant colors in a given color space, distance metric and a proper validity index function. The first technique, so-called Multi-Dimensional (MD) PSO, re-forms the native structure of swarm particles in such a way that they can make inter-dimensional passes with a dedicated dimensional PSO process. Therefore, in a multidimensional search space where the optimum dimension is unknown, swarm particles can seek both positional and dimensional optima. Nevertheless, MD PSO is still susceptible to premature convergences due to lack of divergence. To address this problem we then present Fractional Global Best Formation (FGBF) technique, which basically collects all promising dimensional components and fractionally creates an artificial global-best particle (aGB) that has the potential to be a better ldquoguiderdquo than the PSOpsilas native gbest particle. We finally propose an efficient color distance metric, which uses a fuzzy model for computing color (dis-) similarities over HSV (or HSL) color space. The comparative evaluations against MPEG-7 dominant color descriptor show the superiority of the proposed technique.","1949-3983;19493983","POD:978-1-4244-4265-2","10.1109/CBMI.2009.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137838","color;dynamic clustering;particle swarm optimization","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Extraterrestrial measurements;Humans;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Information resources;Information retrieval;Particle swarm optimization;Visual system","colour graphics;content-based retrieval;fuzzy set theory;particle swarm optimisation;pattern clustering","color distance metric;content-based retrieval;dominant color extraction;dynamic clustering;fractional global best formation;fuzzy model;global best particle;human visual system;image analysis;multidimensional particle swarm optimization;visual scenery","","2","1","24","","","3-5 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing research in this field either requires a trusted third-party (anonymizer) or uses oblivious protocols that are computationally and communicationally expensive. Our design of privacy-preserving techniques is principled on not requiring a trusted third-party while being highly efficient in terms of time and space complexities. The problem has two interesting and challenging characteristics: First, the degree of privacy protection and LBS accuracy depends on the context, such as population and road density, around a user's location. Second, an adversary may violate a user's location privacy in two ways: (i) based on the user's location information contained in the LBS query payload, and (ii) by inferring a user's geographical location based on its device's IP address. To address these challenges, we introduce CAP, a Context-Aware Privacy-preserving LBS system with integrated protection for data privacy and communication anonymity.

However, the widely affective gap between the low-level features and the emotion recognition is still an unsolved problem. In order to recognize the affective type of a scene, a new algorithm is proposed based on fuzzy inference theory in this paper. It contains three main technologies. Firstly, two feature extraction models are built up by analyzing the film grammar. Secondly, based on fuzzy membership functions, a fuzzy method is used to transform a low-level feature vector into a fuzzy vector. This fuzzy expression of the scene content is more closed to the humanpsilas emotion description. Thirdly, a fuzzy logic inference rules are established to infer the affective type of a scene based on self-assessment report and fuzzy theory. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is feasible and achieves a high recognition accuracy which exceeds 80 percent.","","POD:978-0-7695-3560-9","10.1109/ISBIM.2008.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5116415","basic emotion;film affective content;fuzzy inference rules;fuzzy membership function;low-level feature eatraction","Content based retrieval;Databases;Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Image retrieval;Inference algorithms;Information retrieval;Layout;Videos","emotion recognition;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;video retrieval","emotion recognition;feature extraction models;film affective content recognition;film grammar;fuzzy inference theory;fuzzy logic inference rules;fuzzy membership functions","","0","","11","","","19-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Surface acoustic wave (SAW)-based sensors can offer wireless, passive operation in numerous environments, with various device embodiments used for retrieval of the sensed data information. Single sensor systems typically can use a single carrier frequency and a simple device embodiment because tagging is not required. In a multi-sensor environment, orthogonal frequency coding (OFC) permits the system to both identify the sensor and retrieve the sensed information discriminately. Previous research efforts have concentrated on a relatively lower operational frequency in the 250 MHz range due to available fabrication technology limitations. Using harmonic frequency operation, as shown in this paper, higher frequency devices are possible while continuing to work within the same limitations of contact lithography resolution. This paper presents a preliminary investigation of OFC SAW tags and sensors at a 900 MHz operational frequency range using conventional contact lithography techniques. The higher frequency devices are achieved using second harmonic operation. The objective of this effort is to increase the technology readiness level (TRL) of wideband OFC tags at higher frequencies.

Although the amount of sensor data to process is increasing fast, system support to efficiently store and analyze an extensive amount of sensor data largely lags behind. To efficiently store, retrieve, and process massive sensor data, we are developing a sensor data center (SDC) that supports spatio-temporal sensor data structures and parallel sensor data processing using clustered computational nodes composed of commodity hardware. The SDC sharply contrasts to most existing data centers that do not support spatio-temporal sensor data storage, retrieval, and processing. In this paper, we especially focus on the problem of potential load imbalance due to data access skews that adversely affects the timeliness of parallel sensor data processing. Specifically, we present an adaptive data replication method to address access skews in a SDC.

The data rates achievable are high (1 to 10 Mbps), the latency from when data is sent to when data is received is low, and there is no acoustic noise associated with transmission. Of course one of the biggest limitations of an optical approach underwater is the rapid attenuation of optical signals due to spreading loss, scattering, and absorption. Nonetheless, communication signals have been broadcast, received, and decoded over distances of 100 to 200 meters. High data rates and low latency make optical communications an attractive human interface to underwater systems, such as wireless control of underwater vehicles. Underwater optical communications is generally well-suited to multiple platform environments, where acoustic silence and limited range avoids interference between platforms. High data rates are advantageous in data retrieval applications, where, for one example, wireless data retrieval would make deployment and recovery of certain systems more economical.

However, the use of the approach in image retrieval has been limited. In this paper, a method of using LSI in combination with the salient image representation based on a saliency-based bottom-up visual attention computational model (VACM) motivated by visual physiological experimental results was proposed. Firstly, VACM was used to detect the salient region of the image, which is composed of salient or interest points. Meanwhile, a method to select number of the salient points to be extracted for each image is presented. Then color and texture features of the pixels in a small window around each salient point was computed as the visual attention descriptor (VAD). VADs of all images in the training data-set were to be clustered by k-means algorithm to construct a codebook. The term-document matrix was to be built based on the codebook and VADs of all images in the test data-set. Then LSI with four weighting schemes were applied to the term document matrix for image retrieval. According to the preliminary experiment results, some conclusions can be drawn. The best weighting for the LSI technique appears to be applying both local and global weight. With experimental image database used in this paper, the optimal number of dimensions of the semantic space for the LSI model, i.e., the rank of the approximation matrix, was found to be about 21 and the optimal codebook's size should be 900.","2156-2318;21562318","POD:978-1-4244-2799-4","10.1109/ICIEA.2009.5138691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5138691","image retrieval;image saliency;latent semantic indexing;visual attention model","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Data mining;Detectors;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration","document handling;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;image texture","image retrieval;k-means algorithm;latent semantic indexing;saliency-based bottom-up visual attention computational model;salient image representation;term-document matrix;textual information retrieval;visual attention descriptor","","1","","22","","","25-27 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, CBVIR is a very compute-intensive task. Nowadays, with the boom of multi-core processors, CBVIR can be accelerated by exploiting multi-core processing capability. In this paper, we propose a parallelization implementation of a CBVIR system facing to server application and use some serial and parallel optimization techniques to improve its performance on an 8-core and on a 16-core systems. Experimental results show that optimized implementation can achieve very fast retrieval on the two multi-core systems. We also compare the performance of the application on the two multi-core systems and give an explanation of the performance difference between the two systems. Furthermore, we conduct detailed scalability and memory performance analysis to identify possible bottlenecks in the application.

"A two-level protocol to answer private location-based queries","R. Vishwanathan; Yan Huang","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of North Texas, Denton, USA","2009 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics","20090626","2009","","","149","154","An important privacy issue in location based services (LBS) is to hide a user's identity and location while still providing quality location based services. A user's identity can be easily hidden through anonymous Web browsing services. However, a user's location can reveal a user's identity. For example, a user at home may want to ask queries such as ldquoFind the nearest hospital around merdquo through a GPS enabled mobile phone but he may not be willing to dislose his own location. A common way to achieve location privacy is through cloaking, e.g. the client sends a cloaked region to the server and filters the results to find the exact answer. Recently, private information retrieval has been adopted to answer private location-based queries. However, we argue that ensuring the server does not reveal more data than what is queried is important at the same time. In this paper, we propose an efficient two-level solution based on two cryptographic protocols: PIR and oblivious transfer. Our solution is a general-purpose one and can use either a two-level PIR [2] or it can use a combination of PIR and oblivious transfer [11]. Our approach provides privacy for the user/client, does not use a trusted party or anonymizer, is provably privacy-preserving, and when compared to previous approaches ensures that the server reveals as minimum data as is required, and the data that is released by the server is as fine-grained or precise as possible.","","POD:978-1-4244-4172-3","10.1109/ISI.2009.5137287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5137287","","Computer science;Data privacy;Filters;Global Positioning System;Hospitals;Information retrieval;Mobile handsets;Network servers;Protection;Protocols","Global Positioning System;Internet;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;information filtering;mobile computing;mobile radio","GPS-enabled mobile phone;anonymous Web browsing service;information filtering;location based service;private information retrieval;private location-based query answering;two-level PIR cryptographic protocol;two-level oblivious transfer cryptographic protocol","","2","","11","","","8-11 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, algorithms for video partitioning have become crucial with the unremitting growth in the prevalent digital video technology. This demands for a tool which would break down the video into smaller and manageable units called shots. In this paper, a shot boundary detection technique has been proposed for abrupt scene cuts. The method computes cooccurrence matrices by taking block differences between the consecutive frames in each of R, G, and B plane, using sum of absolute differences (SAD). Feature vectors are extracted from the co-occurrence matrices' statistics, defined at various pixel displacement distances. The statistical find-outs are integrated into a training set and an unsupervised classifier, K-means, is used to identify the shot-frames and the non-shot frames.","","POD:978-1-4244-3602-6","10.1109/MSPCT.2009.5164201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5164201","","Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Gunshot detection systems;Histograms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Statistics","image classification;image recognition;video signal processing","K-means;cooccurrence matrix;digital video technology;shot boundary detection;texture feature;unsupervised classifier","","0","","10","","","14-16 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While camera phones with image based recognition of urban objects provide intuitive interfaces for the exploration of urban space and mobile work, similar methodology can be applied to vision in mobile robots and autonomous aerial vehicles. A major issue for the performance of the service - involving indexing into a huge amount of reference images - is ambiguity in the visual information. We propose to exploit geo-information in association with visual features to restrict the search within a local context. In a mobile image retrieval task of urban object recognition, we determine object hypotheses from (i) mobile image based appearance and (ii) GPS based positioning, and investigate the performance of Bayesian information fusion with respect to benchmark geo-referenced image databases (TSG-20, TSG-40). This work specifically proposes to introduce position information as geo-contextual priors for geo-attention based object recognition to better prime the vision task. The results from geo-referenced image capture in an urban scenario prove a significant increase in recognition accuracy (> 10%) when using the geo-contextual information in contrast to omitting geo-information, the application of geo-attention is capable to improve accuracy by further > 5%.","1050-4729;10504729","POD:978-1-4244-2788-8","10.1109/ROBOT.2009.5152657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5152657","","Cameras;Image recognition;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mobile robots;Object recognition;Remotely operated vehicles;Robot vision systems;Space exploration;Space vehicles","cameras;geophysical signal processing;image retrieval;mobile handsets;object recognition;sensor fusion","Bayesian information fusion;GPS based positioning;attentive urban object recognition;autonomous aerial vehicles;camera phones;geo-referenced image databases;geocontextual priors;image recognition;mobile image retrieval task;mobile robots;mobile vision services;urban nomadic users","","3","2","10","","","12-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In VANETs, due to limited contact duration and unreliable wireless connection, a vehicle can get the useful data only when it meets another vehicle and the encountered vehicle has the exactly matched data. However, the probability of such case is very low. To improve the performance of content sharing in intermittently connected VANETs, we propose a novel P2P content sharing scheme called Roadcast. Roadcast ensures popular data is more likely to be shared with other vehicles so that the overall query delay and the query hit ratio can be improved. Roadcast consists of two components called popularity aware content retrieval and popularity aware data replacement. The popularity aware content retrieval scheme makes use of information retrieval (IR) techniques to find the most relevant and popular data towards user's query. The popularity aware data replacement algorithm ensures that the density of different data is proportional to their popularity in the system steady state, which firmly obeys the optimal ""square-root"" replication rule. Results based on real city map and real traffic model show that Roadcast outperforms other content sharing schemes in VANETs.","1063-6927;10636927","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3659-0","10.1109/ICDCS.2009.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5158428","Content Sharing;Replacement;VANET","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Delay;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Road safety;Road vehicles;Telecommunication traffic;Vehicle driving","ad hoc networks;information retrieval;mobile radio;peer-to-peer computing;traffic engineering computing","P2P content sharing scheme;Roadcast;VANETs;information retrieval techniques;optimal square-root replication rule;popularity aware content retrieval;popularity aware content sharing scheme;popularity aware data replacement;query delay;vehicle-to-vehicle communication","","22","","18","","","22-26 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently it is treated as a common solution for modeling language variability. Textual entailment captures a broad range of semantic oriented inferences needed for many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, like Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), Information Extraction (IE), text summarization and Machine Translation (MT). Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) as one of the fundamental problems in those natural language processing applications has attracted increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposes a new method for textual entailment measure which is based on lexical, shallow syntactic analysis combined with fuzzy set theory.

As disk capacity increases, there is a need to increase the number of streams that are allocated to each disk. However, when multiple streams are accessing a single disk, throughput is dramatically reduced because of disk head seek overhead, resulting in requirements for more disks. Thus, there is a tradeoff between how many streams should be allowed to access a disk and the total throughput that can be achieved. In this work we examine this tradeoff and provide an understanding of issues along with a practical solution. We use Disksim, a detailed architectural simulator, to examine several aspects of a modern I/O subsystem and we show the effect of various disk parameters on system performance under multiple sequential streams. Then, we propose a solution that dynamically adjusts I/O request streams, based on host and I/O subsystem parameters. We implement our approach in a real system and perform experiments with a small and a large disk configuration. Our approach improves disk throughput up to a factor of 4 with a workload of 100 sequential streams, without requiring large amounts of memory on the storage node.

To mine repeating patterns with gap constraint, we first show the anti-monotonic property of repeating patterns with gap constraint and then propose a level-wise algorithm, named G-Apriori (standing for Gap with Apriori), based on the anti-monotonic property. Similar to other level-wise mining algorithms such as Apriori, algorithm G-Apriori will scan databases several times to count the number of occurrences of each candidate repeating pattern. Such phenomenon makes G-Apriori spend much time in disk I/O, thereby making G-Apriori not suitable for large databases. In view of this, we develop an index structure to record the positions of the occurrences of each repeating pattern, and then propose algorithm GwI-Apriori (standing for gap with index Apriori) to utilize the index structure to reduce the number of database scans when mining repeating patterns with gap constraint. The experimental results show that algorithm GwI-Apriori is more scalable than algorithm G-Apriori in terms of execution time.","","POD:978-1-4244-4600-1","10.1109/HPCC.2009.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5167044","","Computer science;DNA;Data mining;Databases;Delay;High performance computing;Indexes;Music information retrieval;Sequences;Uninterruptible power systems","data mining;pattern recognition","G-Apriori;GwIAprior;antimonotonic property;gap constraint;index Apriori;level-wise algorithm;repeating pattern mining","","1","","15","","","25-27 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most existing software tools are sophisticated in visualizing and manipulating protein 3-D structures. However, these tools are inconvenient to retrieve strands alignment information and are not so intuitive to illustrate the AAs pairs on strands. In the present study, we present a new software toolkit, called StrandPairsViewer, which can read protein structures data in PDB file and extract AAs pairs as well as peptide chain sequences, sheet structures and strand alignments. It can demonstrate AAs pairs in an intuitive color text that can be pasted into other word-processing software for further editing. The toolkit also supports aligning coding nucleic acid sequences along with the paired strands in color for finding additional folding information from nucleic acids. StrandPairsViewer also enables to make statistical analysis on AAs pairs, as well as manage user's dataset effectively. The proposed toolkit has a convenient and intuitive interface that is potentially helpful and may assist in the protein structures and protein folding study, as a useful complement to the existing visualization tools for protein 3-D structures.

First, the approximation candidates can be obtained quickly by constructing and looking up the compact gradient mapping table based on the distribution sharing of the contours characteristics of the patterns. Then, Hough transform needs to be applied only in a very small parameter space defined by the candidates for the final approximation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have approximated 1628 image patches from 100 images.

An important problem in separation of pitched musical sounds is the estimation of time-frequency regions where harmonics overlap. In this paper, we propose a sinusoidal modeling-based separation system that can effectively resolve overlapping harmonics. Our strategy is based on the observations that harmonics of the same source have correlated amplitude envelopes and that the change in phase of a harmonic is related to the instrument's pitch. We use these two observations in a least squares estimation framework for separation of overlapping harmonics. The system directly distributes mixture energy for harmonics that are unobstructed by other sources. Quantitative evaluation of the proposed system is shown when ground truth pitch information is available, when rough pitch estimates are provided in the form of a MIDI score, and finally, when a multi pitch tracking algorithm is used. We also introduce a technique to improve the accuracy of rough pitch estimates. Results show that the proposed system significantly outperforms related monaural musical sound separation systems.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2020886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165119","Common amplitude modulation (CAM);musical sound separation;sinusoidal modeling;time–frequency masking;underdetermined sound separation","Amplitude modulation;Computer science;Image analysis;Independent component analysis;Instruments;Least squares approximation;Music information retrieval;Psychoacoustic models;Signal processing algorithms;Sparse matrices","amplitude modulation;audio signal processing;frequency estimation;harmonic analysis;least squares approximations;music;source separation;time-frequency analysis;tracking","MIDI score;common amplitude modulation;harmonics overlap separation;least squares estimation framework;monaural musical sound separation;multi pitch tracking algorithm;pitch amplitude modulation;sinusoidal modeling;time-frequency region estimation","","17","","39","","","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The 6LoWPAN-SNMP is an extended modification of the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). Compared to traditional IP-networks, 6LoWPAN is a severely resource-constrained network; hence, existing SNMP protocols need to be modified to meet the goals in RFC 4919, ldquo6LoWPAN Problems and Goalsrdquo. The proposed 6LoWPAN-SNMP provides for native communication of SNMP messages on LoWPAN networks. The proposed mechanism is resource-efficient and fully compatible with the standard SNMP. It utilizes SNMP header compression and provides extended protocol operations to reduce the number of SNMP messages generated among the SNMP entities. Compatibility with the standard SNMP is achieved by a proxy forwarder on the 6LoWPAN gateway. The proposed mechanism is implemented on actual hardware platforms using the open-source Net-SNMP library and the Berkeley 6LoWPAN on the TinyOS 2.1. The feasibility and effectiveness of 6LoWPAN-SNMP is evaluated. The experimental results show that 6LoWPAN can be effectively supported with network management functionality based on SNMP.","","POD:978-1-4244-4600-1","10.1109/HPCC.2009.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5167008","6LoWPAN;IEEE 802.15.4;IPv6;SNMP","Computer network management;Computer science;Conference management;Hardware;High performance computing;Information management;Information retrieval;Internet;Wireless application protocol;Wireless personal area networks","IP networks;computer network management;internetworking;personal area networks;transport protocols","6L0WPAN gateway;6LoWPAN-SNMP message;Berkeley WPAN;IPv6-enabled low-power wireless personal area network;SNMP header compression;TinyOS 2.1;open-source Net-SNMP library;proxy forwarder;resource-constrained network;simple network management protocol","","5","","24","","","25-27 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Next, the scheme uses the k-nearest neighbor K-NN algorithm to select the 40 most ldquosimilarrdquo regions with the same computational level from a large reference library, and computes the mutual information (MI) between the query ROI and each of the selected ROIs from the database. Finally, 15 regions with the highest MI values, which seem to be the most visual similar to the query ROI, are selected and displayed to the observers. We tested the proposed method involving 80 queries, on average the 73.8% of the displayed ROIs are considered semantic and visual similar to the query region.
