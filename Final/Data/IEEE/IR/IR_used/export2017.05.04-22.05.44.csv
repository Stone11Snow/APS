Available data is often not sufficient to allow a precise evaluation and user preferences are usually vague. In this paper, a model for deciding under imperfect information is presented. The decision model handles two types of imperfections: imprecisions on the side of the alternatives and vagueness in the preferences of the users. Incomplete description of the alternatives may result in imprecisions in the evaluation of their features. The decision model provides a framework to reduce these imprecisions by completing information from external sources. Besides, fuzzy query conditions allow users to express vague preferences. A scenario illustrates the use of the decision model where the goal is to select a rental apartment from classified advertisements with respect to its availability by public transport","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-0680-1","10.1109/DEXA.2000.875078","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875078","","Diabetes;Electronic commerce;Electronic mail;Energy efficiency;Food products;Information retrieval;Internet;Investments;Packaging;Power generation economics","decision support systems;electronic commerce;fuzzy logic","decision support;electronic commerce;fuzzy query conditions;imperfections;user preferences","","1","","10","","","2000","04 Sep 2000-08 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Methods based on hashing techniques to minimise the cost of answering range queries by taking the query distribution into account have previously been proposed. These methods have all assumed a uniform distribution of data to disk pages to achieve good performance. This assumption makes them less useful in practice because most real data distributions are non-uniform. In this paper, we discuss a method to eliminate this restriction. Extensive experimentation using a multi-dimensional file structure, the BANG file, indicates that our method results in good performance for all data distributions. In one case an improvement of over 36 times was achieved without compromising the storage utilisation. Our method also results in a stable and efficient file organisation.

Combined with a state-of-the-art text-to-speech synthesizer (TTS), it generates video animations of talking heads that closely resemble real people. To obtain a naturally looking head, we choose a “data-driven” approach. We record a talking person and apply image recognition to extract automatically bitmaps of facial parts. These bitmaps are normalized and parameterized before being entered into a database. For synthesis, the TTS provides the audio track, as well as the phonetic transcript from which trajectories in the space of parameterized bitmaps are computed for all facial parts. Sampling these trajectories and retrieving the corresponding bitmaps from the database produces animated facial parts. These facial parts are then projected and blended onto an image of the whole head using its pose information. This talking head model can produce new never recorded speech of the person who was originally recorded. Talking-head animations of this type are useful as a front-end for agents and avatars in multimedia applications such as virtual operators, virtual announcers, help desks, educational, and expert systems","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/6046.865480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=865480","","Animation;Humans;Image databases;Image recognition;Image sampling;Information retrieval;Magnetic heads;Speech synthesis;Synthesizers;Trajectory","computer animation;face recognition;multimedia computing;realistic images;software agents;speech synthesis","agents;audio track;avatars;computer vision;data-driven approach;educational systems;expert systems;face recognition;facial animation;facial parts;help desks;human head;image recognition;image samples;multimedia applications;phonetic transcripts;photo-realistic talking-heads;pose information;sample-based image synthesis;talking-head animations;text-to-speech synthesizer;video animations;virtual announcers;virtual operators","","59","28","43","","","Sep 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Based on the notion of powerdomain partition, which characterise a knowledge domain by partitioning on its finite powerset, we then exam the expressiveness of the KRA and show that it expresses exactly the set of all possible relations that are invariant under knowledge database automorphism of databases.

As a result, the research and development of continuous media servers has received more attention in recent years. In general, these servers consist of multiple zone-bit recording (ZBR) disks or multiple storage nodes connected through the high-speed network to construct a distributed server. One key issue in developing continuous media servers is the allocation of data into ZBR disks. We propose a novel data placement scheme, called VARBT (variable block-size and data-transfer-time), to fully utilize the characteristics of ZBR disks. The proposed scheme determines data block size in each zone completely according to the capacity of that zone thus the storage utilization is 100%. During the process of data retrieval, the data transfer rate for each block is equal to the bandwidth of each physical zone thus the bandwidth utilization is also maximal. This scheme can be applied not only to a single-disk platform, but also to a multiple-disk server and even a distributed server with multiple storage nodes. Through simulations and performance evaluation, we found that VARBT scheme has the smaller average block size, required memory space and system response time to support more simultaneous streams, and meanwhile it achieves 100% storage utilization and bandwidth utilization","","POD:0-7695-0540-6","10.1109/ITCC.2000.844238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=844238","","Bandwidth;Computer architecture;Disk recording;Electronic mail;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Network servers;Performance evaluation;Research and development;Space technology","magnetic disc storage;multimedia databases;multimedia servers;performance evaluation;storage allocation","ZBR disks;bandwidth utilization;continuous media servers;data placement scheme;data retrieval;distributed server;high-speed network;multimedia servers;multiple storage nodes;multiple zone-bit recording disks;performance evaluation;simulation;storage allocation;variable block size data transfer time","","0","","10","","","2000","27 Mar 2000-29 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Database middleware systems such as Garlic allow users to combine data from multiple sources in a single query. Garlic provides the user with a virtual database to which they can pose arbitrarily complex queries, though the actual data needed to answer the query may be stored in several different sources, and those sources may not even possess all the functionality needed to answer such a query themselves. The Garlic technology, as incorporated in IBM's DB2 product, forms the basis of the DiscoveryLink service offering for the life sciences industry.

Even quite successful approaches of similarity computation have problems in identifying the best context of classification.

A concrete example is to search a database of aerial images so as to retrieve the GPS coordinates of a known scene. Our representation is based on a hierarchy of color histograms and offers a compromise between methods based on a global histogram and methods based on multiple histograms corresponding to segmented regions. Our method retains positional information better than the above schemes and naturally leads to a multi-level comparison strategy where mismatches are quickly discarded at higher levels.

We offer a framework for treating both kinds of irregularities uniformly by using the notion of exception handling (with human agents as potential online exception handlers) and applying it to processes that have been reified as objects in classes with steps as attributes. As a result, only a small number of new constructs, which can be applied orthogonally, need to be introduced.

Recently, various approaches have been proposed to improve disk throughput under guaranteed real-time requirements. SCAN-EDF, which scans the disk surface to retrieve the task data block under the disk head in order to re-schedule tasks in a real-time EDF (earliest deadline first) schedule, is one of the best-known real-time disk scheduling methods. Since tasks rescheduled in SCAN-EDF should have the same deadline, its efficiency depends on the number of tasks with the same deadline. If all tasks have different deadlines, the scheduling results of SCAN-EDF would be the same as EDF. In this paper, we improve SCAN-EDF by applying different hybrid local-merging and global-inserting schemes. As opposed to SCAN-EDF, in our method tasks rescheduled by SCAN may have different deadlines. Its efficiency is not limited by the number of tasks that have the same deadlines. Experiments show that the proposed method is significantly better than SCAN-EDF.

For this purpose 27 days of ERS-2 SAR wave mode data were processed to single look complex SAR images, representing a total of 34310 images of size 5 km×10 km, available every 200 km along the satellite track. In this paper two methods for retrieving wind speeds from SAR images are presented and validated, showing the applicability of both methods for global ocean wind retrieval. The first method is based on the well tested empirical C-band scatterometer (SCAT) models which describe the dependency of the normalized radar cross section (NRCS) on wind speed and direction. To apply C-band models to SAR data the NRCS has to be accurately calibrated. This is achieved by a new simple but effective method using a subset of collocated ERS-2 SCAT and model winds from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF). SAR derived wind speeds are compared to the entire set of collocated ERS-2 SCAT and ECMWF model data. Comparison to ERS-2 SCAT results in a correlation of 0.94 with a bias of -0.45 m s<sup>-1</sup> and a root mean square error of 1.21 m s<sup>-1</sup>. The second approach is based on neural network algorithms allowing one to retrieve wind speeds from uncalibrated SAR images. For this purpose a neural network is trained using ERS-2 SAR data and collocated wind data from ERS-2 SCAT and the ECMWF atmospheric model. Validation of the neural network retrieved SAR wind speeds to ERS-2 SCAT and ECMWF model wind data is performed. A correlation of 0.95 with a bias of -0.1 m s<sup>-1 </sup> and a root mean square error of 1.03 m s<sup>-1</sup> is achieved in comparison to ERS-2 SCAT","","POD:0-7803-7031-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2001.976908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976908","","Atmospheric modeling;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Oceans;Root mean square;Satellites;Weather forecasting;Wind forecasting;Wind speed","neural nets;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","C-band scatterometer models;ERS-2 SAR wave mode data;ERS-2 SCAT data;European remote sensing satellite;SAR images;complex SAR data;global wind speed retrieval;neural networks;normalized radar cross section;scatterometer models;synthetic aperture radar wave mode data;wind direction","","3","","16","","","2001","09 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These three deficiencies relate to all of the components of the database system. That is, the first issue depends on the data model or indexing, the second on DBMS construction and the last relates to the user interface.

The sensor has new and very significant capabilities, especially in terms of multi-angular viewing configuration. In this study, the retrieval capabilities of SMOS, based on the actual system configuration have been assessed. From model simulations, the uncertainities on the retrieved variables is computed as a function of the uncertainties associated with both remotely sensed data (radiometric sensitivity ΔT, systematic bias) and model input parameters (errors are accounted for in the estimates of surface temperature and vegetation optical thickness, if one- or two-parameter retrievals are carried out). The simulations are performed using the τ-ω approach, which provides accurate simulations of the passive microwave signature of the land surface at L-band. This study shows how and why the 2D interferometry concept, applied to Earth remote sensing from space, may bring a major qualitative improvement, thanks to the ability to obtain many data over a significant range of viewing angles. SMOS is the first mission which aims at demonstrating and using this feature.

Between two sets of pivots of the same size, better-chosen pivots can reduce the search time. Alternatively, a better-chosen small set of pivots (requiring less space) can yield the same efficiency as a larger, randomly chosen set. We propose an efficiency measure to compare two pivot sets, combined with an optimization technique that allows selecting good sets of pivots.

As a result, we can modify, update database information without taking down the whole system. This is the main objective in combining both XML and LDAP in a network model.

The ability to automatically extract video content of this nature will lead to a high level of personalization in broadcast delivery to private users, as well as considerably broadening the possibilities of efficiently handling and presenting large amounts of audio-visual data stored in emerging video databases. The technique we have developed uses the so-called ""dimensional approach to affect"" concept underlined by psychophysiology studies. Our computational method sets to represent the affective content as feature points in the so-called 2D emotion space. We manage to obtain time curves that represent the two affect dimensions (arousal and valence) for a video, considered respectively, from low-level video characteristics. Combining the two time curves results in the so-called affect curve that is regarded as a reliable representation of transitions from one feeling to another along a video, as perceived by a viewer.

We suggest a compression technique that allows for the subsequent use of a spatial index structure to guide a spatial search. In response to a window query, our algorithm delivers a compressed partial image, or the exact uncompressed requested image region.

The goal of this paper is to improve spatial scalability of MPEG-2 for progressive video. In order to avoid problems with too large bitstreams of the base layer produced by some of the hitherto proposed spatially scalable coders, spatio-temporal scalability is proposed for video compression systems. It is assumed that a coder produces two bitstreams, where the base-layer bitstream corresponds to pictures with reduced both spatial and temporal resolution while the enhancement layer bitstream is used to transmit the information needed to retrieve images with full spatial and temporal resolution.

We introduce a logical formalism for expressing approximate pattern matching. The formalism uses properties of the dynamic programming approach; a minimizing path of a dynamic programming table is expressed by using a formula in an extension of first-order logic (FO). We consider the well-known problems of k mismatches and k differences. Assuming first that k is given as a part of the input, those problems are expressed by using deterministic transitive closure logic (FO(DTC)) and transitive closure logic (FO(TC)), respectively. We believe that in the general case the k differences is not expressible in FO(DTC), and show that solving this question in the affirmative is at least as hard as separating LOGSPACE from NLOGSPACE.

The constraint model provided by MPGS is very flexible and powerful in terms of the kinds of object constraints it can represent.

The proposed method examines every third row of the the image and checks whether this row passes through a horizontal text region. For a given row R, the pixels of R are hierarchically clustered in L*a*b* space and each cluster is tested whether similar-colored pixels in R's vicinity are possibly part of a text region.

The problem is made difficult by the presence of clutter in a scene, as well as the fact that objects may be imaged under different lighting conditions. We have developed a feature localization scheme that finds a set of locales in an image. Our object search method matches image locales with model object locales. We make use of a diagonal model for illumination change so that each candidate assignment of model to image locales produces a possible set of lighting transformation coefficients in chromaticity space. A combinatoric search for the locale assignment problem is obviated by matching each model locale to every image locale and carrying out a voting scheme in the space of lighting coefficients. This efficiently finds the lighting change. As well, for each pair of coefficients we perform an elastic correlation on locale chromaticity. Locale centroids produce a pose estimation via a displacement model, and we can further apply texture histogram intersection and finally a generalized Hough transform efficiently since the rotation, scale and translation parameters have been recovered.

The scope of the COBWEB (COntext-Based image retrieval on the WEB) project (EP28773) is to create a pioneer system that provides a solution to the problem of automatically storing and retrieving images from large image databases dispersed over the Internet. The project focuses on the following issues. (i) Development of effective algorithms for automatic storage of the visual features of the images, which can be used as a means for retrieving similar images. (ii) Creation of a simple, cross-platform user interface that helps the user to query the database in the most natural way. (iii) Development of a robust communication subsystem that guarantees satisfying retrieval times. In this paper, we describe the architecture and implementation details of the human-computer interface (HCI) and the intelligent search component (ISC), which are two of the main components of the COBWEB system. The HCI consists of a graphical interface, which enables the user to interact with the system. It provides the user with various approaches in querying the database, including keyword specification and sample image submission.

The paper presents a discussion on problems such as the system mistakenly indentifying a concept, a large number of trials to achieve clustering, etc. Experiments on synthetic data and real image database demonstrate the efficacy of this approach","","POD:0-7695-1354-9","10.1109/IVL.2001.990860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=990860","","Boosting;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Spatial databases;Visual databases","content-based retrieval;fuzzy set theory;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;statistical analysis;visual databases","content-based image retrieval system;fast retrievals;fuzzy clustering;human concept distribution;image representation;meta knowledge;real image database;relevance weights;retrieval experiences;statistical learning;synthetic data;visual concept learning","","2","","11","","","2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hydro-Quebec's research institute, IREQ, thus developed the Capacity Indicator and Load Measuring System (CILMS) after three years of R&D efforts aimed at increasing the safety of articulated aerial lifts and validating new work-related methods. The embedded system, located near the bucket, displays the available load capacity and the actual load on the jib. The available capacity is based on the lift geometry. Sensors located on the lower and upper boom and on the jib transmit the angles and length to a microprocessor which processes the information, and then retrieves and displays the capacity in real time. The actual load on the jib is measured at the tip of the jib with a tool interface made up of two load pins. Any load lifted with the jib is calculated in terms of amplitude and angle, after which the amplitude is displayed in real time. Radio communication is used for lower boom angle and load pin measurements to preserve the lift's dielectric insulation. A signal is transmitted to a visual and audible alarm whenever the load exceeds the capacity. If an alarm sounds, the system then records the date and time, the geometry of the lift, and the load. These data are easily read and the operating parameters can be viewed or modified using the pushbuttons on the display unit","","POD:0-7803-6625-5","10.1109/TDCLLM.2000.882862","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=882862","","Capacitive sensors;Displays;Embedded system;Geometry;Information retrieval;Microprocessors;Pins;Power transformer insulation;Radio communication;Safety","computerised instrumentation;distribution networks;lifts;mechanical variables measurement;power transformers;safety","Hydro-Quebec's research institute;IREQ;R&D;aerial devices;articulated aerial lifts;audible alarm;capacity indicator;capacity indicator and load measuring system;distribution network;jib load measurement;lift dielectric insulation;lift geometry;load measuring system;load pin measurements;load pins;radio communication;safety;sensors;transformer lifting;visual alarm;work-related methods","","0","","","","","2000","08 Oct 2000-12 Oct 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Results show a good correlation between the backscattering coefficient σ<sup>0</sup> (with a 6-dB dynamic range and R<sup>2</sup>&ges;0.8), the stand timber volume and the stand density. In fact, the trend is mainly driven by stand density and different relationships are observed according to age class, which explicitly points out the effects of canopy structure on the backscattering level. Stem volume is derived from the inversion of a semi-empirical model by taking into account these effects. Inversion results show a global accuracy of ca. 21 m<sup>3</sup>/ha.

Despite substantial reduction of these bidirectional effects through the calculation of vegetation indices (VIs), residual impacts still remain on 10-days products derived from the maximum value compositing (MVC). The association of different orbital tracks on a same image creates patchwork artifacts while the time behavior of reflectances and VIs exhibits erratic changes. The reduction of these noise-like fluctuations can be done by retrieving the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To fit a BRDF model requires the collecting of a data set, commonly achieved using a sliding time window of constant length from daily acquisitions. Once the BRDF retrieved, the data can be composed, by selecting a distinctive subset of data, correcting it from directional effects and choosing a way to combine it. The objective of this study is to adapt such a process, referred hereinafter as 'directional compositing', to the VEGETATION (SPOT satellite) system characteristics and production line requirements","","POD:0-7803-6359-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2000.858339","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=858339","","Bidirectional control;Distribution functions;Fluctuations;Geometrical optics;Information retrieval;Noise reduction;Optical sensors;Orbital calculations;Satellites;Vegetation mapping","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;remote sensing;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","10-days compositing method;BRDF;SPOT;VEGETATION;bidirectional effect;bidirectional reflectance distribution function;directional compositing;geophysical measurement technique;land surface;maximum value compositing;multispectral remote sensing;optical method;satellite remote sensing;source-target-sensor geometry;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","","0","","6","","","2000","24 Jul 2000-28 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fortunately, several access structures for high dimensional spaces, e.g., the SS-tree, SR-tree and M-tree have been proposed. However, each of those structures have been benchmarked in a rather ad-hoc manner. The paper benchmarks and compares all the above structures using a real dataset of 40000 high dimensional objects.

To characterize forest changes, it is useful to parameterize a forest using several parameters, such as biomass, basal area, tree density, tree height, and trunk diameter. These parameters are not independent and some of them are related by allometric equations. Remote sensing data can be used for estimating some forest parameters and others may be retrieved using allometric equations. Many researchers reported algorithms to estimate forest parameters using polarimetric SAR data. However, these algorithms cannot be applied to all types of forests without additional information on the forest type and environmental conditions since radar measurements depend on the tree structure, incidence angle, and environmental conditions. The backscattering cross section also saturates as forest parameters, such as biomass and the tree height, increase. Forest parameters also have been estimated using SAR interferometry. Specifically, the interferometric correlation coefficient has been used to estimate the angular range of volume scattering.

However, inherent subjectivity in user perception of an image results in retrieved images that are largely irrelevant to the user. We propose a novel methodology for efficient understanding of user perception from the query image itself. Our system automatically generates a set of modified images, after the user selects object(s) of interest from the segmented query image. Our goal is to learn the retrieval parameters by modifying the segment-level description of the query image. Segment-level description includes individual segment properties as well as the inter-segment relationships. The user perception is then learnt on the basis of user feedback on this set of modified images. We demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed approach with examples.

The coordinate transformation from surface to image coordinates, due to the perspective projection, transforms each homogeneous sinusoidal component of the surface texture into a sinusoid whose frequency is a function of location. The functional dependence of the sinusoid phase in location is uniquely determined by the tilt and slant angles of the surface. From the physical model of the perspective projection, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound on the error variance of estimating the tilt and slant of the observed surface in the presence of observation noise. It is shown in this paper that the phase of each of the sinusoids can be expressed as a linear function of some variables that are related to the surface tilt and slant angles. Using the phase differencing algorithm, we fit a polynomial phase model to a sinusoidal component of the observed texture. Substituting in the derived linear relation, the unknown phase with the one estimated using the phase differencing algorithm, we obtain a closed-form, analytic, and computationally efficient solution to the problem of estimating the tilt and slant angles. The algorithm performance is shown to be close to the Cramer-Rao bound, even for low signal-to-noise ratios, at computational complexity which is considerably lower than that of any existing algorithm","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/18.857800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=857800","","Frequency;Image coding;Image segmentation;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Phase estimation;Polynomials;Surface fitting;Surface texture","computational complexity;image texture;parameter estimation;polynomials","Cramer-Rao lower bound;closed-form analytic computationally efficient solution;computational complexity;coordinate transformation;coordinates;error variance;functional dependence;homogeneous sinusoidal component;linear function;noisy observed image;observation noise;orientation;parametric solution;perspective projection;phase differencing algorithm;planar surfaces;polynomial phase model;sinusoid phase;slant angle;textured surface;tilt","","9","","23","","","Aug 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Systems that model human performance, or that use robust image matching methods, often use nonmetric similarity judgments; but when the triangle inequality is not obeyed, most pattern recognition techniques are not applicable. Exemplar-based (nearest-neighbor) methods can be applied to a wide class of nonmetric similarity functions. The key issue, however, is to find methods for choosing good representatives of a class that accurately characterize it. We show that existing condensing techniques are ill-suited to deal with nonmetric dataspaces. We develop techniques for solving this problem, emphasizing two points: First, we show that the distance between images is not a good measure of how well one image can represent another in nonmetric spaces. Instead, we use the vector correlation between the distances from each image to other previously seen images. Second, we show that in nonmetric spaces, boundary points are less significant for capturing the structure of a class than in Euclidean spaces. We suggest that atypical points may be more important in describing classes. We demonstrate the importance of these ideas to learning that generalizes from experience by improving performance. We also suggest ways of applying parametric techniques to supervised learning problems that involve a specific nonmetric distance functions, showing how to generalize the idea of linear discriminant functions in a way that may be more useful in nonmetric spaces","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/34.862197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=862197","","Computer Society;Extraterrestrial measurements;Humans;Image matching;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Jacobian matrices;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Supervised learning","correlation methods;image classification;image representation;image retrieval;learning by example","appearance-based vision;atypical points;boundary points;class representation;exemplar-based methods;image classification;image retrieval;nearest-neighbor methods;nonmetric dataspaces;nonmetric distances;nonmetric similarity functions;nonmetric similarity judgments;robust image matching methods;triangle inequality;vector correlation","","96","3","44","","","Jun 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper attempts to address the shortfall by defining an audio structure that will allow content-based manipulation of audio at the level of audio objects. The paper then summarises the processes required to generate such a structure. Further, details are provided as to how the second level of this structure can be derived from a low-level perceptually based audio representation previously developed by the authors to satisfy the requirements at the lowest level of the audio structure.

A number of methods to derive local cost models have been suggested recently. However, these methods are only suitable for a static multidatabase environment. In this paper, we propose a new multi-state query sampling method to develop local cost models for a dynamic environment. The system contention level at a dynamic local site is divided into a number of discrete contention states based on the cost of a probing query. To determine an appropriate set of contention states for a dynamic environment, two algorithms based on iterative uniform partitioning and data clustering, respectively, are introduced. A qualitative variable is used to indicate the contention states for the dynamic environment. The techniques from our previous (static) query sampling method, including query sampling, automatic variable selection, regression analysis and model validation, are extended so as to develop a cost model incorporating the qualitative variable for a dynamic environment.
