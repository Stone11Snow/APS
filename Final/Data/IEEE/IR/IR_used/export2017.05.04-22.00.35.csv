The ability of logical approaches to give rise to more general information retrieval models is promising.

Our work is based on a logical model of information retrieval in which some classical representations can be modeled and matched.

A central problem in good text classification for information filtering and retrieval (IF/IR) is the high dimensionality of the data. It may contain many unnecessary and irrelevant features. To cope with this problem, we propose a hybrid technique using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Rough Sets theory (RS) to alleviate this situation. Given corpora of documents and a training set of examples of classified documents, the technique locates a minimal set of co-ordinate keywords to distinguish between classes of documents, reducing the dimensionality of the keyword vectors. This simplifies the creation of knowledge-based IF/IR systems, speeds up their operation, and allows easy editing of the rule bases employed. Besides, we generate several knowledge base instead of one knowledge base for the classification of new object, hoping that the combination of answers of the multiple knowledge bases result in better performance. Multiple knowledge bases can be formulated precisely and in a unified way within the framework of RS. This paper describes the proposed technique, discusses the integration of a keyword acquisition algorithm, Latent Semantic indexing (LSI) with Rough Set-based rule generate algorithm, and provides experimental results. The test results show the hybrid method is better than the previous rough set-based approach.","","POD:0-7695-1393-X","10.1109/WISE.2001.996486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996486","","Computer science;Indexing;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Rough sets;Testing;Text categorization","classification;information retrieval;rough set theory","Latent Semantic Indexing;hybrid text categorization;information filtering;information retrieval;rough sets theory;text classification;text documents","","1","1","21","","","3-6 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RBS groups the results by the ranked sources, which is sorted by their satisfied distances.

Portland International Conference on","20020807","2001","1","","435 vol.1","","Summary form only given. The paper aims to present our ongoing research-a novel approach towards the systematic definition and construction of the autonomous workgroup memory (AW memory). In introduction four general information-related problems are described, which workgroups have to face today. These are: (1) the overall information volume problem, (2) the problem of retrieving information according to the information context of the current task and its environment, (3) the need to form an easily accessible and homogeneous workgroup (e.g. organizational) memory, and (4) the twofold problem of psychological nature, based on a psychological cost in: (a) personal exchange of information and (b) attention distraction and desperation related to searching for information with ordinary search engines. In the second section related research works are presented (Answer garden, just-in-time information retrieval agents, TeamInfo, Information Lens and Knowledge Depot) and the difference to our approach is explained. The third, main section starts with an overall description of the approach we propose and explains the conceptual scheme of the AW memory. The paper concludes with plans for our future work, which will be directed towards refinement and a prototype implementation of the autonomous workgroup memory, with the assessment of its usability, appropriateness and efficacy.","","POD:1-890843-06-7","10.1109/PICMET.2001.952345","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952345","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Costs;Informatics;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Lenses;Optimization methods;Psychology;Search engines","groupware;information retrieval","Answer garden;Information Lens;Just-In-Time information retrieval agents;Knowledge Depot;TeamInfo;attention distraction;autonomous workgroup memory establishment;homogeneous workgroup memory;information context;information retrieval;information volume problem;personal exchange of information;psychological cost","","0","","","","","July 29 2001-Aug. 2 2001","29 Jul 2001-02 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fuzzy set methods have been already applied to the representation of flexible queries and to the modeling of uncertain pieces of information in databases systems, as well as in information retrieval. This methodology seems to be even more promising in multimedia databases which have a complex structure and from which documents have to be retrieved and selected not only from their contents, but also from “the idea” the user has of their appearance, through queries specified in terms of user's criteria. This paper provides a preliminary investigation of the potential applications of fuzzy logic in multimedia databases. The problem of comparing semistructured documents is first discussed. Querying issues are then more particularly emphasized. We distinguish two types of request, namely, those which can be handled within some extended version of an SQL-like language and those for which one has to elicit user's preference through examples","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.929896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=929896","","Content based retrieval;Database systems;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Multimedia systems;Quality of service","fuzzy logic;information retrieval;multimedia databases","SQL-like language;fuzzy logic techniques;fuzzy set methods;information retrieval;linguistic categories;multimedia database querying;numerical data;semistructured documents;user's preference","","18","","85","","","May/Jun 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"SNMP GetPrev: an efficient way to browse large MIB tables","D. Breitgand; D. Raz; Y. Shavitt","Lucent Technol. Bell Labs., Holmdel, NJ, USA","IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","20020807","2002","20","4","656","667","The simple network management protocol (SNMP) is a widely used standard for management of devices in Internet protocol networks. Part of the protocol great success is due to its simplicity; all the managed information is kept in a management information base (MIB) that can be accessed using SNMP queries to a software agent. We develop a general model that abstract the data retrieval process in SNMP. In particular, we study the amount of queries (communication) and time needed to randomly access an element in this model. It turns out that this question has practical importance. For some network management applications, e.g., MIB browsing, there is a need to traverse portions of a MIB tree, especially tables, in both directions. While the GetNext request defined by the SNMP standard allows an easy and fast access to the next columnar object instance or next scalar object, there is no corresponding operator defined in the SNMP framework for retrieving the previous MIB object instance. This, in effect, allows an efficient MIB traversal only in one direction and makes the search in the reverse direction problematic. This paper presents and analyzes the GetPrev application, a tool that enables the retrieval of the previous instances of a columnar objects or scalar MIB objects. Our GetPrev application uses only standard SNMP GetNext and Get requests to carry on a fast and bandwidth efficient search for the required object instance. For example, as predicted by our analysis and shown by our experiments, retrieving a value of the last columnar object instance in a large forwarding table (ipForwardTable) containing about 3000 entries can take several minutes using a sequence of the GetNext requests (the straightforward approach used, e.g., by widely deployed snmpwalk and snmptable applications). The GetPrev application presented in this paper retrieves this value using no more than 20 GetNext requests (in most cases about seven requests), taking no more than a second (i.e., it is two orders of magnitude faster and two to three orders of magnitude less bandwidth consuming)","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2002.1003033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003033","","Access protocols;Computer network management;Computer science;Content management;Graphical user interfaces;IP networks;Information management;Information retrieval;Routing;Software agents","Internet;computer network management;information retrieval;online front-ends;software agents;transport protocols","GetNext request;Internet protocol networks;M1B tree;SNMP Get requests;SNMP GetNext requests;SNMP GetPrev;SNMP queries;SNMP standard;bandwidth efficient search;columnar objects;data retrieval process;fast search;ipForwardTable;large MIB tables browsing;large forwarding table;managed information;management information base;previous MIB object instance retrieval;scalar MIB objects;simple network management protocol;snmpwalk;snrnptable;software agent","","8","","17","","","May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two important features make this approach applicable to multimedia information fusion, information retrieval, data mining, geographic information systems, and medical information systems: 1) any document, including a Web page, database record, video file, audio file, image and even paper documents, can be enhanced by an adlet and become an active document; and 2) any node in a nonactive network can be enhanced by adlet-savvy software and the adlet-enhanced node can coexist with other nonenhanced nodes.

Domain ontologies are frequently used to capture and formalize implicit domain-specific knowledge.

Unlike information retrieval systems very common today in the form of Internet search engines, Q/A systems do not retrieve documents, but instead provide short, relevant answers located in small fragments of text. This enhanced functionality comes with a price: Q/A systems are significantly slower and require more hardware resources than information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a distributed Q/A architecture that enhances the system throughput through the exploitation of interquestion parallelism and dynamic load balancing and reduces the individual question response time through the exploitation of intraquestion parallelism. Inter and intraquestion parallelism are both exploited using several scheduling points: one before the Q/A task is started and two embedded in the Q/A task. An analytical performance model is introduced. The model analyzes both the interquestion parallelism overhead generated by the migration of questions and the intraquestion parallelism overhead generated by the partitioning of the Q/A task.

By fusing temporal information into color content, DCHs for a ""group of frames"" (GoF) are trying to capture the dominant colors with long durations, which would be the colors of the focused objects or background.

During September 2000, active users spent 4,320 hours on the Web database and initiated 14,998 topic sessions, giving an average of seven hours and 25 sessions per user. The definition of a ""session"" has proved difficult, since the log data available is based on registered organizations, rather than on tasks or individual users.

These two planning factors must be well-scheduled, since badly-scheduled factors can cause longer execution times because of the higher routing costs. In addition to these two factors, the time constraints that reside on the nodes of the information repository (i.e. the information servers) also have to be dealt with. Consider the nodes that present correct information only for a certain time interval. If an agent is sent to gather information and arrives earlier than a specified update time, it may retrieve useless or corrupted information. To cope with these types of information retrieval, we propose a time-constrained MAP method which finds the minimum number of agents needed and the best scheduled agent itineraries for retrieving information from a distributed computing environment. The method works under the time constraints mentioned above, allows the completion time to be lower-bounded and minimizes routing overheads. Simulation results show that the proposed method produces results that are highly applicable to the time-constrained distributed information retrieval problem domain.","","POD:0-7695-1506-1","10.1109/ITCC.2002.1000444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000444","","Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Computer science;Costs;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Mobile agents;Processor scheduling;Routing;Time factors","costing;distributed programming;minimisation;planning (artificial intelligence);scheduling;search engines;software agents;telecommunication network routing","agent itinerary;completion time lower bound;correct information presentation;corrupted information retrieval;cost-effectiveness;distributed computing environment;execution time;information gathering;information repository nodes;information servers;minimum agent number;planning factor scheduling;routing costs;routing overhead minimization;simulation;time-constrained distributed information retrieval;time-constrained mobile agent planning method;timed mobile agents;update time;useless information retrieval","","2","","14","","","8-10 April 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though techniques exist for locating exact matches, finding relevant partial matches might be a problem. It may not be also easy to specify query requests precisely and completely - resulting in a situation known as a fuzzy-querying. It is usually not a problem for small domains, but for large repositories such as World Wide Web, a request specification becomes a bottleneck. Thus, a flexible retrieval algorithm is required, allowing for imprecise specification or search.

The network is based on M.L. Minsky's (1980) knowledge lines (k-lines) theory of memory storage and retrieval in the central nervous system. It employs arrays of self-organized map modules, such that the k-lines are implemented via link weights (address correlation) that are updated by learning. The network also employs features of forgetting and of interpolation and extrapolation, and is thus able to handle incomplete data sets. It can deal equally well with exact and fuzzy information, thus making it specifically applicable to medical diagnosis where the diagnosis is based on exact data, fuzzy patient interview information, patient histories, observed images and test records. Furthermore, the network can be operated in a closed loop with search engines to intelligently use data from the Internet in a higher learning hierarchy. All of the above features are shown to make the LAMSTAR network suitable for medical diagnosis problems that concern large data sets of many categories that are often incomplete and fuzzy. Applications of the network to three specific medical diagnosis problems are described: two from nephrology and one related to an emergency-room drug identification problem. It is shown that the LAMSTAR network is hundreds, and even thousands, times faster in its training than backpropagation-based networks when used for the same problem with exactly the same information.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/4233.945291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=945291","","Biological neural networks;Biomedical imaging;Central nervous system;Extrapolation;History;Information retrieval;Interpolation;Medical diagnosis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Neural networks","Internet;content-addressable storage;extrapolation;information retrieval;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;neurophysiology;search engines;self-organising feature maps","Internet;LAMSTAR neural net;adaptive system;address correlation;central nervous system;closed-loop operation;emergency-room drug identification;exact information;extrapolation;forgetting;fuzzy information;incomplete data sets;intelligent data use;interpolation;k-lines;knowledge lines;large data sets;large memory storage and retrieval;large-memory neural network;learning hierarchy;link weight updating;medical diagnosis applications;medical information retrieval;nephrology;observed images;patient histories;patient interview information;pattern recognition;search engines;self-organized map module arrays;self-organizing feature map;test records;training speed","Computational Biology;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Kidney Neoplasms;Neural Networks (Computer);Substance-Related Disorders","61","2","11","","","Sept. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One approach is to cluster the documents based on information provided only by users' usage logs and not by the content of the documents. A major advantage of this approach is that the relevancy information is objectively reflected by the usage logs; frequent simultaneous visits to two seemingly unrelated documents should indicate that they are in fact closely related. In this paper, we present a recursive density based clustering algorithm that can adaptively change its parameters intelligently. Our clustering algorithm RDBC (Recursive Density Based Clustering algorithm) is based on DBSCAN, a density based algorithm that has been proven in its ability in processing very large datasets. The fact that DBSCAN does not require the pre-determination of the number of clusters and is linear in time complexity makes it particularly attractive in web page clustering. It can be shown that RDBC require the same time complexity as that of the DBSCAN algorithm. In addition, we prove both analytically and experimentally that our method yields clustering results that are superior to that of DBSCAN.","","POD:0-7695-0981-9","10.1109/HICSS.2001.926536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926536","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Information retrieval;Scattering","Internet;computational complexity;information resources;information retrieval","DBSCAN;clustering algorithm RDBC;correlation-based document clustering;density based algorithm;information retrieval;recursive density based clustering algorithm;relevancy information;time complexity;very large datasets;web documents;web logs;web page clustering","","4","","14","","","6-6 Jan. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Text categorization is an interesting area for evaluating and quantifying the impact of linguistic information. Work on text retrieval through the Internet suggests that embedding linguistic information at a suitable level within traditional quantitative approaches is the crucial issue able to bring the experimental stage to operational results. This kind of representational problem is studied in this paper where traditional methods for statistical text categorization are augmented via a systematic use of linguistic information. The addition of NLP capabilities also suggested a different application of existing methods in revised forms. This paper presents an extension of the Rocchio formula as a feature weighting and selection model used as a basis for multilingual information extraction. It allows an effective exploitation of the available linguistic information that better emphasizes the latter with significant data compression and accuracy. The results is an original statistical classifier fed with linguistic features and characterized by the novel feature selection and weighting model. It outperforms existing systems while keeping most of their interesting properties.

Previous research on the detection of clones is mainly focused on identifying pieces of code with similar (or nearly similar) structure. Our approach is to examine the source code text (comments and identifiers) and identify implementations of similar high-level concepts (e.g., abstract data types). The approach uses an information retrieval technique (i.e., latent semantic indexing) to statically analyze the software system and determine semantic similarities between source code documents (i.e., functions, files, or code segments). These similarity measures are used to drive the clone detection process. The intention of our approach is to enhance and augment existing clone detection methods that are based on structural analysis. This synergistic use of methods will improve the quality of clone detection.

However, most previous information retrieval systems have not taken the pre-existing category information into account. In this paper, we present weight adjustment schemes based upon the category information in the vector-space model, which are able to select the most content-specific and discriminating features. Our experimental results on TREC data sets show that the pre-existing category information does provide additional beneficial information to improve retrieval. The proposed weight adjustment schemes perform better than the vector-space model with the inverse document frequency (IDF) weighting scheme when queries are less specific.

We report a system that can automatically determine whether an ROI is visible in the image, and can incorporate this into the metadata for individual images to enhance searching capability. The goal is to annotate each image with metadata regarding a number of ROIs. An experiment with the system annotated 236 advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) images of the North Atlantic from a five-month viewing period with descriptors that expressed the visibility of an ROI centered on Long Island, NY. For ground truth, we used the classifications of three human subjects to determine visibility of the same region of interest, and labeled the ROI with the majority decision of the three subjects. Partial cloud cover made the human determination subjective, and resulted in disagreements among the subjects.

There are many reasons why information access is difficult: users cannot track all the available information sources, few computer users are skilled in composing queries and ""everyday"" applications (e.g., word processors and spreadsheets) are not integrated with information access tools. Process-aware retrieval, however, offers a framework that shifts the burden of information access from the user to the computer. By explicitly representing processes, and information about processes, process-aware retrieval enables the computer to make highly targeted suggestions regarding knowledge and information sources, while aiding in the completion of process steps. This papers reviews current strategies for information access, evaluating strengths and weaknesses, and then defines a process-aware framework that builds on the strengths to address the weaknesses.","","POD:0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.994232","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=994232","","Application software;Availability;Computerized monitoring;Database languages;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Organizing;Software libraries;Workstations","information retrieval;planning (artificial intelligence);workflow management software","advanced digital libraries;information access;information retrieval systems;information sources;process-aware knowledge retrieval;process-aware retrieval","","4","","28","","","7-10 Jan. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many large organizations create and maintain huge volumes of textual information online, and there is a pressing need for support of efficient and effective information retrieval, filtering, and management. Text categorization, or the assignment of textual documents to one or more pre-defined categories based on their content, is an essential component of efficient management and retrieval of documents. Previously, research has focused predominantly on developing or adopting statistical classification or inductive learning methods for automatically discovering text categorization patterns for a pre-defined set of categories. However, as documents accumulate, such categories may not capture a document's characteristics correctly. In this study, we propose a mining-based category evolution (MiCE) technique to adjust document categories based on existing categories and their associated documents. Empirical evaluation results indicate that the proposed technique, MiCE, was more effective than the category discovery approach and was insensitive to the quality of original categories.","","POD:0-7695-0981-9","10.1109/HICSS.2001.927093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=927093","","Content based retrieval;Content management;Information filtering;Information filters;Information management;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Mice;Pressing;Text categorization","classification;data mining;document handling;information retrieval;learning by example","MiCE;free-format text;global connectivity;inductive learning methods;information retrieval;mining-based category evolution approach;online document categories management;statistical classification;text repositories","","1","2","24","","","6-6 Jan. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As many parallel sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithms exist, such an information retrieval approach lends itself to parallelism. This enables us to attack the problem of parallel information retrieval, which has resisted good scalability. We use sparse matrix compression algorithms and compare the storage of a subcollection of the commonly used NIST TREC corpus with a traditional inverted index. We demonstrate query processing using a sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithm. Our results indicate that our approach saves approximately 35% of the total storage requirements for the inverted index. Additionally to improve accuracy, we develop a novel matrix based relevance feedback technique as well as a proximity search algorithm.

The increasing amount of hyperlinked human knowledge available on the Web has shifted the research focus to the search engines that will deliver the needed information quickly. This demand has triggered a revisitation of the long-standing issue of semantics, which was never addressed adequately by information theory or linguistic theory. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, on the other hand, provide a powerful mathematical tool in modeling ""semantics."" The organization and the manipulation of information, knowledge base construction and discovery,. information retrieval and logical inferencing all deal with semantics in a fundamental way. Unless we experience a breakthrough in understanding semantics, especially related to machine automation, it will be difficult to make a quantum jump in accessing, creating, and modifying information. This paper intends to bring to center stage the complex problems of semantics confronted while dealing with natural language. The paper demonstrates the ability of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic to serve as a mathematical vehicle to model semantics in a significantly improved way.

An Auto-ID tag affixed to a physical object stores the GUIDe for that object. Networked tag readers wirelessly communicate with the Auto-ID tags, thereby connecting the physical objects to the network. An object's GUIDe acts as a pointer to storage locations for data and information about that object, operating in a similar manner to pointers in programming languages. Given a GUIDe, the Object Name Service (ONS), a facility similar to the Domain Name Service (DNS), is queried to identify these storage locations on the local network and over the Internet. Storing an object's data and information in a standardized XML-based language such as PML allows the use of Internet friendly query languages such as XQL and Quilt and enables the automated storage and retrieval of data and information at remote locations.

Since the number and nature of source signals (intended + interference signals) change, it is not practical to know them a priori. Therefore, it is not always practical to apply signal separation techniques that work well when the number of source signals is equal to the number of sensors. In addition, since how the signals get mixed is unknown, we need to apply blind techniques for the separation. This paper is concerned with a blind source separation (BSS) technique for the over-complete case (#signals > #sensors) that is based on the sparse decomposition and, the joint estimation of mixing matrix and the separated source signals by applying information theoretic based probabilistic approach.

ICSE 2001","20020807","2001","","","103","112","Focuses on investigating the combined use of semantic and structural information of programs to support the comprehension tasks involved in the maintenance and reengineering of software systems. ""Semantic information"" refers to the domain-specific issues (both the problem and the development domains) of a software system. The other dimension, structural information, refers to issues such as the actual syntactic structure of the program, along with the control and data flow that it represents. An advanced information retrieval method, latent semantic indexing, is used to define a semantic similarity measure between software components. Components within a software system are then clustered together using this similarity measure.

These algorithms utilize language models, a representation of the contents of each text collection over which selection is to be performed, but these language models cannot always be easily acquired. Query-based sampling is a technique by which these language models are discovered by interacting with a collection and observing the results. Previous work has shown query-based sampling to be a viable solution to the problem of discovering the contents of text collections when the information cannot be otherwise obtained. However, the characteristics of language models of WWW collections created using query-based sampling have not yet been studied. This work evaluates two query-based sampling techniques for building language models of three World Wide Web collections. Experimental results support the effectiveness of query-based sampling as a solution for building language models of web collections. This work also proposes a metric by which it may be possible to determine the point at which further sampling of a given web collection can cease. This metric is used along with other metrics used in previous work to determine the fidelity of these language models.","","POD:0-7695-1435-9","10.1109/HICSS.2002.993982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=993982","","Computer science;Contracts;Information retrieval;Internet;NASA;Natural languages;Sampling methods;Terminology;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;information resources;information retrieval;sampling methods","WWW collections;World Wide Web collections;information retrieval;language models;query-based sampling;selection algorithms;text collection;web collections","","2","","14","","","7-10 Jan. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems employ relevance feedback mechanism to learn user perception in terms of a set of model-parameters and in turn iteratively improve the retrieval performance. Since the quantity of user feedback is expected to be small, learning the user's perception essentially involves parameter estimation with very few training points. We propose a novel, and more efficient method for relevance feedback. Contrary to existing geometric model-based relevance feedback methods, the proposed technique explicitly uses information about irrelevant data points to estimate the parameters of the model. This algorithm iteratively updates the parameters of the similarity metric so as to fit the relevant examples while excluding the irrelevant ones. This is achieved by modifying the weights associated with the relevant examples.

Shaded leaf, shaded residue, and shaded soil areas are generally ignored, or treated as equivalent. This paper presents a method of determining shaded spectral reflectance profiles for component cover types by determining the mean multi-scattering ratio (the ratio of shaded-to-sunlit reflectance) and applying that mean to measured sunlit component spectral reflectance. In this method, the multi-scattering ratio is determined by FLAIR model inversion.

The implementation of this channel on MODIS was primarily based on previous analysis of hyperspectral imaging data collected with the Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). We describe an algorithm to retrieve cirrus bidirectional reflectance using channels near 0.66 and 1.38 μm. It is shown that the apparent reflectance of the 1.38-μm channel is essentially the bidirectional reflectance of cirrus clouds attenuated by the absorption of water vapor above cirrus clouds. A practical algorithm based on the scatterplot of 1.38-μm channel apparent reflectance versus 0.66-μm channel apparent reflectance has been developed to scale the effect of water vapor absorption so that the true cirrus reflectance in the visible spectral region can be obtained. To illustrate the applicability of the present algorithm, results for cirrus reflectance retrievals from AVIRIS and MODIS data are shown. The derived cirrus reflectance in the spectral region of 0.4-1 μm can be used to remove cirrus contamination in a satellite image obtained at a visible channel. An example of such an application is shown. The spatially averaged cirrus reflectances derived from MODIS data can be used to establish global cirrus climatology, as is demonstrated by a sample global cirrus reflectance image.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.802454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1035996","","Aircraft;Bidirectional control;Clouds;Electromagnetic wave absorption;Hyperspectral imaging;Image resolution;Information retrieval;MODIS;Reflectivity;Satellites","atmospheric techniques;clouds;imaging;infrared imaging;remote sensing","0.66 micron;1.38 micron;AVIRIS data;IR channels;MODIS;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-Radiometer;Terra satellite;aircraft data;algorithm;apparent reflectance;atmosphere;bidirectional reflectance;cirrus cloud reflectances;global cirrus climatology;global cirrus reflectance image;high clouds;hyperspectral imaging data;remote sensing;satellite data;visible channel;water vapour absorption","","74","","22","","","Aug 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

EnviSat also embarks a radiometer, the MWR which provides the altimeter with the tropospheric correction.

During this activity the operation of the instrument in-flight operation will be verified and its functionality optimised. The measurement performance of the instrument and the overall system will also be evaluated, including verification of the instrument auxiliary data retrieval and correct use of these data in the ground processing algorithms.

In this paper we will outline the strategy and procedures adopted to tune the parameters used on-board and in the on-ground processing. We show results before and after the optimisation activities as well as comparison with pre-flight simulations. Also, we will show the RA-2 measurement performance of range and sigma-0 as well as the performance of its tracker. In particular the tuning of the autonomous range resolution selection logic is a challenging task and we will show the results of this activity. Finally we will show the status of the in-flight calibration of the Range and Sigma-0.","","POD:0-7803-7536-X","10.1109/IGARSS.2002.1025121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1025121","","Calibration;Data processing;Information retrieval;Instruments;Performance evaluation;Radar tracking;Radiometry;Robustness;Satellite broadcasting;Spaceborne radar","calibration;geophysical techniques;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;terrain mapping","ENVISAT;EnviSat-1;MWR;RA-2;atmosphere;geophysical measurement technique;land surface;meteorology;microwave radiometry;ocean;performance;radar altimeter;radar altimetry;radar remote sensing;satellite remote sensing;sea surface;spaceborne radar;terrain mapping","","3","","","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper attempts to address both problems by suggesting a collaborative yet personalized approach for Web-based multimedia retrieval, which employs a synergy between the relevance feedback technique from the information retrieval community, and the user profiling technique from the information filtering community. Specifically, a ""common profile"" is established to represent the common knowledge on the semantics of multimedia data, which allow a user to ""learn from others"" in the retrieval process. On the other hand, for each user a ""user profile"" is constructed to characterize his/her personal views, which allow a user to ""learn from own history"". Both types of profiles can be learned and updated incrementally from user feedback. By using an integrated retrieval algorithm based on profiles, this approach strikes the balance between exploiting the common knowledge of most users and catering for the personalized interest of a particular user. The results of some preliminary experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","POD:0-7695-1393-X","10.1109/WISE.2001.996470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996470","","Collaboration;Computer science;Feedback;Humans;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information filtering;Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Search engines","Internet;indexing;information needs;information resources;multimedia systems;relevance feedback","Internet;Web-based multimedia retrieval;common knowledge;experiments;information filtering;information retrieval;personalized user interests;personalized views;relevance feedback;semantic indexes;semantics;user feedback;user profiling","","0","2","16","","","3-6 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme is called constrained similarity measure (CSM), which not only takes into consideration the perceptual similarity between images, but also significantly improves the retrieval performance of the Euclidean distance measure. Two techniques, support vector machine (SVM) and AdaBoost from machine learning, are utilized to learn the boundary. They are compared to see their differences in boundary learning. The positive and negative examples used to learn the boundary are provided by the user with relevance feedback. The CSM metric is evaluated in a large database of 10009 natural images with an accurate ground truth.

Recently, a lot of 3D models have been created and stored because of the great demand for CG animation productions and 3D game productions. Thus we need a 3D model database system that allows us to retrieve required models easily and accurately. The development of such a system poses two main problems: which feature can be assumed to be the best similarity measure among 3D models, and what is the best way to specify the query. The author proposes the use of a hand sketch image to deal with the second problem. The author has developed a 3D model database system based on silhouette image matching. Silhouette image matching means a similarity measure between a 3D model's silhouette images and the hand sketch images; this is a solution of the first problem.

The colour distribution is quantised according to a scale-parameter obtained by convolving the distribution function with Gaussians of increasing size. The generated family of histograms is then used to define descriptors at various levels of detail. Using this hierarchical descriptor structure large sets of non-similar images are discriminated at very low computational cost using low detailed descriptions. The search is then refined progressively until only a few very similar objects or images are found and ranked using higher levels of detail.

For a business organization to remain on competition, there is a need to acquire knowledge according to the context of their business. This is particularly true in the product design field because designers frequently use images and drawings containing semantics level and task models extensively. Therefore it will be advantageous for design task performances if the designer is able to describe the conceptual and semantic level of these pictures. Another challenge is to transform this information into knowledge that can be reused and shared in some design sections or business communities.

A POLDER sensor, mounted on the Earth observation satellite ADEOS in 1996, is a unique sensor which can gather multi-(up to 14) directional polarization measurements of one target. Two channels of POLDER in the near infrared wavelengths are examined in this study. The first channel is in the water vapor absorption band of 0.910 μm and the second is in the gas absorption-free band of 0.865 μm. In practice, a ratio of each reflectance for these two channels is used to estimate the total column water vapor content. This algorithm is referred to as the two-channel ratio method. It is shown that the global distribution of water vapor content from the POLDER data present the typical characteristics of spatial and temporal changes. The water vapor content has high values over the tropical zone and decreases with latitude. Furthermore, the Indian monsoon is clearly demonstrated in the water vapor map.

Practice has shown that both types of operations are needed for an efficient image database management system. Particularly in medical image databases, such a mixed form of retrieval is very important. We first present a global image data model that supports both metadata and low-level descriptions of images. We illustrate our work with real examples in the medical domain. Then, using an original image data repository model, we show how relational and similarity-based operations can be integrated.

This work concerns a technique, called the latent semantic indexing (LSI), which has been used for textual information retrieval for many years. In this environment, LSI determines clusters of co-occurring keywords so that a query which uses a particular keyword can then retrieve documents perhaps not containing this keyword, but containing other keywords from the same cluster. In this paper, we examine the use of this technique for content-based web document retrieval, using both keywords and image features to represent the documents. Two different approaches to image feature representation, namely, color histograms and color anglograms, are adopted and evaluated. Experimental results show that LSI, together with both textual and visual features, is able to extract the underlying semantic structure of web documents, thus helping to improve the retrieval performance significantly, even when querying is done using only keywords.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2002.1017733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017733","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Navigation;Search engines;Web sites","Internet;image colour analysis;image retrieval;indexing;information retrieval;multimedia computing","Internet;color anglograms;color histograms;image feature representation;keyword;latent semantic indexing;multimedia;text-based document retrieval;web document retrieval","","87","12","42","","","Jun 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A look-up table approach in combination with the radiance transfer code MODTRAN4.2 was applied to preprocessed at-sensor radiance data to retrieve surface reflectance. Results indicate that the spectral calibration data provided do not achieve a proper positioning of the bands' centre wavelengths. Wavelength shifts of up to 1 nm in the VNIR and up to 3 nm in the SWIR remain.

The automatic learning mode has been applied to optimize the relevance feedback (RF) method and the single radial basis function-based RF method. In addition, a semiautomatic version is proposed to support retrieval with different user subjectivities. Image similarity is evaluated by a nonlinear model, which performs discrimination based on local analysis.
