Kargupta","Haifa University, Haifa","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20090224","2009","21","4","465","478","In a large network of computers or wireless sensors, each of the components (henceforth, peers) has some data about the global state of the system. Much of the system's functionality such as message routing, information retrieval and load sharing relies on modeling the global state. We refer to the outcome of the function (e.g., the load experienced by each peer) as the emph{model} of the system. Since the state of the system is constantly changing, it is necessary to keep the models up-to-date. Computing global data mining models e.g. decision trees, k-means clustering in large distributed systems may be very costly due to the scale of the system and due to communication cost, which may be high. The cost further increases in a dynamic scenario when the data changes rapidly. In this paper we describe a two step approach for dealing with these costs. First, we describe a highly efficient emph{local} algorithm which can be used to monitor a wide class of data mining models. Then, we use this algorithm as a feedback loop for the monitoring of complex functions of the data such as its k-means clustering. The theoretical claims are corroborated with a thorough experimental analysis.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4604665","Data mining;Distributed databases;Distributed systems;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technology;Mining methods and algorithms;Peer to Peer Data Mining;Systems and Software","","data mining;distributed processing;pattern clustering","data stream mining;decision trees;generic local algorithm;global data mining models;information retrieval;k-means clustering;large distributed systems;load sharing;message routing","","19","","25","","20080822","April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The first stage is topic filtering. The topic filtering stage is intended to minimize information mismatch by filtering out the most likely irrelevant information based on term-based profiles. Thus, only a relatively small amount of potentially highly relevant documents remain for document ranking. The second stage of the presented method uses pattern mining approach. The objective of the second stage is to solve the problem of information overload. The most likely relevant documents were assigned higher ranks by exploiting patterns in the pattern taxonomy. The second stage is precision oriented. Since relatively small amount of documents are involved at this stage, computational cost is markedly reduced, at the same time, with significant improved results. The new two-stage information filtering model has been evaluated by extensive experiments. The tests were based on well-known IR bench-marking processes, using the latest version of the Reuters dataset, namely Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1). The performance of the new model was compared with both of the term-based and data mining-based IF models. The results show that more effective and efficient information access has been achieved by combining the strength of information filtering and data mining method.","","POD:978-0-7695-3496-1","10.1109/WIIAT.2008.390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4740871","data mining;information filtering;information retrieval;sequential pattern mining;user profile","Data mining;Filtering theory;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Information technology;Intelligent agent;Internet;Search engines;Software agents","data mining;document handling;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence)","data mining;document filtering;document ranking;document retrieval;information filtering;information mismatch minimization;information overload problem;information retrieval;machine learning;pattern mining;pattern taxonomy;term-based profile;topic filtering stage;two-stage model","","0","","18","","","9-12 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to accommodate heterogeneous data types found in relational databases, we extended the TFIDF measure to handle, in addition to text, numerical attribute types for coincident meaning extraction. We present a SOM clustering based visualization algorithm allowing the user to browse the heterogeneously typed database attributes and discover semantically similar clusters.

"Similarity-based Retrieval in High Dimensional Data with Recursive Lists of Clusters: A Study Case with Natural Language Dictionaries","F. Barbosa","Dept. de Inf., UNL, Caparica","2009 International Conference on Information Management and Engineering","20090619","2009","","","432","436","An important issue in similarity-based retrieval in high dimensional data objects is the data representation. In order to use an indexing structure that can effectively handle large databases, it is essential to reduce the dimensionality of the data objects. The symbolic representation of the objects is a promising technique of dimension reduction, which allows researchers to avail from the area of text-retrieval algorithms and techniques. A similar searching engine consists in finding the objects similar to a given objects in some collection. Comparing the given object to every other object in a large database is prohibitively slow. If objects can be placed in a metric space, the search can be sped up by comparing the query object to a restricted number of objects, rather than the entire database. If the objects are strings (text) and a ""good"" metric to compare objects exists, we get a metric space. In order to have efficient similar searching in metric spaces, metric data structures are used. We evaluate the performance of range queries in the recursive lists of clusters (RLC) metric data structure, when the metric spaces are natural language dictionaries with the extended edit distance (EED). The study compares RLC with Vp-Tree data structure in six different dictionaries, which are characterized according to the mean and the variance of the histograms of distances. The experimental results show that RLC has a good performance in all the tested cases and, in some of them it outperforms the Vp-tree data structure. In addition, RLC is the only data structure that always keeps its good performance, when the space dimension is lower or higher.","","POD:978-0-7695-3595-1","10.1109/ICIME.2009.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5077071","Information Indexing and Retrieval;Metric Data Structures;Range Query;Text Processing","Data structures;Databases;Dictionaries;Extraterrestrial measurements;Histograms;Indexing;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Search engines;Testing","data structures;dictionaries;information retrieval;natural languages;text analysis","Vp-tree data structure;data representation;extended edit distance;indexing structure;metric data structures;natural language dictionaries;similarity-based retrieval;text-retrieval algorithms","","0","","16","","","3-5 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new ontology-structure-based technique for measuring semantic similarity in single ontology and across multiple ontologies in the biomedical domain within the framework of unified medical language system (UMLS). The proposed measure is based on three features: 1) cross-modified path length between two concepts; 2) a new feature of common specificity of concepts in the ontology; and 3) local granularity of ontology clusters. The proposed technique was evaluated relative to human similarity scores and compared with other existing measures using two terminologies within UMLS framework: medical subject headings and systemized nomenclature of medicine clinical term. The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed technique in single and multiple ontologies, and demonstrate that our proposed measure achieves the best results of correlation with human scores in all experiments.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2009.2020689","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5061528","Biomedical information retrieval;Unified Medical Language System (UMLS);biomedical ontology;biomedical terminology;semantic similarity","","Unified Modeling Language;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","biomedical concepts;intelligent knowledge-based applications;medical subject headings;ontology clusters;ontology-structure-based technique;systemized nomenclature;unified medical language system","","31","","30","","20090602","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

DFPC is inspired by an existing algorithm called possibilistic fuzzy C-means (PFCM) that hybridizes fuzzy and possibilistic clustering. It has been shown that PFCM can perform effectively for low-dimensional data clustering. To achieve our goal, we expand this existing idea by introducing a novel PFCM-like coclustering model. The new algorithm DFPC preserves the desired properties of PFCM. In addition, as a coclustering algorithm, DFPC is more suitable for our intended high-dimensional application: document clustering. Besides, the coclustering mechanism enables DFPC to generate, together with document clusters, fuzzy-possibilistic word memberships. These word memberships, which are absent in the existing PFCM model, can play an important role in generating useful descriptions of document clusters. We detail the formulation of the proposed model and provide an extensive analytical study of the algorithm DFPC.

Its original task was to find those time series similar to a pattern (query) time-series data, where both the pattern and data time series are static. Recently, with an increasing demand on stream data management, similarity-based stream time-series retrieval has raised new research issues due to its unique requirements during the stream processing, such as one-pass search and fast response. In this paper, we address the problem of matching both static and dynamic patterns over stream time-series data. We will develop a novel multiscale representation, called multiscale segment mean, for stream time-series data, which can be incrementally computed and thus perfectly adapted to the stream characteristics. Most importantly, we propose a novel multistep filtering mechanism, step by step, over the multiscale representation. Analysis indicates that the mechanism can greatly prune the search space and thus offer fast response. Furthermore, batch processing optimization and the dynamic case where patterns are also from stream time series are discussed. Extensive experiments show the multiscale representation together with the multistep filtering scheme can efficiently filter out false candidates and detect patterns, compared to the multiscale wavelet.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624258","Information Storage and Retrieval;Temporal databases","Data analysis;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Storms;Streaming media;Temperature sensors;Weather forecasting","batch processing (computers);information retrieval;pattern matching;time series","batch processing optimization;fast pattern matching;multiscale segment mean;multistep filtering scheme;pattern time-series data;similarity-based time-series retrieval;stream data management;stream time series;stream time-series retrieval","","7","","38","","20080912","April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Lanczos Vectors versus Singular Vectors for Effective Dimension Reduction","J. Chen; Y. Saad","University of Minnesota, Minneapolis","IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering","20090623","2009","21","8","1091","1103","This paper takes an in-depth look at a technique for computing filtered matrix-vector (mat-vec) products which are required in many data analysis applications. In these applications, the data matrix is multiplied by a vector and we wish to perform this product accurately in the space spanned by a few of the major singular vectors of the matrix. We examine the use of the Lanczos algorithm for this purpose. The goal of the method is identical with that of the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD), namely to preserve the quality of the resulting mat-vec product in the major singular directions of the matrix. The Lanczos-based approach achieves this goal by using a small number of Lanczos vectors, but it does not explicitly compute singular values/vectors of the matrix. The main advantage of the Lanczos-based technique is its low cost when compared with that of the truncated SVD. This advantage comes without sacrificing accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on a few sample applications requiring dimension reduction, including information retrieval and face recognition. The proposed technique can be applied as a replacement to the truncated SVD technique whenever the problem can be formulated as a filtered mat-vec multiplication.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674352","Dimension reduction;Lanczos algorithm;PCA;SVD;eigenfaces;eigenfaces.;face recognition;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing","","data analysis;singular value decomposition;vectors","Lanczos vector;SVD;data analysis application;effective dimension reduction;mat-vec;matrix-vector product;singular value decomposition;singular vector","","11","","27","","20081117","Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To reduce this gap, we introduce a framework for feedback based Web search engine development.

This paper presents an approach to automatic tagging which incorporates temporal aspects of music directly into the statistical models, unlike the typical bag-of-frames paradigm in traditional music information retrieval techniques. Vector quantization on song segments leads to a vocabulary of acoustic segment models. An unsupervised, iterative process that cycles between Viterbi decoding and Baum-Welch estimation builds transcripts of this vocabulary. Latent semantic analysis converts the song transcriptions into a vector for subsequent classification using a support vector machine for each tag. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better in 15 of the 18 tags. Further analysis demonstrates an ability to capture local timbral characteristics as well as sequential arrangements of acoustic segment models.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959973","Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Music;Speech processing;Vector quantization","Automatic speech recognition;Hidden Markov models;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Tagging;Technical Activities Guide -TAG;Vector quantization;Vocabulary","acoustic signal processing;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;iterative methods;music;signal classification;speech processing;statistical analysis;support vector machines;vector quantisation","Baum-Welch estimation;Viterbi decoding;acoustic segment model;bag-of-frames paradigm;iterative process;latent semantic analysis;local timbral characteristic;music information retrieval technique;music tag annotation;song segments;statistical model;support vector machine;vector quantization","","9","","13","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the previous approaches to extracting overlay text from videos are based on low-level features, such as edge, color, and texture information. However, existing methods experience difficulties in handling texts with various contrasts or inserted in a complex background. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to detect and extract the overlay text from the video scene. Based on our observation that there exist transient colors between inserted text and its adjacent background, a transition map is first generated. Then candidate regions are extracted by a reshaping method and the overlay text regions are determined based on the occurrence of overlay text in each candidate. The detected overlay text regions are localized accurately using the projection of overlay text pixels in the transition map and the text extraction is finally conducted. The proposed method is robust to different character size, position, contrast, and color. It is also language independent. Overlay text region update between frames is also employed to reduce the processing time. Experiments are performed on diverse videos to confirm the efficiency of the proposed method.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2008.2008225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4717227","Optical character recognition (OCR);overlay text;transition map;video information retrieval;video summarization","","feature extraction;image colour analysis;object detection;video retrieval","low-level features;overlay text detection;overlay text pixels;reshaping method;text extraction;transition map;video content analysis;video information retrieval;video scene extraction;video summarization","Algorithms;Automatic Data Processing;Documentation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reading;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Subtraction Technique;Video Recording","56","","19","","20081216","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There is in fact a growing interest for music information retrieval (MIR) applications amongst which the most popular are related to music similarity retrieval, artist identification, musical genre or instrument recognition. Current MIR-related classification systems usually do not take into account the mid-term temporal properties of the signal (over several frames) and lie on the assumption that the observations of the features in different frames are statistically independent. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of the information carried by the evolution of these characteristics over time. To that purpose, we propose a number of methods for early and late temporal integration and provide an in-depth experimental study on their interest for the task of musical instrument recognition on solo musical phrases. In particular, the impact of the time horizon over which the temporal integration is performed will be assessed both for fixed and variable frame length analysis. Also, a number of proposed alignment kernels will be used for late temporal integration. For all experiments, the results are compared to a state of the art musical instrument recognition system.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2008.2007613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4740151","Alignment kernels;audio classification;music information retrieval (MIR);musical instrument recognition;support vector machine (SVM);temporal feature integration","Feature extraction;Instruments;Kernel;Machine assisted indexing;Music information retrieval;Performance analysis;Signal analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunications","audio signal processing;indexing;information retrieval;music;musical instruments;signal classification;support vector machines","artist identification;audio classification;automatic indexing tools;music information retrieval;music similarity retrieval;musical audio content;musical genre recognition;musical instrument classification;musical instrument recognition;support vector machines;temporal integration","","35","","53","","","Jan. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A widely used dance music dataset has been chosen for proof of concept. On this data set, the proposed method based on scale transform achieves classification results as high as other state of the art approaches.

We have defined a criterion to evaluate and analyze the query processing techniques. On the basis of defined criterion, analysis matrix is provided for quick insights on prominent features and limitations of query processing techniques.

This paper analyzes how people are excited about the watched video content and proposes a content-driven attention ranking strategy which enables client users to iteratively browse the video according to their preference. The proposed attention rank (AR) algorithm, which is extended from the Google PageRank algorithm that sorts the websites based on the importance, can effectively measure the user interest (UI) level for each video frame. The degree of attention is derived by integrating the object-based visual attention model (VAM) with the contextual attention model (CAM), which not only can more reliably take advantage of the human perceptual characteristics, but also can effectively identify which video content may attract users' attention. The information of users' feedback is utilized in re-ranking procedure to further improve the retrieving accuracy. The proposed algorithm is specifically evaluated on broadcasted baseball videos.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2008.2009682","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4757432","Attention modeling;contextual analysis;information retrieval;interactive systems;sports videos","CADCAM;Computer aided manufacturing;Context modeling;Data analysis;Feedback;Humans;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Multimedia communication;Videos","multimedia computing;social aspects of automation;sport","Google PageRank algorithm;attention characteristics;baseball videos;content based attention ranking;content driven attention ranking;contextual attention model;human perceptual characteristics;multimedia data;object-based visual attention model;user interest level;video content","","8","","43","","","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, search queries and documents can be classified by the models according to their spatial specificity. Second, the geographic center(s) of interests for queries and documents can be inferred. Finally, the model can be applied to generate relevance features for search ranking. We evaluated our proposals on a large dataset with about 10,000 unique queries sampled from the Yahoo!

Previous approaches that have been used for this concept mapping have mainly relied on term-level matching, whereby the medical terms in the raw text and their synonyms are matched with concepts in a terminology database. These previous approaches, however, have shortcomings that limit their efficacy in CC concept mapping, where the concepts for CC data are often represented by associative terms rather than by synonyms. Therefore, herein we propose a concept mapping scheme based on a two-phase matching approach, especially for application to Korean CCs, which uses term-level complete matching in the first phase and concept-level matching based on concept learning in the second phase. The proposed concept-level matching suggests the method to learn all the terms (associative terms as well as synonyms) that represent the concept and predict the most probable concept for a CC based on the learned terms.

The minimum classification error (MCE) training was undertaken to enhance speech recognition performance by minimizing the word error rate. This paper presents a new minimum rank error (MRE) algorithm for <i>n</i>-gram language model training. Rather than speech recognition, the proposed language models are estimated for <i>information</i> <i>retrieval</i> by considering the metric of <i>average</i> <i>precision</i>. However, the maximization of average precision is closely linked to minimizing the rank error or optimizing the order of the ranked documents. Accordingly, this paper calculates the <i>rank</i> <i>error</i> <i>loss</i> <i>function</i> from the misordering pairs of relevant and irrelevant documents in the rank list. The Bayes risk due to the expected rank loss is minimized to develop the Bayesian retrieval rule for <i>ad-hoc</i> information retrieval. Consequently, the <i>discriminative</i> <i>training</i> of language model is performed by integrating discrimination information from individual relevant documents relative to their corresponding irrelevant documents. Experimental results on TREC collections indicate that the proposed MRE language model improves the order of relevant documents, and degrades that of irrelevant documents. The MRE method achieves significantly higher average precision for test queries than the maximum likelihood and the MCE retrieval models.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2008.2008366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4749457","Average precision;discriminative training;information retrieval;language model;rank error loss function","Bayesian methods;Degradation;Error analysis;Information retrieval;Information systems;Maximum likelihood estimation;Natural languages;Optical losses;Speech recognition;Testing","Bayes methods;information retrieval;speech recognition;statistical analysis","Bayes risk;Bayesian retrieval rule;average precision;information retrieval;minimum classification error training;rank error loss function;speech recognition;statistical language modeling","","2","","27","","","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

When a new bug report is submitted to the repository, a person, called a triager, examines whether it is a duplicate of an existing bug report. If it is, the triager marks it as duplicate and the bug report is removed from consideration for further work. In the literature, there are approaches exploiting only natural language information to detect duplicate bug reports. In this paper we present a new approach that further involves execution information. In our approach, when a new bug report arrives, its natural language information and execution information are compared with those of the existing bug reports. Then, a small number of existing bug reports are suggested to the triager as the most similar bug reports to the new bug report. Finally, the triager examines the suggested bug reports to determine whether the new bug report duplicates an existing bug report. We calibrated our approach on a subset of the Eclipse bug repository and evaluated our approach on a subset of the Firefox bug repository. The experimental results show that our approach can detect 67%-93% of duplicate bug reports in the Firefox bug repository, compared to 43%-72% using natural language information alone.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-60558-079-1; POD:978-1-4244-4486-1","10.1145/1368088.1368151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4814157","duplicate bug report;execution information;information retrieval","Computer bugs;Computer science education;Costs;Educational technology;Laboratories;Natural languages;Open source software;Software maintenance;Software quality;Testing","information retrieval;natural language processing;public domain software","Eclipse bug repository;execution information;information retrieval;natural language information;triager","","118","3","19","","","10-18 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a formulation implicitly assumes that the training data has similar distributional characteristics as that of the data which need to be indexed. In this paper we demonstrate empirically that even within the relatively narrow domain of news videos collected from a variety of news programs and broadcasters, the assumption of distributional similarity of visual features does not hold across programs from different broadcasters. This is manifested in considerable degradation of ranked retrieval performance on novel sources. We observe that concepts whose spatial locations remain relatively fixed between various sources are also more robust to source mismatches, and vice versa. We also show that a simple averaging of multiple visual detectors is more robust than any of the individual detectors. Furthermore, we show that for certain sources using only 20% of the available annotated data can bridge roughly 80% of the performance drop, while others can require larger amounts of annotated data.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959989","Information retrieval;Multimedia systems;Robustness","Broadcasting;Content based retrieval;Degradation;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Robustness;Speech processing","content-based retrieval;image classification;video retrieval","content-based image retrieval;content-based video retrieval;multiple visual detector;predetermined visual concepts;ranked retrieval performance;textual queries;visual concept classification","","0","","14","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Binary search trees and suffix trees (ST) have been used to speedup the search of the LAB over the dictionary, at the expense of high memory usage [1]. A suffix array (SA) is a simpler, more compact data structure which uses (much) less memory [2,3] to hold the same information.

After each query was run on each search engine; and each phrase containing a query was run on the semantic search engine, the first twenty documents on each retrieval output was classified as being ldquorelevantrdquo or ldquonon-relevantrdquo. Afterwards, precision and normalized recall ratios were calculated at various cut-off points to evaluate keyword-based search engines and the semantic search engine.

Our goal in this paper is to answer the following question, what are the factors affecting the performance of Data fusion algorithms? The reason behind introducing those factors is the absence of a single source in the literature able to present all those factors in an organized and complete manner.

This paper proposes a simple method of fuzzy matching between query names and phones of candidate audio segments. This approach has the advantage of avoiding some word decoding errors in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Experiments on Mandarin-English CLSSR show that phone-based searching and conventional translation-based searching are complementary. Adding phone matching achieved 26.29% improvement on F-measure over searching on state-of-the-art machine translation (MT) output and 8.83% over entity translation (ET) output.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3472-5; POD:978-1-4244-3471-8","10.1109/SLT.2008.4777895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4777895","Information Retrieval;Speech Recognition","Automatic speech recognition;Broadcasting;Content based retrieval;Decoding;Error analysis;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Pipelines;Speech recognition;Text recognition","fuzzy systems;language translation;natural language processing;pattern matching;query processing;speech processing;speech recognition","Mandarin-English CLSSR;OOV words;automatic speech recognition;candidate audio segments;cross-lingual spoken sentence retrieval;entity translation;fuzzy matching;machine translation;phonetic name matching;query names;word decoding errors","","0","","15","","","15-19 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Kusatsu, Kusatsu","2008 Tenth IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","20090109","2008","","","613","618","In this paper, we propose a music retrieval method based on the distributions of features in the music. In common music retrieval methods, if several features are similar between the query and the retrieval target, the retrieval systems return that the query is similar to the retrieval target. However, a problem is that several features in the music are ignored. If the other features in the query and the retrieval target are quite different, the query and the retrieval target should be treated as different types of music. Therefore, we calculate the importance of each feature in the music. Then, we compare the importance of features between the query and the retrieval target, and we can retrieve the music without ignoring the importance of several features. In our experimental evaluation, we can confirm that our proposed system has better accuracy than the baseline method.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3454-1","10.1109/ISM.2008.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4741236","Content Based Retrieval;Music Information Retrieval;TF-IDF;Vector Space Model","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Frequency conversion;Information science;Motion pictures;Music information retrieval;TV","content-based retrieval;music;query formulation","feature segments distribution;music retrieval method;retrieval systems;retrieval target","","1","","10","","","15-17 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Boolean Factor Analysis and Its Application to Word Clustering","A. A. Frolov; D. Husek; P. Y. Polyakov","Inst. of Higher Nervous Activity & Neurophysiol., Russian Acad. of Sci., Moscow, Russia","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","20090707","2009","20","7","1073","1086","The objective of this paper is to introduce a neural-network-based algorithm for word clustering as an extension of the neural-network-based Boolean factor analysis algorithm (Frolov , 2007). It is shown that this extended algorithm supports even the more complex model of signals that are supposed to be related to textual documents. It is hypothesized that every topic in textual data is characterized by a set of words which coherently appear in documents dedicated to a given topic. The appearance of each word in a document is coded by the activity of a particular neuron. In accordance with the Hebbian learning rule implemented in the network, sets of coherently appearing words (treated as factors) create tightly connected groups of neurons, hence, revealing them as attractors of the network dynamics. The found factors are eliminated from the network memory by the Hebbian unlearning rule facilitating the search of other factors. Topics related to the found sets of words can be identified based on the words' semantics. To make the method complete, a special technique based on a Bayesian procedure has been developed for the following purposes: first, to provide a complete description of factors in terms of component probability, and second, to enhance the accuracy of classification of signals to determine whether it contains the factor. Since it is assumed that every word may possibly contribute to several topics, the proposed method might be related to the method of fuzzy clustering. In this paper, we show that the results of Boolean factor analysis and fuzzy clustering are not contradictory, but complementary. To demonstrate the capabilities of this attempt, the method is applied to two types of textual data on neural networks in two different languages. The obtained topics and corresponding words are at a good level of agreement despite the fact that identical topics in Russian and English conferences contain different sets of keywords.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2009.2016090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4982625","Associative memory;Boolean factor analysis;Hopfield-like neural network;concepts search;information retrieval;neural network application;neural network architecture;recurrent neural network;statistics;unsupervised learning","","Bayes methods;Boolean functions;Hebbian learning;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;pattern clustering;probability;recurrent neural nets;text analysis","Bayesian procedure;Boolean factor analysis algorithm;Hebbian learning rule;component probability;fuzzy clustering;recurrent neural network algorithm;signal classification;textual document;word clustering;word semantics","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Fuzzy Logic;Language;Mathematical Computing;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Semantics","11","","18","","20090527","July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The harmony structure is extracted directly from a music audio signal using a second-order statistic of chroma feature vectors. The method is experimentally shown to be robust against the degradation of chroma feature vectors due to noisy pitch estimation in our classical music opus identification evaluation. To analyze the effects of the noisy pitch estimation, we propose a noise model that describes difference between the oracle chroma feature vectors as obtained from a symbolic representation and those extracted from the rendered audio signal. The results suggest that the harmony structure modeling scheme employing the covariance matrix is more robust than the alternative investigated second-order statistics. The results also show that the proposed method obtains 84.3% accuracy with the symbolic representations and 72.0% with the synthesized audio data, which suggest that the proposed harmony structure modeling method has room for further improvement by addressing the signal processing challenges of pitch extraction, or through employing more robust features.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959995","multipitch analysis;music fingerprint;music information retrieval;polyphony music signal","Covariance matrix;Data mining;Degradation;Multiple signal classification;Noise robustness;Signal analysis;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Signal synthesis;Statistics","audio signal processing;covariance matrices;feature extraction;information retrieval systems;music","classical music opus identification;covariance matrix;music information retrieval systems;noisy pitch estimation;oracle chroma feature vector;pitch extraction;robust harmony structure modeling scheme;second-order statistics;signal processing;symbolic representation","","1","","10","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To that aim, we propose to model the power spectral densities (PSDs) of both contributions with a source/filter model for the main instrument while retaining a model emphasizing temporal repetitions of the musical background. We show that improved source separation performances can be obtained by a two-step estimation strategy where the model parameters are re-estimated in a second stage by adequately exploiting the main melody line estimated in a first stage. The experiments conducted on several monaural signal databases show that our system achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to other unsupervised source separation algorithms.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959531","Blind Audio Source Separation (BASS);Desoloing;Karaoke;Melody extraction;Music Information Retrieval (MIR)","Covariance matrix;Data mining;Filters;Instruments;Iterative methods;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Source separation;State estimation;Telecommunications","audio recording;audio signal processing;blind source separation;music","blind audio source separation;estimation strategy;melody extraction;monaural musical mixture desoloing;monaural source separation;music information retrieval;polyphonic musical recording;unsupervised source separation","","14","1","11","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key characteristic in these standards is the frequent use of ontological references, i.e., ontological concept codes appear as XML elements and are used to associate portions of the EMR document with concepts defined in a domain ontology. A rich corpus of work addresses searching XML documents. Unfortunately, these works do not make use of ontological references to enhance search. In this paper we present the XOntoRank system which addresses the problem of ontology-aware keyword search of XML documents with a particular focus on EMR XML documents.

The developed system has been designed with a view to capturing both implicit and explicit user data which is used to develop a personal contextual profile. Such profiles can be shared across multiple users to create a shared contextual knowledge base. These are used to refine search queries and improve both the search results for a user as well as their search experience. An empirical study has been undertaken to evaluate the system against a number of hypotheses.
