This ability requires the animal to keep track its direction and distance from specific locations. In rodents, direction of the animal is coded by the activity of <i>head</i> <i>direction</i> <i>cells</i> present in several regions of the brain, but distance information is only indirectly available, through the entorhinal cortical grid cell system. A neural system downstream from the entorhinal cortex seems to be necessary to extract the distance information from the periodic activity of grid cells. We propose that a system of such cells store the distance of the animal from important locations in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus and these ldquodistance cellsrdquo might be identified with the dentate granule cells. A computational model is set up to study the neural mechanism of distance information decoding from the ensemble of grids cells. The proposed distance cells receive innervation from entorhinal grid cells, the connection strength between grid cells and distance cells is set by a one-shot-learning rule and the distance cell activity is affected by a winner-take-all mechanism. Simulation results of this model verifies that the activity of the distance cell population is able to unambiguously code the distance of the animal from important places. The proposed distance cells have a multi-peaked, patchy spatial activity pattern similar to the firing pattern of granule cells in dentate gyrus.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:978-1-4244-3548-7","10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178864","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5178864","","Animals;Biological neural networks;Central nervous system;Data mining;Displays;Hippocampus;Lesions;Monitoring;Neurons;Rats","biology computing;cellular biophysics;information retrieval;zoology","dentate granule cells;dentate gyrus region;distance cell population;distance information decoding;distance information extraction;entorhinal cortical grid cell system;head direction cells;one-shot-learning rule;winner-take-all mechanism","","2","","56","","","14-19 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to extract bar-long unit rhythmic patterns for a music collection we propose a clustering method based on one-pass dynamic programming and k-means clustering. After extracting the fundamental rhythmic patterns for each style/genre a pattern occurrence histogram is calculated and used as a feature vector for supervised learning. Experimental results show that the automatically calculated rhythmic pattern information can be used to effectively classify musical genre/style and improve upon current approaches based on timbral features.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202514","Audio genre classification;Dynamic programming;Feature extraction;Pattern clustering method;Percussive sound","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Dynamic programming;Feature extraction;Histograms;Iterative algorithms;Multiple signal classification;Pattern clustering;Rhythm;Spectrogram","audio acoustics;audio signal processing;dynamic programming;feature extraction;information retrieval;musical acoustics;pattern clustering;signal classification","audio genre classification;feature vector;global statistical features;k-means clustering;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;one-pass dynamic programming;percussive pattern clustering;rhythmic pattern information;supervised learning;timbral features","","7","","13","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are several ways in which one can characterize different approaches to text summarization: extractive and abstractive from single document or multi document. This paper focuses on the automatic text summarization by sentence extraction. The first step in summarization by extraction is the identification of important features. Our approach used important features based on fuzzy logic to extract the sentences. In our experiment, we used 30 test documents in DUC2002 data set. Each document is prepared by preprocessing process: sentence segmentation, tokenization, removing stop word, and word stemming. Then, we use 8 important features and calculate their score for each sentence. We propose a method using fuzzy logic for sentence extraction and compare our results with the baseline summarizer and Microsoft Word 2007 summarizers. The results show that the highest average precision, recall, and F-measure for the summaries are conducted from fuzzy method.","","POD:978-0-7695-3654-5","10.1109/ICSPS.2009.156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5166839","feature-based;fuzzy logic;text summarization","Data mining;Feature extraction;Frequency;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Internet;Multivalued logic","data compression;feature extraction;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;text analysis","automatic text summarization;feature-based sentence extraction;fuzzy inference rule;fuzzy logic;multi document extraction;sentence segmentation;text compression","","5","","16","","","15-17 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we illustrate the human role as sensor referencing results of an earlier experiment investigating human performance of operator, navigator, or ldquoperceptual sensorrdquo tasks for teams of 4, 8, and 12 simulated pioneer P3AT robots. The experiment shows humans to be resource limited for the navigation/control task as the number of robots increases while the perceptual sensor function was less affected.

This Eyetap device is equipped with a video camera and networking capability.

Users will simultaneously wear communicating sensor devices wherever they are, whenever they need them, and whatever they are doing. Under such circumstances, various contents will be generated,updated by the devices and moved much more frequently than they are now. We propose an architecture for a real-time information-delivery system that enables users to quickly discover the freshest, most accurate content. We compared three types of well-known data searching algorithms, i.e., in DNS-like static-tree method, Web crawler method, and Chord method, which can be used in servers in existing systems to retrieve the metadata on the content. We first developed a simulator and evaluated the algorithms to assess the methods to find which generation, update, and movement of content occurred more frequently. We discovered that the Web crawler method and Chord method both offered roughly the same correct answer rate. However, the number of messages increased dramatically with the Web crawler method when the content-update interval shortened.The average search time also increased with the Chord method as the number of user nodes increased.","","POD:978-0-7695-3580-7","10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5176033","distributed database searching;information delivery system;search engine;simulation software","Cameras;Content management;Crawlers;Database systems;Deductive databases;Network servers;Real time systems;Sensor arrays;Technology management;User-generated content","Internet;digital simulation;distributed databases;information retrieval;meta data;search engines","Chord method;DNS-like static-tree method;Web crawler method;communicating sensor devices;consumer generated media tools;content-generation devices;data searching algorithms;data-searching algorithms;distributed database searching;input-output devices;metadata retrieval;real-time information-delivery system;search engine;simulation software","","0","","9","","","1-3 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Initially, the framework addresses two types of source data models: the relational database (RDB) and object-relational database (ORDB) models. The derived ontology model is based on OWL. The framework extracts information about the source data models from the metadata maintained by the DBMS. The extracted metadata includes most of the integrity constraints that are typically maintained by a DBMS. The extracted metadata is then analyzed to identify ontology concepts, properties, and explicit relationships, discover redundant ontology concepts and implicit relationships, and identify restrictions on properties and relationships. The analysis is based on heuristic database modeling techniques. The analyzed data is automatically translated into a rudimentary OWL ontology model that can be enhanced by ontology modelers. The paper provides examples to demonstrate how the translation is conducted.","","POD:978-1-4244-4114-3","10.1109/IRI.2009.5211575","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5211575","Data Models;OWL;Object-Relational Database;Ontology;Relational Database;Reverse-Engineering","Computer errors;Computer science;Costs;Data analysis;Data mining;Data models;OWL;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Relational databases","data integrity;information retrieval;knowledge representation languages;meta data;object-oriented databases;ontologies (artificial intelligence);relational databases","DBMS;OWL model;database management system;heuristic database modeling technique;information extraction;integrity constraint;object-relational database model;ontology model;relational database model","","4","","10","","","10-12 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover the exponential growing volumes of the data and its availability are crucial issues. A centralized storage system would be overloaded and be a single point of failure. That is why overlay network may provide the solution as they can be used to implement a distributed storage system over an information system. ROSA is an overlay network that was designed to combine a high scalability while maintaining a strong connectivity. The reliability of its topology, designs ROSA as a good platform for deploying such a reliable storage system. Nevertheless ROSA is an unstructured overlay network, this will decrease the efficiency of the storage system. In this article we first propose a structure, called chain of lumps, built upon ROSA. This structure will provide the advantage of a structured network to ROSA. Once ROSA endowed with the structure, we propose a reliable storage system deployed over ROSA.

The suggestion is not that a particular way of implementing OAIS be specified, but, rather that general guidelines on implementation are required if the term ldquoOAIS-compliantrdquo is to be meaningful in the sense of giving an assurance of attaining and maintaining an operationally adequate or better level of long-term reliability, consistency, and cross-compatibility in implemented DP systems that is measurable, verifiable, manageable, and (as far as possible) future-proofed.","1546-1874;15461874","POD:978-1-4244-3297-4","10.1109/ICDSP.2009.5201126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5201126","authenticity;data model;digital preservation;functional entities;integrity","Guidelines;ISO standards;Information resources;Information systems;Maintenance;Mathematics;Poles and towers;Software libraries;Standards development;Waste management","data integrity;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;open systems","OAIS;authenticity;consistency;cross-compatibility;data flows;digital preservation;integrity;meaning;open archival information system;renderability;retrievability","","1","","20","","","5-7 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Combining with semantic dictionaries, image semantic keywords can be extracted from the eight kinds of text. The strategy of extracting image semantics is better than existing technique, which is better than manual annotation in efficiency and better than automatic annotation based on content in accuracy.

The use of temporal abstraction is important for decision support applications which consume abstract concepts, while databases usually contain primitive concepts. In this paper we propose a new approach for TA which has a tight coupling with the temporal integrity constraints checking (TICC) stage. The preceding TICC stage not only ensures the consistency of the raw data stored in the temporal database but also prepares appropriate datasets for the TA stage. The approach has been applied to the clinical database system for monitoring the treatment of patients who have colorectal cancer.","","POD:978-0-7695-3580-7","10.1109/ACIIDS.2009.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5175979","clinical databases;inference graph;temporal abstraction;temporal integrity constraints;transition graph","Cancer;Cities and towns;Computer industry;Data mining;Database systems;Deductive databases;Frequency;Information technology;Medical treatment;Patient monitoring","computerised monitoring;information retrieval;medical information systems;patient treatment;temporal databases","TICC stage;clinical database system;colorectal cancer;data extraction;decision support application;patient treatment monitoring;raw temporal data;temporal abstraction method;temporal database;temporal integrity constraints checking","","0","","12","","","1-3 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The importance of this problem derives from the fact that, once extracted, data can be handled in a way similar to instances of a traditional database, which in turn can facilitate application of Web data integration and various other domain specific problems. In this paper, we propose a novel table extraction technique that works on Web pages generated dynamically from a back-end database. The proposed system can automatically discover table structure by relevant pattern mining from Web pages in an efficient way, and can generate regular expression for the extraction process. This approach requires no human intervention and experimental results have shown its accuracy to be promising.

Rough set based Rank aggregation is a user feedback based technique for rank aggregation, which learns ranking rules using rough set theory. In this paper, we discuss an improved version of the rough set based rank aggregation technique, which is more suitable for aggregation of different Web search evaluation techniques. For learning the ranking rules, we obtain the implicit user feedback to the search results returned by a search engine in response to a set of fifteen queries and mine the ranking rules using rough set theory. In the modified rough set based rank aggregation technique, we incorporate the confidence of the rules in predicting a class for a given set of data. That means, we do not say surely that the record belongs to a particular class according to a particular rule. Instead, we associate a score variable to the predicted class of the record, where the value of the variable is equal to the confidence measure of the rule. We validate the mined ranking rules by comparing the predicted user feedback based ranking with the actual user feedback based ranking. We apply the ranking rules to another set of thirty seven queries for aggregating different rankings of search results obtained on the basis of different evaluation techniques. We show our experimental results pertaining to seven public search engines.","","POD:978-1-4244-4575-2","10.1109/NAFIPS.2009.5156415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5156415","Boolean Similarity Measures;Confidence;PageRank;Rank Aggregation;Ranking Rules;Rough Set;User Feedback;Vector Space Model;Web Search Evaluation","Business;Educational institutions;Extraterrestrial measurements;Feedback;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Information processing;Search engines;Set theory;Web search","Internet;information retrieval;rough set theory","Web search system;rough set based rank aggregation;user feedback based technique","","2","","23","","","14-17 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the consumers of Web-services are typically 'machines', Web pages are meant for human users. It is highly desirable (for reasons of security, revenue, ownership, availability etc.) for service providers that content that will undergo further processing be fetched in a prescribed fashion, preferably through a supplied Web services. In fact, monetization of partnerships within a services ecosystem normally means that Web site data translate into valuable revenue. Unfortunately, it is quite commonplace for arbitrary developers to extract or leverage information from websites without asking for permission and or negotiating a revenue sharing agreement. This may translate to significant lost income for content providers. Even in cases where Web site owners are happy to share the data, they may want users to adopt dedicated Web service APIs (and associated API-servers) rather than putting a load on their revenue-generating websites. In this paper, we introduce a mechanism that disables automated Web scraping agents, thus forcing clients to conform to the provided Web Services.","","POD:978-0-7695-3709-2","10.1109/ICWS.2009.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5175930","Deep Web Extraction;Random Injection","Availability;Data mining;Data security;HTML;Humans;Navigation;Switches;USA Councils;Web server;Web services","Web services;Web sites;application program interfaces;financial management;information retrieval;multi-agent systems","API;Web services;application program interface;automated Web scraping agents;random injection;revenue-generating Web sites;unwelcomed deep Web extraction services;user-viewable Web pages","","0","","4","","","6-10 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can also facilitate people's manipulation of a document or people's interactions through documents. Additionally, the algorithm is useful for binding multimedia data to language independent paper documents. Our document recognition algorithm is inspired by the widely known SIFT descriptor but can be computed much more efficiently for both descriptor construction and search. It also uses much less storage space than the SIFT approach. By testing our algorithm with randomly scaled and rotated document pages, we can achieve a 99.73% page recognition rate on the 2188-page ICME06 proceedings and 99.9% page recognition rate on a 504-page Japanese math book.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202515","Cell Phone Interface;Document Retrieval;Image Descriptor;Paper Document;SIFT;SURF","Books;Cameras;Cellular phones;Collaboration;Displays;Image retrieval;Keyboards;Laboratories;Testing;Web and internet services","document handling;information retrieval;transforms","document hardcopy;fast invariant transform algorithm;informal camera capture;language independent document retrieval;language independent e-documents access;multimedia data","","6","6","8","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Time–Frequency Correlation-Based Missing-Feature Reconstruction for Robust Speech Recognition in Band-Restricted Conditions","W. Kim; J. H. L. Hansen","Center for Robust Speech Syst. (CRSS), Univ. of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA","IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","20090714","2009","17","7","1292","1304","Band-limited speech represents one of the most challenging factors for robust speech recognition. This is especially true in supporting audio corpora from sources that have a range of conditions in spoken document retrieval requiring effective automatic speech recognition. The missing-feature reconstruction method has a problem when applied to band-limited speech reconstruction, since it assumes the observations in the unreliable regions are always greater than the latent original clean speech. The approach developed here depends only on reliable components to calculate the posterior probability to mitigate the problem. This study proposes an advanced method to effectively utilize the correlation information of the spectral components across time and frequency axes in an effort to increase the performance of missing-feature reconstruction in band-limited conditions. We employ an F1 area window and cutoff border window in order to include more knowledge on reliable components which are highly correlated with the cutoff frequency band. To detect the cutoff regions for missing-feature reconstruction, blind mask estimation is also presented, which employs the synthesized band-limited speech model without secondary training data. Experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods are accomplished using the SPHINX3 speech recognition engine and the TIMIT corpus. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed time-frequency (TF) correlation based missing-feature reconstruction method is significantly more effective in improving band-limited speech recognition accuracy. By employing the proposed TF-missing feature reconstruction method, we obtain up to 14.61% of average relative improvement in word error rate (WER) for four available bandwidths with cutoff frequencies 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 kHz, respectively, compared to earlier formulated methods. Experimental results on the National Gallery of the Spoken Word (NGSW) corpus also show the proposed method is- effective in improving band-limited speech recognition in real-life spoken document conditions.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2009.2015080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5165113","Band-limited speech;correlation;missing-feature;speech recognition;time–frequency (TF)","Automatic speech recognition;Cutoff frequency;Engines;Probability;Reconstruction algorithms;Robustness;Speech coding;Speech recognition;Speech synthesis;Training data","correlation methods;error statistics;information retrieval;speech recognition;time-frequency analysis","F1 area window;SPHINX3 speech recognition engine;TIMIT corpus;audio corpora;band-restricted condition;blind mask estimation;cutoff border window;cutoff frequency band;frequency 1.0 kHz;frequency 1.5 kHz;frequency 2.0 kHz;frequency 2.5 kHz;missing-feature reconstruction method;posterior probability;spoken document retrieval;synthesized band-limited speech model;time-frequency correlation","","9","","29","","","Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Users store and retrieve the information objects, denoted by object identifiers, from the network without knowing or bothering which host serves the actual request, comparable to earlier initiatives in networking that separate node identifiers from network locations. The capability to address content directly takes many optimizations, such as content- optimized routing or transparent caching, to the next level, while at the same time enabling novel services. In order to prevent unauthorized access to the information objects that roam around freely in the global network, objects shall be encrypted. We argue that for some use cases, e.g. when dealing with sensitive company-internal information, a stricter partitioning of the network is required. We propose and discuss two solutions to this problem, one focusing on securing the name resolution procedure, the other concentrating on the actual retrieval. Both mechanisms complement existing proposals by separating information objects in the private network domain while maintaining global reachability.","2164-7038;21647038","POD:978-1-4244-3437-4","10.1109/ICCW.2009.5207981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5207981","","Authentication;Cryptography;Hip;IP networks;Internet;Network servers;Peer to peer computing;Proposals;Routing;Web server","cryptography;information networks;information retrieval","content distribution network;content-optimized routing;global reachability maintenance;information object retrieval;information-centric networks;name resolution procedure;object encryption;private network domain;transparent caching","","0","1","14","","","14-18 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose to link video ads with relevant product/service information across e-commerce Web sites or portals towards ad recommendation in a cross-media manner. Firstly, we carry out semantic analysis within ad videos in which frames marked with product images (FMPI) are extracted. Secondly, we link ad videos with relevant ads on the Web by utilizing FMPI to search visually similar product images (e.g. appearance or logo) and to collect their accompanying text (brand name, category, description, or other tags) over popular e-commerce Websites or portals such as EBay, Amazon, Taobao, etc. We search visually similar product images with local sensitive hashing (LSH) in a naive Bayes near neighbor classifier. Finally, we may recommend more relevant products/services for ad videos through ranking those matched product images and categorizing useful tags of top ranked ads from the Web. Preliminary experiments have been carried out to demonstrate the idea of linking ad videos with product/service information from the Web.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:978-1-4244-4290-4","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202488","ad recommendation;video ad;video retrieval","Advertising;Data mining;Image analysis;Joining processes;Portals;Streaming media;TV;User-generated content;Web and internet services;Web search","Internet;Web sites;advertising;electronic commerce;image retrieval;information retrieval","Google AdSense;Internet services;MSRA videosense-imagesense;Web pages;Web search;e-commerce Web sites;frames marked with product images;image content analysis;local sensitive hashing method;naive Bayes near neighbor classifier;online media services;portals;semantic analysis;service information;text content analysis;video ADS linking;video content analysis","","5","","15","","","June 28 2009-July 3 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our idea is to appropriately set the due time to improve response time of peer-to-peer teaching material retrieval without sacrificing much recall. The proposed approach consists of two phases: construction phase and sharing phase. In construction phase, peer information is acquired and managed in a decentralized manner. In sharing phase, the due time is interactively determined and the results are retrieved.

That a key phrase is extracted means that it is present verbatim in the sentence to which it is assigned. Accurate key phrase extraction is fundamental to the success of many recent digital library applications, clustering, and semantic information retrieval techniques. The present research discusses a support vector machines (SVMs) approach for Vietnamese key phrase extraction and presents a number of experiments in which performance is incrementally improved. In general, the Vietnamese key phrase extracting process consists of three steps: word segmentation for identifying lexical units in an input sentence, part-of-speech tagging for words, and key phrase extraction for phrases. The performance of Vietnamese key phrase extraction systems is generally measured by the precision rate attained. This depends strongly on the nature and the size of a training set of key phrases. Most results are superior to 70.30% with a training set of 9,000 Vietnamese key phrases with of 2,000 sentences which was selected from the corpus of Vietnamese Lexicography Center (www.vietlex.com.vn).","","POD:978-1-4244-4566-0","10.1109/RIVF.2009.5174613","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5174613","","Data mining;Feature extraction;Industrial training;Learning systems;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Testing;Text analysis","information retrieval;natural languages;support vector machines;text analysis","Vietnamese Lexicography Center;Vietnamese key phrase extraction;automatic key phrase extraction;clustering;digital library;part-of-speech tagging;precision rate;semantic information retrieval;support vector machine;word segmentation","","0","","11","","","13-17 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The FCFNN starts with no hidden neurons and parsimoniously generates new hidden units according to the proposed growing criteria as learning proceeds. In the second learning phase, all free parameters of the hidden units are updated by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method. The performance of the FCFNN algorithm is compared with other popular algorithms like ANFIS, GDFNN and SOFNN, etc., for nonlinear function approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the learning speed of the proposed FCFNN algorithm is faster and the network structure is more compact while comparable generalization performance and accuracy are achieved, moreover, it is capable of extracting fuzzy rules online.","1948-9439;19489439","POD:978-1-4244-2722-2","10.1109/CCDC.2009.5192394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5192394","Extraction of Fuzzy Rules;Fuzzy Neural Network;Growing Criteria;Online Self-constructing","Approximation algorithms;Function approximation;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Least squares approximation;Least squares methods;Neural networks;Neurons;Parameter estimation;Radio access networks","Kalman filters;fuzzy neural nets;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;nonlinear filters","compact fuzzy neural network;extended Kalman filter method;fuzzy rules online extraction;network structure;nonlinear function approximation;online learning process;pruning mechanism","","2","","16","","","17-19 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Illumina digital gene expression (DGE) tag profiling allows comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed genes in organisms. Computer programs are necessary to handle the overwhelming amount of data generated by the Illumina genome analyzer. Here we report the design and implementation of a program for the analysis of differential gene expression based on Illumina data. The program TIGERA (tool for Illumina gene expression reads analysis) was written in perl utilizing newly-implemented and preexisting algorithms with a simple graphical user interface. The program performs the following tasks automatically after the required inputs are provided. The expression levels of high-quality Illumina tags for each of the two groups of libraries are determined and normalized as transcript per million (TPM). The Illumina tags are mapped to the annotated reference sequences to identify uniquely mapped tags. The mapping results are validated using information generated by digital restriction enzyme digestion of the reference sequences. Based on whether the tags matched to unique or multiple reference sequences after validation, the tags are grouped in three categories: one tag-one reference, one tag-one gene, and one tag-multiple genes. The tags within the first two categories are analyzed further to determine the reference sequences that contain unique expression levels or have potential alternative transcript splicing products. A Poisson mixture model is applied to analyze the differential expression of reference sequences with unique expression levels and the tags not being matched to the reference sequences. The progress of the analysis is monitored and reported. The analysis results are presented as text files and also deposited in a MySQL database that can be visualized and searched in Internet browsers.- Two biological replicates of the DGE tag libraries of the infective juveniles of the entomopathogenic nematode <i>Heterorhabditis</i> <i>bacteriophora</i> TT01 and GPS11 strains were sequenced using Illumina platform to demonstrate the performance of the program.","","POD:978-0-7695-3685-9","10.1109/OCCBIO.2009.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5159158","Illumina DGE tag profiling;TIGERA;differential gene expression;perl program","Algorithm design and analysis;Biochemistry;Bioinformatics;Gene expression;Genomics;Graphical user interfaces;Organisms;Software libraries;Solids;Splicing","Internet;SQL;bioinformatics;data analysis;enzymes;genetics;graphical user interfaces;information retrieval;microorganisms;molecular biophysics;online front-ends","DGE tag profiling;GPS11 strains;Heterorhabditis bacteriophora TT01;Illumina digital gene expression;Illumina genome analyzer;Internet browser;MySQL database;Poisson mixture model;TIGERA;computer program;data generation;digital restriction enzyme digestion;entomopathogenic nematode;graphical user interface;one tag-multiple gene category;one tag-one gene category;one tag-one reference category;tool for Illumina gene expression reads analysis;transcript splicing product","","0","","17","","","15-17 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we use the similarities among target images for improving the performance of the image retrieval systems by cluster-based retrieval of images by unsupervised learning. Our algorithm retrieves image clusters as retrieval results by applying K-means clustering algorithm to a collection of images collected by manifold ranking algorithm.

To manage the barrage of data, one needs to create mechanisms for identifying only those time intervals which are informative and worthy of further highlevel analysis either by machine or the human observer. We regard a time interval to be informative and contain an event if it is uncommon or distinct from routine background. Different events in general may unfold at different temporal scales. Here, we present a non-parametric distribution based approach for event detection in sensor network data. In this approach we employ multiple sliding windows at different scales to obtain the distribution of the data. We segment the temporal data stream and identify the potential event bearing candidates by comparing the present and past statistical behavior of the data. In the experiments we demonstrate the effect of optimum bandwidth selection on accuracy and the range of allowable window sizes and therefore time scales.

However, how to react after a given disaster occurs is also a key issue that can improve response times and save lives. GISCorps is a program of the urban and Regional Information Systems Association (URISA) that coordinates short-term, volunteer-based GIS services to underprivileged communities. In case of a natural disaster, the GISCorps members volunteer their time to characterize the prior and current status of the affected area (for example doing damage assessment) by the observation of satellites images and ancillary data using Google Earth. This information is crucial since it can help local services carry out better decisions and for scheduling response strategies. This methodology has the main advantage of being simple, easy to schedule and based in uniform and standard formats. However its main drawback is that it lacks scalability and relies only in the level of expertise of the member and his/her knowledge and tools. Current high performance computing and information retrieval techniques can provide to this community powerful features that can speed up and improve their procedures. Furthermore, they can provide value added mechanisms to automatically collect and process data concerning the disaster. This new knowledge can be used by the GIS expert to better identify areas or can be automatically forwarded to the local services. In this paper we propose a grid based new service architecture oriented to improved the GISCorps procedures and improve risk reduction in natural disasters. The main aim of this paper is to present a use case of how the forthcoming technologies can be used in natural disaster scenarios to improve response time and provide better information for the decision making process.","","POD:978-1-4244-3626-2","10.1109/RAST.2009.5158298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5158298","","Delay;Earth;Geographic Information Systems;Hazards;High performance computing;Information systems;Monitoring;Processor scheduling;Satellites;Scalability","condition monitoring;decision making;disasters;geographic information systems;grid computing;hazards;information retrieval;search engines;software architecture","GIS services;GISCorps;Google earth;ancillary data;decision making process;earth phenomenon monitoring;high performance computing;information retrieval techniques;natural disaster response;risk reduction;satellites images;scheduling response strategies;service oriented architecture;urban and regional information systems association","","1","","30","","","11-13 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Software watermarking is such a technique for protecting software by embedding secret information into the software to identify its copyright owner. This paper presents a novel robust dynamic watermarking scheme based on STBDW that first utilizes the Shamir threshold scheme to split the watermark number into pieces, which help to retrieve the original watermark with partial information and increase resilience. Then the pieces are run through the block cipher and self isomorphic mapping operations that makes the unrelated pieces become associated, which improves STBDW robustness further. In this article, we describe a software watermark embedding prototype in which the watermark pieces are embedded into the dynamic branch structure of program. Experiment shows that our technique has great robustness, it can effectively resist semantics-preserving code transform attacks and immune from most obfuscation attacks.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170389","Java bytecode;Shamir scheme;block cipher;self isomorphic mapping;software watermark","Automation;Computer crime;Computer science;Educational institutions;Embedded software;Protection;Resists;Robustness;Topology;Watermarking","copyright;information retrieval;security of data;watermarking","Shamir threshold scheme;branch based dynamic watermarking;copyright;dynamic branch structure;information retrieval;robust dynamic watermarking scheme;self isomorphic mapping operation;semantics-preserving code transform attack;software piracy;software watermark embedding prototype","","1","","14","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous studies on time-critical on-demand data broadcast were under the assumption that each client requests only one data item at a time. With rapid growth of time-critical information dissemination services in emerging applications, there is an increasing need for systems to support efficient processing of real-time multi-item requests. Little work, however, has been done. In this work, we study the behavior of six representative single-item request based scheduling algorithms in time-critical multi-item request environments. The results show that the performance of all algorithms deteriorates when dealing with multi-item requests. We observe that data popularity, which is an effective factor to save bandwidth and improve performance in scheduling single-item requests, becomes a hindrance to performance in multi-item request environments. Most multi-item requests scheduled by these algorithms suffer from a starvation problem, which is the root of performance deterioration.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:978-1-4244-3751-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161187","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5161187","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bandwidth;Broadcasting;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information management;Performance analysis;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm;Time factors","data handling;information retrieval;pattern recognition;real-time systems;scheduling","data scheduling;dynamic data access patterns;on-demand broadcast environments;real-time multiitem requests;system scalability;time-critical on-demand data broadcast;wireless data dissemination","","0","","12","","","23-29 May 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed case model integrates both content information and rating information. Instead of using syntactic techniques, case similarity between the current case and a retrieved case is measured based on semantic similarity algorithm in order to understand and reuse cases well stored in distributed case bases. The domain ontologies provide a formal representation which includes semantic descriptions of users and products. The proposed approach that considers semantic information of both the products' content descriptions and the user's preferences overcomes the limitations of the traditional recommender systems.","","POD:978-0-7695-3507-4","10.1109/CSIE.2009.634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170623","Case-based reasoning;intelligent recommendation;semantic web","Collaboration;Computer science;Current measurement;Filtering;History;Hybrid power systems;Intelligent systems;Ontologies;Recommender systems;Semantic Web","case-based reasoning;groupware;information filters;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","case-based recommendation technique;collaboration-based case modeling approach;formal representation;intelligent recommendation approach;ontology;product-based case modeling approach;recommender system;semantic Web technique;semantic-enhanced case-based reasoning","","0","","15","","","March 31 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study is looking into the opportunity to extract important facts from the PETRONAS health safety and environment (HSE) reports for database construction and analysis purpose. The reports are currently managed by PETRONAS Group HSE in Malaysia which contain the information on incidents and accidents occurred during the design, construction, operation and maintenance by all the PETRONAS Operating Units locally and worldwide. The effort to automate PETRONAS HSE reports will greatly benefit the PETRONAS Group HSE to automatically populate the database entries in which traditionally the task is arduous and time consuming. Many algorithms have been reported for IE ranging from simple statistical methods to advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods. This study investigates one of the NLP approach known as link grammar (LG) for extracting relevant information. LG appears within limited literature search to be the most suitable candidate algorithm.
