An explosion in the content of the Internet, the lowering in costs associated with imaging devices and the digital revolution have placed much higher requirements on the storage of graphics and video, both in commercial domains and at home. Fully automated indexing systems will be very desirable to manage and organise these large amounts of data. We tackle the problem of image indexing in the compressed domain using a neural network extraction technique together with a DCT domain watermark. This approach allows the indexing of the image entirely in the DCT domain, thus benefits from substantial computational savings. Coupled with DCT based watermarking, the technique allows for the real-time embedding of indexing data in popular image (JPEG) and video (MPEG) formats. Such a low-cost combination (both in processing and key storage) makes the method highly suitable for use in portable imaging devices such as digital cameras where it would be highly desirable to have some means of indexing the images they have stored.","","POD:0-7803-7300-6","10.1109/ICCE.2002.1013958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1013958","","Costs;Discrete cosine transforms;Explosions;Graphics;Image databases;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Watermarking","cameras;code standards;copy protection;data compression;data encapsulation;database indexing;discrete cosine transforms;embedded systems;feature extraction;image retrieval;multimedia databases;neural nets;visual databases","DCT domain watermark;JPEG;MPEG;automated indexing systems;compressed domain;computational savings;database indexing;digital cameras;image indexing;media databases;neural network extraction;portable imaging devices;real-time embedding;retrieval;watermarking","","2","","5","","","18-20 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A serious problem faced by these systems is the need to deal with the nonstationary database. In an image database system, image features are usually organized into an binary tree data structure, and to update the binary tree for a nonstationary database requires a large amount of computations. Here, we convert this difficult problem into a constrained optimization problem, and a scheme called IFDU (iteration-Free Data structure Updating technique) algorithm is proposed based on Lagrangian function to adapt the existing binary tree for a nonstationary database. Experimental results based on recall and precision reveal that our method provides a binary tree that is very close to the optimal one.

However, traditional relevance feedback usage in the context of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) may not be very efficient due to a significant overhead in database search and image download time in client-server environments. In this paper, we propose a CBIR system that efficiently addresses the inherent subjectivity in user perception during a retrieval session by employing a novel idea of intra-query modification and learning. The proposed system generates an object-level view of the query image using a new color segmentation technique. Color, shape and spatial features of individual segments are used for image representation and retrieval. The proposed system automatically generates a set of modifications by manipulating the features of the query segment(s). An initial estimate of user perception is learned from the user feedback provided on the set of modified images. This largely improves the precision in the first database search itself and alleviates the overheads of database search and image download. Precision-to-recall ratio is improved in further iterations through a new relevance feedback technique that utilizes both positive as well as negative examples. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of the proposed system.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2002.1017734","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1017734","","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image representation;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases;Transaction databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;image segmentation;relevance feedback","automatic query modification;client-server environments;color segmentation technique;content-based image retrieval;database;image representation;interactive query-by-example based image retrieval systems;intra-query modification;relevance feedback;relevance feedback usage","","39","2","34","","","Jun 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The first two proposed solutions uses relationships between the phase and the gain differences (GD), or gain samples (GS), in nepers. The last proposed solution uses a neural network NN for solving the problem. The NN incorporates a combination of the maximum entropy estimation algorithm with some additional nonlinear constraints.

As a first contribution we define such services, and show that they support many `XML-to-RDBMS' mappings. As a second contribution, we describe implementations of such services in a database cluster. We evaluate two implementations, one based on a two-level logging and isolation mechanism and one using Windows 2000 COM+ transactions. The main results are as follows: the first approach scales linearly for updates, and query response times are interactive. For example, with high workloads of 100 concurrent clients and 8 cluster components, query response times are 3 seconds on average.

Computer Graphics International 2001","20020807","2001","","","359","362","Proposes a novel watermarking algorithm for 3D volume data based on the spread-spectrum communication technique, which is invisible and robust. “Invisible” means that the 2D rendered image of this watermarked volume is perceptually indistinguishable from that of the original volume. “Robust” watermarking implies that the watermark is resistant to most intentional or unintentional attacks. We have implemented the algorithm in a software package and have conducted experiments showing that the watermark is invisible in the volume-rendered 2D images.

We then devise an image similarity metric that embodies our results, and develop a prototype system, which identifies the semantic category of the image and retrieves the most similar images from the database.

Local peaks in signal power are identified in each audio file, and a spectral vector is extracted near each peak.

We describe a framework that hides the complexities associated with creating and accessing distributed objects that access DBs through SQL queries. An application programmer (developer) needs only to specify the set query and select the DB and its driver. Access to the data is provided through an automatically generated application program interface (API) in the selected language.

This is not achievable via traditional indexes. Even if an exact nearest neighbor query is desired, the ANN-tree is demonstrably more efficient than existing structures like the R*-tree.

Our experimental results show that our clustering approach offers high retrieval effectiveness with low space overhead.

Soon, the only successful enterprises may be those who have successfully evolved into learning organizations. The philosophical bases underlying traditional decision support systems (DSSs) are ill-equipped either to handle this explosion of information in today's rapidly changing business environment, or to support a learning organization. A comprehensive knowledge management system (KMS) based on the philosophies of inquiring systems (ISs) allows organizational learning to occur by providing both decision support and management of existing and created knowledge. By combining the DSS paradigm with an IS, an organization is capable of designing a comprehensive KMS that fully supports learning within the organization. The development of such a system allows executives to rely more fully on the support system, freeing up valuable time to establish goals and to guide the organization to its ultimate success.","","POD:0-7695-0981-9","10.1109/HICSS.2001.926485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=926485","","Decision making;Decision support systems;Explosions;Feedback loop;Information management;Information retrieval;Information systems;Information technology;Knowledge management;Technology management","business data processing;decision support systems;feedback;knowledge based systems;philosophical aspects","changing business environment;decision support systems;executives;feedback loops;information bases;information explosion;information technology;inquiring organizations;inquiring systems;knowledge bases;knowledge management system;learning organizations;organizational goals;organizational learning;philosophical basis","","2","","47","","","6-6 Jan. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The current approach searches for specific types of content information relevant to the presence or absence of speakers or persons.

The research leading to this paper focused on this problem, i.e. efficiency and scalability. A novel representation of color histograms is presented. The introduced model is based on hierarchical image adaptive color histograms. One important aspect of the envisaged hierarchic definition is that details at various levels of scale can be obtained. For fast search of similar features in large databases large sets of non-similar images are discriminated at very low computational cost using low detailed descriptions.

First, simulation runs were used to quantify the trends in red and near infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Second, advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) measurements obtained over Canada during the 1996 growing season, together with reanalyzed IWV content data, were employed to determine the actual impact of constant IWV values. Third, various options in characterizing IWV for atmospheric corrections of AVHRR composites were examined. It was found that (1) as expected, IWV affects near-infrared radiation substantially more than red, although the latter is also altered; (2) that additional, subtle interactions take place between IWV, radiance levels, and viewing geometry that influence the retrieved surface reflectance; (3) that spatial and temporal variation in IWV caused changes in the normalized difference vegetation index up to 7.5% in relative terms during the peak green period; and (4) that IWV varies so substantially that pixel and date-specific values need to be used for the atmospheric correction of AVHRR data.

The methods used in search engines in order to retrieve documents most similar to user-defined sets of keywords are not applicable to targets which are medium to large size documents, because of even greater noise effects, stemming from the presence of a large number of words unrelated to the overall topic in the document. Inverted representation is the dominant method for indexing text, but it is not as suitable for document-to-document similarity search, as for short user queries. One way of improving the quality of similarity search is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), which maps the documents from the original set of words to a concept space. Unfortunately, LSI maps the data into a domain, in which it is not possible to provide effective indexing techniques. The authors investigate new ways of providing conceptual search among documents by creating a representation in terms of conceptual word-chains. This technique also allows effective indexing techniques so that similarity queries can be performed on large collections of documents by accessing a small amount of data. We demonstrate that our scheme outperforms standard textual similarity search on the inverted representation both in terms of quality and search efficiency","","POD:0-7695-1119-8","10.1109/ICDM.2001.989494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=989494","","Indexing;Information retrieval;Intrusion detection;Large scale integration;Libraries;Recommender systems;Search engines;Vocabulary","indexing;query processing;search problems;text analysis","LSI;Latent Semantic Indexing;concept space;conceptual document search;conceptual indexing;conceptual word-chains;document retrieval;document-to-document similarity search;indexing techniques;inverted representation;keywords;noise effects;qualitative perspective;search engines;short user queries;similarity queries;similarity search;standard textual similarity search;text data;textual descriptions;user-defined sets","","5","","13","","","2001","29 Nov 2001-02 Dec 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm treats all the signatures as an abstract threshold graph, where the threshold is determined based on local data statistics. Similar clusters are identified as highly connected regions in the graph. This algorithm outperforms simple thresholding and hierarchical clustering techniques in identifying a set of manually-determined similar clusters from a dataset of 46,356 Web video clips. At 95% precision, our algorithm attains 85% recall while simple thresholding and complete-link hierarchical scheme attain 67% and 75% recall respectively.

After presenting a query object, the HMMs which represent the individual clusters in the images are matched against the feature sequence calculated on the query image.

In order to minimize the objective function of the FCM algorithm, the small clusters grab some points belonging to the largest clusters. This article presents a simple and intuitive idea to approach this problem. It consists of some heuristic adjustments to the calculation of the Euclidean distances employed in FCM algorithm.

As a hidden storage place, the contents of a proxy cache are generally transparent to users who cannot find out what are currently available in cache. As a result, users usually surf/search the Web repeatedly for the same information that may have been retrieved by others and could be available from cache. Experiments show that more than 60% of total cache contents are never used and the low utilization rate is largely due to users' unawareness of the cache contents. In this paper, we propose a framework for efficient management of Web data in Squid proxy cache, where data in cache are managed both as physical objects as well as logical pages. The logical pages in cache are then indexed in terms of keywords and popularity and users can search the contents of cache directly.

We assume that each agent is situated in a particular context or, more precisely, that he believes to be in a particular context and chooses a t-norm accordingly. Then we introduce a process of negotiation among the agents, each of them endowed with a notion of similarity associated to the context; for this purpose we attempt to formulate a theory of negotiation as a fragment of modal logic and in particular we show that similarity-based unification can be expressed in terms of modal logic, by means of an ""acceptance"" operator","","POD:0-7803-7078-3","10.1109/NAFIPS.2001.944353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=944353","","Books;Cognitive science;Context modeling;Deductive databases;Guidelines;Humans;Information retrieval;Logic programming","formal logic;multi-agent systems","acceptance operator;conjunction;context;modal logic;negotiation;similarity-based unification;t-norm;unification","","0","","13","","","25-28 July 2001","25 Jul 2001-28 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is based on the architectural plant model (AMAP), which integrates knowledge of botanical growth processes and real plant measurements. AMAP is encapsulated in a flexible interface software called AMAP2SAR that allows one to (1) simulate a three-dimensional (3-D) plant such as a tree, (2) transform the tree into a collection of cylinders, and (3) feed theoretical models such as radiative transfer (RT) models. The method is illustrated by an example of Austrian black pine plantations in southern France. Simulated characteristics of black pines are validated for stands up to 50 years old and for a given environment. The results show the ability to derive classical forest parameters as well as those needed for electromagnetic models (such as geometry) as a function of age. Vertical profiles of canopy elements are derived and point out the vertical heterogeneity of the stands after they are 20 years old for parameters having an impact on the backscatter such as diameter and number of branches. Consequently, the crown layer variability with age and canopy depth should be considered in RT models.

IT shops must efficiently manage data and still provide a rock-solid system with guaranteed 24/7 access. Finding a way to effectively fulfil this mission requires rethinking traditional data management methods. Among the many tools already available, hierarchical storage management (HSM) is an effective data management solution for this demanding new environment. HSM enables centralized data management across a variety of storage platforms, such as servers, RAID (redundant arrays of inexpensive disks), magneto-optical jukeboxes, and tape libraries. It maintains data through a three-level management system. Level one is online data maintained in an online server volume or RAID. Level two is infrequently accessed data; so HSM maintains it in slower storage platforms. Level three is offline data stored in a tape library or on shelved media. The business rarely accesses such data, basically keeping it to comply with record retention rules","1520-9202;15209202","","10.1109/6294.918223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=918223","","Databases;Environmental management;File servers;Information retrieval;Libraries;Local area networks;Magnetooptic effects;Material storage;Network servers;Road transportation","business data processing;storage management","RAID;data management;e-commerce;hierarchical storage management;magneto-optical jukeboxes;mission-critical data;online data;redundant arrays of inexpensive disks;servers;tape libraries;three-level management system","","1","","","","","Mar/Apr 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Measurements demonstrated the merits of Vagabond, namely the simple design, the implicit heterogeneity inherited from CORBA, and its speed. The system (renamed as M<sup>3</sup>) was implanted inside an Oracle8i database system which is able to run Java code as a stored procedure. Further measurements have justified the idea presented above, ie. sending agents directly inside the database can decrease the response time of multimedia content search and retrieval. However, the required modifications made the embedded agency accessible for clients using only Aurora, Oracle's modified Visi-broker ORB.

However, accessing a large chunk of Web data incurs a great amount of access latency while a mobile user migrates across cells. This paper investigates this problem and proposes an effective way of delivering such data to a mobile user in a ubiquitous computing system. Our data delivery (/spl Dscr//sup 2/) strategy is based on the dynamic programming skill needed to pre-assign the user-requested data on the possible cells to be visited in order to reduce the access latency. We first design an encoding method for the cells and then derive the properties of the encoding scheme. These properties are then used in our algorithm to deliver the data. Finally, experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7695-0996-7","10.1109/DASFAA.2001.916380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916380","","Bandwidth;Chaos;Computer science;Data communication;Delay;Design methodology;Dynamic programming;Information retrieval;Ubiquitous computing;Web pages","Internet;cellular radio;data communication;dynamic programming;encoding;information resources;mobile computing","World Wide Web page browsing;data access latency;data delivery strategy;dynamic programming;mobile radio cell encoding method;ubiquitous computing systems;user-requested data pre-assignment;wireless devices","","2","","9","","","21-21 April 2001","18 Apr 2001-21 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional bottlenecks, like copy operations, multiple copies of the same data element in main memory, and checksum calculation in communication protocols are avoided by applying three orthogonal techniques: zero-copy-one-copy memory architecture, network level framing, and integrated error management.

In this paper we propose a gain-based cache replacement policy, Min-SAUD, for wireless data dissemination when cache consistency must be enforced before a cached item is used. Min-SAUD considers several factors that affect cache performance, namely access probability, update frequency, data size, retrieval delay, and cache validation cost. Min-SAUD is optimal in terms of the stretch performance measure. Preliminary experimental results show that in most cases the Min-SAUD replacement policy substantially outperforms two existing policies, namely LRU and SAIU.","0190-3918;01903918","POD:0-7695-1257-7","10.1109/ICPP.2001.952071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=952071","","Broadcasting;Costs;Delay;Environmental management;Frequency;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Performance analysis;Resource management;Surface acoustic waves","cache storage;storage management","LRU;Min-SAUD;SAIU;access probability;cache consistency;cache management method;cache validation cost;data size;data updates;gain-based cache replacement;optimal cache replacement policy;retrieval delay;stretch performance measure;update frequency;variable data sizes;wireless data dissemination","","6","","15","","","3-7 Sept. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Search services on the WWW are becoming increasing popular among users because of the huge amount of data available and consequently it is difficult to retrieve and filter it. Several works have argued that traditional term-based search engines are not very useful since the resulting ranking depends on the precision of the user in expressing the query. However, usually, users are unclear about the information they need and so they do not give much thought to query formulation. Moreover, if the query pertains to topics which are abundant on the Web, search services become unusable because of the huge number of pages obtained. For instance, at the time of this work, AltaVista returned more than 18,000,000 pages in reply to the query asking for the documents related to the word ""java"".","","POD:0-7695-1393-X","10.1109/WISE.2001.996474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996474","","Algorithm design and analysis;Filters;Humans;Information resources;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Navigation;Web pages;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;information resources;query processing;search engines","AltaVista;World Wide Web;authoritative Web pages;probabilistic approach;query formulation;term-based search engines","","0","","3","","","3-6 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end a number of relevance feedback mechanisms are currently adopted to refine image queries. They are aimed either to locally modify the feature space or to shift the query point towards more promising regions of the feature space. A novel adaptive query shifting mechanism is proposed to improve retrieval performance beyond that provided by other relevance feedback mechanisms. In addition we discuss the extent to which query shifting may provide better performance than feature weighting and provide experimental results on the complementarity of the two approaches. Finally, some combinational approaches are proposed to exploit such complementarities","","POD:0-7695-1183-X","10.1109/ICIAP.2001.957046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=957046","","Art;Availability;Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Spatial databases;Visual databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image representation;image retrieval;relevance feedback","adaptive query shifting;content-based image retrieval;feature relevance learning;feature-based image representation;relevance feedback;retrieval performance;user similarity perception","","4","","10","","","26-28 Sep 2001","26 Sep 2001-28 Sep 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a brute-force approach, the exhaustive search can be employed for this computation. However, this exhaustive search is time-consuming and limits the usefulness of such systems. Thus, there is a growing demand for a fast algorithm which provides the same retrieval results as the exhaustive search. We propose a fast search algorithm based on a multiresolution data structure. The proposed algorithm computes the lower bound of distance at each level and compares it with the latest minimum distance, starting from the low-resolution level. Once it is larger than the latest minimum distance, we can remove the candidates without calculating the full-resolution distance. By doing this, we can dramatically reduce the total computational complexity. It is noticeable that the proposed fast algorithm provides not only the same retrieval results as the exhaustive search, but also a faster searching ability than existing fast algorithms. For additional performance improvement, we can easily combine the proposed algorithm with existing tree-based algorithms. The algorithm can also be used for the fast matching of various features such as luminance histograms, edge histograms, and local binary partition textures","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/76.920197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920197","","Content based retrieval;Histograms;Image databases;Image resolution;Image retrieval;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Spatial databases","computational complexity;feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;image texture;tree searching;visual databases","computational complexity reduction;content-based image retrieval systems;distance computation;edge histograms;exhaustive search;fast multiresolution feature matching algorithm;fast multiresolution search algorithm;large image databases;latest minimum distance;local binary partition textures;low-resolution level;lower distance bound;luminance histograms;multiresolution data structure;tree-based algorithms","","18","","14","","","May 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
