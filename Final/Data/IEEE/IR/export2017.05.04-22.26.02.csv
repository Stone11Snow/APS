Existing approaches of TARS choose to search the entire trust network, which have very high computational cost. Though the trust network is the scale-free network, we show via experiments that TARS cannot find satisfactory number of recommenders by directly applying the classical searching mechanism of the scale-free network. This is because it chooses the local highest-degree node at each step of the trust propagation. Since the power of the trust network's degree distribution is not big enough, the selected nodes cannot cover superior number of users. In this paper, we propose an efficient searching mechanism, named S_Searching, for TARS based on the scale-freeness of trust networks: choosing the global highest-degree nodes to construct a Skeleton, and searching the recommenders via this Skeleton. Benefiting from the superior outdegrees of the nodes in the Skeleton, S_Searching can find the recommenders very efficiently. Experimental results show that S_Searching can find almost the same number of recommenders as that of conducting full search, which is much more than that of applying the classical searching mechanism in the scale-free network, while the computational complexity and cost is much less.","2324-898X;2324898X","Electronic:978-0-7695-4745-9; POD:978-1-4673-2172-3","10.1109/TrustCom.2012.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296205","recommender system;scale-freeness;searching mechanism;trust network;trust-aware","Computational complexity;Computational modeling;Educational institutions;Internet;Recommender systems;Skeleton;Strontium","complex networks;computational complexity;information retrieval;recommender systems;security of data","S-Searching;Skeleton;TARS;classical searching mechanism;computational complexity;cost;local highest-degree node;trust network degree distribution;trust network scale-freeness;trust propagation;trust-aware recommender systems","","1","","13","","","25-27 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While search engines like Google help retrieve information using keywords, the large volumes of unstructured search results returned by search engines make it hard to track the evolution of an event. A story chain is composed of a set of news articles that reveal hidden relationships among different events. Traditional keyword-based search engines provide limited support for finding story chains. In this paper, we propose a random walk based algorithm to find story chains. When breaking news happens, many media outlets report the same event. We have two pruning mechanisms in the algorithm to automatically exclude redundant articles from the story chain and to ensure efficiency of the algorithm.

In this paper, a pixel-based quantitative fusion algorithm of multi-sensor observations with combination of physical and empirical model is presented. Firstly, the parameter was retrieved from one sensor data based on physical model, and then used to establish the pixel-based empirical relationships with measurements of another sensor. Thus, the two retrieval methods could be combined and the observations of two sensors could also be fused. The algorithm was applied to fuse MISR with multi-angular measurements and MODIS with high temporal resolution for retrieval of Leaf Area Index (LAI).

These technologies require complex processing of large amount of textual information. However, they cannot currently be effectively applied to Web-based search due to various obstacles, such as lack of semantic tagging. A new approach proposed in this paper supports Web-based search for intelligence information utilizing evidence-based natural language processing (NLP). This approach combines traditional NLP methods for filtering of Web-search results, Grounded Theory to test the completeness of the evidence, and Evidential Analysis to test the quality of gathered information. The enriched information derived from the Web-search will be transferred to the intelligence services knowledge base for handling by an effective Intranet search system thus increasing substantially the information for intelligence analysis.

To accelerate forward-projection, we analyze the CT geometry to identify the intrinsic parallelism and data access sequence for a highly parallel hardware architecture. To improve the efficiency of this architecture, we propose a water-filling buffer to remove pipeline stalls, and an out-of-order sectored processing to reduce the off-chip memory access by up to three orders of magnitude. We make a floating-point to fixed-point conversion based on numerical simulations and demonstrate comparable image quality at a much lower implementation cost. As a proof of concept, a 5-stage fully pipelined, 55-way parallel separable-footprint forward-projector is prototyped on a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA for a throughput of 925.8 million voxel projections/s at 200 MHz clock frequency, 4.6 times higher than an optimized 16-threaded program running on an 8-core 2.8-GHz CPU.

These FW panels are one of the critical components in the ITER tokamak with a maximum surface heat flux of 5 MW/m<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, a qualification test needs to be performed with the goal to qualify the joining technologies required for the ITER FW. Various mock-ups were fabricated to develop the manufacturing procedure of FW components. For the nondestructive examination of the fabricated mock-ups, an ultrasonic test (UT) was performed with optimized probes. The UT was performed by using a three-axis digital ultrasonic C-scan system and software. The system comprised an ultrasonic pulser and receiver, model Panametrics 5800PR; a personal computer having an internal analog/digital converter board and four-axis motion control board; and a three-axis scanning tank. Two types of transducers were used for this experiment. One was Panametrics V312-SU, having a center frequency of 10 MHz (nominal) and a piezoelectric element diameter of 0.25 in with a flat protective layer for the Be/Cu. The other was Panametrics V309-SU with a center frequency of 5 MHz and an element diameter of 0.5 in for the Cu/SS interface. Winspect software controlled all aspects of data acquisition, motion control, data archiving, and image display. Based on the acceptance criteria, the average amplitude of the interface signals, which have about 50% of the reference echo amplitude, was recorded and analyzed on each beryllium tile. An image-analysis software analyzed the statistics of amplitude distribution and calculated the unacceptable area. Each mock-up that passed these UTs was concluded to qualify the joining technologies required for an ITER FW by using a high-heat flux test facility. As a result of these qualification tests based on the acceptance criteria of an ITER FW, the fabrication technologies will be utilized to develop the FW of plasma-facing components.","0093-3813;00933813","","10.1109/TPS.2012.2206614","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6253269","ITER;mock-up;nondestructive examination;qualification test;semiprototype;ultrasonic test (UT)","Acoustics;Beryllium;Cooling;Fabrication;Heating;Software","Tokamak devices;analogue-digital conversion;armour;beryllium;copper;data acquisition;heat sinks;image processing;information retrieval systems;joining processes;motion control;piezoelectric transducers;plasma toroidal confinement;plasma-wall interactions;protective coatings;stainless steel;ultrasonic materials testing","FW panels;ITER first wall;ITER tokamak;Panametrics 5800PR;Winspect software;acceptance criteria;amplitude distribution;beryllium armour;data acquisition;data archiving;four-axis motion control board;frequency 10 MHz;heat sink;high-heat flux test facility;image display;image-analysis software;interface signals;internal analog-digital converter;joining technology;manufacturing procedure;nondestructive testing;piezoelectric element;plasma-facing components;reference echo amplitude;stainless steel back plate;surface heat flux;three-axis digital ultrasonic C-scan system;three-axis scanning tank;transducers;ultrasonic pulser;ultrasonic receiver;ultrasonic test","","1","","8","","20120730","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Error-correcting codes are very important for rank modulation, and they have attracted interest among researchers. In this work, we explore a new approach, systematic error-correcting codes for rank modulation. In an (n, k) systematic code, we use the permutation induced by the levels of n cells to store data, and the permutation induced by the first k cells (k <; n) has a one-to-one mapping to information bits. Systematic codes have the benefits of enabling efficient information retrieval and potentially supporting more efficient encoding and decoding procedures. We study systematic codes for rank modulation equipped with the Kendall's τ-distance. We present (k + 2, k) systematic codes for correcting one error, which have optimal sizes unless perfect codes exist. We also study the design of multi-error-correcting codes, and prove that for any 2 ≤ k <; n, there always exists an (n, k) systematic code of minimum distance n-k.

Loosely-coupled associative computing techniques, which have so far not been considered, can provide the break-through needed for a distributed data management scheme. Using a novel lightweight associative memory algorithm known as Edge Detecting Hierarchical Graph Neuron (Edge HGN), data retrieval/processing can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem, conducted across multiple records within a single-cycle, utilizing a parallel approach.

This paper proposes a scalable data extraction model in data warehouse via Complex Semantic Event (CSE). CSE is an intelligent process to integrate data extraction, aggregation and transformation. The schema of CSE is automatically synchronized and easy to scale for changing requirement. High level aggregated data is stored on the server, while lower level data could be stored in distributed hosts since they are rarely queried. This CSE based approach also promotes the idea of implementing data warehouse aggregation in distributed network or computing cloud. This method decreases the load on servers and reduces network traffic. We implemented this CSE based model in our monitoring system, where data warehouse is used as the data source for trend analysis and prediction. It has been observed that this approach can improve system performance and is helpful in resource load balancing.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4748-0; POD:978-1-4673-1640-8","10.1109/ICDEW.2012.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6313663","","Data models;Data warehouses;Distributed databases;Monitoring;Semantics;Servers;XML","cloud computing;data integrity;data warehouses;information retrieval;resource allocation","CSE;cloud computing;complex semantic event processing;data source;data warehouse aggregation;distributed network;distributed system;resource load balancing;scalable data extraction model;scalable data warehouse model","","0","","24","","","1-5 April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We train an instance-based classifier on our manually annotated dataset to select the appropriate semantic role of each chunk.

Characterizing leaf orientation is a key step to the retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) based on remotely sensed data, particularly discrete point data such as that provided by light detection and ranging. In this paper, we present a new method that indirectly and nondestructively retrieves foliage elements' orientation and distribution from point cloud data (PCD) obtained using a terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) approach. An artificial tree was used to develop the method using total least square fitting techniques to reconstruct the normal vectors from the PCD. The method was further validated on live tree crowns. An equation with a single parameter for characterizing the leaf angular distribution of crowns was developed. The TLS-based algorithm captures 97.4% (RMSE = 1.094 degrees, p <; 0.001) variation of the leaf inclination angle compared to manual measurements for an artificial tree. When applied to a live tree seedling and a mature tree crown, the TLS-based algorithm predicts 78.51% (RMSE = 1.225 degrees, p <; 0.001) and 57.28% (RMSE = 4.412 degrees, p <; 0.001) of the angular variability, respectively.

In these speech-centric applications, the output of ASR as “noisy” text is fed into down-stream processing systems to accomplish the designated tasks of translation, information retrieval, or natural language understanding, etc. In conventional applications, the ASR model as a sub-system is usually trained without considering the down-stream systems. This often leads to sub-optimal end-to-end performance. In this paper, we propose a unifying end-to-end optimization framework in which the model parameters in all sub-systems including ASR are learned by Extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithms via optimizing the criteria directly tied to the end-to-end performance measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a speech translation task using the spoken language translation benchmark test of IWSLT. Our experimental results show that the proposed method leads to significant improvement of translation quality over the conventional techniques based on separate modular sub-system design. We also analyze the EBW-based optimization algorithms employed in our work and discuss its relationship with other popular optimization techniques.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4673-0046-9; POD:978-1-4673-0045-2; USB:978-1-4673-0044-5","10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289102","EBW algorithm;Speech translation;end-to-end optimization criteria;speech recognition","Computational modeling;Information processing;Linear programming;Optimization;Speech;Speech recognition;Training","information retrieval;language translation;natural language processing;optimisation;speech recognition","ASR model;EBW-based optimization algorithms;IWSLT;automatic speech recognition;conversational understanding;down-stream processing systems;end-to-end optimization;end-to-end performance measure;extended Baum-Welch algorithms;information retrieval;natural language understanding;noisy text;speech translation;speech translation task;speech-centric information processing;spoken language translation benchmark test;suboptimal end-to-end performance;voice search","","1","","20","","","25-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, most existing works extract high-dimensional features to represent models and suffer from practical limitations. First, misalignment in high-dimensional features may produce unreliable euclidean distances and affect retrieval accuracy. Second, the curse of dimensionality also degrades efficiency. In this paper, we propose an embedding retrieval framework to improve the practicability of these methods. It is based on a manifold learning technique, the Diffusion Map (DM). We project all pairwise distances onto a low-dimensional space. This improves retrieval accuracy because intercluster distances are exaggerated. Then we adapt the Density-Weighted Nyström extension and further propose a novel step to locally align the Nyström embedding to the eigensolver embedding so as to reduce extension error and preserve retrieval accuracy. Finally, we propose a heuristic to handle disconnected manifolds by augmenting the kernel matrix with multiple similarity measures and shortcut edges, and further discuss the choice of DM parameters. We have incorporated two existing matching algorithms for testing. Our experimental results show improvement in precision at high recalls and in speed.

Examples of unconventional methods include setting up cyberattack cells to disrupt critical infrastructures; using unmonitored financial resources to disrupt or bankrupt national economies; and establishing organizations within countries to desensitize the population to terrorist objectives. Sometimes there are patterns, but most often there are no obvious patterns. This presentation addresses the detection of emergent terrorist events by finding critical pieces of information buried in large volumes of data spanning many disparate data sources. The first part of this talk defines the needle in the haystack problem and discusses the associated informatics issues. Disciplines such as computer science, law enforcement, intelligence, and health, are shown to have common technical issues such as searching through large volumes of unstructured text and across confidential databases as well as to have unique technical issues. The second part of this presentation explores various example terrorist threats and how needles in the information haystack space could be identified; how hypothesis development and vetting techniques can lay a foundation for data collection using data mining approaches; and how analysis shaped by plausible means can be contrasted with the vulnerabilities and accessibilities of the terrorist objectives. The last part of this presentation focuses on future research areas needed to expand the ability to detect needles in haystacks. The suggested research areas span the informatics domain and include new policies, hypothesis-based analysis, and data access techniques. In summary, the presentation addresses the identification of unknown and unexpected needles in information haystacks for the purpose of identifying emergent terrorist activities.

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of home tele health interventions for people with asthma. Methods: An electronic search was performed in three different databases (Medline, Embase and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register). English language articles were selected for inclusion if they met the following criteria: randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a receiving tele health care with receiving usual care, inclusion of patients with asthma of any level of severity, and evaluation of efficacy or quality of life. Results: A total of 24 articles met inclusion criteria and were assessed. The included studies investigated various types of telecommunications technology to support and deliver healthcare from a distance. Improvement in asthma symptoms, quality of life and self-care behaviors as well as reduction in hospitalizations and emergency department visits was observed in different studies. There was a high level of acceptance of using the tele health systems among both healthcare providers and individuals. However, no statistically significant difference between the groups was observed in most of included studies. Conclusions: Overall, home tele health interventions appear to enhance patient access to healthcare professionals. Tele health solutions for asthma care are feasible and well-accepted and increase self-management skills, but evidence for their effectiveness in improving clinical outcomes is not strong. More research is needed to assess the effects of the range of telemedicine technologies.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4684-1; POD:978-1-4673-1328-5","10.1109/IMIS.2012.155","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296975","Ambient Assisted Living;asthma;e-health;home monitoring;review;telehealth","Diseases;Education;Employee welfare;Monitoring;Pediatrics;Telemedicine","database management systems;diseases;health care;information retrieval;telemedicine","Cochrane Controlled Trials Register database;Embase database;English language;Medline database;RCT;asthma care;asthma symptoms;clinical outcomes;electronic search;emergency department visits;home telehealth interventions;hospitalization reduction;life quality;randomized controlled trial;self-care behaviors;telehealth care;telemedicine technologies","","0","","44","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many researches that use WordNet, have calculated similarity between each pair-word by considering Depth of Subsumer of the words and Shortest Path between them. In this paper we have improved semantic similarity measure by giving weights to edges of WordNet hierarchy. We have considered that the nearer an edge is to the root in the hierarchy, the less effect it has in calculating the similarity. Therefore, we have offered a new formula for weighting the edges of hierarchy and based on that calculated the distance between two words and depth of words; and then tuned parameters of the transfer functions using particle swarm optimization.

The objective of a specialized version of the system is to provide medical and healthcare information services to users via interactive search for personalized patient needs. Patients usually have questions regarding healthcare, including those which concern illness symptoms, duration and types of treatment, possible drug effects, and more. Authorized personnel would often be ideal in responding to such needs; however they could potentially be very expensive, and not easy to support and maintain. If patients could have access to information at their home, by means of i-phone or online access, this could save time, doctor office visit expenses, as well as valuable and restricted medical time. What is more, information concerning other anonymized and similar patient cases provides knowledge and perspective on a wide range of patient issues. From the doctors' perspective, they typically need to spend time on differential analysis about new patient cases: study symptoms, research possible causes, rank results by emergency priority and treat them accordingly. A search system that would direct a doctor (or patient/user) to similar patient cases would save significant amount of manual search time. The powerful new feature of this system is the storage and mining of past patient cases knowledge, to create metadata to be used in the subsequent retrieval of relevant documents. Finally, the interactive search system would speed up identification of rare cases; for instance, symptoms that do not appear commonly in past cases may require special treatment or expert referral. We build a model which dynamically learns medical needs of interacting MDs and patients. The model works on free or unstructured text, allowing disambiguation of vague words and flexibility in descri- ing medical needs. In addition, both experts with an advanced knowledge of medical terminology, and beginning users using basic medical terms, can achieve high search relevance. Furthermore, our approach obviates the need for the assignment of tags or labels, such as treatment, symptoms, causes, to documents, to respond effectively to user queries. In particular, we build a temporal difference algorithm to predict user's information needs by incorporating both current and predicted knowledge into learning the user profile. Our source of information about the user consists of submitted queries and feedback on the returned results. We tested our system on publicly available medical data (OhsuMed TREC dataset 2002) and we achieved a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy, compared to the literature. We provide quantitative results as well as demonstration screenshots which illustrate a) the value of interaction (user time spent with system versus results accuracy), b) the value of using medical terminology understanding, when compared with simple general words, and c) the value of allowing the maximum number of feedback submissions to vary.","2166-0778;21660778","Electronic:978-1-5090-5643-9; POD:978-1-4673-2318-5; USB:978-0-7695-4770-1","10.1109/SRII.2012.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311035","healthcare information services;interactive retrieval;medical data retrieval;reinforcement learning;temporal difference","Diseases;Information services;Medical diagnostic imaging;Senior citizens;Terminology;Unified modeling language","data mining;health care;human computer interaction;information needs;information retrieval;interactive systems;medical information systems;text analysis","SAP;Saffron;basic medical terms;collaboration project;data mining;data storage;differential analysis;document retrieval;fast interactive search system;free or unstructured text;healthcare information services;human-machine interaction search system;information needs;medical information services;medical terminology;metadata;patient cases knowledge;patient issues;personalized patient needs;publicly available medical data;rare cases;submitted queries;temporal difference algorithm;unstructured text","","0","","25","","","24-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The summary was extracted by selecting the sentences that have the highest rankings. The experiment was conducted on a number of Vietnamese news documents. The result showed that the summaries created by Genetic Programming are better than those created by a number of statistic based methods and even by human (non-experts).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4760-2; POD:978-1-4673-2171-6","10.1109/KSE.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6299404","Automatic Text Summarization;Genetic Programming;Statistical Methods","Feature extraction;Genetic programming;Humans;Sociology;Statistics;Testing;Training","information retrieval;text analysis","Internet;Vietnamese news documents;automatic text summarization;document information extraction;genetic programming","","1","","23","","","17-19 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such network architecture assumes that it is the responsibility of the network itself to locate content and deliver it to the user in the most efficient way. In Content-Aware Network (CAN), data objects are replicated on multiple server machines, on behalf of content publishers, with the use of caching protocol. Client user access the content from the most appropriate server, at the rate allocated by the CAN, which affects the perceived utility. In this paper the problem of content placement and transmission rate allocation is considered. The problem is formulated as maximizing the total income of CAN operator, which receives payments proportional to the utility from subscribed users. However, CAN operator needs to pay for link utilization to the physical network operator and for server storage space to the hosting company. A two-level decomposition algorithm is presented which can be used as a decision support tool for the CAN operator.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5640-8; POD:978-1-4673-2001-6; USB:978-0-7695-4737-4","10.1109/SAINT.2012.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305303","capacity allocation;data placement;mixed nonlinear integer programming","Companies;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Internet;Protocols;Resource management;Servers","Internet;cache storage;client-server systems;decision support systems;information retrieval","CAN operator;caching protocol;client user access;content delivery;content location;content placement;content-aware networks;data access;data replication;decision support tool;link utilization;multiple server machines;network architecture;network design;payments;physical network operator;server addresses;server storage space;subscribed users;transmission rate allocation;two-level decomposition algorithm;two-level heuristic algorithm;utility-based data placement","","1","","21","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We reproduced the sound field of one of the parades with the recorded sound sources. We employed point-source loudspeakers for reproducing Japanese traditional drums, flutes, and bells with omni-directional radiation characteristics.

It constructs a domain ontology by integrating multi-resource and heterogeneous data, generates a user's interest ontology by analyzing the user's demographic characteristics and personal preferences.

In this paper we identify the pedagogical features of an LO, and use them to classify an LO for the appropriate instructional setting.

We provide a computationally-efficient optimization algorithm for the problem to further the applicability of the proposed framework to large real world datasets.

We first decomposed the genome into different precincts. For each precinct, we tried to use exhaustive search for tagSNPs selection. If it was not feasible, we then turned to a greedy algorithm for selecting tagSNPs.

The representation involves a 2-dimensional tree structure, where each node encodes the musical note and the dimensions correspond to the time and simultaneous multiple notes, respectively. Since the temporal structure and the synchrony of simultaneous events are both essential in music, our representation reflects them explicitly. In the conventional approaches to music representation from audio, note extraction is usually performed prior to structure analysis, but accurate note extraction has been a difficult task. In the proposed method, note extraction and structure estimation is performed simultaneously and thus the optimal solution is obtained with a unified inference procedure. That is, we propose an extended 2-dimensional infinite probabilistic context-free grammar and a sparse factor model for spectrogram analysis. An efficient inference algorithm, based on Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and dynamic programming, is presented.

We captured all documents from Lexis-Nexis Academic's BBC International Monitoring - which contains translated transcriptions of web pages, broadcasts, newspapers, and other content - for each of 47 Muslim nations (MNs) using the search term: jihad and MN name. We presented a new kind of semantic network time series analysis of this text. Unlike most semantic network analysis, our nodes were time segments, not words. The link strengths were similarity scores of time nodes across 779,192 word pairs. The time nodes were 105 weekly intervals. We created a two-mode matrix. Columns were the frequencies of time slices' word pairs, appearing in a three-word window. Matrix rows were three-quarters of a million word pairs extracted from the aggregate two-year text file. We converted this two-mode matrix to a one-mode matrix by computing the similarity of each pair of time slices across the rows of word pairs. This resulted in a one-mode network of 105 by 105 time units. Pearson correlations were the similarity coefficients. We conducted social network analysis of the time nodes to find the most central ones. Highly central nodes lie more often on the shortest paths between all pairs of time nodes. They therefore contain in their internal lists of highest frequency word pairs the main themes across the two-years of text. The method is highly automated and efficient. In this case only three central nodes provided the basis for an analyst's interpretations of main propaganda themes.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4782-4; POD:978-1-4673-2358-1","10.1109/EISIC.2012.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298827","Muslim nations;international networks;jihad;semantic networks;social network analysis;time-series analysis;web mining","Correlation;Explosions;Matrix converters;Semantics;Social network services;Text mining;Time frequency analysis","Internet;ethical aspects;information retrieval;semantic networks;social networking (online);text analysis;time series;word processing","BBC International Monitoring;Islamist sources;MN name;Muslim nation;Pearson correlations;broadcasts;jihad;link strengths;matrix rows;newspapers;one-mode matrix;propaganda analysis;search term;semantic network time series analysis;semantic similarity;similarity coefficients;similarity scores;social network analysis;text analysis;three-word window;time nodes;time slices;translated Web page transcriptions;two-mode matrix;two-year text file;word pairs","","2","","","","","22-24 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this need, we conducted an in-depth comparison of user initiated file activity on the mass storage system (MSS) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) during two periods, one in the early 1990s, and another nearly twenty years later. In addition to confirming earlier findings, our analysis turned up three surprising results. First, the read: write ratio went from 2:1 in the earlier trace to 1:2 in the later trace, a reduction of a factor of four in reads relative to writes. Second, only 30% of the current archive was accessed during the three year period of the study, in stark contrast to the 80% seen in the 1992 trace analysis. Third, access latency to the first byte of data actually got slower despite much faster computers and storage devices. These findings indicate that archival behavior has shifted towards a write-heavy workload, and that future archives can be more optimized for write activity than previously believed. Furthermore it may be worth considering the value of data being archived when it is stored, since later retrieval is increasingly less likely.","1526-7539;15267539","Electronic:978-0-7695-4793-0; POD:978-1-4673-2453-3","10.1109/MASCOTS.2012.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6298201","","Bandwidth;Computers;Data models;Hardware;Market research;Meteorology;Organizations","evolutionary computation;information retrieval systems;parallel machines;storage management","MSS;archival usage tracking;data migration;data retrieval;data storage device;evolutionary computation;mass storage system;optimization;read-write ratio;supercomputing tertiary storage;user initiated file activity;write activity","","1","","19","","","7-9 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among them, some questions are very attractive and popular to many users, while some other questions are very tedious and unattractive. In this paper, we aim to identify popular questions in the community QA through modeling question popularity. Three popularity-related features of questions are defined to build the popularity model: (a) potential hits, which reflect how many users are attracted by a question at their first glance; (b) popular terms, from which users find a question attractive; and (c) tedious unpopular terms. The notable characteristic of the proposed framework is extensibility and more features can be incorporated. A large-scale question dataset from a practical community QA website was used to train and test the model. Meanwhile, two well-known classifiers, k-nearest neighbors and support vector machines, were implemented for comparison. Our approach is well validated by the experimental results with much higher prediction accuracy than the baseline methods.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2795-4; POD:978-1-4673-2794-7","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2012.6311134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311134","community question answering;question popularity;social network analysis","Communities;Equations;Logistics;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Radio frequency;Support vector machines","Web sites;pattern classification;question answering (information retrieval);support vector machines","classifier;community QA Website;community question answering;k-nearest neighbor;large-scale question dataset;question popularity modeling;support vector machine","","2","","19","","","22-24 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The collection process, called ""eDiscovery,"" incurs long hours of searching for evidential files. To reduce the eDiscovery cost, it has been recently noticed that metadata-based search technologies play an important role. Although metadata, such as the name of author and the time and date of creation, usually contain useful information, it is unreliable because it can be overwritten by non-authorized personnel. In this paper, the risk of using metadata for eDiscovery is explained, and a metadata-management method for improving file-search efficiency is proposed. To reveal the risk of metadata, an experiment on connecting eDiscovery applications was performed. In the experiment, the files collected by one application were exported to the other application for reviewing them. The experiment shows that proper operations can create incorrect metadata. To correct the metadata, the proposed method extracts information from day-to-day operations and overwrites the metadata using that information. To evaluate the proposed method, metadata of files modified by 3 examinees were retrieved. Evaluation results show that the accuracy of metadata corrected by the proposed method is 100%, while the accuracy of that recorded by a conventional file system is only 60%. This result implies that the proposed method, using extracted information from day-to-day operations, is an important tool for assuring the files are provided as litigation evidence.","2166-0778;21660778","Electronic:978-1-5090-5643-9; POD:978-1-4673-2318-5; USB:978-0-7695-4770-1","10.1109/SRII.2012.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6311065","eDiscovery;enterprise search;metadata management;monitoring agent","File systems;Monitoring;Operating systems;Organizations;Servers;Spreadsheet programs;Trademarks","document handling;electronic data interchange;information retrieval;law administration;meta data","collection process;day-to-day operations;eDiscovery;electronic data evidence;evidential files;extracted information;file-search efficiency;litigation evidence;metadata management method;metadata-based search technology;nonauthorized personnel;paper document evidence","","1","1","27","","","24-27 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, one of the most important successful projects in the area of Semantic Web is known as Linked Open Data (LOD). Till now a variety of data sets has been made available using LOD paradigm. However, extracting useful information from LOD and presenting it to general web users is a leading issue faced by the Semantic Web. Researchers are focusing to design Semantic Web applications that can easily present information to the end users, while abstracting away the under-lying details of the Semantic Web technologies. The designing of such an interface between Semantic Web and its users involves the following issues: 1) discovery of potential resources from LOD, 2) structuring the discovered resources, and 3) presenting the structured information in an easily understandable way. In our previous work, a Concept Aggregation Framework was proposed to address these issues and its implementation was carried out in a system named CAF-SIAL. The system is up and running since 2008. However, the scope of CAF-SIAL is currently limited to only one type of a resource, i.e. person. Users are able to find structured information about persons from CAF-SIAL. However, in the present work, we extend our system to include yet another valuable resource i.e. “organization”. We have selected fourteen different types of organizations like Airlines, Military and Universities etc. Each type of organization has number of properties. Importance of inclusion of the new resource and working of the system has been illustrated in a case study. The proposed extension will soon be incorporated in the running system.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-55-8; POD:978-1-4577-0472-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6316714","","Educational institutions;Organizations;Resource description framework;Semantics;Web pages;XML","data structures;data visualisation;information resources;information retrieval;organisational aspects;publishing;semantic Web","CAF-SIAL;LOD;concept aggregation framework;discovered resource structure;information extarction;linked open data;organization discovery;organization structure;organization visualization;potential resource discovery;semantic Web technologies;structured information presentation","","0","","17","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, little is known about the impact of these changes on the landscape of cellular network traffic. Using anonymized traces from one million cellular subscribers, we conduct a comparative study of the usage characteristics of three different types of mobile devices: feature phones, air cards, and smart phones. Our study covers three aspects: traffic volume in terms of data, voice, and short messages and corresponding temporal fluctuations, applications breakdown in data access, and the presence of malicious traffic. Our study reveals some similarities as well as distinct differences among the three device types. These insights into the modern cellular network traffic could influence how cellular carriers manage and provision their networks.","1095-2055;10952055","Electronic:978-1-4673-1544-9; POD:978-1-4673-1543-2","10.1109/ICCCN.2012.6289231","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289231","","Bandwidth;Electric breakdown;IP networks;Smart phones;Solid modeling","cellular radio;information retrieval;mobile handsets;telecommunication industry;telecommunication traffic","air card;cellular mobile device;cellular network traffic;cellular subscriber;data access;data traffic volume;feature phone;landscape evolution;short message;smart phone;temporal fluctuation","","1","","21","","","July 30 2012-Aug. 2 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Some remarkable property of the uniformly random distributed archive scheme","A. Tallat; K. Shin; H. Lee; H. Yasuda","Department of Future Science, Tokyo Denki University, Tokyo, Japan 101-8457","2011 6th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Convergence Information Technology (ICCIT)","20121004","2011","","","586","591","We investigate security of a certain simple and fast scheme of distributed archive. The scheme, namely Uniformly Random Distributed Archive (URDA), distributes original source data across multiple storages in the Internet with redundancy. The most important feature of URDA is its stochastic process to determine storages to which fragments of the original data are to be delivered. By delivering each data fragment to randomly chosen n - k + 1 storages out of n storages, we can realize the followings: (1) If k storages are accessible, the original data can be completely reconstructed; (2) Even if an attacker compromises k - 1 storages, the entire original data will not be revealed. Moreover, we show that URDA has a remarkable property in terms of secrecy of archived data. The property is that, if an attacker compromises r storages (r <; k) to obtain a part of the original data, the attacker can guess only with very small success probability where in the revealed part a particular data fragment appears. Although further study is necessary to reach full understanding of the security of URDA, this indicates that URDA can provide at least a certain good level of secrecy in addition to its excellent time-efficiency.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-55-8; POD:978-1-4577-0472-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6316685","","Approximation methods;Cryptography;Educational institutions;Equations;Internet;Robustness","Internet;digital storage;information retrieval systems;records management;security of data","Internet;URDA security;archived data;data fragment;distributed archive security;original source data distribution;redundancy;stochastic process;uniformly random distributed archive scheme","","0","","10","","","Nov. 29 2011-Dec. 1 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to likelihood based scores, some keyword dependent features named predictor features such as duration and prosodic features could be defined to improve the performance of CM. In this paper a discriminative and probabilistic computation of CM based upon some useful predictor features and support vector machines (SVM) is presented for Persian conversational telephone speech KWS. Our experimental results show that higher performance will be achieved by appending utilized predictor features. The proposed CM with linear kernel function of SVM is obtained an improvement about 8.6% in Figure-of-Merit (FOM) of KWS system.","2164-7054;21647054","Electronic:978-1-4673-1148-9; POD:978-1-4673-1149-6","10.1109/IranianCEE.2012.6292531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6292531","SVM;confidence measure;keyword spotting;predictor feature;speech recognition","Acoustics;Hidden Markov models;Ions;Kernel;Support vector machines","information retrieval;probability;speech recognition;support vector machines","FOM;KWS systems;Persian conversational telephone speech;SVM;confidence measure improvement;figure-of-merit;kernel function;keyword spotting system;likelihood based scores;normalized acoustic likelihoods;predictor features;speech recognition;support vector machines","","0","2","16","","","15-17 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
