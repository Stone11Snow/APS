These methods power many World Wide Web search engines and accomplish reasonable amounts of search accuracy. Though some content based image retrieval (CBIR) systems use both semantic and primitive attributes to match search criteria, history has proven that it is difficult to extract linguistic information from a 2D image. In this research, activity theory is used as a base to demonstrate how semantic information can be retrieved from objects identified in an image. Using an image segmentation technique by The Berkeley Digital Library Project (Blobworld), and combining it with object-to-community relationships, a high-level understanding of the image can be demonstrated.","1555-5798;15555798","POD:0-7803-9195-0","10.1109/PACRIM.2005.1517354","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517354","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;History;Humans;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Object recognition;Search engines;Web sites","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;image segmentation","abstract content-based image retrieval system;activity theory;image segmentation technique;meta-data;semantic information","","0","","5","","","24-26 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sci., Tokyo Univ., Japan","International Workshop on Ubiquitous Data Management","20051024","2005","","","71","77","This paper proposes a new framework for mapping and retrieving photographs, maps and cyberspaces to each other. Our target photographs are enhanced with spatial metadata such as geographic coordinates where they were taken and directions where they focused on. We assume photographs having such spatial metadata become popular. In a common framework, such photographs are mapped to their viewpoints by using their location information generated by GPS. We think this framework has less function for practical spatial queries. For example, even if a photograph is mapped to a certain point on a map, a scene of the point may not be shown in the photograph. It may show a different direction than user wants to see. A problem is that though locations or objects shown in photographs are important for users, viewpoints are not positions of them but positions of cameras from which photographs were taken. We therefore map each photograph to a vector from its viewpoint to its gazing point, and named the vector as photo vector. A prototype system based on our framework provides functions such as handling advanced spatial queries for retrieving photographs, visualizing how many photographs show each location, and mapping text labels having URLs and geographic coordinates to the appropriate positions on photographs. In this framework, photographs, maps and cyberspaces are mapped to each other.","","POD:0-7695-2411-7","10.1109/UDM.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521239","","Cameras;Data structures;Data visualization;Global Positioning System;Image storage;Information retrieval;Information science;Layout;Prototypes;Uniform resource locators","data visualisation;geographic information systems;image retrieval;meta data;ubiquitous computing;visual databases","GPS;URL;cyberspace;data visualization;geographic coordinates;location information;maps;photo vector;photograph retrieval;spatial metadata;spatial queries;ubiquitous photo mapping;user lines of sight","","1","","4","","","4 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address several issues related to this topic. The first one is overfitting when very large feature spaces are used and relatively small amounts of training data are available. The second is the use of a framework that can recognise events at different time scales, as standard hidden Markov model (HMM) do not model well long-term term temporal dependencies in the data. In this paper we propose a method combining layered HMMs and an unsupervised low level clustering of the features to address these issues. Experiments conducted on the recognition task of different events in 7 rugby games demonstrates the potential of our approach with respect to standard HMM techniques coupled with a feature size reduction technique.

Automatic gender identification is used for video indexing and can improve speech recognition results by using gender-specific classifiers. Gender identification in large datasets is difficult because of the large variability in speaker characteristics. Bootstrapping is an approach that attempts to combine minimal user annotations with automatic techniques for audio classification. In bootstrapping a small random sampling of the training data is annotated by the user and this annotation is used to train a classifier that annotates the remaining data. This technique is useful when the training set is too large to be fully annotated by the user.

This paper presents an approach for vocal melody extraction from dual channel Karaoke music audio. The extracted melody corresponds to the singing voice in the original performance channel, which can then be used for melody-based music retrieval. In the proposed technique, audio signals from both the accompaniment channel and the original performance channel are analyzed. The note partials are firstly extracted from the signal, which is represented in constant-Q transform frequency domain. Then the volume balance between the two channels is estimated based on signal approximation in the sub-bands. Finally, the pitch corresponding to the singing voice is identified based on the note partial differences between the two channels. The extracted melody is represented as a sequence of pitch values. This technique assumes that the two channels have similar accompaniment instrument performance except for the singing voices. Experimental result on 40 Karaoke music audios has shown the performance of the proposed technique. The pitch extraction rate is above 70% and melody retrieval accuracy in an 800-tune-database is 90%.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:0-7803-9331-7","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521620","","DVD;Data mining;Frequency domain analysis;Indexing;Instruments;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Performance analysis;Signal analysis;Signal processing","audio signal processing;electronic music;feature extraction;frequency-domain analysis;information retrieval;music;transforms","audio signal;constant-Q transform;dual channel Karaoke system;frequency domain analysis;melody-based music retrieval;pitch extraction rate;polyphonic music audio;subband signal approximation;vocal melody extraction","","1","","7","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the basic peer-to-peer protocols construct this graph on a random manner and they do not take the content of the stored or searched documents into account. Our solution improves the performance of a peer-to-peer network by constructing semantic profiles based on document metadata followed by a comparison of the semantic similarities on generalized topics, where these topic generalizations are made with an adaptive algorithm that utilize a well-tried full-language taxonomy.

As one of the results, the user might tend to visit those pages in high-quality Web sites with higher probability.

In order to determine whether a phrase is a keyphrase or not, the following features of a phrase in a given document are adopted: its TF (term frequency) and IDF (inverted document frequency), whether or not it appears in the title or headings (subheadings) of the given document, and its distribution in the paragraphs of the given document.

The applicability of these systems depends on efficient decentralized techniques to search and retrieve data. In this paper, we propose an INquiry-based FOrwarding (INFO) strategy to search the small world networks. When a node initiates a search with the INFO strategy, it first sends an inquiry message to all its neighbors. This message requires each neighbor to recommend a candidate node which is the closest node to the destination in its own neighborhood. After receiving the neighbors' replies, the source will pick the closest one to the destination among the candidates and forward the search task to that node. The INFO strategy can decide search directions more globally than the traditional neighborhood-based greedy strategy. Experiments show that this strategy can find a path with shorter length to reach the destination.","","POD:0-7695-2415-X","10.1109/WI.2005.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517817","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Information science;Mathematics;Power grids;Search methods;Social network services;Web sites","information networks;information retrieval","INFO strategy;data retrieval;data searching;inquiry-based forwarding;neighborhood-based greedy strategy;real-world network systems","","1","","8","","","19-22 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an ontology comparison tool based on a novel senses refinement algorithm, which builds a senses set to accurately represent the semantics of the input ontology. The senses refinement algorithm automatically extracts senses from the electronic lexical database WordNet (locally installed or online), removes unnecessary senses based on the relationship among the entity classes of the ontology, and specifies relations and constraints of the concepts in the refined senses set. The senses refinement converts the measurement of ontology difference into simple set operations based on set theory, thus ensures the efficiency and accuracy of the ontology comparison. Our experimental studies show that the proposed senses refinement algorithm outperforms the naive senses set construction algorithm in terms of efficiency and accuracy.","","POD:0-7695-2415-X","10.1109/WI.2005.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517874","","Application software;Buildings;Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Query processing;Semantic Web;Set theory;Strontium","ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;set theory","WordNet;electronic lexical database;information integration;information retrieval;naive senses set construction;ontology comparison tool;semantic Web;senses refinement;set theory","","4","","12","","","19-22 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, spatio-temporal video segments of a fixed length are clustered according to image features of each segment. Then, a user performs feedback to the results of clustering, whether each segment is relevant to the cluster it belongs. The clustering accuracy can be improved through the interaction based on the feedback information.

The barrier to more wide-spread use of ontologies for such applications is the lack of support in the currently available middleware stacks used in enterprise computing.

To optimize the resolution of customer reports about service quality degradations affecting the quality guarantees we propose to apply event correlation techniques.

In this paper, we show how a human may visualize a statistical table as an multidimensional object, defined by a suitably modified OLAP model. In this way, the keywords are classified into semantically distinct groups, i.e., dimension hierarchies, without any ontological knowledge or resorting to machine learning.

Objectives related to the PSR/CX during SMEX03 included: calibration and validation of AMSR-E T<sub>B</sub> observations over different climate/vegetation regions of the U.S. [Alabama (AL), Georgia (GA), Oklahoma (OK)], identification of possible areas of radio-frequency interference (RFI), comparison of X-band observations from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Microwave Imager (TMI), AMSR-E, and PSR/CX, and exploring the potential of soil moisture retrieval algorithms using C- and X-band imagery in diverse landscapes. In the current investigation, more than 100 flightlines of PSR/CX data were extensively processed to produce gridded T<sub>B</sub> products for the four study regions. Due to the lack of significant rainfall in OK, generally dry soil moisture conditions were observed. Observations obtained over AL include a wide range of soil moisture and vegetation conditions. Results from the AL site clearly showed a lack of sensitivity to rainfall/soil moisture under forest canopy cover. Quantitative comparisons made with the TMI validated that both the PSR/CX and AMSR-E X-band channels were well calibrated. Spectral analyses indicated that the PSR/CX observations at C-band also are reasonable. As expected, there were varying degrees of RFI in the AMSR-E C-band data for the study sites that will prevent further soil moisture analysis using these data. X-band comparisons of the PSR/CX high-resolution and AMSR-E and TMI low-resolution data indicated a linear scaling for the range of conditions studied in SMEX03.

So far several methods have been proposed to index XML documents. There are two major categories of XML indexing methods, those coming from the database community, and those coming from the information retrieval (IR) community. They have limited to meet the characters of indexing XML documents. This paper aims at presenting a hybrid method of indexing XML documents. The new method integrates the merit of database community and of IR community on indexing XML documents. It can support exact query, approximate query and range query. It would be useful to engage all three types of common matching that is necessary in Information and data retrieval systems. In addition, the hybrid method is proved to be efficient by an instance.","","POD:0-7695-2401-X","10.1109/DEEC.2005.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517709","","Application software;Computer science;Databases;Educational institutions;Indexing;Information retrieval;Sun;Tree data structures;Vocabulary;XML","XML;document handling;indexing;information retrieval systems","XML document retrieval;hybird method;indexing;information data retrieval system;query","","0","","8","","","9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many SBD methods have been proposed in the literature, and experimental results show that the existing methods work reasonably well for abrupt shot boundaries, but less effectively for gradual shot boundaries. In this paper, we propose an effective post-refinement method for identifying actual shot boundaries from the results obtained by existing SBD methods. The proposed method formulates the SBD problem as sequential detection of changes in the underlying feature distributions whose parameters are estimated from existing video shots. Specifically, the proposed post-refinement method enhances the performance of SBD by identifying as many false positives (false detections) and false negatives (miss detections) as possible. Experiments conducted on a large set of test videos, whose initial shot boundaries are obtained by four existing SBD methods, show that the proposed post-refinement method can improve markedly the detection recall and precision and is rather insensitive to the thresholds used by the existing methods in detecting the initial shot boundaries.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2005.856927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1522267","False positive;false negative;post-refinement;sequential change detection;shot boundary detection (SBD)","Content based retrieval;Event detection;Gunshot detection systems;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Parameter estimation;Testing;Video recording;Video sequences","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;image sequences;sequential estimation;signal detection;video databases;video signal processing","SBD;content-based video analysis;post-refinement method;sequential detection;shot boundary detection;video data segmentation","","17","","32","","","Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

But ontology is a pre-defined structure with crisp concept descriptions and inter-concept relations. However, due to the dynamic nature of the document repository, ontology should be upgradeable with information extracted through text mining of documents in the domain. This also necessitates that concepts, their descriptions and inter-concept relations should be associated with a degree of fuzziness that will indicate the support for the extracted knowledge according to the currently available resources. Supports may be revised with more knowledge coming in future. This approach preserves the basic structured knowledge format for storing domain knowledge, but at the same time allows for update of information. In this paper, we have proposed a mechanism which initiates text mining with a set of ontological concepts, and thereafter extracts fuzzy relations through text mining. Membership values of relations are functions of frequency of co-occurrence of concepts and relations.

In this paper we propose a novel algorithm P Join for supporting efficient ranked join queries in P2P networks, which is a part of our work to introduce database query processing facilities in P2P networks. The existing ranked join query algorithms consume an excessive amount of bandwidth when they are applied directly into the scenario of P2P networks.

The InSAR system of SRTM was designed for high-resolution topographic mapping of the Earth's land surfaces, using two SAR antennas on a Space Shuttle with a cross-track separation of 60 m. An additional along-track antenna separation of 7 m resulted in an effective time lag of about 0.5 ms between the two images, which could theoretically be exploited for target velocity retrievals. However, the feasibility of ocean current measurements with SRTM has been questionable, since the time lag was much shorter than the theoretical optimum (about 3 ms at X-band) and the signal-to-noise ratio over water was quite low. Nevertheless, some X-band InSAR images of coastal areas exhibit clear signatures of tidal flow patterns. As an example, we discuss an image of the Dutch Wadden Sea. We convert the InSAR data into a line-of-sight current field, which is then compared with results of the numerical circulation model KUSTWAD. For tidal phases close to the conditions at the time of the SRTM overpass; we obtain correlation coefficients of up to 0.6 and rms differences on the order of 0.2 m/s. Furthermore we find that SRTM resolves current variations down to spatial scales on the order of 1 km. This is consistent with predictions of a numerical InSAR imaging model. Remaining differences between SRTM- and KUSTWAD-derived currents can be attributed mainly to residual motion errors in the SRTM data as well as to a limited representation of the conditions at the time of the SRTM overpass in the available KUSTWAD results.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2005.856116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1512402","Current measurements;Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM);interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)","Current measurement;Earth;Information retrieval;Numerical models;Oceans;Radar antennas;Space shuttles;Surfaces;Synthetic aperture radar;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry","oceanographic techniques;radar imaging;radiowave interferometry;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;synthetic aperture radar;tides","AD 2000 02;Dutch Wadden Sea;InSAR data;KUSTWAD numerical circulation model;SAR along-track interferometry;SRTM;Shuttle Radar Topography Mission;Space Shuttle;interferometric SAR;line-of-sight current field;measurement feasibility;ocean current measurement;ocean current retrieval;residual motion error;synthetic aperture radar;target velocity retrieval;tidal flow pattern;topographic mapping","","38","","20","","","Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Data is off-loaded from the buoy using ftp, and remote login capability allows the acoustic communication schedule to be modified when instruments are added or removed from the network. The system has been operational for one year, typically transferring more than 500 Kbytes of data per day from two seafloor instruments.","","POD:0-7803-9103-9","10.1109/OCEANSE.2005.1513188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1513188","","Acoustic sensors;Communication system control;Information retrieval;Instruments;Modems;Observatories;Oceans;Remote monitoring;Sea floor;Sensor systems","data acquisition;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;seismometers;underwater acoustic communication;underwater acoustic telemetry","2362 m;500 Kbyte/s;5000 bit/s;Linux-based embedded controller;Nootka fault;Vancouver Island;acoustic communication;acoustic modem;acoustically-linked deep ocean observatory;buoy-based observatory;cold seep site;data retrieval;data telemetry;meteorological sensor;modem base station;ocean bottom seismometer;seafloor instrument;sensor monitoring;water column","","12","","5","","","20-23 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A method for extracting a musical unit to phrase music data in the compressed domain of TwinVQ audio compression","M. Nakanishi; M. Kobayakawa; M. Hoshi; T. Ohmori","Graduate Sch. of Inf. Syst., Univ. of Electro-Commun., Japan","2005 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","20051024","2005","","","4 pp.","","A method for phrasing music data into meaningful musical pieces (e.g., bar and phrase) is an important function to analyze music data. To realize this function, we propose a method for extracting a unit of music data (musical unit) in the compressed domain of TwinVQ audio compression (MPEG-4 audio). Our key idea is to extract a musical unit from a sequence of autocorrelation coefficients computed in the encoding step of TwinVQ audio compression. We call the sequence of the autocorrelation coefficients the ""autocorrelation sequence r"". We use the k-th autocorrelation sequence r<sub>k</sub> (k=1, 2, ..., 20) of music data for extracting a musical unit of music data. First, we calculate the j<sub>k</sub>-th autocorrelation coefficient a<sub>k</sub><sup>j</sup><sub>k</sub> of the k-th autocorrelation sequence r<sub>k</sub> (j<sub>k</sub>=38, 39, ..., 208; k=1, 2, ...,20). Second, for detecting the peak in the sequence (a<sub>k</sub><sup>38</sup>, a<sub>k</sub><sup>39</sup>, ..., a<sub>k</sub><sup>208</sup>), the Laplacian filter is applied to the sequence. We then obtain the order p<sub>k</sub> for which the maximum differential coefficient is attained. Finally, we compute the musical unit using p<sub>k</sub>. To evaluate the performance of extracting the musical unit by our method, we collected 64 music data and obtained autocorrelation sequences by applying the TwinVQ encoder to each data. We then applied our extraction algorithm to each autocorrelation sequence. The experimental results reveal a very good performance in the extraction of a musical unit for phrasing music data.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:0-7803-9331-7","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521491","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521491","","Audio compression;Autocorrelation;Bit rate;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Encoding;Feature extraction;MPEG 4 Standard;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval","Laplace transforms;audio coding;audio databases;correlation theory;data compression;feature extraction;filtering theory;information retrieval;music;sequences","Laplacian filter;TwinVQ audio compression;autocorrelation sequence;music data phrase;musical unit extraction","","3","","9","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This first step is realized by a clusterization which uses a similarity measure based on the co-citation frequency between pages. Given the cluster hierarchy, the second step selects a reduced number of documents to be manually qualified and propagates the given metadata values to the other documents belonging to the same cluster.

Experimental studies were carried out to empirically evaluate the proposed approach with real-world data collected from a Usenet bulletin board over a one year period. The results showed that the proposed approach can not only identify prominent members whose behaviors are community supportive but also filter chatters whose behaviors are superficial to the online community. The findings have broad implications for online communities by allowing moderators to better support their members and by enabling members to better understand the conversation space.","","POD:0-7695-2415-X","10.1109/WI.2005.134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517823","","Communities;Computer networks;Filters;Frequency conversion;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Social network services;Visualization","Internet;information filters;information retrieval;information services;knowledge acquisition;social sciences computing","Usenet bulletin board;information retrieval;key members identification;online community;social computing;social network analysis","","21","2","14","","","19-22 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We specifically address computationally intensive search of complex data, such as content-based retrieval of digital images or sounds, where sophisticated algorithms must be evaluated on the objects of interest. Since these problems require significant computation, we distribute the search over a collection of compute nodes, such as active storage devices, intermediate processors and host computers. A key challenge with mapping the desired computation to the available resources is that the most efficient distribution depends on several factors: relative power and number of compute nodes; network bandwidth between the compute nodes; the cost of evaluating query predicates; and the selectivity of the given query. This wide range of variables renders manual partitioning of the computation infeasible, particularly since some of the parameters (e.g., available network bandwidth) can change during the course of a search. This paper proposes several techniques for dynamic partitioning of computation, and demonstrates that they can significantly improve efficiency for distributed search applications.","1082-8907;10828907","POD:0-7803-9037-7","10.1109/HPDC.2005.1520953","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1520953","","Bandwidth;Computer networks;Content based retrieval;Costs;Digital images;Distributed computing;Explosives;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Load management","content-based retrieval;distributed processing;resource allocation;storage management","active storage devices;compute node;content-based retrieval;data search;digital images;digital sound;distributed search system;dynamic load balancing;dynamic partitioning;host computers;intermediate processors;network bandwidth;query predicate;resource availability;resource utilization","","0","","13","","","24-27 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present an O(n) real-time algorithm for determining key from polyphonic audio. We use the standard Fast Fourier Transform with a local maximum detection scheme to extract pitches and pitch strengths from polyphonic audio. Next, we use Chew's Spiral Array Center of Effect Generator (CEG) algorithm to determine the key from pitch strength information. We test the proposed system using Mozart's Symphonies. The test data is audio generated from MIDI source. The algorithm achieves a maximum correct key recognition rate of 96% within the first fifteen seconds, and exceeds 90% within the first three seconds. Starting from the extracted pitch strength information, we compare the CEG algorithm's performance to the classic Krumhansl-Schmuckler (K-S) probe tone profile method and Temperley's modified version of the K-S method. Correct key recognition rates for the K-S and modified K-S methods remain under 50% in the first three seconds, with maximum values of 80% and 87% respectively within the first fifteen seconds for the same test set. The CEG method consistently scores higher throughout the fifteen-second selections.","1945-7871;19457871","POD:0-7803-9331-7","10.1109/ICME.2005.1521350","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1521350","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Fast Fourier transforms;Indexing;Music information retrieval;Probes;Spirals;Testing;Viterbi algorithm","","","","6","7","21","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we use formal concept analysis (FCA) method for clustering documents according to their formal contexts. Concept hierarchy of documents is built using the formal concepts of the documents in the document corpus. We use tf.idf (term frequency × inverse document frequency) term weighting model to reduce less useful concepts from these formal concepts and the association and correlation mining techniques to analyze the relationship of terms in the document corpus.","","POD:0-7695-2415-X","10.1109/WI.2005.1","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517867","association;conceptual document clustering;correlation;formal concept analysis (FCA);frequent termsets","Clustering algorithms;Frequency;Information retrieval;Itemsets;Organizing;Partitioning algorithms;Publishing;Search engines;Text mining;Web sites","Internet;data mining;text analysis","World Wide Web;concept based document clustering;correlation mining;formal concept analysis;inverse document frequency;term frequency;text mining","","2","","9","","","19-22 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Meaning metaphor for visualizing search results","N. Bonnel; A. Cotarmanac'h; A. Morin","Div.

These results are then displayed as a succession of ordered lists. Facing the limits of this approach, we propose a prototype to explore new organizations and presentations of search results, as well as new types of interactions with the results in order to make their exploration more intuitive and efficient. The main topic of this paper is the processing of the results coming from an information retrieval system. Although the relevance depends on the result quality, the effectiveness of the result processing represents an alternative way to improve the relevance for the user. Given the current expectations, this processing is composed by an organization step and a visualization step. Then the proposed prototype organizes the results according to their meaning using a Kohonen self-organizing map, and also visualizes them in a 3D scene to increase the representation space. The 3D metaphor proposed here is a city.","1550-6037;15506037","POD:0-7695-2397-8","10.1109/IV.2005.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509117","3D metaphors;Adaptive interfaces;Search result visualization;Self-Organizing Maps","Cities and towns;Data visualization;Information retrieval;Layout;Prototypes;Research and development;Search engines;Self organizing feature maps;Telecommunications;Web sites","Internet;data visualisation;information retrieval;information retrieval systems;self-organising feature maps","3D metaphors;Kohonen self-organizing map;World Wide Web;adaptive interfaces;information retrieval system;search result visualization;self-organizing maps","","7","2","15","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Representing UML snowflake diagram from integrating XML data using XML schema","Y. Li; A. An","Dept. of Comput.

Our integration framework takes advantage of the constructs and relationships existing within XML schemas. Two processes are involved in our integration framework. The first one is to convert XML schemas into UML class diagrams. The second is to build a multidimensional model from the UML class diagrams. This paper focuses on the issues in the second process. We describe how to represent a multidimensional model using a UML snowflake diagram and how to represent the UML snow/lake diagram using XML schemas. Our advanced XML schema-based representation of a multidimensional model is used as metadata in our prototype system for processing OLAP queries. It elegantly holds the information within a UML snowflake diagram such as the retrieval path through which we can obtain the participating XML data sources for OLAP operations. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first people to apply the advantages of XML Schemas during integrating XML data sources for virtual OLAP and to propose an XML schema-based method for representing a UML snowflake diagram that integrates heterogeneous XML data sources.","","POD:0-7695-2401-X","10.1109/DEEC.2005.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1517704","","Computer science;Data engineering;Data warehouses;Information retrieval;Internet;Multidimensional systems;Prototypes;Unified modeling language;Warehousing;XML","Internet;Unified Modeling Language;XML;data mining;data warehouses;distributed databases;meta data","OLAP query processing;UML class diagrams;UML conceptual-level integration;UML snowflake diagram;XML schemas;heterogeneous XML data source;metadata;prototype system","","3","","23","","","9 April 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, nine species of hypotrichous ciliates, Paraurostyla weissei, Uroleptus pisci, Eschaneustyla sp., Euplotes aediculatus, Tachysoma pellionellum, Gonostomum sp., Holosticha sp., H. multistylata, and Stylonychia mytilus were isolated and cultured and their ssu-rRNA genes were sequenced using standard molecular techniques. The sequences of ssu-rRNA gene of the other ciliates were retrieved from worldwide databases. Two of the nonciliate species, Labyrinthuloides minuta and Prorocentrum minimum were used as outgroups for the phylogenetic analysis. The reconstructed tree demonstrated that the hypotrichous ciliates formed a monophyletic group within the global ciliate tree, and the members of this group composed of all hypotrichs and one oligotrichous ciliate. This monophyletic group (Hypotrichida) was divided into five main lineages or clades: Phacodinium line, Euplotidium-Diophrys line, Euplotes-Aspidisca line, Oxytricha-Stylonychia-Onychodromu line and Holosticha-Urostyla-Eschaneustyla line. The Hateria (considered as a member of oligotrichs previously) allied more closely with a clade (Oxytricha-Stylonychia-Holosticha-Urostyla) than with other clades.","","POD:0-7803-8943-3","10.1109/KORUS.2005.1507693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1507693","","Bioinformatics;DNA;Databases;Educational institutions;Genomics;Information retrieval;Organisms;Packaging;Phylogeny;RNA","","","","0","","19","","","June 26 2005-July 2 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The automatic generation of site maps is a complex task since the structure of the data, semantical and layout aspects have to be considered. One main problem is a concise presentation of site maps since the data to be displayed is usually extensive. The focus of this article is a new method to offer concise site map presentations to Web users by adaptation of site maps to landmarks and search queries. By landmarks we denote important data objects in a Web site, that are determined by information retrieval (IR) methods and used to simplify the Web site graph such that a layout may be generated efficiently. Adaptation of site maps to user queries provides personalized maps that reflect the part of a Web site that is relevant for a specific user. By these means the fraction of the Web site is visualized efficiently as a site map that is adapted to the specific needs of a user. In contrast to previous approaches, the landmark presentation provides a concise view of a larger Web space, which may be applied to disambiguate search results.","1550-6037;15506037","POD:0-7695-2397-8","10.1109/IV.2005.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1509118","","Books;Data visualization;Guidelines;History;Information retrieval;Navigation;Search engines;Search problems;Service oriented architecture;Web pages","Web sites;data visualisation;information retrieval;search engines","Web site graph;adaptive site map visualization;information retrieval;landmarks;navigation support;search queries","","0","","35","","","6-8 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
