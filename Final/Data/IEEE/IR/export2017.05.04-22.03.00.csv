The front-end provides a user interface which is embedded in a dialogue system. This dialogue system allows queries to be formulated in a user friendly (i.e. exploiting a limited range of natural language) and interactive way. Access to the analyzed data is provided by IRQL. The principal focus of IRQL development is the integration of concepts of information retrieval, database query languages, and query languages for semi-structured data. Therefore, we will be able to exploit the structure of documents, if known, and can additionally use information retrieval techniques regardless of whether the structure is known or not. Our approach develops a query language that is compatible with the recently adopted SQL99 standard and information retrieval clauses (e.g. Boolean retrieval). Our data model extends the object-relational model and additionally supports an abstraction of attributes. That is, we can use attribute-independent queries as well as attribute-dependent ones as in RDBMSs. We evaluate IRQL queries by mapping them to queries supported by existing systems such as object-relational DBMSs, full-text DBMSs, or conventional search engines, and post processing the results supplied by these systems, if necessary","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-0680-1","10.1109/DEXA.2000.875102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=875102","","Abstracts;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Database languages;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Search engines;Spatial databases;Standards development;World Wide Web","data models;document handling;full-text databases;information retrieval;object-oriented databases;query languages;relational databases","Boolean retrieval;GETESS project;IR techniques;IRQL development;IRQL queries;Information Retrieval Query Language;RDBMSs;SQL99 standard;attribute-independent queries;back-ends;conventional search engines;data access;data model;database query languages;dialogue system;full-text DBMSs;information retrieval;information retrieval clauses;information retrieval techniques;object-relational DBMSs;object-relational model;post processing;semi-structured data;structured data;user interface","","1","1","21","","","2000","04 Sep 2000-08 Sep 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper introduces an approach devoted to facilitating information access and retrieval using the World Wide Web's syntactic structures and semantic organization. We consider the HTML language syntax structure and the organization of information in a general Web document, and we define some rules that people use for structuring Web information. These rules can be used for managing and retrieving Web information and its semantics. A Web document is treated as a complex informative object formed by images, tables, animations, videos and text organized into chapters, paragraphs, titles, and so on, connected according to semantic links.

Capturing and re-establishing the agent's state is the most important problem in strong migration of mobile agents. We describe a way to save and restore the state of a running Java-based agent. We achieve this at the language level, without modifying the Java Virtual Machine, by instructing the Java source programs with a preprocessor which is used in a mobile agent scenario to offer strong migration for mobile agents based on Java.

DASFAA 2001","20020807","2001","","","182","189","Feature-based similarity retrieval has become an important research issue in multimedia database systems. The features of multimedia data are useful for discriminating between multimedia objects (e.g., documents, images, video, music score, etc.). For example, images are represented by their color histograms, texture vectors, and shape descriptors. A feature vector is a vector that represents a set of features, and are usually high-dimensional data. The performance of conventional multidimensional data structures (e.g., R-tree family K-D-B tree, grid file, TV-tree) tends to deteriorate as the number of dimensions of feature vectors increases. The R*-tree is the most successful variant of the R-tree. We propose a SOM-based R*-tree as a new indexing method for high-dimensional feature vectors. The SOM-based R*-tree combines SOM and R*-tree to achieve search performance more scalable to high dimensionalities. Self-organizing maps (SOMs) provide mapping from high-dimensional feature vectors onto a two-dimensional space. The mapping preserves the topology of the feature vectors. The map is called a topological feature map, and preserves the mutual relationships (similarity) in the feature spaces of input data, clustering mutually similar feature vectors in neighboring nodes. We experimentally compare the retrieval time cost of a SOM-based R*-tree with that of an SOM and an R*-tree using color feature vectors extracted from 40,000 images.","","POD:0-7695-0996-7","10.1109/DASFAA.2001.916377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=916377","","Histograms;Image retrieval;Indexing;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Music information retrieval;Self organizing feature maps;Shape;Topology;Tree data structures","database indexing;multimedia databases;query processing;self-organising feature maps;tree data structures","SOM-based R*-tree;color histograms;experiment;feature extraction;feature vector;feature-based similarity retrieval;indexing;multidimensional data structures;multimedia database;retrieval time;search performance;self-organizing maps;shape descriptors;texture vectors;topological feature map","","0","","52","","","21-21 April 2001","18 Apr 2001-21 Apr 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance indices can then be normalized with respect to the textbox DD level and are therefore independent of the ground truth difficulty. We also assign a detection importance (DI) level to each ground truth textbox. The overall detection rate is the DI-weighted average of the detection qualities of all ground truth textboxes, which makes the detection rate more accurate to reveal the real performance.

The characteristics of these temporal databases are outlined. (1) Each record is inhomogeneous with respect to time-series, including short-term effects and long-term effects. (2) Each record has more than 1000 attributes when a patient is followed for more than one year. (3) When a patient is admitted for a long time, a large amount of data is stored in a very short term. Even medical experts cannot deal with these large databases, and the interest in mining some useful information from the data are growing. The article introduces a combination of extended moving average method and rule induction method, called CEARI to discover new knowledge in temporal databases. An extended moving average method is used for preprocessing, to deal with the irregularity of temporal data. Using several parameters for time-scaling, given by users, this moving average method generates a new database for each time scale with summarized attributes. Then, the rule induction method is applied to each new database with summarized attributes.

International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing","20020807","2002","","","218","222","While the persistent data of many advanced database applications, such as OLAP and scientific studies, are characterized by very high dimensionality, typical queries posed on these data appeal to a small number of relevant dimensions. Unfortunately, the multidimensional access methods designed for high-dimensional data perform rather poorly for these partially specified queries. A potentially very appealing idea, frequently suggested in the literature, is to adopt a node-splitting policy that takes into account the ""importance"" of individual dimensions, which could be determined either a priori or through a statistical sampling of actual queries. This paper presents the results of some carefully controlled experiments conducted to observe the effects of query-based splitting on the performance of KDB-trees. The strategy is compared to a splitting policy that selects the split dimensions in a ""cyclic"" fashion, which has been shown to be very effective, especially in high-dimensional situations. Based on the results, the query-based splitting does not appear to be a very appealing splitting strategy for KDB-trees.","","POD:0-7695-1506-1","10.1109/ITCC.2002.1000390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000390","","Application software;Computer science;Databases;Design methodology;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Physics;Sampling methods;Tree data structures;US Department of Energy","query processing;software performance evaluation;tree data structures;very large databases","KDB-trees;OLAP;advanced database applications;experiments;high-dimensional data;multidimensional access methods;node-splitting policy;persistent data;query-based splitting;splitting strategy;statistical sampling","","0","","9","","","8-10 April 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This means that, as a by-product of the clustering process, each document cluster will be characterized by a possibly different set of keywords. The cluster dependent keyword weights help in partitioning the document collection into more meaningful categories. They can also be used to automatically generate a brief summary of each cluster in terms of not only the attribute values, but also their relevance.

For texture-based features an important form of invariance is rotational invariance. Novel rotationally invariant texture-based features are introduced that are extracted from a polar Fourier transform (PFT). The PFT is similar to the discrete Fourier transform in two dimensions but uses transform parameters radius and angle rather than the Cartesian co-ordinates. The PFT is discretised appropriately across the angular and radial frequency space with the transform magnitudes forming the rotationally invariant features. These features although rotationally invariant, capture the angular distribution together with the radial distribution of frequency within texture.

Data Compression Conference","20020807","2002","","","476","","Summary form only given. We recently proposed elastic storage, a new solution for storing a variable number of images in a fixed storage space. Initially, when only a few images are stored, they are stored losslessly (or near-losslessly). When more images have to be added, the storage space occupied by the previously stored images is adjusted to fit in each new image. A variable amount of space is allocated to each image, depending on its complexity. The implementation is based on bit-rate scalable image compression methods (such as JPEG 2000), which enable the data for each new image to simply overwrite part of the data of previously stored images. Thus, the method operates without any decoding and re-encoding of image data on the storage medium. The new strategy is implemented by a simple modification of the compressed image data block significance values used for the elastic storage method. Therefore, all basic operations (store, retrieve, delete) remain the same and the low complexity of the original strategy implementation is retained.","1068-0314;10680314","POD:0-7695-1477-4","10.1109/DCC.2002.1000019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1000019","","Decoding;Digital cameras;Image coding;Image quality;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Laboratories;PSNR;Transform coding","data compression;image coding;storage management;variable rate codes","JPEG 2000;bit-rate scalable image compression;data overwriting;digital still images;elastic storage;image coding;significance values","","0","","1","","","2-4 April 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The server-to-disk approach, usually implemented with SCSI buses, is being replaced by storage area networks (SAN), which enable storage to be externalized from servers, thus allowing storage devices to be shared among multiple servers. A SAN is a separate network for storage, isolated from the messaging network and optimized for the movement of data between servers and storage devices. Nowadays, most current SAN use Fibre Channel as the technology to move data between servers and storage devices. In order to design and evaluate the performance of these systems it is necessary to have adequate tools. Usually, performance evaluation may be based on analytical modeling or simulation. Each of them differs in their scope and applicability or simulation modeling technique offers more freedom, flexibility, and accuracy than analytical methods. Thus, when evaluating the performance of SAN, simulation modeling should be used. We present the main capabilities of a simulator for Fibre Channel SAN, focusing on its input parameters and output variables.

The watermark is multi-level with few bits embedded robustly at low levels and longer watermark sequences embedded less robustly at higher levels. This allows detection of ""tampered"" and ""attacked"" images by detection of existence of the watermark at low levels and deterioration of the watermark at high levels.

The in-between cases are also covered. Specific and general problems, like the incidence of users disconnecting dynamically is also discussed. The aim of this scheme is to encourage the users to disperse the resource demand instead of having a large number of direct connections to the source of the data, which would result in a higher than necessary bandwidth use from the source. This would benefit the overall performance of the network. The implementation of this task must balance between the necessity to offer a competitive service and the risk of not recovering such service cost for the network operator.

In practice, however, texture similarity computed using computational texture features is not necessarily consistent with human's perception.

The underlying mechanism includes a fuzzy neural learning system for active learning that can be used in clustering operations. Due to the tremendous popularity and growth of heterogeneous information on the Internet, it may be difficult to index and categorize documents efficiently to speed up searching and browsing; this problem is made even more complex due to the broad spectrum of Internet users. Further, the internal representation of information retrieval systems may not always match the user's intent (sometimes called the user concept), thus requiring several cycles of query, possibly with user feedback, to match the user's desires with the retrieval results. Several approaches have been suggested to close the gap between the user's intent and the actual retrieved documents taken from a dynamically increasing information database. These methods include intelligent browsing agents, meta-search engines that are interface agents to multiple search engines and Internet resources, and user concept matching for the Lotus Notes database. In this work, a novel intelligent query and browsing information framework is developed to aid searching, learning and discovering the user concept from multiple existing information retrieval systems.

Embedded data in each frame is recovered from the quantized frames of the received stego signal without synchronization or reference to the original cover signal. Using utterances from Texas Instruments Massachusetts Institute of Technology (TIMIT) databases, it was found that error-free data recovery resulted in voiced and unvoiced frames, while high bit-errors occurred in frames containing voiced/unvoiced boundaries. Modifying the phase, in accordance with data, led to higher successful retrieval than modifying the spectral density of the cover audio.

In this way, any complicated DTD structure can be treated uniformly. That is, using the concepts of classification/generalization and aggregation of the object-oriented model, any complex nested and recursive structure in a DTD as well as multiple appearance of element types can be represented.

It is used to record when facts exist in a database. Accounting for transaction time is essential to supporting audit queries that delve into past database states and differential queries that pinpoint differences between two states. In a web context, transaction time is a problematic concept because there are no transactions. Browsers and other consumers of web data can observe snapshots of resources like XML documents but are rarely active participants in their creation or destruction. This paper presents the TTXPath data model and query language. TTXPath extends XPath with support for transaction time. XPath is a specification language for locations in an XML document. It serves as the basis for XML query languages like XSLT and XQuery, XPath has no temporal semantics. To construct a TTXPath data model, snapshots of an XML document are obtained over time by an observer The snapshots are then merged and transaction times are associated with each edge and node. The TTXPath query language extends XPath with a transaction-time axis to enable a query to access past or future states, and with constructs to extract and compare times. TTXPath maximally reuses XPath hence the changes needed to support transaction time are minimal and TTXPath is fully backwards compatible with XPath.","","POD:0-7695-1393-X","10.1109/WISE.2001.996480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=996480","","Computer science;Data mining;Data models;Database languages;HTML;Information resources;Information retrieval;Markup languages;Transaction databases;XML","data models;hypermedia markup languages;query languages;query processing;specification languages","<sub>TT</sub>XPath data model;XML document;XQuery;XSLT;audit queries;database;database transactions;differential queries;query language;snapshots;specification language;transaction-time axis;transaction-time semantics;web context","","1","","34","","","3-6 Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, each stored data page is composed of an equal number of binary pixels in either a low-contrast (“off”) state or a high-contrast (“on”) state. By increasing the number of “off” pixels and decreasing the number of “on” pixels per page, there is an associated gain in VHM system storage capacity. When grayscale pixels are used, a further gain is possible by similarly controlling the fraction of pixels at each gray level. This paper introduces a constant-weight, nonbinary, shortened enumerative permutation modulation block code to produce pages that exploit the proposed capacity advantage. In addition to the code description, we present an encoder and a low-complexity maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder for the shortened permutation code. A proof verifies our claim of ML decoding. Applying this class of code to VHMs predicts a 49% increase in storage capacity when recording modulation coded 3-bit (eight gray level) pixels compared with a VHM using a binary signaling alphabet and equal-probable (unbiased) data","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/49.920186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=920186","","Block codes;Gray-scale;Holographic optical components;Holography;Information retrieval;Maximum likelihood decoding;Memory;Modulation coding;Optical modulation;Optical recording","block codes;computational complexity;holographic storage;maximum likelihood decoding;modulation coding","ML decoding;binary pixels;binary signaling alphabet;constant-weight block code;constant-weight code;equal-probable data;grayscale pixels;holographic storage;low-complexity maximum-likelihood decoding;modulation block code;nonbinary code;page-oriented optical storage systems;shortened enumerative permutation codes;storage capacity;volume holographic memories","","4","1","25","","","Apr 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Atmospheric retrievals consist of scientific algorithms used to ascertain the actual state of the atmosphere in terms of its temperature and chemical constituents. Atmospheric retrieval algorithms are computationally expensive and convergence of the retrieval is sensitive to input, therefore it is important to provide the best input that will result in the best atmospheric profile. TES has complex requirements in terms of the variety of input data and observations. So it requires a sophisticated system such as Strategy Builder to automate the selection of the optimum strategy for performing the retrieval algorithm on its various types of observation. Strategy Builder also increases the lifetime of the retrieval software by improving its flexibility in implementing various research approaches. Strategy Builder software uses strategy selection logic based on specific strategy selection rules for retrieval of various target scenes. This paper also addresses the issues involved in retrieving the atmosphere of one target scene in a sequence of retrievals. With the robustness that Strategy Builder provides the retrieval software can be used for a longer time, for more research and the produced output is more reliable.

We used a feedforward neural network trained by backpropagation algorithm and an evolving fuzzy neural network to classify the textures. The soft computing models were trained using 80% of the texture data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. A performance comparison was made among the soft computing models for the texture classification problem. We also analyzed the effects of prolonged training of neural networks.

All the records are stored in a directory-tree, with different types of records in different directories. To perform information filtering, self-adaptive information agents are established to extract the user's profile from his bookmark records that represent his interests. This makes it possible for a personal and active information service. The agents are trained through interaction with the user so as to represent his interests more exactly. Open Bookmark service is also an open framework, in which information agents communicate with each other and exchange useful information. Thus the quality of information service can be greatly improved.

These issues, which have to be considered in application of distance enhancing codes, are discussed here. We define several distance enhancing constraints which support design of high rate codes. We also define weak constraints for which the minimum distance between sequences may be the same as for the uncoded system but the number of pairs of sequences at tile minimum distance is smaller.

In addition, a method for optimizing LSP, based on genetic algorithm, is proposed, and incorporated in the relevance feedback process, allowing the user to automatically specify LSP-based queries. LSP is evaluated on four test databases totalling over 2,000 images. Compared with six conventional methods, and SIMPLIcity, an advanced image retrieval system, LSP brings between 15% and 24% increase in the average retrieval precision.

Assuming that a multi-bank memory architecture is used for data storage, the method trades off bank conflicts against memory accesses during real-time memory (de)allocation. It has been applied to the data queueing module of the PRO<sup>3</sup> system.

Users in medicine need queries that use both content-based and meta-data representations of images or salient objects. In this paper, we first present a global image data model that supports both meta-data and low-level descriptions of images and their salient objects. This allows us to make multi-criteria image retrieval (context-, semantic- and content-based queries).

The approach is a modified version of the recent work by J. Miao (1998), which utilized the radiometric measurements at 150, 183.3±3, and 183.3±7 GHz of the SSM/T-2 sensor to retrieve PW over the antarctic region. However, Miao has implicitly assumed a surface emissivity that is frequency independent over the 150-183 GHz range. This assumption turns out not to be a good one based on the airborne measurements described below and the errors introduced in the PW estimation were substantial in many cases. It is shown below that four-frequency radiometric measurements in the frequency range of 150-220 GHz provided a robust retrieval of PW, while allowing for a surface emissivity that varied linearly with frequency. The retrieved PW compared favorably with that calculated from rawinsonde data at two widely separated locations. The differences between the retrieved and calculated values are not more than ±0.02 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is smaller than errors associated with measurement uncertainty. It is found necessary to account for the double side-band nature of the 183.3 GHz measurements in the radiative transfer calculations for development of the retrieval algorithm. The PW values estimated from the algorithm developed from single side band, 183.3 GHz radiative transfer calculations could be in error by as much as ±0.10 g/cm<sup>2 </sup>.

The parameterizations of the melting layer include the effects of snow density, particle size distributions of hydrometeors as well as different permittivity models for mixed-phase particles. The hydrometeor profiles are obtained from a two-dimensional cloud ensemble model simulating a convective-stratiform rainfall event over the East Mediterranean sea. The statistical analysis reveals that the Maxwell-Garnett mixing formulas with water matrix and ice inclusions may be chosen for graupel, while a new permittivity model from Meneghini and Liao is suitable for snowflakes. A new Bayesian inversion framework is set up for both airborne microwave radiometric, radar, and combined radar-radiometer retrievals of hydrometeor profiles. Using the cloud profiles as control training data set, a numerical analysis was carried out by testing the inversion algorithms on each melting model data set. Results are discussed in terms of estimate sensitivity, defined as the statistical deviation bounds of the retrieved profiles from the control case ones. Relatively high values of estimate sensitivity to the melting-layer parameterizations are found for all hydrometeor species, especially for low snow-density and Maxwell-Garnett dielectric model test cases. The need of including various melting-layer characterizations within a comprehensive training data set and its implications for model-based Bayesian retrieval algorithms is finally argued and numerically tested","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.898667","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=898667","","Bayesian methods;Clouds;Discrete event simulation;Information retrieval;Permittivity;Sensitivity analysis;Snow;Statistical analysis;Testing;Training data","airborne radar;atmospheric precipitation;atmospheric techniques;meteorological radar;radiometry;rain;remote sensing by radar","Bayesian inversion;Maxwell-Garnett mixing formula;airborne microwave retrieval;airborne radar;atmosphere;graupel;hydrometeor;inversion algorithm;measurement technique;melting layer parameterization;meteorological radar;microwave radiometry;mixed-phase particle;particle size distribution;permittivity model;profile;radar remote sensing;rain;rainfall;remote sensing;sensitivity analysis;snow density;stratiform precipitation;two-dimensional cloud ensemble model","","11","","39","","","Jan 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Likewise, object-to-object interactions are decomposed into a hierarchy of low-level elementary reaction units (ERU) and high-level interaction units (IU). We then propose an algorithm for temporal segmentation of video objects into EMUs, whose dominant motion can be described by a single representative parametric model. The algorithm also computes a representative (dominant) affine model for each EMU. We also provide algorithms for identification of ERUs and for classification of the type of ERUs. Experimental results demonstrate that segmenting the life-span of video objects into EMUS and ERUs facilitates the generation of high-level visual summaries for fast browsing and navigation. At present, the formation of high-level action and interaction units is done interactively.

Apart from server capacity, another important issue in the deployment of CM servers is reliability. This study investigates rebuild algorithms for automatically rebuilding data stored in a failed disk into a spare disk. Specifically, a block-based rebuild algorithm is studied with the rebuild time and buffer requirement modeled. A buffer-sharing scheme is then proposed to eliminate the additional buffers needed by the rebuild process. To further improve rebuild performance, a track-based rebuild algorithm that rebuilds lost data in tracks is proposed and analyzed. Results show that track-based rebuild, while it substantially outperforms block-based rebuild, requires significantly more buffers (17-135 percent more) even with buffer sharing. To tackle this problem, a novel pipelined rebuild algorithm is proposed to take advantage of the sequential property of track retrievals to pipeline the reading and writing processes. This pipelined rebuild algorithm achieves the same rebuild performance as track-based rebuild, but reduces the extra buffer requirement to insignificant levels (0.7-1.9 percent). Numerical results computed using models of five commercial disk drives demonstrate that automatic rebuild of a failed disk can be done in a reasonable amount of time, even at relatively high server utilization (e.g., less than 1.5 hours at 90 percent utilization)","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2002.1003860","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1003860","","Algorithm design and analysis;Degradation;Disk drives;Fault tolerance;Information retrieval;Lifting equipment;Performance analysis;Pipelines;Streaming media;Writing","buffer storage;fault tolerant computing;multimedia computing;multimedia servers;pipeline processing","automatic disk failure recovery;block-based rebuild algorithm;buffer requirement;buffer-sharing scheme;continuous media servers;disk drives;pipelined rebuild algorithm;reading processes;rebuild time;reliability;spare disk;track retrievals;track-based rebuild algorithm;writing processes","","24","","21","","","May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

QDOM is based on the DOM standard. It allows the client applications to navigate into the view using standard DOM navigation commands. Then the application can use any visited node as the root for a query that creates a new view. The query/navigation processing algorithms of MIX perform decontextualization, i.e., they translate a query that has been issued from within the context of other queries and navigations into efficient queries that are understood by the source outside of the context of previous operations. In addition, MIX provides a navigation-driven query evaluation model, where source data are retrieved only as needed by the subsequent navigations.

A backscatter model is validated with X-band radar measurements of a single tree exposed to rain. A good agreement between simulation and measurements is observed and this demonstrates the ability of radar to measure the amount of intercepted rain. The backscatter model is next applied to simulate different satellite radar configurations. To account for forest variability, the backscatter difference between a wet and dry forest canopy is calculated for four deciduous tree species, above a wet and a dry soil. On average, the simulated backscatter of a wet forest canopy is 1 dB higher than the backscatter of a dry forest canopy at co-polarized L-band and 2 dB at co-polarized C and X-band. The simulated sensitivity is in agreement with observations. It is argued that current satellites can retrieve the amount of intercepted rain at best with a reliability of 50%, due to the variability in soil moisture, species composition and system noise. The authors expect that the reliability will improve with the launch of the next generation radar satellites. The results of this analysis may also be used to assess the influence of rain, fog or dew upon other radar applications for temperate deciduous forests","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.992793","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=992793","","Backscatter;Information retrieval;L-band;Monitoring;Radar measurements;Rain;Satellites;Soil measurements;Spaceborne radar;Water storage","atmospheric techniques;forestry;hydrological techniques;rain;remote sensing by radar;spaceborne radar;vegetation mapping","0.3 to 11 GHz;C-band;L-band;X-band;atmosphere;backscatter model;boundary layer;canopy;deciduous tree;forest;hydrology;intercepted rain;land surface;measurement technique;meteorology;radar backscatter;radar remote sensing;rain water storage;rainwater;retrieval;spaceborne radar;temperate deciduous forest;vegetation","","1","","53","","","Feb 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The concept behind the method is to keep an R-tree for each timestamp in history, but to allow consecutive trees to share branches when the underlying objects do not change. New branches are only created to accommodate updates from the previous timestamp. Although existing implementations of HR-trees process timestamp (window) queries very efficiently, they are hardly applicable in practice due to excessive space requirements and poor interval query performance. This paper addresses these problems by proposing the HR+-tree, which occupies a small fraction of the space required for the corresponding HR-tree (for typical conditions about 20%), while improving interval query performance several times.

That way we cope with the typical sequential searches in cookbooks, very inefficient in a real context. Secondly, the development of an interactive adaptation mechanism that guides the user in obtaining new usage experiences. Thus, we face the fact that it results unrealistically in trying to represent every use of the framework. Thirdly, the existence of a learning mechanism that lets the user enrich the case base with new experiences, reducing the initial effort of the usage experience acquisition.

The method extends an efficient frequent pattern mining method, FP-growth, constructs a class distribution-associated FP-tree, and mines large databases efficiently. Moreover, it applies a CR-tree structure to store and retrieve mined association rules efficiently, and prunes rules effectively based on confidence, correlation and database coverage. The classification is performed based on a weighted χ<sup>2</sup> analysis using multiple strong association rules. Our extensive experiments on 26 databases from the UCI machine learning database repository show that CMAR is consistent, highly effective at classification of various kinds of databases and has better average classification accuracy in comparison with CBA and C4.5.

This phenomenon is called “interference”. To suppress the interference, we have proposed an incremental learning system (called RAN-LTM), in which long-term memory (LTM) is introduced into a resource allocating network (RAN). Since RAN-LTM needs to train not only new data but also some LTM data to suppress the interference, if many LTM data are retrieved large computations are required. Therefore, it is important to design appropriate procedures for producing and retrieving LTM data in RAN-LTM. In the paper, these procedures in the previous version of RAN-LTM are improved. In simulations, the improved RAN-LTM is applied to the approximation of a one-dimensional function, and the approximation error and the training speed are evaluated as compared with RAN and the previous RAN-LTM","1098-7576;10987576","POD:0-7803-7044-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2001.938469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938469","","Buffer storage;Computer networks;Feedforward neural networks;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Interference suppression;Learning systems;Neural networks;Radio access networks;Training data","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","RAN-LTM;approximation error;computations reduction;feedforward neural network;incremental learning;input-output relationships;long-term memory;resource allocating network;training speed","","9","","7","","","2001","15 Jul 2001-19 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BSP tree, hence the structure, of the image is explicitly coded. A method is developed to compute the similarities of images based on their BSP tree representations. In image database applications, the images in the database are coded by BSP tree to achieve a good balance between storage efficiency and easy manipulation of image data.

An extension to SQL enables the construction of an interpreter that intercepts the extended commands and translates them into standard SQL, allowing one to take advantage of any relational database server.

One of the reasons for this is that extracting semantics from the visual features and spatial structures of video streams is extremely difficult. To remedy this drawback, we propose a new video retrieval model based on fuzzy triples. In this model, the fuzzy triples are used for indexing video shots and formulating queries. Moreover, they are also used to express a set of active rules where the spatio-temporal semantics of the video streams is encoded. The fuzzy triples and the rules define generic spatio-temporal patterns in video streams by specifying the relative spatial relationships between salient objects and their changes with respect to time. Capturing such semantics entails concept-based video retrieval. For this, the fuzzy triples employ a fuzzy thesaurus and inexact matching. The inexact matching is needed when determining a direction from an angle formed counter-clockwise between two salient objects in a video shot. The novelty of the proposed model is that it can provide a concept-based video retrieval functionality which is conceptually simple and hence easy to construct","","POD:0-7803-7101-1","10.1109/TENCON.2001.949628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=949628","","Cameras;Content based retrieval;Databases;Fuzzy systems;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Streaming media;Thesauri;Videoconference","database indexing;fuzzy logic;image matching;image retrieval;query formulation;thesauri;video databases","active rules;angular direction determination;concept-based video retrieval model;fuzzy thesaurus;generic spatio-temporal patterns;inexact matching;query formulation;relative spatial relationships;semantically related video shots;spatial structures;spatio-temporal fuzzy triples;spatio-temporal semantics;video databases;video shot indexing;video streams;visual features","","1","","11","","","2001","19 Aug 2001-22 Aug 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since a high and rapidly increasing number of users retrieve multimedia data with high data rates, the data servers can represent a severe bottleneck. Traditional time and resource consuming operations, like memory copy operations, limit the number of concurrent streams that can be transmitted from the server, because of two reasons: (1) memory space is wasted holding identical data copies in different address spaces; and (2) a lot of CPU resources are used on copy operations. To avoid this bottleneck and make memory and CPU resources available for other tasks, i.e. more concurrent clients, we have implemented a zero-copy data path through the communication protocols to support high-speed network communication, based on UVM.

XAS automatically maps the underlying data into virtual XML components when mappings between DTDs and underlying schemas are established. The components can be presented as XML documents or assembled into larger components. XAS manages the relationship between XML components and the mapping in the form of document composition logic.

An image is represented by a set of regions, roughly corresponding to objects, which are characterized by color, texture, shape, and location. The system classifies images into semantic categories. Potentially, the categorization enhances retrieval by permitting semantically-adaptive searching methods and narrowing down the searching range in a database. A measure for the overall similarity between images is developed using a region-matching scheme that integrates properties of all the regions in the images. The application of SIMPLIcity to several databases has demonstrated that our system performs significantly better and faster than existing ones.

Reconstruction of the entire shape, including undercuts and tooth crowding area, was attempted by applying a perceptual grouping algorithm, which is one of pattern-recognition theories. In the data measured from occlusal, right and left sides, the rows of measurements were parallel to the frontal plane, and three-directionally combined data (3-DC data) was accomplished by affine transformation. While, in the labial side, transformation to the frontal plane was done since rows of the measured data were parallel to the sagittal plane. To combine the labial data with the 3-DC data and reconstruct the complete image, rearrangement of the order of the data in the file was attempted by applying the perceptual grouping. That is, the minimum total length of data combining was examined by considering the factor of proximity and continuity between the data. The most appropriate order of data combining and recognition of islands were accomplished. Using a computer graphic (CG) with a wire-frame model, complicated regions such as anterior segments showing tooth crowding and undercut area were found to be successfully reconstructed without any data defects. The accuracy of reconstruction was ascertained by comparing the characteristic distances between apexes of molars in the reconstructed model with the real cast. The difference was within 0.3 mm, and present method for dental cast reconstruction is considered to be satisfactory for the present purpose such as orthodontics.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/42.959306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=959306","","Biomedical optical imaging;Dentistry;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Laser theory;Morphology;Prosthetics;Shape measurement;Teeth;Three dimensional displays","dentistry;image recognition;image reconstruction;laser applications in medicine;medical image processing;shape measurement","3-D measurement;affine transformation;complete 3-D reconstruction;computer graphic;data defects;dental cast shape;dental stone model;frontal plane;labial side;line laser scanner;perceptual grouping;reconstruction accuracy;sagittal plane;tooth crowding area;wire-frame model","Dental Casting Technique;Dental Models;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Lasers;Pattern Recognition, Automated","29","","22","","","Oct. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The fundamental problem of recalling pattern sequences by neural networks is first reviewed. Since it is difficult to implement a desired flow vector field distribution by using conventional matrix encoding scheme, a time-varying Hopfield model (TVHM) is proposed. The weight matrix of the TVHM is constructed in such a way that its auto-correlation and cross-correlation parts are encoded from two different sets of patterns. With this mechanism, flow vectors between any two adjacent stored patterns are of the same directions. Moreover, the flow vector field distribution around a stored pattern can be modulated by the time variable. Then, theoretical results regarding the radii of attraction and the recalling dynamics of the TVHM are presented. The proposed approach is different from the existing methods because neither synchronous dynamics nor interpolated training patterns are required. A way of increasing the storage capacity of the TVHM is proposed. Finally, experimental results are presented to illustrate the validity, capacity, recall capability, and the applications of the proposed model","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/72.991419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=991419","","Associative memory;Autocorrelation;Encoding;Equations;Error correction;Hopfield neural networks;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Pattern recognition;Time varying systems","Hopfield neural nets;correlation methods;encoding;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern recognition;time-varying systems","Hopfield neural networks;autocorrelation;cross-correlation;encoding;flow vector field distribution;recalling;temporal sequence recognition;time-varying systems;training patterns","","11","","36","","","Mar 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
