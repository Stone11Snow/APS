To enable a group of multiple disciplinary computer software systems to effectively and efficiently collaborate is an important task for applications such as cooperative designs, energy efficiency monitoring system, real-time collaborative mechatronic control systems, e-learning, and enterprise computing etc. With the cost reduction of the hardware for storing data and the need of maintaining the vast amount of data generated from simulation tools, social media and sensors for decision making, to retrieve the right information and to share appropriate knowledge at right time among the participants is a challenging task. On-line Analytical Processing, OLAP, is an effective tool to summarize vast structured data into concise data cubes with multiple dimensions for business intelligence and decision making. Semantic OLAP was developed in the research communities is to process the linked data which is a form of web data representation with semantics increasingly gaining its popularity over the Internet. The introduction of OLAP has increased the efficiency of data retrieval and data management, but it does not address the issues of information and knowledge sharing. In this talk, these issues will be reviewed with examples and a new OLAP framework which could bridge the gaps and increase the sharing among different OLAPs will be presented with a case study. This talk will also share delegates with recent research findings from some ongoing EU-funded projects.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6085-2; POD:978-1-4673-6084-5","10.1109/CSCWD.2013.6580930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6580930","","Chaos;Collaborative work;Computers;Conferences;Decision making;Educational institutions;Semantics","data mining;decision making;information retrieval;semantic Web;social networking (online)","EU-funded projects;Internet;Web data representation;business intelligence;data cubes;data management;data retrieval;decision making;hardware cost reduction;information retrieval;information sharing;knowledge sharing;multiple disciplinary computer software systems;on-line analytical processing;semantic OLAP framework;simulation tools;social media;summarised semantic data sharing","","0","","","","","27-29 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, we optimize the hash value calculation of name strings, as well as the data structure to store multiple Bloom filters, which significantly reduces the memory access times compared with that of non-optimized Bloom filters. We conduct extensive experiments on a commodity server to test NameFilter's throughput, memory occupation, name update as well as scalability. Evaluation results on a name prefix table with 10M entries show that our proposed scheme achieves lookup throughput of 37 million searches per second at low memory cost of only 234.27 MB, which means 12 times speedup and 77% memory savings compared to the traditional character trie structure.

System of Systems (SoS) integrate independently operating, non-homogeneous systems to achieve a higher goal than the sum of the parts. Today's SoS are also contributing to the existence of unmanageable “Big Data”. Recent efforts have developed a promising approach, called “Data Analytics”, which uses statistical and computational intelligence (CI) tools such as principal component analysis (PCA), clustering, fuzzy logic, neuro-computing, evolutionary computation, Bayesian networks, etc. to reduce the size of “Big Data” to a manageable size and apply these tools to a) extract information, b) build a knowledge base using the derived data, and c) eventually develop a non-parametric model for the “Big Data”. This paper attempts to construct a bridge between SoS and Data Analytics to develop reliable models for such systems. A photovoltaic energy forecasting problem of a micro grid SoS will be offered here for a case study of this modeling relation.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5597-1; POD:978-1-4673-5596-4","10.1109/SYSoSE.2013.6575263","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575263","Big Data;Clustering;Data Analytics;Fuzzy C-Means;Fuzzy Inference Systems;Micro-Grid;Neural Networks;PCA;Solar Energy","Analytical models;Data models;Mathematical model;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Training;Training data","artificial intelligence;belief networks;data analysis;evolutionary computation;fuzzy logic;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;load forecasting;nonparametric statistics;pattern clustering;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;principal component analysis;systems engineering","Bayesian networks;Big Data;CI tool;Internet;PCA;clustering;computational intelligence tool;data analytics;evolutionary computation;fuzzy logic;independently operating nonhomogeneous systems;information extraction;knowledge base;microgrid SoS;neurocomputing;nonparametric model;photovoltaic energy forecasting problem;principal component analysis;sensor technology;statistical tools;system of systems;wireless communication","","4","","9","","","2-6 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Up to now there are very few researches conducted on sentiment analysis for Persian documents. This paper considers the problem of sentiment classification for online customer reviews in Persian language. One of the challenges of Persian language is using of a wide variety of declensional suffixes. Another common problem of Persian text is word spacing. In Persian in addition to white space as interwords space, an intra-word space called pseudo-space separates word's part. One more noticeable challenge in customer reviews in Persian language is that of utilizing many informal or colloquial words in text. In this paper we study these challenges by proposing a model for sentiment classification of Persian review documents. The proposed model is based on a lemmatization approach for Persian language and is employed Naive Bayes learning algorithm for classification. Additionally we present a new feature selection method based on the mutual information method to extract the best feature collection from the initial extracted features. Finally we evaluate the performance of the model on a manually gathered collection of cellphone reviews, where the results show the effectiveness of the proposed model.","2164-7054;21647054","Electronic:978-1-4673-5634-3; POD:978-1-4673-5632-9","10.1109/IranianCEE.2013.6599671","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6599671","Feature Selection;Mutual information;Persian language;Sentiment analysis;Sentiment classification","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Equations;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Mutual information;Training","Bayes methods;Internet;classification;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;text analysis","Internet;Persian language;Persian review documents;Persian text;cellphone review collection;declensional suffixes;feature collection extraction;feature selection;information retrieval;interwords space;intraword space;lemmatization approach;mutual information-based method;naive Bayes learning algorithm;natural language processing community;online customer reviews;pseudo-space;sentiment analysis;sentiment classification","","1","","24","","","14-16 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Huge volume of data including sensitive data is outsourced and stored remotely in public clouds. There is a need for efficient protection of the privacy and security of users and their data without affecting its utility to authorized users. There needs to be a trade-off between data security and availability. Multi user encryption schemes provide partial solution by encrypting data and managing keys efficiently among the users but exposing the entire data accessible to all the users. But, in certain applications, the data need to be accessed by only specified users and they shall have access to only specified parts of the data on a need to know basis. Ciphertext policy attribute based encryption supports keyword based search but require large amount of data for a single keyword thereby increasing the size and hence the cost of storage on the cloud. In this paper, we have proposed an encryption scheme which requires less storage space on the cloud but provides fine grained access control to authorized users.

This paper explores the use of node-local nonvolatile memories (NVM) such as phase-change memory, to provide frequent, low overhead checkpoints. By adapting existing multi-level checkpoint techniques, we devise new methods, termed NVM-checkpoints, that efficiently store checkpoints on both local and remote node NVM. The checkpoint frequencies are guided by failure models that capture the expected accessibility of such data after failure. To lower overheads, NVM-checkpoints reduce the NVM and interconnect bandwidth used with a novel pre-copy mechanism, which incrementally moves checkpoint data from DRAM to NVM before a local checkpoint is started. This reduces local checkpoint cost by limiting the instantaneous data volume moved at checkpoint time, thereby freeing bandwidth for use by applications. In fact, the pre-copy method can reduce peak interconnect usage up to 46%. Since our approach treats NVM as memory rather than as 'Ramdisk', pre-copying can be generalized to directly move data to remote NVMs. This results in 40% faster application execution times compared to asynchronous approaches not using pre-copying.","1530-2075;15302075","Electronic:978-0-7695-4971-2; POD:978-1-4673-6066-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2013.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569798","Checkpointing;Memory bandwidth;Non volatile memory (NVM);PCM;Pre-Copy","Bandwidth;Checkpointing;Hardware;Nonvolatile memory;Peer-to-peer computing;Phase change materials;Random access memory","DRAM chips;checkpointing;failure analysis;fault tolerance;information retrieval;optimisation;virtual machines;virtual storage","DRAM;checkpoint frequency;checkpoint optimization;data accessibility;failure model;local node NVM;multilevel checkpoint technique;next generation high end machine;nonvolatile memory;precopy mechanism;remote node NVM;virtual memory","","12","","29","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The applicability of network science is truly broad, and most recently it has been found to be a very helpful tool in understanding the complex dynamics of human relationships. In this paper we show that network science can be applied to the study of arts and culture as well by analyzing the archival data of classical music recordings, exploring the complex patterns of collaboration among various musicians. Specifically, we study the network of classical musicians (composers and performers) constructed from the ArkivMusic.com database, a comprehensive digital source of information on classical music CDs. The goal of this paper is twofold: First, we show that the study of complex network patterns in the landscape of classical music recording can provide novel understanding and insights into culture and the arts, highlighting their potential as a subject of serious study in network science per se, Second, given how network analysis allows one to unearth the essential patterns of relations between things from complex large-scale data, we would like to explore how the findings can be applied to ubiquitous virtual reality research that aims to enrich user experience via exploiting the connections between the elements of an environment.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5084-8; POD:978-1-4799-0865-3","10.1109/ISUVR.2013.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6597729","","Art;Collaboration;Correlation;Data handling;Information management;Music;Social network services","art;data analysis;information retrieval systems;music;network theory (graphs);social sciences computing;ubiquitous computing;virtual reality","ArkivMusic.com database;archival data analysis;arts;classical music recordings;complex collaboration patterns;culture;information technology;network science;social network analysis;ubiquitous VR;ubiquitous virtual reality research","","0","","15","","","10-13 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes the Ericsson Implicit Social Networking, a location-aware implicit social networking platform for mobile users. Using this platform, telcos can maximize their revenue potential by utilizing stored user data, an approach called data monetization. Mobile users equipped with a smartphone can use the Ericsson Implicit Social Networking platform through a myriad of context-aware services. After users install and activate a client application, they are able to receive personalized information, offers and content - e.g. movie recommendations, discounts for customer loyalty, songs and tickets for events by their favorite artist.

However, the generalization of Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems in manufacturing companies to get such indicators has rapidly entailed the increase of the quantity of the digital resources, where a resource represents manufacturing data presented in specific formats. Retrieving such resources may become impossible without a semantic support. Our solution provides a semantic framework to enhance the retrieval of manufacturing information through the use of a business ontology and a domain-specific dictionary. The specificity of this business semantics is that it brings the resources closer to the business needs on one hand, and it unifies the business vocabulary in the company on other hand.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6085-2; POD:978-1-4673-6084-5","10.1109/CSCWD.2013.6581002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6581002","Business ontology;Domain-specific dictionary;Manufacturing-Proces Control;Resource retrieval;Semantic support","Companies;Dictionaries;Manufacturing;Ontologies;Process control;Semantics","groupware;information retrieval;manufacturing data processing;manufacturing industries;ontologies (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;process control","COTS system;business ontology;business semantics;business vocabulary;collaborative control;collaborative work;commercial off-the-shelf system;company engineers;control indicator;control task;digital resources;domain-specific dictionary;industries;manufacturing companies;manufacturing data;manufacturing information retrieval;manufacturing process control;manufacturing processes;resources retrieval;semantic framework;semantic support","","4","","12","","","27-29 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The growth of mobile computing has led to an increase in access to digital music. With the growth of digital music, the development of music information sharing services for users becomes important. The existing sharing methods are based on the users' social network and preferences in music. However, sometimes, sharing music according to location and time is needed. This paper presents work on smart spaces equipped with NFC tags, deployed at different locations in hallways for discovering and sharing new music experiences. This concept provides a new way of interaction between passers-by for discovering music in relation to location. For example, the hallway locations use sensing devices to provide an automatic means of exchanging music information among the passers-by. We utilized NFC tags as Music-Relay hot spots. The hot spot retrieves information about the music a user is playing on her/his device while s/he is passing by the hot spot. The work contributes to a pervasive service that equips an environment with music context intelligence about a passer-bys choice of music and allows users to feel the musical presence of other users who have been in the same location at previous point in time.

A huge amount of fresh information is posted on the World Wide Web day by day. Web crawlers are programs that traverse the Web and download web documents in an automated manner. Search engines have to keep an up to date image to all Web pages and other web resources hosted in web servers in their index and data repositories, to provide improved and exact result to its users. The crawlers of these search engines have to retrieve the pages continuously to keep the index up to date. The list of URL is very huge and thus it is very difficult to refresh it quickly as 40% of web pages change daily. Due to which more of the network resources particularly bandwidth are consumed by the web crawlers to keep the repository up to date. This paper deals with a system based on web crawler using mobile agent. The proposed approach uses Java Aglets for crawling the web pages. The major advantages of web crawler based on Mobile Agents are that the analysis part of the crawling process is done locally at the residence of data rather than inside the remote server. This considerably reduces network load and traffic which can improve the performance and efficiency of the crawling process.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5149-2; POD:978-1-4673-5150-8","10.1109/AICERA-ICMiCR.2013.6575995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6575995","Aglets;Mobile Agent;Mobile Crawler;Search Engine;Web Crawler;World Wide Web","Crawlers;Indexes;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Search engines;Web pages;Web servers","Internet;Java;information retrieval;mobile agents;search engines","Java Aglets;URL;Web crawlers;Web documents;Web pages;Web resources;Web servers;World Wide Web;data repositories;images;index repositories;information resources;mobile agent;mobile crawler;multimedia;network load;network resources;network traffic;page retrieval;remote server;search engine freshness;text documents","","0","","16","","","4-6 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Discovering user's interest at E-commerce site using clickstream data","L. Chen; Q.

With the development of E-commerce, users' detailed navigating and purchasing behaviors can be completely stored. Clickstream data are records of users' browsing behaviors, which provide information about the path viewed by users and their access time on each page. Usually, personalized services can be offered based on this information by e-commerce service providers. To facilitate dynamic and personalized commodity recommendations, not only within-category but also across-category, an interest oriented method based on clickstream data mining is proposed in this paper to cluster users. A new definition of users' interest is introduced for the first time as a set of the preference for commodity categories. In order to describe users' behaviors and reflect their interest, three main indicators category visiting path, browsing frequency and relative length of access time are taken into consideration and refined from clickstream data. According to these indicators, an improved clustering algorithm with rough set theory is used to cluster users with similar interest. The experimental result shows that this algorithm is effective and applicable. The result of this proposed algorithm can be applied to support decision making for e-commerce sites.","2161-1890;21611890","Electronic:978-1-4673-4843-0; POD:978-1-4673-3080-0","10.1109/ICSSSM.2013.6602631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6602631","browsing behavior;clickstream data mining;clustering;cross-category recommendation;user interest","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Equations;Time-frequency analysis;Topology;Web pages","Web sites;data mining;electronic commerce;information retrieval;pattern clustering;recommender systems;rough set theory","access time;across-category recommendations;browsing frequency;category visiting path;clickstream data mining;clustering algorithm;commodity recommendations;e-commerce site;electronic commerce;interest oriented method;personalized service;rough set theory;user browsing behavior;user interest discovery;user navigation behavior;user purchasing behavior;within-category recommendations","","3","","22","","","17-19 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Identifying top-k information hubs is crucial for many applications such as advertising in social networks where advertisers are interested in identifying hubs to whom free samples can be given. Existing solutions are centralized and require time stamped information about pair-wise user interactions and can only be used by social network owners as only they have access to such data. Existing distributed algorithms suffer from poor accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to identify information hubs that preserves user privacy. Our method can identify hubs without requiring a central entity to access the complete friendship graph. We achieve this by fully distributing the computation using the Kempe-McSherry algorithm, while addressing user privacy concerns. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed technique using three real-world data set; The first two are Facebook data sets containing about 6 million users and more than 40 million friendship links. The third data set is from Twitter and comprises of a little over 2 million users. The results of our analysis show that our algorithm is up to 50% more accurate than existing algorithms. Results also show that the proposed algorithm can estimate the rank of the top-k information hubs users more accurately than existing approaches.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2013.SUP.0513055","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6544551","Social network analysis;eigendecomposition;information hubs;spectral graph analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Communities;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Equations;Privacy;Social network services;Vectors","data privacy;distributed algorithms;graph theory;information retrieval;social networking (online)","Facebook data sets;Kempe-McSherry algorithm;Twitter;distributed algorithm;friendship graph;pair-wise user interactions;real-world data set;social networks;top-k information hub identification;user privacy","","2","","36","","20130620","September 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the problem of converting an end-user's natural language input to a valid structured query in an ad-hoc fashion hasn't been sufficiently solved yet. In this paper we present a framework for Q&A systems that operate on structured data. The main innovation is that the framework allows defining a mapping between recognized semantics of a user's questions to a structured query model that can be executed on arbitrary data sources. It bases on popular standards like RDF and SparQL and is therefore very easy to adapt to other domains or use-cases. We will describe the application of this framework at hand of a BI question answering use-case, which also includes the personalization of generated queries, demonstrating the realworld applicability of our approach.

This nature of smart space enables of appearance of cyber conflicts between different smart space devices (or participants) which can have different goals and situation understanding but common information space for trusted cyber relationships. Therefore, one of the main security problems of coalition operations in smart spaces is a support of dynamic access control for decreasing cyber risks. In particular, a new access control model for accessing resources is needed. The model should describe the current situation via a context. Therefore, the research and development of the context-based access control mechanisms for smart space resources is an essential task. The paper proposes a model of the context-based access control for the information shared in a smart space. Micro virtualization mechanisms represented by virtual private micro smart spaces are the basis for the model, which is built on the combination of the role-based and attribute-based access control models. Roles are assigned dynamically based on the smart space participant's trust level. The role separation allows simplifying policies and makes them human-readable and easy to configure. The trust level calculation is based on the participant's context, which includes identification attributes; location; current date; device type, etc. Also, three kinds of access control rules have been proposed. These rules are used to calculate the trust level, to assign roles based on the trust level, and to grant permissions to the smart space resources.","2325-5366;23255366","Electronic:978-9949-9211-5-7; POD:978-1-4799-0450-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6568371","access control;context;smart space;smart-m3","Access control;Aerospace electronics;Cloud computing;Communities;Context;Context modeling;Laboratories","authorisation;information retrieval;resource allocation;trusted computing;virtualisation","attribute-based access control models;coalition operations;context-based access control model;cyber conflicts;cyber risk reduction;dynamic access control;information sharing;information space;microvirtualization mechanisms;research and development;resource access;resource sharing;role assignment;role-based access control models;security problems;service sharing;smart space devices;trust level calculation;trusted cyber relationships;virtual private micro smart spaces","","1","","24","","","4-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Essentially, with its fully decentralized approach, Chord avoids any bottleneck and single point of failure while guaranteeing data to be retrieved in O(log N) hops in a network consisting of N nodes. By optimizing the number of hops for data access, Chord implicitly assumes that all connections between nodes have comparable bandwidth and latency characteristics. However, in heterogeneous, mobile P2P systems that consist of both mobile and fixed nodes, this is not the case. Moreover, due to the mobility of nodes, connection parameters can dynamically change. Especially in mobile P2P applications where low latency for data access is essential, such as in emergency management, routing should aim at reducing the overall latency, rather than the number of hops in the network. In this paper, we present COMPASS, a protocol for efficient data access in heterogeneous mobile Chord-based P2P systems. COMPASS takes into account that the network latency of nodes in a mobile P2P network may significantly differ and thus aims at minimizing the overall latency, even if this necessitates more hops in the network. This is done by probing the network and by maintaining, in addition to Chord's finger table, at each peer a data structure called COMPASS table. We present in detail the initialization and maintenance of the COMPASS table that dynamically adapts to changing node characteristics. Evaluation results show that COMPASS outperforms standard Chord-based routing and reduces the overall latency in heterogeneous P2P networks consisting of fixed and mobile nodes.","1551-6245;15516245","Electronic:978-0-7695-4973-6; POD:978-1-4673-6068-5","10.1109/MDM.2013.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569121","Chord;Mobile Devices;Mobile Peer-to-Peer System;P2P Data Management","Compass;Fingers;Mobile handsets;Mobile nodes;Peer-to-peer computing;Routing","data structures;information retrieval;minimisation;mobile computing;overlay networks;peer-to-peer computing;routing protocols","COMPASS protocol;COMPASS table;O(log N) hops;bandwidth characteristics;connection parameters;data access;data management;data retrieval;data structure;distributed hash tables;fixed nodes;heterogeneous mobile Chord-based P2P system;latency characteristics;mobile nodes;network latency;node mobility;optimized routing;overall latency minimization;overlay networks;peer-to-peer systems","","1","","20","","","3-6 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While this outsourced storage and computing paradigm can potentially bring great economical savings for data owners and users, its benefits may not be fully realized due to wide concerns of data owners that their private data may be involuntarily exposed or handled by cloud providers. Although end-to-end encryption techniques have been proposed as promising solutions for secure cloud data storage, a primary challenge toward building a full-fledged cloud data service remains: how to effectively support flexible data utilization services such as search over the data in a privacy-preserving manner. In this article, we identify the system requirements and challenges toward achieving privacy-assured searchable outsourced cloud data services, especially, how to design usable and practically efficient search schemes for encrypted cloud storage. We present a general methodology for this using searchable encryption techniques, which allows encrypted data to be searched by users without leaking information about the data itself and users¿ queries. In particular, we discuss three desirable functionalities of usable search operations: supporting result ranking, similarity search, and search over structured data. For each of them, we describe approaches to design efficient privacy-assured searchable encryption schemes, which are based on several recent symmetric-key encryption primitives. We analyze their advantages and limitations, and outline the future challenges that need to be solved to make such secure searchable cloud data service a reality.","0890-8044;08908044","","10.1109/MNET.2013.6574666","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574666","","Cloud computing;Data storage systems;Encryption;Privacy;Search engines","cloud computing;data privacy;information retrieval;private key cryptography","cloud computing;efficient search schemes;encrypted cloud storage;flexible data utilization services;privacy-assured cloud data storage services;privacy-assured searchable encryption schemes;privacy-assured searchable outsourced cloud data service;result ranking;search-over-structured data;secure searchable cloud data storage service;similarity search;symmetric-key encryption primitives;usable search schemes","","4","","16","","","July-August 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On one hand there is the limited time that a consumer has to access the information and on the other hand there is the minimum utility level that a provider needs to provide to the society of consumers to cover it's investment cost. In this paper we present a novel decision model for a set of competing providers that wish to enter a market. It may happen that due to the competition, some competitors will not be able to cover their investment cost and therefore will disappear. We analyze the optimum way of forming the market, in order to maximize the aggregate utility of it. We show that this problem is NP-complete and present a linear programming rounding heuristic algorithm to solve it.

"UBI-Tree: Indexing Method for Schema-Less Search","Y. Arakawa; T. Nakamura; M. Nakamura; H.

Schema-less search is a multi-dimensional range search from a wide variety of data, such as sensor data, collected through participatory sensing. Such data have different types and number of dimensions because a participant uses various devices. Therefore, applications must search for their target data within the sensor data in a cross-schema manner. UBI-Tree is a tree-structured index based on R-Tree. The insert algorithm classifies various data into nodes according to newly introduced scores to estimate the inefficiency of classification. The score can uniformly represent the difference in the types of dimensions between data as well as the difference in dimension values. By classifying data that have a similar dimension set into the same node, UBI-Tree suppresses the curse of dimensionality and makes schema-less searches efficient. The validity of UBI-Tree was evaluated through experiments.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2159-1; POD:978-1-4799-2160-7","10.1109/COMPSACW.2013.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6605803","UBI-Tree;index;sensor data;shema-free;shema-less","Classification algorithms;Equations;Indexing;Position measurement;Temperature measurement;Time measurement","classification;data reduction;indexing;information retrieval;pattern classification;tree data structures;trees (mathematics)","R-Tree;UBI-Tree;cassification inefficiency estimation;data search;dimensionality curse suppression;indexing method;insert algorithm;multidimensional range search;participatory sensing;schema-less search;tree-structured index","","1","","16","","","22-26 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Weather radars commonly known as NEXRAD have also been used for monitoring purposes. The advantage of NEXRAD is that it can provide bird migration movements over a broad geographical scale and can be accessed free of charge.

However, there is no scalable factorization algorithm that takes advantage of the symmetry and guarantees numerical stability through pivoting at the same time. This is because such an algorithm exhibits many of the fundamental challenges in parallel programming like irregular data accesses and irregular task dependencies. In this paper, we address these challenges in a tiled implementation of a blocked Aasen's algorithm using a dynamic scheduler. To fully exploit the limited parallelism in this left-looking algorithm, we study several performance enhancing techniques; e.g., parallel reduction to update a panel, tall-skinny LU factorization algorithms to factorize the panel, and a parallel implementation of symmetric pivoting. Our performance results on up to 48 AMD Opteron processors demonstrate that our implementation obtains speedups of up to 2.8 over MKL, while losing only one or two digits in the computed residual norms.","1530-2075;15302075","Electronic:978-0-7695-4971-2; POD:978-1-4673-6066-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2013.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569872","","Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Multicore processing;Numerical stability;Partitioning algorithms;Plasmas;Symmetric matrices","information retrieval;matrix decomposition;multiprocessing systems;numerical stability;parallel architectures;parallel programming;scheduling","AMD Opteron processors;MKL;blocked Aasen algorithm;computational kernel;computed residual norms;data access;dense symmetric indefinite matrix;dynamic scheduler;engineering simulations;irregular task dependencies;left-looking algorithm;multicore architectures;numerical stability;parallel programming;parallel reduction;scientific simulations;symmetric pivoting;tall-skinny LU factorization algorithms","","0","","24","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the data is on the order of petabytes, current search engines are very large centralized systems based on replicated clusters, where easily more than 100 billion web pages are indexed. On the other hand, Internet users are above two billion and hundreds of million of queries are issued each day. In the near future, centralized systems are likely to become less effective against such a data-query load, thus suggesting the need of fully distributed search engines. Such engines need to maintain high quality answers, fast response time, high query throughput, high availability and scalability; in spite of network latency and scattered data.

In this paper, we present an improved data layout of S-RAID: Hybrid S-RAID (HS-RAID) to improve energy-saving and reliability of the S-RAID used in the archival storage specially. HS-RAID takes two strategies to achieve the goal: one is to storage metadata separating from data files to increase the idle time of disks for energy-saving, the other is to utilize a new parity technique to reduce overheads of the storage system. We have developed a HS-RAID 5 system with 12 hard disks and 2 SSDs to evaluate it. Experimental results show that the power consumption of HS-RAID is only 36% of RAID 5, and 70% of S-RAID 5. Furthermore, the analysis shows that HS-RAID makes average mean time to failure (MTTF) 40 times as long as RAID.","2379-5352;23795352","Electronic:978-0-7695-4879-1; POD:978-1-4673-5704-3","10.1109/PDCAT.2012.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6589312","RAID;archival storage;data layout;energy-saving","Arrays;File systems;Hard disks;Layout;Power demand;Redundancy","RAID;hard discs;information retrieval;information storage;memory architecture;meta data;power aware computing;reliability","HS-RAID 5 system;MTTF;SSD;data files;energy saving improvement;hard disks;hybrid S-RAID;idle disk time;improved data layout;mean time to failure;overhead reduction;parity technique;power consumption reduction;power-aware archival storage architecture;reliability improvement;semiRAID;sequential data access pattern;storage metadata separation","","0","","19","","","14-16 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accessing the Internet is increasingly common from mobile devices through cellular networks. The Internet is now used for shopping, communicating, and for finding employment and housing. More information is readily available than at any time in human history; however, this information is often inaccessible to people with blindness or low-vision. In order to increase access to information for these individuals, information must be presentable in non-visual formats. Presently, screen readers are able to verbalize on-screen text using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis; however, this vocalization is inadequate for browsing the Internet. Modern operating systems have generally relied on a graphical display and a mouse for interfacing. For individuals with vision loss, we propose to create and test an auditory interface that incorporates an auditory-spatial orientation with a standard keyboard for input. If information can be structured as a two-dimensional table, each link can be semantically grouped as a cell in a row within the auditory table. This provides a consistent structure for non-visual auditory navigation. After testing the auditory display prototype with 13 participants, it was shown that stereo panning was an effective technique for audiospatially orienting non-visual navigation through a five-row, six-column HTML table as compared to a centered, stationary synthesized voice. Rather than be left out of ubiquitous computing, blind and low-vision individuals may benefit from increased efficiency and accuracy in non-visual navigation. This finding may also stimulate interest in non-visual computing while performing other tasks, such as walking, eating, or driving.","1091-0050;10910050","Electronic:978-1-4799-0053-4; POD:978-1-4799-0052-7","10.1109/SECON.2013.6567417","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567417","Auditory Displays;Non-visual Navigation;Screen Readers;Sound Spatialization;Stereo Panning","Arrays;Browsers;HTML;Internet;Navigation;Speech;Testing","Internet;audio user interfaces;auditory displays;computerised navigation;hypermedia markup languages;information retrieval;keyboards;mobile computing;vision defects","Internet;audio-spatially enhanced nonvisual navigation;auditory display prototype testing;auditory interface;auditory table;auditory-spatial orientation;blind individuals;cellular networks;graphical display;information access;low-vision individuals;mobile devices;mouse;nonvisual computing;operating systems;screen readers;six-column HTML table;standard keyboard;stereo panning;two-dimensional table;ubiquitous computing;vision loss","","0","","8","","","4-7 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A social network group can be created as a specific community for people who share an interest in a particular topic. One form of interaction within the group is the question-answer interaction by which the users in the group can ask questions or provide answers to others. A network analysis method, e.g., PageRank, can be used to analyze the interaction patterns between the users in order to identify and rank experts in the group. In this paper, we are interested in experimenting on how the quality of the users' comments can take part in the identification and ranking of experts by a PageRank-like algorithm. The quality factors are community rating, that is given to the answers, and the content-based features of the comments, i.e., length, complexity, and informativeness.

However, this architecture presents serious limitations when used to provide real-time traffic monitoring and correlation capabilities across all probes. This paper describes a novel architecture that addresses the problem of real-time traffic correlation and alerting, by exploiting modern cloud infrastructures.

First, we develop a new compression methodology, which exploits the similarities between spatial and/or temporal neighbors in a popular climate simulation dataset and enables high compression ratios and low decompression costs. Second, we develop a framework that can be used to incorporate a variety of compression and decompression algorithms. This framework also supports a simple API to allow integration with an existing application or data processing middleware. Once a compression algorithm is implemented, this framework automatically mechanizes multi-threaded retrieval, multi-threaded data decompression, and the use of informed prefetching and caching. By integrating this framework with a data-intensive middleware, we have applied our compression methodology and framework to three applications over two datasets, including the Global Cloud-Resolving Model (GCRM) climate dataset. We obtained an average compression ratio of 51.68%, and up to 53.27% improvement in execution time of data analysis applications by amortizing I/O time by moving compressed data.","1530-2075;15302075","Electronic:978-0-7695-4971-2; POD:978-1-4673-6066-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2013.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6569897","Compression;Data management;Data-intensive computing;Map-Reduce","Compression algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Meteorology;Middleware;Prefetching","application program interfaces;cache storage;climatology;data analysis;data compression;geophysics computing;information retrieval;middleware;multi-threading","API;GCRM;caching;climate simulation dataset;compression ratios;data processing middleware;data-intensive middleware;decompression costs;global cloud-resolving model climate dataset;high performance systems;informed prefetching;large-scale data analytics applications;multithreaded data decompression;multithreaded retrieval;online compression;wide-area bandwidths","","12","","41","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is widely employed for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction etc. However, due to the vast quantities of tensor entries involved in calculation, it inevitably suffers from high computational cost, especially when recalculation of HOSVD is frequently required. To address the problem, we prove theoretically that the set of HOSVD unitary matrices of a sub-tensor is equivalent to the corresponding subset of HOSVD unitary matrices of the original tensor. Therefore, if we first arrange all tensors in the database compactly as a higher-order tensor, then we only need to conduct HOSVD once on the total tensor. We subsequently propose a robust HOSVD-based multilinear approach for efficiently indexing and retrieving multifactor data, in responding to various query structures. We also apply the proposed method for indexing and retrieval of multi-camera multi-object motion trajectory. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of both robustness and efficiency.","1070-9908;10709908","","10.1109/LSP.2013.2277861","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6576836","HOSVD;Higher-order data;indexing and retrieval;multilinear algebra;tensor tucker decomposition","Heuristic algorithms;Indexing;Matrix decomposition;Robustness;Signal processing algorithms;Tensile stress","indexing;information retrieval;singular value decomposition;tensors","HOSVD unitary matrices;HOSVD-based multilinear approach;computational cost;dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;higher-order singular value decomposition;higher-order tensor;indexing method;matrix SVD;multicamera multiobject motion trajectory;multifactor data;natural multilinear extension;orthonormal spaces;query structures;retrieval method;robust HOSVD-based higher-order data indexing;robust HOSVD-based higher-order data retrieval","","1","","5","","20130808","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we present a credentialing system called TrustForge, which enables effective and flexible access control for the AVMcrowd-sourced repository. Credentialing systems are essential in crowdsourcing to ensure quality, since it is potentially open to contributions made by anyone. The open source software community has developed elaborate manual approaches of managing its contributor community, which are often very labor-intensive and inefficient. Our aim with TrustForge is to improve the automation of the credentialing and access control process in the context of component-based systems, where users contribute components at various levels of abstraction. TrustForge takes a hybrid approach that combines trust policy and reputation to address this problem. In TrustForge, a policy language is used to specify the access control rules for users in the system to contribute components. In addition, reputation values computed for users based on the quality of their past component contributions are used to tune the static policies to enable flexibility and adaptiveness. The contributions of this work are as follows: (1) the design of TrustForge - an effective and flexible access control mechanism that combines policy and reputation approaches; (2) the identification of heuristics for component quality measurement and a novel reputation computation algorithm for evaluating user trustworthiness; (3) a data model based on provenance graphs that allows efficient repository information storage and retrieve. We have implemented TrustForge system and integrate it with the VehicleForge repository system to support the operation of the AVM challenge program. The evaluation results based on realworld deployment and- systematic simulation demonstrate that TrustForge can effectively discern the trustworthiness of users within the crowd-sourced system.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5839-2; POD:978-1-4673-5837-8","10.1109/PST.2013.6596065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6596065","","Access control;Algorithm design and analysis;History;Open source software;Software quality;Vehicles","authorisation;graph theory;groupware;information retrieval;military computing;military vehicles;trusted computing","AVMcrowd-sourced repository;TrustForge;VehicleForge repository system;access control process;adaptive vehicle make;collaborative crowd-sourced environment;component quality measurement;component-based engineering;component-based system;credentialing automation;credentialing system;crowd-sourced engineering;flexible access control;heuristics identification;military vehicle;open source software community;open source software movement;policy language;provenance graph;repository information retrieval;repository information storage;reputation approach;reputation computation algorithm;user trustworthiness evaluation","","1","1","22","","","10-12 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key algorithmic characteristic of the SpM × V kernel, that inhibits it from achieving high performance, is its very low flop:byte ratio. In this paper, we present a compressed storage format, called Compressed Sparse eXtended (CSX), that is able to detect and encode simultaneously multiple commonly encountered substructures inside a sparse matrix. Relying on aggressive compression techniques of the sparse matrix's indexing structure, CSX is able to considerably reduce the memory footprint of a sparse matrix, alleviating the pressure to the memory subsystem. In a diverse set of sparse matrices, CSX was able to provide a more than 40 percent average performance improvement over the standard CSR format in SMP architectures and surpassed 20 percent improvement in NUMA systems, significantly outperforming other CSR alternatives. Additionally, it was able to adapt successfully to the nonzero element structure of the considered matrices, exhibiting very stable performance. Finally, in the context of a “real-life” multiphysics simulation software, CSX accelerated the SpM × V component nearly 40 percent and the total solver time approximately 15 percent.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2012.290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327187","Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication;data compression;multicore optimizations","Computer architecture;Encoding;Indexes;Kernel;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Vectors","data compression;indexing;information retrieval;matrix multiplication;optimisation;sparse matrices;storage management","CSX;NUMA systems;SMP architecture;aggressive compression technique;compressed sparse extended;extended storage compression format;memory subsystem;multiphysics simulation software;nonzero element structure;optimization;sparse matrix indexing structure;sparse matrix vector multiplication;standard CSR format;substructure detection;substructure encoding","","10","","28","","20121008","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advantages of KC are to help an organization to develop rational and coordinate approaches to capture, identification, storage and intellectual assets retrieval. However, there are limited guidelines in building the KC in an organization. In addition, the component of KC and its features are also not very clear. Thus, this paper presents requirement of KC model by defining the components of KC which are knowledge generation, knowledge dissemination and digital repository as engagement mechanism. This has been done based on comparison of several existing KC website and also based on previous studies. The proposed requirement of KC hopefully will improve the knowledge management in an organization.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4992-5; POD:978-1-4673-4990-1","10.1109/ICoICT.2013.6574568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574568","digital repository;knowledge centre;knowledge centre features;knowledge dissemination;knowledge generation","Best practices;Communications technology;Communities;Knowledge engineering;Organizations;Standards organizations;Training","Internet;information retrieval;information storage;knowledge management","KC Web site;Web analysis;coordinate approach;digital repository;engagement mechanism;knowledge centre;knowledge dissemination;knowledge generation;rational approach","","0","","10","","","20-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Split File Model for Big Data in Low Throughput Storage","M. Uehara","Fac. of Inf.

Recently, several low-throughput storage services such as the Pogo plug Cloud have been developed. These services are based on Amazon Glacier. They have low throughput, but low cost and large capacity. Therefore, these services are suitable for backups or archiving big data and can be used instead of offline storage tiers. To utilize such low throughput storage efficiently, we need tools for effective deduplication and resumable transfers, amongst others. We propose a split file model that can represent big data efficiently in low throughput storage. In the split file model, a large file is divided into many small parts, which are stored in a directory. We have developed tool commands to support the use of split files in a transparent way. Using these commands, replicated data is naturally excluded and effective shallow copying is supported. In this paper, we describe the split file model in detail and evaluate an implementation thereof.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4992-7; POD:978-1-4799-0547-8","10.1109/CISIS.2013.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6603897","big data;low throughput storage;split file model","Data handling;Data models;Data storage systems;Information management;Joining processes;Servers;Throughput","cloud computing;information retrieval systems;storage management","Amazon Glacier;Pogoplug cloud;big data archiving;directory;large-scale storage;low-throughput storage services;offline storage tiers;resumable transfers;split file model","","2","","2","","","3-5 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It involves matching a set of strings in a document against a dictionary of pre-defined patterns. In this paper, we describe a high performance and scalable hardware architecture to enable high throughput dictionary matching on very large dictionaries for text analytics applications. Our hardware accelerator employs a novel hashing based approach instead of commonly used deterministic finite automata (DFA) based algorithms. A limitation of the DFA based approaches is that they typically process one character every cycle, while the proposed hash based scheme can process a string token every cycle, thus achieving significantly higher processing throughput than the DFA based implementations. Our measurement results based on a prototype implementation on an Altera Stratix IV FPGA device indicate that our hardware dictionary matching engine can process typical document streams at a processing rate of ~1.5GB/s (~12 Gbps) while simultaneously allowing support for large dictionary sizes containing up to ~100K patterns, thus making it very useful for IE workload acceleration.","1063-6862;10636862","Electronic:978-1-4799-0493-8; POD:978-1-4799-0494-5; USB:978-1-4799-0492-1","10.1109/ASAP.2013.6567551","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567551","FPGA;dictionary matching;hardware acceleration;hashing;information extraction;pattern matching;string matching;text analytics","Arrays;Dictionaries;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Pattern matching;Random access memory;Throughput","dictionaries;field programmable gate arrays;file organisation;information retrieval systems;string matching;text analysis","Altera Stratix IV FPGA device;DFA based algorithms;IE systems;IE workload acceleration;deterministic finite automata based algorithms;hardware accelerator;hardware dictionary matching engine;hashing based approach;high throughput dictionary matching;high-speed dictionary matching engine;information extraction system;large-scale dictionary matching engine;scalable hardware architecture;string matching;string token;text analytics applications","","1","","19","","","5-7 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatic Competence Leveling of Learning Objects","R. Kawase; P. Siehndel; B. P. Nunes; M. Fisichella","L3S Res.

Educational institutions apply competences to understand whether a person has a particular level of ability or skill. Educational resource enriched with competence information allows learners identifying, on a fine-grained level, which resources to study with the aim to reach a specific competence target. However, the process of annotating learning objects with competence levels is a very time consuming task, ideally, this task should be performed by experts on the subjects of the educational resources. Due to this, most educational resources available online do not enclose competence information. In this paper, we present a method to tackle the problem of automatically assigning an educational resource with competence levels. To solve these problems, we exploit information extracted from external repositories available on the Web, which lead us to a domain independent approach. We demonstrate the quality of the proposed methods through an evaluation on real world data with an additional user study. Results show that the automatic competence level assignment achieves 84% precision on ground truth data. The key implications of our approach are: first, it effectively facilitates experts in the arduous task of competence assignment and second, it directly supports learners to retrieve proper leveled material.","2161-3761;21613761","Electronic:978-0-7695-5009-1; POD:978-1-4799-0373-3","10.1109/ICALT.2013.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6601890","","Education;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Europe;Internet;Materials","educational computing;educational institutions;information resources;information retrieval","ability level;automatic competence level assignment;automatic educational resource assignment;automatic learning object competence leveling;competence information enriched educational resource;educational institutions;information extraction;learning object annotation process;online available educational resources;proficiency levels;skill level","","2","","18","","","15-18 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Whether they are fighting crime, curing diseases, deciding what car to buy, or researching a new field, inevitably investigators will encounter text documents. Taking a visual analytics approach, we integrate multiple text analysis algorithms with a suite of interactive visualizations to provide a flexible and powerful environment that allows analysts to explore collections of documents while sensemaking. Our particular focus is on the process of integrating automated analyses with interactive visualizations in a smooth and fluid manner. We illustrate this integration through two example scenarios: An academic researcher examining InfoVis and VAST conference papers and a consumer exploring car reviews while pondering a purchase decision. Finally, we provide lessons learned toward the design and implementation of visual analytics systems for document exploration and understanding.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2012.324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392833","Visual analytics;document analysis;exploratory search;information seeking;information visualization;sensemaking","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Data visualization;Measurement;Tag clouds;Text analysis;Visualization","data visualisation;information retrieval;interactive systems;text analysis","InfoVis conference papers;Jigsaw;VAST conference papers;academic researcher;automated analysis;computational analysis;document exploration;interactive visualization;purchase decision;sensemaking;text analysis algorithm;text document collection;visual analytics","","21","","70","","20121224","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
