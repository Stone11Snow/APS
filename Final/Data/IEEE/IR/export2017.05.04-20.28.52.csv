They have been proved by many existing work. The feedback includes positive and negative relevance one. The most of the previous work using feedback have focused on positive relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback in IR. In recent years, some work has been done and investigated the negative relevance feedback in IR. However, this paper highlights the incorporation or integration between the language models based positive and negative relevance feedback in IR, where both types of feedback are used to modify and expand the user's query model. Our experimental results of using several TREC collections show that this method is significantly outperform the relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback in terms of the retrieval accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6585-9; POD:978-1-4244-6582-8","10.1109/ICICISYS.2010.5658362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5658362","information retrieval;language model;negative relevance feedback;relevance feedback","Radio frequency","natural language processing;query processing;relevance feedback","information retrieval;language model;negative relevance feedback;positive relevance feedback;pseudo-relevance feedback;user query model","","0","","13","","","29-31 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome the limitations of under-specified queries, we utilize tags to enhance information retrieval capabilities by expanding users' original queries with context-relevant information. We compute a set of significant tag neighbor candidates based on the neighbor frequency and weight, and utilize the most frequent and weighted neighbors to expand an entry query that has terms matching tags. The proposed approach is evaluated using MedWorm medical article collection and standard evaluation methods from the text retrieval conference (TREC). We compared the baseline of 0.353 for Mean Average Precision (MAP), reaching a MAP 0.491 (+39%) with the query expansion.

The proposed approach also recommends candidate identifiers built from high-level artifacts related to the source code under development and has been implemented as an Eclipse plug-in, called COde Comprehension Nurturant Using Traceability (COCONUT). The paper also reports on two controlled experiments performed with master's and bachelor's students. The goal of the experiments is to evaluate the quality of identifiers and comments (in terms of their consistency with high-level artifacts) in the source code produced when using or not using COCONUT. The achieved results confirm our conjecture that providing the developers with similarity between code and high-level artifacts helps to improve the quality of source code lexicon.

Hence, the success of the Semantic Web depends heavily on the development of ontologies, which necessitates fast and simple engineering of ontologies and prevention of a knowledge acquisition bottleneck. This paper discourses the issue of prevailing semantic conflicts in Web mining and explains how intelligent agents with the help of ontology can eliminate some kinds of these semantic conflicts as a result of which relevance of retrieved results is improved.

How to organize and search large scale music collections is one of the most fundamental challenging research problems. In this paper we introduce an inverted index approach well known in text information retrieval to organize and index music collections. According to musical form structure and repetition rule of musical themes, repeating patterns can be regarded as representation for musical themes. Statistical result indicates repeating patterns follow Zipf's law on a given music database.

This method has several problems to be solved, which is different with the digital image watermarking. In the method, consideration for geometrical deformation, especially rotations, in the data extraction process is essential. For the correction, addition of a black frame to an image as a marker has been considered. However it may not be preferable in some case, since the frame may change the impression of the image. This paper proposes new correction method without the remarkable marker. This method can adopt the relationship between the mark in the DFT domain and the rotation of images. By embedding the mark in the DFT domain, the rotational angle can be easily obtained. Related to this new embedding marker, the area in the DCT domain for embedding the information is investigated. Also an image resize technique suitable for this method is developed. From the experimental results, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7010-5; POD:978-1-4244-7007-5; USB:978-1-4244-7009-9","10.1109/ISCIT.2010.5665066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665066","","Discrete Fourier transforms;Discrete cosine transforms;Labeling;PSNR;Pixel;Printing;Watermarking","discrete Fourier transforms;discrete cosine transforms;image processing;image retrieval;information retrieval","DCT domain;DFT domain;automatic information retrieval;data embedded printing images;data embedding printing images;data extraction process;digital image watermarking;geometrical deformation;image resize technique;reference marks;rotational angles","","3","","4","","","26-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Diagnosis of heart diseases requires special skill and clinical experience along with detailed and expensive tests. However, heart disease diagnosis by heartbeat sounds is preferable and still widely used as the first step of diagnosis. Recently, Computer aided auscultation has emerged as a cost-effective technique to analyze and interpret the heart sounds.

It deals with retrieving information in a different language than in which documents are stored. User retrieves the result in the language of his choice. Computing has changed the way to process the data. Our research work develops an application which gives user the flexibility to interact with system in a language of his/her choice. Using this system, a user can enter the query in Hindi or English and retrieve the relevant documents in Hindi or English, though stored documents are in English only. Thus both types of users can get the information through the documents and images. The approach used for this application is to transform the query to English language and then query processing is done. After that retrieval of documents is done, the final output is converted to the desired language. The other way around would be to convert the documents to the query language and then start processing but that would increase the time complexity. In this system, query is in form of keyword in any of the language either Hindi or English. The corpus is of Allahabad museum consisting of images and documents. All the stored documents related to Allahabad museum are in English language. The system successfully handles different types of cross language user queries related to Allahabad Museum.","","DVD:978-1-4244-8593-2; Electronic:978-1-4244-8594-9; POD:978-1-4244-8595-6","10.1109/ICSIP.2010.5697460","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5697460","Cross language;Information Retrieval;Unstructured Data","Complexity theory;Databases;Graphical user interfaces;Image processing;Information retrieval;Lead","document handling;natural language processing;query processing","Allahabad Museum;Hindi-English based cross language information retrieval system;query processing;relevant document retrieval","","1","","7","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, it is unknown how to prevent some curious storage- provider from learning the private information of the user, such as, searching criterion and access pattern, as well as contents. In CRYPTO'07, Boneh et al. put forward a privacy-preserving solution to this problem, with the help of public key cryptography. In their work, the authors made use of PIR (Private Information Retrieval) and several combinatoric techniques, which are theoretically interesting and likely to be the best approach in the literature.

Document objects of the result set are distributed by calculating their pair-wise distances and clustering similar documents in a relatively nearby area.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5392-4; POD:978-1-4244-5391-7","10.1109/CISE.2010.5677204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677204","","Data visualization;Engines;Feature extraction;Metasearch;Search engines;Visualization","query processing;search engines","document retrieval;information retrieval;meta-search engines;pairwise distances;querying;real-time visualization system","","0","","7","","","10-12 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the variations in faces as well as the images that capture this human feature, recognition and identification of facial images is a complex problem. In this paper, a face identification and recognition system is designed using scale invariant points and phase extraction. Identification of a face within an image is the first step; here a skin color model is used by matching the texture of skin via hue and saturation values. This step is followed by a face recognition operation whereby components of the face (e.g., eyes, lips, and nose) are extracted using a geometric approach rather than holistic approach. Each individual component of the face is extracted using separate classifiers resulting in individual feature signatures. The approach of extracting signatures for each facial component results in classifying scale invariant images of the face which provides robust recognition among clusters and occlusions in real-time. The output of each classifier is individually processed for features that are invariant of scale, translation, rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes. Results show that the constructed PID's (Phase IDentifications) are unique for each component of a face and the signatures of a facial image obtained via this hybrid face recognition approach provides better results than classical methods by focusing on specific areas that are sensitive to variations. The main advantage of PIDs is that they are applicable to a broader range of image structures, such as corners and edges, for which scale selection is unreliable in current scale invariance algorithms. In this paper, we extend our work in PIDs by focusing on the selection of the number of key points in the facial image in order to test robustness and accuracy. This is demonstrated by several face detection examples.","2154-4824;21544824","Electronic:978-1-889335-42-1; POD:978-1-4244-9673-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5665360","","Computational modeling;Eyebrows;Face;Face recognition;Image recognition;Nose;Robustness","edge detection;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;image texture","component based classification;edge recognition;facial image;facial information retrieval;hue saturation value;human feature recognition;image matching;phase identification;scale invariance;skin color model;skin texture","","1","","11","","","19-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We generate the database by estimating fundamental frequencies (F0) of the audio signals frame by frame. To improve the retrieval accuracy, we exploit multiple F0 candidates to absorb the impact of F0 estimation errors.

However, many efforts have been made to make more useful query keywords because users do not use many keywords in their natural language search query when retrieving information on the Web. Because a keyword does not provide much information, however, relevance feedback is generally used to complement the weakness of general retrieval methods. This paper proposes a term cluster query expansion model based on classification information of retrieved documents. This model generates classification information from the upper ranked n documents retrieved by retrieval system. On the basis of the extracted classification information, the term cluster (m) that represents each group is generated, and then the model allows user to select term cluster that corresponds to user information needs. The query keywords are expanded by using a relevance feedback algorithm based on the selected classification information. As a result of the experiments with test collection, the retrieval effectiveness was improved by 13.2% compared to the initial query when the Rocchio method was used.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4225-6; POD:978-1-4244-8432-4","10.1109/AICI.2010.159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655201","Classification Information;Natural Language Information Retrieval;Query Expansion;Relevance Feedback;Term Cluster","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Geography;History;Industries;Information retrieval;Natural languages","information needs;natural language processing;pattern classification;query processing;relevance feedback","Rocchio method;classification information;document similarities;natural language information retrieval system;natural language search query;relevance feedback algorithm;term cluster query expansion model;user information needs;user query keywords","","2","","12","","","23-24 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The access to the web from a mobile device especially the search for information is growing in popularity every day due to the availability, cheap cost and convenience of access. Studies have shown that the users are not satisfied with the state of the art in mobile browsing especially in the search and retrieval process. The potentially large volume of content that can be accessed, low power limitations of cellular band width, variable and small screen sizes pose considerable challenges to mobile users. This has necessitated great interest and research in the domain.

The growing interest in mining the Internet for conversation topics, opinions, and influencers has resulted in many free and commercial products. At the heart of such capability are two core technologies: information retrieval and text mining. While search engines and technologies like RSS make gathering information easier, they, like text mining, still require a significant amount of consideration when applying them in mission critical situations. For example, different search engines retrieve irrelevant results, and it is difficult to impossible to know that all relevant results have been found. Also, doing significant analysis of such documents will usually require the fusion of other information sources - a task that most search engines, at least, do not support. We have developed a system and architecture for light-weight document and information retrieval to enable focused and deep analysis of text, authors and publishers, and the networks that they form between each other through citations and other reference and co-occurrence analysis. While it is both intuitive and obvious that such a system is necessary for in-depth analysis, it is nontrivial as to how to construct such a system out of the many moving pieces, data sources and technologies.

Melody feature is represented in pitch interval based on physics and perception characteristic of music, which averts the effect by gross differences in key or tempo. The Longest matched subsequences (LMS) algorithm is proposed to obtain the most matched portions from two music pieces, according to local similarity between elements. A compound criterion of similarity evaluation is established, with both matched proportion and distance of matched subsequences being considered.

It was designed to retrieve possibly incomplete documents, consisting of several images and semantic information, from a database; more complex data types such as videos can also be included in the framework. The proposed retrieval method relies on image processing, in order to characterize each individual image in a document by their digital content, and information fusion. Once the available images in a query document are characterized, a degree of match, between the query document and each reference document stored in the database, is defined for each attribute (an image feature or a metadata). A Bayesian network is used to recover missing information if need be. Finally, two novel information fusion methods are proposed to combine these degrees of match, in order to rank the reference documents by decreasing relevance for the query. In the first method, the degrees of match are fused by the Bayesian network itself. In the second method, they are fused by the Dezert-Smarandache theory: the second approach lets us model our confidence in each source of information (i.e., each attribute) and take it into account in the fusion process for a better retrieval performance. The proposed methods were applied to two heterogeneous medical databases, a diabetic retinopathy database and a mammography screening database, for computer aided diagnosis. Precisions at five of 0.809 ± 0.158 and 0.821 ± 0.177, respectively, were obtained for these two databases, which is very promising.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2010.2063711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5540296","Diabetic retinopathy;heterogeneous information retrieval;information fusion;mammography;medical databases","Bayesian methods;Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image processing;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging;Spatial databases;Videos","belief networks;image fusion;medical image processing","Bayesian network;CADx system;Dezert-Smarandache theory;case retrieval;computer aided diagnosis;digital content;heterogeneous information fusion;image processing;medical database;query document","Algorithms;Bayes Theorem;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Diabetic Retinopathy;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Diagnostic Imaging;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Mammography;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Radiology Information Systems","18","","39","","20100805","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This conceptual model combines locally applied Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) and agglomerative clustering of particular models into one structure, which is suitable to support information retrieval process and can be combined with standard full-text search. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is one of the approaches which can be applied in process of conceptual modeling in domain of text documents. Extension of classic FCA (binary table data) is one-sided fuzzy version that works with real values in the object-attribute table (document-term matrix in case of vector representation of text documents). In our approach, starting set of documents is decomposed to smaller sets of similar documents with the use of some partitional clustering algorithm. Then one concept lattice is built for every cluster using FCA method and these FCA-based models are combined to hierarchy of concept lattices using agglomerative clustering algorithm. Finally, we define basic details and methods of IR system that combines standard full-text search and conceptual search (using extracted concept hierarchy).","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9109-4; POD:978-1-4244-9108-7","10.1109/SACI.2011.5872999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872999","","Analytical models;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Indexes;Information retrieval;Lattices;Merging","formal concept analysis;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;pattern clustering;semantic Web;text analysis","FCA;agglomerative clustering algorithm;formal concept analysis;hierarchical conceptual model;information retrieval system;knowledge technologies;object attribute table;one sided fuzzy version;semantic Web;text documents","","3","","9","","","19-21 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed an information retrieval technology based approach to compress and balance the training data set.

The proposed Conceptual File Management (CFM) method allows a file to be accessed from multiple folders; furthermore, it keeps the current hierarchical structure with minor changes. CFM reduces the ambiguity and redundancy, therefore the quality of information retrieval is improved. A Conceptual File Manager based on the above-mentioned principle has been developed. Experiments show that it improves the quality of the system in terms of maintaining the structure and retrieving the desired items easier and faster based on users' viewpoints.

Experimental results on classifying audio clips from BBC Sound Effects Library according to both semantic and onomatopoeic labels indicate that the proposed N-gram approach performs better than using only a bag-of-words approach by providing complementary local dynamic information.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8112-5; POD:978-1-4244-8110-1","10.1109/MMSP.2010.5662068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662068","","Acoustics;Conferences;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Semantics;Speech","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing;classification;information retrieval","BBC sound effects library;N-gram model;acoustic topic model framework;acoustic word;audio clip classification;audio information retrieval;onomatopoeic label;unstructured audio signal","","1","","14","","","4-6 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Approaches to align sentences from parallel corpora are generally used to construct translation memories. In this paper, we present, on the one hand, a hybrid approach to align sentences combining different information sources (bilingual lexicon, sentence length and sentence position, semantic similarity), and on the other hand, a Computer-Aided Translation prototype based on a cross-language information retrieval approach. This approach consists in building a database of source and target sentences augmented with grammatical information of words and considering the sentence to translate as a ""query"" to that database. The Computer-Aided Translation prototype has been experimented on a set of examples and the experimental results we obtained are encouraging and outperform the current CAT tools.","2164-7143;21647143","Electronic:978-1-4244-8136-1; POD:978-1-4244-8134-7","10.1109/ISDA.2010.5687173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687173","Computer-Aided Translation;Sentence alignment;cross-language information retrieval;parallel corpora;translation memory","","language translation;query languages","computer aided translation;cross language information retrieval;grammatical information;source database;translation memory","","0","1","12","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At present, patent retrieval is becoming more and more important. Not only because patents are always can an important resource in all kinds of field, but patent retrieval save a great deal of time and funds for corporations and researchers. However, with available methods the precision of retrieval results for patents is not very high. What's more, through analyzed the patent documentations we found that except the literal meanings, there are deeper meanings which can be concluded from the patents. Here we call the deeper meanings as pragmatic information. Therefore we established a patent retrieval system to integrate the pragmatic information with classical information retrieval technique to improve the retrieval accuracy. Some experiments using the proposed method have carried out, and the results show that the precision of patent retrieval based on the pragmatic information is higher than the one without using it.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6899-7; POD:978-1-4244-6896-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2010.5587776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5587776","Patent documents;Patent retrieval;Pragmatic information","Artificial neural networks;Data mining;Information retrieval;Patents;Pragmatics;Semantics;Syntactics","computational linguistics;document handling;information retrieval;natural language processing","Chinese patent retrieval;information retrieval;patent documentations;pragmatic information","","1","","12","","","21-23 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A PIR scheme allows a user to retrieve a data item from an online database while hiding the identity of the item from a database server. In 1995, Chor et al. stated private information retrieval (PIR) problem and proposed k-server solutions which replicate the same database on the k servers. In 1997, Kushilevitz et al. proposed a PIR scheme based on the quadratic-residue assumption using only one server (one database - database replication is not needed). The scheme can simplifies multi-server management and reduce costs. In this paper, we point out that Kushilevitz's PIR scheme will let the user get much more information than he/she should get in one query of the database.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4281-2; POD:978-1-4244-8891-9","10.1109/ICGEC.2010.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715464","private information retrieval;the protection of users' privacy","Complexity theory;Databases;Information retrieval;Patents;Privacy;Security;Servers","data privacy;electronic commerce;information retrieval;replicated databases","Kushilevitz's one-server private information retrieval scheme;PIR problem;PIR scheme;cost reduction;database query;database replication;database server;e-commerce environment;k-server solutions;multiserver management;online database;quadratic-residue assumption;replicated database;user privacy protection","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
