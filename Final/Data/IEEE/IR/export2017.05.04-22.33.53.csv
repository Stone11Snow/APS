A nonstationary latent Dirichlet allocation (NLDA) was established by incorporating a Markov chain to detect the stylistic segments in a heterogeneous document. Each segment corresponds to a particular style and is generated by different word distributions. However, such NLDA is constrained by a fixed number of segments for different lengths of documents. This paper presents a new adaptive segment model (ASM) by adaptively building the topic-based document model with different segment numbers. By incorporating a multinomial hidden variable with Dirichlet prior, the inference procedure of ASM parameters is built through a variational Bayes EM algorithm. In the experiments, the proposed ASM is evaluated for spoken document retrieval using TDT2 corpus.

However, the method of directly encrypting digital goods maybe not work well if buyers and sellers trade with the digital goods in this environment. The reason is that the cloud server could not decide which digital goods contain certain keywords requested by a buyer if the meta data of the encrypted digital goods is not searchable. In this paper, we propose a secure digital goods trading scheme in the cloud computing. Our scheme can efficiently protect keywords privacy for buyers, and make the cloud server to search the keywords on the encrypted digital content to protect the privacy of sellers' digital content.

An analysis of programming skills by gender in secondary grammar schools was made with the help of a web based Informatics Test. After composing an on-line test on the base of the National Curriculum I analysed how effectively can students of different grades answer questions dealing with different subjects. From different towns of Hungary over 60 teachers used the test to see the knowledge level of more than 1000 students having answered these questions. After the evaluation of the test results the correctness of the original presumption emerged. First the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test was used to see if the groups showed standard normal distribution in answering the questions. The means of the correct answers by gender were examined using a Z-test with two parameters and the deviation quotient was to calculated revealing how much gender influences the difference of means. Significance level was 5% through the analysis. Significant divergence by gender was found regarding programming skills showing the hypothesis correct in this two area. Students have to put everything in source code when learning programming. It seems this method is more favourable for boys. Girls have problems finding syntax errors in source code or understand it at all. I looks it would be better to teach girls with different tools using primitive building elements to write programs so when changing the parameters of these building elements no syntax errors would occur.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4272-0; POD:978-1-4244-9043-1","10.1109/UIC-ATC.2010.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5667105","Hungary;programming skills by gender;secondary grammar school","Databases;Educational institutions;Gaussian distribution;Programming profession;Text processing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational institutions;further education;gender issues;grammars;programming;question answering (information retrieval)","Hungarian grammar school students;Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test;Z-test;answer questions;genders;higher education;national curriculum;online test;programming skills;source code;syntax errors;web Informatics Test","","1","","7","","","26-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While complex coordination patterns provide substantial utility through expressive querying, they also exhibit usability problems for users when learning required interaction sequences, recalling past queries, and interpreting visual states. As visual analysis tools grow more sophisticated, there is a growing need to make them more understandable as well. Our long-term goal is to exploit natural language familiarity and literacy to directly facilitate individual and collaborative use of visual analysis tools. In this poster, we present work in progress on an automatically generated query-to-question user interface to translate interactive states during visual analysis into an accompanying visual log of formatted text. Our effort currently focuses on a symmetric and thus relatively simple coordination pattern: cross-filtered views. We describe our current thinking about query-to-question translation in a typical cross-filtered visualization of movies, people, and genres in the Internet Movie Database.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9487-3; POD:978-1-4244-9488-0","10.1109/VAST.2010.5650251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5650251","Coordinated multiple views;cross-filtered queries;interaction states;natural language generation;visual provenance","Data visualization;Encoding;Internet;Motion pictures;Natural languages;Visualization;Weaving","data analysis;data visualisation;information filtering;natural languages;query processing;question answering (information retrieval)","Internet movie database;coordinated multiple views;cross-filtered visualization;interaction sequences;learning;multidimensional data;natural language;query-to-question translation;query-to-question user interface;visual analysis tools;visual exploration;visual log;visual state interpretation","","0","","8","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web 2.0 has undoubtedly made significant impact in enriching the end-user experience and allowing programmers to write more interactive desktop-like applications for the web. However, it has also introduced some new issues for researchers in the field information retrieval and has made the job of information retrieval from web more difficult, time consuming and challenging. Web pages contain lot of clutter besides the original article. To extract the main content several methods have been developed. However, these methods were originally designed based on the traditional model of the web, and would fail to work on web 2.0 content. Due to evident popularity of web 2.0, the volume of the web 2.0 content on the Web will rise sharply in the coming years. In this paper we propose a new solution to this problem, based upon open source components, which will make the job of web 2.0 content extraction more efficient and will reduce the utilization of precious system resources.

A vast amount of information is now accumulated on the Web and becoming increasingly influential in people's decision making. However, the Web contains a proliferation of false and misleading information. Thus, it is essential to study the methodologies and technologies that enable us to judge the credibility of information. It is for this reason that we have developed WISDOM, which organizes information on a given topic through the following three types of analysis: (1) extracting and contrasting important and controversial sentences around the points related to the topic, using semantics-oriented natural language processing (NLP) techniques; (2) identifying and classifying the authorship of each page; and (3) analyzing the appearance of each page, according to, for example, page design and writing style. WISDOM is in a state of continuous development, and in comparison to our previous demonstration at IUCS 2009, the current version of WISDOM is more advanced in the following respects. First, it extracts contrasting statements, in which statements contrasting the topic to other things, e.g., electric vehicles vs. hybrid electric vehicles. Second, it analyzes the expertise of information senders and indicates senders with high expertise with stars. Third, WISDOM analyzes a fresh 120 million Japanese Web pages; these pages are crawled and updated everyday by our crawler.

Our approach, which is based on open-source standard technologies, transforms the raw information at the network level and provides a customized and Web-accessible view. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and early experiences of the visualization techniques and tools deployed for the NoAH project, a large-scale honey pot-based infrastructure. Additionally, we provide a traffic analysis of data collected over a six month period of our infrastructure's operation. During the data collection period, we observed that the number of attackers continually increased as did the volume of traffic they generated. Furthermore, interesting patterns for specific types of traffic have been identified, such as the diurnal cycle of the traffic targeting TCP port 445 (Windows Directory Services), the port that receives the largest volume of attack traffic.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4311-6; POD:978-1-4244-9377-7","10.1109/EC2ND.2010.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5663312","","Availability;Data visualization;Grippers;IP networks;Monitoring;Sensors;Servers","IP networks;Internet;computer network security;data visualisation;information retrieval;public domain software;telecommunication traffic","IP address;NoAH infrastructure;Web-accessible view;information extraction;large-scale honeypot-based infrastructure;open-source standard technology;traffic analysis;visualization technique","","0","","15","","","28-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This task is extremely challenging due to the pronunciation difference between the source and target language. A given proper name can lead to many different transliterations. In the past, research efforts had demonstrated a 30-50% error using top-1 reference for transliteration. This error leads to performance degradation for many applications. In this paper, a novel approach to verify a given proper name transliteration pair using a discrete variant Hidden Markov Model (HMM) alignment is proposed. The state emission probabilities are derived from SMT phrase tables. The proposed method yields an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3.73% on a 300 matched and 1000 unmatched name pairs test set. By comparison, the commonly used SMT framework yields 6.5% EER under the best configuration. The widely used edit distance approach has an EER of 22%.

It measures the time per scan, the reliability of the scanners, and performs a qualitative evaluation of the users' comments. The results indicate that, although most of the evaluated scanners are available already, still very few function reliably enough to be useful for consumers. General guidelines for the improvement of mobile 1D barcode scanners are derived.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7415-8; POD:978-1-4244-7413-4","10.1109/IOT.2010.5678457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5678457","","Hardware;Internet;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Reliability;Software","Internet;information retrieval;mark scanning equipment;mobile computing;mobile handsets","1D barcode scanning;Internet;black and white striped code;consumer product;linear barcodes;mobile phone","","2","","8","","","Nov. 29 2010-Dec. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users are responsible of the information they post in their profile and, in the vast majority of social networks, they can limit the disclosure degree of such data regarding the members of the social network. However, a part from data they provide, other related data can be obtained from users: the relations between them.

Due to the challenge of such data-intensive applications, data compression has become much more important. This paper proposes a data compression method for inverted indices, which combines the bit-level compression method - Huffman coding and a coarse-grained compression method, to achieve a balanced performance in compression ratio and decompression speed. Because an inverted index is only compressed once, the compression speed is not the major measurement for a compression method. The proposed method shows good to 21.61% compression ratio on inverted indices from a commercial search engine. This compression ratio is better than results by other existing compression methods. We also develop an efficient FPGA-based hardware decompression module, which could provide up to 996 MBps input bandwidth for the accelerator system.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8983-1; POD:978-1-4244-8980-0","10.1109/FPT.2010.5681488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5681488","","Bandwidth;Hardware;Huffman coding;Indexes;Query processing;Search engines","Huffman codes;Internet;data compression;field programmable gate arrays;information retrieval;search engines","FPGA-based decompression solution;FPGA-based hardware decompression module;Web search engines;bit-level compression method-Huffman coding;coarse-grained compression method;data compression method;inverted index;reconfigurable computing","","0","","5","","","8-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difference between QA system and the traditional text retrieval lies in the answer extraction module, which realizes the accurate answer extraction. The answer extraction on the basis of pattern matching is an efficient strategy, which focuses on displaying answers through formalized pattern. The most significant goal of the formalized answer extraction on basis of pattern matching strategy is to establish a complete pattern knowledge database. The automatic construction of formalized pattern for answer extraction is the future tendency of formalized extraction. Unfortunately, formalized answer extraction is still less effective than the extraction method based on statistical learning. This paper analyzes the following subjects: 1. Low coverage of questions. 2. Unreliability of pattern tag. 3. Difficulty in the assessment of pattern confidence. 4. Low level of pattern generalization. Based on the above four subjects, this thesis attempts to automatically construct pattern knowledge database through pattern learning and question sorting architecture based on answer types, use reliable pattern tag to process the formalization of pattern and dramatically increase coverage and accuracy. Furthermore, assess the pattern confidence in terms of coverage and accuracy. Finally, it will put forward pattern generalization technology based on the principle of unchanged pattern major elements, which observably enhances the pattern generalizing performance. Experimental results show that the average coverage of this paper reaches 57.2%, the average accuracy reaches 46.2%; major question accuracy is 80.8% and generalization technology increases accuracy nearly 6%. In sum, this paper realizes high extraction accuracy with simple methods.

Sci., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ, USA","2010 IEEE 51st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","20101217","2010","","","61","70","We consider statistical data analysis in the interactive setting. In this setting a trusted curator maintains a database of sensitive information about individual participants, and releases privacy-preserving answers to queries as they arrive. Our primary contribution is a new differentially private multiplicative weights mechanism for answering a large number of interactive counting (or linear) queries that arrive online and may be adaptively chosen. This is the first mechanism with worst-case accuracy guarantees that can answer large numbers of interactive queries and is efficient (in terms of the runtime's dependence on the data universe size). The error is asymptotically optimal in its dependence on the number of participants, and depends only logarithmically on the number of queries being answered. The running time is nearly linear in the size of the data universe. As a further contribution, when we relax the utility requirement and require accuracy only for databases drawn from a rich class of databases, we obtain exponential improvements in running time. Even in this relaxed setting we continue to guarantee privacy for any input database. Only the utility requirement is relaxed. Specifically, we show that when the input database is drawn from a smooth distribution - a distribution that does not place too much weight on any single data item - accuracy remains as above, and the running time becomes poly-logarithmic in the data universe size. The main technical contributions are the application of multiplicative weights techniques to the differential privacy setting, a new privacy analysis for the interactive setting, and a technique for reducing data dimensionality for databases drawn from smooth distributions.","0272-5428;02725428","Electronic:978-0-7695-4244-7; POD:978-1-4244-8525-3","10.1109/FOCS.2010.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5670948","","Accuracy;Data privacy;Databases;Histograms;Noise;Noise measurement;Privacy","data analysis;data privacy;query processing;question answering (information retrieval);statistical analysis","data dimensionality reduction;data universe;differentially private multiplicative weights mechanism;multiplicative weights mechanism;privacy-preserving data analysis;statistical data analysis","","32","","14","","","23-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The semantic relations in the system are automatically acquired from a large collection of Web documents using state-of-the-art knowledge acquisition methods. These methods require only minimal human intervention, so the system can be easily customized to obtain many different kinds of relations and adapted to new target domains. Additionally, we demonstrate the system's usefulnes for innovation support based on analogy and lexical word similarity.

NEPTUNE Canada opened its instrument network and data archive to free and open access by anyone willing to register for an account. Thus, we have embarked on a journey to transform our observatory into an online platform for collaborative, multidisciplinary e-science. Four main areas of Internet-mediated activity characterize e-science: data provision, analysis & visualization, collaboration and publication. Data provision entails making our large and ever expanding data archive accessible and searchable through the Web. To support online analysis & visualization, tools must be developed, which allow scientists to display and manipulate a wide variety of data products derived from measurements gathered by the various instruments attached to the observatory. Virtual collaboration can be fostered by making it easy for groups of geographically or institutionally separated researchers to design experiments, control instruments, share analyses and discuss conclusions within a shared web-based workspace. Publication and dissemination of research findings can be supported by tools that help researchers manage and contribute to both informal outreach (e.g. blogs) and the iterative review and revision cycles required for formal manuscript authoring. E-science promises some tantalizing advantages over traditional approaches. By providing through-the-web access to a large multivariate data archive, researchers are freed from the burdens of data storage and management. Additionally, the archive can simultaneously serve multiple users at multiple institutions in widely separated locations. Community-driven development of analysis routines allows users to visualize the data using both existing and custom-created code. E-science also encourages higher levels of collaboration, allowing resea- chers to form virtual teams able to tackle complex problems, where expertise in a variety of disciplines is required. Finally, by opening new avenues for interaction between researchers and students or members of the general public, e-science can influence both the questions scientists choose to address and the scope of their investigations. Transforming the promise of e-science into reality, however, is fraught with both technical and organizational challenges. The sheer volume of data records (50+ Tb/year) and observation density pose significant challenges for observatory and researcher alike, requiring new data mining approaches to be developed. Evolving and sometimes competing data format standards must be grappled with. Questions of data reliability and security must be answered. New protocols for protecting intellectual property within an open data environment must be defined. Ground rules for providing equitable access to finite shared resources (eg. underwater camera control time) must be defined. Cultural, institutional and motivational barriers to distributed decision-making and virtual team coordination must be overcome. NEPTUNE Canada is working to address the many challenges of e-science through a wide range of possible solutions. To help researchers make more optimal use of our large and growing data archives, we are developing a facility that allows users to upload and run custom data analysis routines on NEPTUNE Canada servers. Code authors will be able to retain privacy of over their routines, or if desired, publish their code for sharing and possible additional development with the larger user community. NEPTUNE Canada is developing other tools in the form of web and mobile applications for data search and subscription, event detection, interactive data plotting and real-time collaborative multi-user device control.

To reduce this cost, we propose reducing the number of times disks have to spin up by grouping together files such that a typical spin-up handles several file accesses. For a typical system, we show that if only 30% of total accesses occur while disks are still spinning, we can conserve 12% of the power cost. We classify files according to directory structure and see access hit rates of up to 66% for a power savings of up to 52% of the power cost of spinning up for every read in easily-separable workloads.","2157-7242;21577242","Electronic:978-1-4244-8912-1; POD:978-1-4244-8913-8","10.1109/PDSW.2010.5668053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5668053","","Indexes;Internet;Mobile communication;Semantics;Servers;Spinning;Support vector machines","information retrieval;power aware computing;storage management","archival storage;directory structure;easily separable workload;file access;power management;semantic data placement;spin up handle;spinning disk","","10","","29","","","15-15 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a practical unsupervised approach to improve user experience when exploring photo collections by using opinions and sentiments expressed in user comments on the uploaded photos. While most existing techniques concentrate on binary (negative or positive) opinion orientation, we use a real-valued scale for modeling opinion and sentiment strengths. We extract two types of sentiments: opinions that relate to the photo quality and general sentiments targeted towards objects depicted on the photo. Our approach combines linguistic features for part of speech tagging, traditional statistical methods for modeling word importance in the photo comment corpora (in a real-valued scale), and a predefined sentiment lexicon for detecting negative and positive opinion orientation. In addition, a semi-automatic photo feature detection method is applied and a set of syntactic patterns is introduced to resolve opinion references. We implemented a prototype system that incorporates the proposed approach and evaluates it on several regions in the World using real data extracted from Flickr.","2157-5525;21575525","Electronic:978-83-60810-27-9; POD:978-1-4244-6432-6","10.1109/IMCSIT.2010.5679726","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5679726","","Blogs;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Frequency measurement;Internet;Motion pictures;Syntactics","Internet;behavioural sciences computing;feature extraction;information retrieval;software prototyping;user modelling","Flickr;Internet services;binary opinion orientation;data extraction;linguistic features;photo collections;photo comment corpora;photo quality;practical unsupervised approach;predefined sentiment lexicon;prototype system;real-valued scale;semiautomatic photo feature detection method;speech tagging;syntactic patterns;traditional statistical methods;user attitudes;user experience;user opinions;word importance modeling","","2","","32","","","18-20 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The majority of researchers for NEPTUNE Canada's 800km cabled ocean observatory are geographically diverse, and it is both expensive and time-consuming to be physically present during instrument deployment. We have developed an economical, scalable web application that allows researchers to interact, collaborate and review video collected during live ROV operations. For over 20 years ocean research vessels have been equipped with satellite uplink capability, allowing researchers on land to participate in observing live dive operations and ocean phenomena. Perhaps the most famous example is the JASON project, a collaboration started in 1989 between Robert Ballard, WHOI and National Geographic Society. There are significant costs associated to host the uplink and downlink, however, and researchers may not be able to easily communicate with the chief scientist on board the ship and with each other. Worse, the video footage may be archived with very little metadata, mission time or easy means of cataloguing and retrieval. These problems were addressed in a uniquely collaborative venture between NEPTUNE Canada, the Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility (CFFS) and Canada's Advanced Research & Innovation Network (CANARIE). In this paper we report on the development of software and infrastructure enabling live video observation, online annotation and archiving of instrument positioning on the NEPTUNE Canada ocean observatory. The paper will detail the software design, infrastructure and quality assurance processes used to deploy this innovative, cost effective solution which successfully addresses the needs of the ocean science and engineering communities.","0197-7385;01977385","Electronic:978-1-4244-4333-8; POD:978-1-4244-4332-1","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5664305","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664305","","High definition video;Marine vehicles;Navigation;Oceans;Real time systems;Sensors;Streaming media","Internet;geographic information systems;groupware;information retrieval systems;marine engineering;software architecture;video databases;video signal processing","Canada;Canada's Advanced Research & Innovation Network;Canadian Scientific Submersible Facility;NEPTUNE;ROV operation;instrument positioning;metadata;ocean observatory;quality assurance process;software design;video acquisition;video analysis;video annotation;video archiving","","2","","18","","","20-23 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these websites are accessible only through devices equipped with a screen and a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Furthermore, these devices need a network connection to access the internet. With the development of a Vocal User Interface (VUI), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and VoIP communication, we present in this article a system which allows browsing the Internet by using a standard phone only. The system works like an intelligent call routing mechanism that accepts vocal commands as input from the user, translates those commands into HTTP requests, sends them to the web server which processes it and finally returns the HTTP response translated back to the user in a vocally manner. To reach this goal the system implements Content Extraction (CE) algorithms over web content in order to analyze, classify and return relevant parts of web pages to the user. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the system. Our results show that the system offers a reliable and efficient web browsing experience in more than 80% of the websites tested.

Aiming at overcoming this type of pitfalls, this paper will study and propose a comprehensive model and framework that can combine the automatic web data analysis and extraction with the user interaction-based semi-supervised web data extraction. The new model and framework has a good trade-off between the automatic generation of extraction rules and their expression capability towards the accurate information extraction.

Rather than comparing house number, street, city and province individually, we use a string similarity measurement to perform address comparison, which enables us to combine the edit distance with the vector space model to search for potentially matching address candidates by associating them with a similarity matching score. Upon evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques, we introduce an algorithm for effective address matching, called Term-Weighted Dissimilarity, which combines edit distance similarity with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting. We implement this algorithm in software and show its effectiveness via a real application for address matching and correction based on Canada Post's address standard.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4237-9; POD:978-1-4244-8538-3","10.1109/3PGCIC.2010.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5662779","Address matching;TF-IDF weight;address correction;address standardization;edit distance;string similarity;vector space model","","geographic information systems;information retrieval;string matching;text analysis","address capturing process;address comparison;address management;address matching;address standards;edit distance;string similarity measurement;term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting;term-weighted dissimilarity;vector space model","","1","","30","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A faceted navigation system allows a user to search for one's desired information in an exploratory way, thereby enabling the user to browse a set of XML data without using specialized query languages such as XPath and XQuery. However, designing a faceted navigation interface for XML data is not straightforward due to the tree and flexible, tree-like nature of XML. In this work, we attempt to design and implement a dedicated faceted navigation system for QCDml on top of an XML database. The interface is designed by taking the domain experts' usability into account. We also care about the system's performance. In general, the process of faceted navigation is computationally expensive because of the need for aggregate computation of each available facets. In order to alleviate this, we make use of a relational database system as the engine to speed up the aggregate computation. We finally demonstrate the implemented faceted navigation system, which has been made available on the Web.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4237-9; POD:978-1-4244-8538-3","10.1109/3PGCIC.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5664692","ILDG;QCDml;XML;faceted navigation;metadata","","Internet;XML;grid computing;information retrieval;query languages;relational databases","ILDG;QCDml ensemble XML data;Web;XML database;XML-based metadata format;XPath;XQuery;faceted navigation system;international lattice data grid;query languages;relational database system","","0","","13","","","4-6 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional centralized data management technologies are limited in the aspects of efficiency, throughout and maintenance cost. MapReduce framework is a recent trend to process large-scale data. It is implemented on clusters built by numbers of business machines, to conquer limitations mentioned above by parallel computation. In this paper, we provide a SLCA-based keyword search implementation for large-scale XML data sets on a MapReduce cluster.

Therefore, labels assigned to documents by only one human editor in some existing labeled document sets may be of limited use and may prove problematic for training a classifier or evaluating categorization algorithms.

Thus, in 1990's the research on AR has been applied for other language, such as Arabic, Chinese, Hindi and Norwegian. There are however limited or no effort in dealing with Malay text. The AR systems for one language cannot be simply adapted to use in other languages. This is due to the fact that different languages have different set of rules relating to syntax and semantic to respective language. This paper proposed a model for resolving anaphora phenomena in Malay text. The model consists of three elements consisting of anaphora resolution process, syntactic knowledge process and semantic-world knowledge process.

To reduce human effort, Automated Insight Externalization (AIE) is desired. Most existing IE approaches achieve automation by capturing events (e.g., clicks and key presses) or actions (e.g., panning and zooming). In this paper, we propose a novel AIE approach named Click2Annotate. It allows semi-automatic insight annotation that captures low-level analytics task results (e.g., clusters and outliers), which have higher semantic richness and abstraction levels than actions and events. Click2Annotate has two significant benefits. First, it reduces human effort required in IE and generates annotations easy to understand. Second, the rich semantic information encoded in the annotations enables various insight management activities, such as insight browsing and insight retrieval. We present a formal user study that proved this first benefit. We also illustrate the second benefit by presenting the novel insight management activities we developed based on Click2Annotate, namely scented insight browsing and faceted insight search.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9487-3; POD:978-1-4244-9488-0","10.1109/VAST.2010.5652885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5652885","Annotation;Decision Making;Insight Management;Multidimensional Visualization;Visual Analytics","Automation;Book reviews;Compounds;Context;Mice;Prototypes;Semantics","data mining;data visualisation;decision making;information retrieval;problem solving;user interfaces","Click2Annotate;decision making;insight browsing;insight externalization;insight management activity;insight retrieval;problem solving","","6","1","18","","","25-26 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
