It allows certain types of data processing operations to be performed directly on the storage nodes of modern parallel filesystems, near the data they manage. This is possible by exploiting the underutilized processor and memory resources of storage nodes that are implemented using general purpose servers and operating systems. In this paper, we present a novel user-space implementation of Active Storage for Lustre, and compare it to the traditional kernel-based implementation. Based on microbenchmark and application level evaluation, we show that both approaches can reduce the network traffic, and take advantage of the extra computing capacity offered by the storage nodes at the same time. However, our user-space approach has proved to be faster, more flexible, portable, and readily deployable than the kernel-space version.","","CD-ROM:978-1-59593-764-3; POD:978-1-59593-764-3","10.1145/1362622.1362660","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5348819","","Bandwidth;Concurrent computing;Costs;Drives;Environmental management;File systems;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Operating systems;Permission","","","","25","","28","","","10-16 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from other methods which are based on taxonomy or search engine in Internet, our method uses snippets from Wikipedia1 to calculate the semantic similarity between words by using cosine similarity and TF-IDF. Also, the stemmer algorithm and stop words are used in preprocessing the snippets from Wikipedia. We set different threshold to evaluate our results in order to decrease the interference from noise and redundancy. Our method was empirically evaluated using Rubenstein-Good enough benchmark dataset. It gives higher correlation value (with 0.615) than some existing methods.

Considering the size and incoherent available information in the Internet has made the use of search engines obvious and necessary. Since search engines pay less attention to the linguistics and content features of documents in different languages and cultures, just uses the pages genuine content similarities, to provide the needs of users, will not be that successful. Regarding the fact, search engines for more effective retrieval and clustering Web pages should consider the linguistics, contents, characteristics and properties of languages. More over they should develop ways to eliminate the complexity of languages as well as using linguistic features to cluster Web pages more effective. In this paper a method for clustering and ranking Web pages in Persian language including its contents and linguistic properties has been developed. Clustering scheme provided based on STC algorithm is one of the best algorithms in clustering text documents. The main idea of this method includes some pre-processing phase to overcome the complexity of linguistic feature in Persian language. Open Source tools are available for these pre-processing steps and there is no need to implement them, simply some changes in their modules may be needed. Some of these pre-processing steps are extract phrases, parse sentences, remove stop words and also add neighbor pages pointed terms to the collection of phrases. All steps in this method have a linear behavior in time order and can apply to the large data sets. This means the proposed method in our research is scalable for mass document sources as the Web.","","POD:978-1-4244-5244-6","10.1109/ICCIT.2009.295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368875","Clustering;Persian Web;STC Algorithm","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Information retrieval;Information technology;Internet;Search engines;Telecommunication computing;Web pages","natural language processing;pattern clustering;search engines;text analysis","Persian language;STC algorithm;Web pages clustering;mass document source;open source tools;search engines;text document clustering","","0","","7","","","24-26 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The terms used in log queries can provide a better choice of features, from the user's point of view, for summarizing the Web pages that were clicked from these queries. Therefore, the associated queries, reverse queries, Webpage title and keyword phrases are combined with the cluster centers to attain high-quality expansion terms for new queries.

In this paper, we propose a lightweight scheme to protect in presence of node failure and compromising. Our scheme consists of robust data head formation and secure data aggregation by taking advantages of both homomorphic secret sharing and homomorphic encryption.

Besides other characteristics, storage capabilities of individual sensor nodes have to be considered as this might be very small compared to the collected sensor data. The temporal availability of sink nodes or the importance of collected data are not equal for all nodes and, therefore, demand storage of the generated data locally for later retrieval. Furthermore, data items (detected events) may be collected at different rates, which can lead to hotspot-like storage requirements. In this paper, we introduce a data-centric cooperative storage mechanism for wireless senor networks. Our approach is based on Virtual Cord Protocol (VCP), a virtual relative position based efficient routing protocol that also provides means for data management, e.g. insert, get, delete, and replicate, as known from typical Distributed Hash Table (DHT) services. Data items are distributed deterministically over several nodes in the same vicinity. Thus, storing and retrieving data items typically require communication with local nodes. To maintain information about stored information, we use a bloom filter to track the nodes that are storing particular items.","2325-5315;23255315","POD:978-1-4244-4640-7","10.1109/ISABEL.2009.5373619","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373619","","Availability;Batteries;Event detection;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Routing protocols;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","bloom filter;data-centric cooperative storage;distributed hash table services;routing protocol;sensor nodes;sink nodes;virtual cord protocol;wireless sensor network","","2","","19","","","24-27 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve the problem, we propose a collaborative learning model using a voting mechanism. Student are divided into small groups. They practice programming individually. A COOP point is voted to reward group members who have offered convincing opinions to others. COOP points are used as a measure of a student contribution to group learning.

Identification cues such as prosody, pronunciation, and idiolect have been successfully investigated. Semantic speaker recognition, such as identifying people by the topics they frequently talk about, has not found an equal amount of attention. However, it is a promising approach, especially for broadcast data and multimedia archives, where prominent speakers can be expected to often talk about their specific subjects. This paper reports on our experiments with topic-based speaker recognition on German parliamentary speeches. Text transcripts of speeches of federal ministers were used to train speaker models based on word frequencies. For recognition, these models were applied to automatic speech recognition transcripts of parliamentary speeches and could identify the correct speaker surprisingly well, with an EER of 13.8%. Fusing this approach with a classical GMM-UBM system (with EER 14.3%) yields an improved EER of 8.6%.","","POD:978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5372907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5372907","","Acoustic testing;Automatic speech recognition;Cepstral analysis;Digital multimedia broadcasting;Frequency;Information retrieval;Loudspeakers;Multimedia communication;Speaker recognition;Training data","speaker recognition","German parliamentary speeches;broadcast data;classical spectral-cepstral-feature-based approaches;idiolect;multimedia archives;pronunciation;prosody;semantic speaker recognition;text transcripts;topic-based speaker recognition","","1","","14","","","Nov. 13 2009-Dec. 17 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The search users are faced with too many irrelevant results. In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel search system that effectively searches the target documents by the search query whose definition is based on the document type, search terms and the semantic relationship between the search terms and the target documents.

In this paper, a multi-baseline InSAR data fusion method based on iterative and maximum-likelihood methods is proposed to combine the information from different baselines and obtain more accurate digital elevation model (DEM) compared with single baseline.

RDBMS (relational database management systems) is the most efficient and reliable data structure in terms of storage and retrieval. One of the ways is to store ontologies in RDBMS. OWL is used to represent ontologies. To store OWL documents in RDBMS multiple techniques have been proposed, but they either deal with single ontology or they do not store complete semantics expressed in OWL ontologies which compromise the correct retrieval of the data. Some of the techniques are not really scalable, as the ontology is dynamic and extensible where as the RDBMS schema is not dynamically extensible. So, there is a need to preserve the dynamic OWL documents in the Relational structure in such a way that no data or relationship is lost and advantages of RDBMS are also gained. This paper addresses the issue of storing multiple OWL ontologies in an RDBMS in a way that is correct, consistent, scalable and efficient to retrieve. A relational schema, with the name of OntRel, has been proposed along with a set of rules to populate database from OWL documents. OntRel has been implemented and tested and available as on the web for open use. Finally, we have compared the Load time, Query performance and completeness of OntRel with other indexing techniques using Lehigh University Benchmark (LUBM) and University Ontology Benchmark (UOBM).","","POD:978-1-4244-5330-6","10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368643","OWL to RDBMS mapping;Ontology Indexing;Ontology Persistent model;Rule based ontology storage","Benchmark testing;Crawlers;Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Management information systems;OWL;Ontologies;Relational databases;Search engines;Semantic Web","data structures;indexing;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);relational databases","Lehigh University Benchmark;OWL documents;OWL-DL ontologies;OntRel;University Ontology Benchmark;data structure;information retrieval;ontology indexer;relational database management systems;relational structure;semantic based information system","","2","","20","","","4-7 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And then through comparison and analysis, the optimal goods distribution is determined when the utility ratio of AS/RS is a^0/0. Furthermore, on the basis of comprehensively considering the operation time of a storage or retrieval and the traveling distance of stackers, a storage assignment method which can realize the optimal goods distribution is presented, the usability and validity of the method are verified by an example.

Content-based image retrieval techniques have shown great potential, yet commonly employed approaches like query-by-example are only of limited usefulness. An interesting alternative is provided by systems that allow visual exploration of an image dataset through a browsing interface. In these methods the complete database, or parts thereof, is visualised through application of dimensionality reduction techniques, clustered visualisations or display of a graph structure. Once visualised, it should then be possible to browse through the collection in an interactive, intuitive and efficient way. In this paper we present various browsing techniques that can be employed for this purpose. Browsing can be achieved in several ways. We can distinguish between horizontal browsing which works on images of the visualisation plane, and includes operations such as panning, zooming, magnification and scaling, and vertical browsing which allows navigation to a different level of a hierarchically organised visualisation. Furthermore, browsing can also be accomplished by taking into account time stamp information, hence enabling temporal browsing. We conclude, highlighting the need for objective evaluation and benchmarking of browsing system and see one of the next research challenges in the development of effective image browsing tools for mobile devices.","","POD:978-1-4244-5330-6","10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368671","browsing;content-based image retrieval;image database navigation;image databases","Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Navigation;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Visual databases;Visualization","content-based retrieval;graph theory;image retrieval;visual databases","browsing interface;content-based image retrieval;dimensionality reduction techniques;graph structure;image browsing tools;image collections;image databases;mobile devices;temporal browsing;time stamp information","","8","","46","","","4-7 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we discussed different HH-to-VV polarisation models' performance in retrieving wind speed by CMOD5 from Radarsat2 image mode data. Image data used in this paper was taken in south of China, Hainan Island. One image was taken on condition of low wind speed while another was taken on condition of moderate wind speed. After retrieving wind speed using CMOD5 model, we compared inversion results to observation results under low and moderate wind speed conditions (the observed wind speed is 3.4m/s and 8.7m/s). In conclusion, it is shown that three polarisation models can be applicable by acceptable error standard under different conditions. This study just gives a preliminary understanding of HH-to-VV polarisation models' performance under different wind speed conditions.","","POD:978-1-4244-2731-4","10.1109/APSAR.2009.5374106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374106","CMOD5;NRCS;polarisation model","Decision support systems;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Polarization;Wind speed","polarisation;radar cross-sections;radar imaging;synthetic aperture radar;wind","CMOD5 model;HH-polarized SAR images;HH-to-VV polarisation models;Hainan Island;Radarsat2 image mode data;normalized radar cross section;south China;wind speed","","0","","10","","","26-30 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address cases where search term(s) of interest (queries) are acoustic examples. This is provided either by identifying a region of interest in a speech stream or by speaking the query term. Queries often relate to named-entities and foreign words, which typically have poor coverage in the vocabulary of large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) systems. Throughout this paper, we focus on query-by-example search for such out-of-vocabulary (OOV) query terms. We build upon a finite state transducer (FST) based search and indexing system to address the query by example search for OOV terms by representing both the query and the index as phonetic lattices from the output of an LVCSR system. We provide results comparing different representations and generation mechanisms for both queries and indexes built with word and combined word and subword units. We also present a two-pass method which uses query-by-example search using the best hit identified in an initial pass to augment the STD search results. The results demonstrate that query-by-example search can yield a significantly better performance, measured using actual term-weighted value (ATWV), of 0.479 when compared to a baseline ATWV of 0.325 that uses reference pronunciations for OOVs. Further improvements can be obtained with the proposed two pass approach and filtering using the expected unigram counts from the LVCSR system's lexicon.","","POD:978-1-4244-5478-5","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373341","","Acoustic signal detection;Indexing;Information retrieval;Lattices;Music information retrieval;Natural languages;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Transducers;Vocabulary","indexing;query processing;speech processing;speech recognition;vocabulary","OOV terms;actual term-weighted value;finite state transducer;foreign words;indexing system;large vocabulary continuous speech recognition systems;named-entities;open vocabulary search;out-of-vocabulary query terms;phonetic lattices;query-by-example search;query-by-example spoken term detection;reference pronunciations;speech content;speech stream;spoken term detection technology","","28","5","19","","","Nov. 13 2009-Dec. 17 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A TC system can automatically assign a document with the most suitable category, but the reason for such an assignment is usually unknown by users. To make the TC system be interpretable, it is necessary to select a group of keywords, or termed a keyword combination, to describe each text category. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, keyword combination extraction based on ant colony optimization (KCEACO), to search the optimal keyword combination of a target category. By extending the traditional feature selection techniques, an evaluation function is designed for evaluating a keyword combination. This function takes into account the relationships among different keywords.

In this paper, a text detection method based on sparse representation classification with discrimination dictionaries is presented, which can detect text with different sizes, fonts and colors. The propose method detects edge information using Sobel operator and a sliding window scans the edges into patches to facilitate sparse representation process. Then the roughly text area is detected by sparse representation classification based on discrimination dictionaries. Finally, a projection profile analysis is used to refine the detected text areas. The detection performance of our approach is tested using a set of video frames taken from MPEG-7 video test set.","","POD:978-0-7695-3865-5","10.1109/ISCID.2009.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370396","discrimination dictionary;sparse representation;text detection","Computational intelligence;Data mining;Dictionaries;Educational institutions;Image edge detection;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Testing","edge detection;image classification;image representation;information retrieval;text analysis;video signal processing","MPEG-7 video test set;Sobel operator;discrimination dictionaries;edge detection;image text detection;projection profile analysis;sliding window;sparse representation classification;text information retrieval;video frames","","1","","11","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the database of Web of science we comparatively analyzed the outputs of the scientific papers, indexed by science citation index, between 31 provincial cities of China in 10 disciplines of natural science during 2005-2007. The paper quantities for each city as well as the whole country were steadily growing at this stage. The political center Beijing and the economic center Shanghai shared 27.3% and 13.2% of all scientific papers published by these cities, respectively. In contrast, each of the ranked last 13 cities had only a share of lower than 1%. Our data indicated that there were big discrepancies between the provincial cities of China for the development of the disciplines investigated.","2155-1456;21551456","POD:978-0-7695-3876-1","10.1109/ICIII.2009.461","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5369732","Scientific paper;discipline development;provincial cities of China;science citation index","Citation analysis;Cities and towns;Databases;Frequency estimation;Indexes;Information management;Information retrieval;Innovation management;Paper technology;Power generation economics","Internet;citation analysis;socio-economic effects","China;Web of science;database;discipline development discrepancy analysis;economic center Shanghai;political center Beijing;science citation index;scientific paper","","0","","8","","","26-27 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Audio classification serves as the fundamental step towards it. Accuracy in classifying data relies on the strength of the features and on the efficacy of classification scheme. In this work, we have focused on the features only. We have restricted ourselves further in the time domain based low level features. Zero crossing rate (ZCR) and shot time energy (STE) are the most widely used features in this category. We have tried to develop the features reflecting the quasi-periodic pattern of the signal by studying the occurrence pattern of ZCR and STE. Co-occurrence matrix for ZCR and STE are formed and features are computed from that to parameterize the signal. For classification, simple k-means clustering is followed and experimental result indicates that proposed features perform better than the traditional feature derived from ZCR and STE.","","POD:978-0-7695-3859-4","10.1109/IITA.2009.427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370569","STE occurrence pattern;Speech/music classification;ZCR occurrence pattern;audio features","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feature extraction;Frequency domain analysis;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Psychoacoustic models;Psychology;Speech","audio signal processing;matrix algebra;speech processing","STE;ZCR;co-occurrence matrix;content-based audio retrieval;k-means clustering;music classification;quasi-periodic pattern;shot time energy;speech classification;time domain;zero crossing rate","","4","","28","","","21-22 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Positive and negative opinions represented in review documents are helpful information for governments to improve their services, for companies to market their products, and for customers to purchase their commodities. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that employs finer granularity clustering for opinions extraction and clustering for the calculation of their sentiment orientation of opinions. The experimental result shows that the approach is qualitatively quite useful when used to analyze the netizens' opinions to hot topics from some Websites.","","POD:978-0-7695-3865-5","10.1109/ISCID.2009.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370398","Semantic Orientation;Text mining;finer granularity clustering;opinion mining","Blogs;Computational intelligence;Computer science;Consumer electronics;Data mining;Design engineering;Government;Humans;Information retrieval;Natural languages","Web sites;data mining;text analysis","discussion groups;finer granularity clustering;forums;online review Websites;opinion mining;opinion-rich resources;personal blogs","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
