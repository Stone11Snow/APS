Inner structural analyses induce constitutions of person, location and organization name from the point of linguistics. However inner structural rules for named entities only provide necessary conditions for a sequence of Chinese characters being an entity name but not sufficient. Whether a string being a proper name or not is also determined by its contextual information or sometimes common sense. We build Chinese NER system based on supervised machine learning using features induced from simple inner structure and contextual information. We compare some NER approaches. The experimental results indicate complicated cases of various NER strategies. Then this paper turns to explore contextual features of named entities on large scale corpus, seeking for contextual evidence for different strategies of NER and mark words giving clues to the occurrence of NE. Finally, we apply some conclusions to improve NER system by enriching features in model and enhance the performance distinctly.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2780-2; POD:978-1-4244-2779-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906794","Named entity recognition;conditional random fields;contextual features;recognition model","Constitution;Context modeling;Data mining;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Natural languages;Predictive models","learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;natural language processing;text analysis","Chinese NER system;Chinese character;Chinese named entity recognition;inner structural analysis;linguistics;supervised machine learning","","0","","10","","","19-22 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The numerical weather prediction community (NWP) has developed and utilized OSSEs to understand the impact of instrument designs and new measurements on numerical forecasts over the last 40 years. Now, there is a growing interest in applying OSSEs as a mechanism for systematic analysis and science evaluation for future observations of interest to the Earth science community. Examples include precise measurements of earth surface deformation, ice dynamics, ecosystem structure, and atmospheric chemistry.

The difference between text database and XML database results in three new challenges: (1) Identify the user search intention, i.e. identify the XML node types that user wants to search for and search via. (2) Resolve keyword ambiguity problems: a keyword can appear as both a tag name and a text value of some node; a keyword can appear as the text values of different XML node types and carry different meanings. (3) As the search results are sub-trees of the XML document, new scoring function is needed to estimate its relevance to a given query. However, existing methods cannot resolve these challenges, thus return low result quality in term of query relevance. In this paper, we propose an IR-style approach which basically utilizes the statistics of underlying XML data to address these challenges. We first propose specific guidelines that a search engine should meet in both search intention identification and relevance oriented ranking for search results. Then based on these guidelines, we design novel formulae to identify the search for nodes and search via nodes of a query, and present a novel XML TF*IDF ranking strategy to rank the individual matches of all possible search intentions. Lastly, the proposed techniques are implemented in an XML keyword search engine called XReal, and extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our approach.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:978-1-4244-3422-0","10.1109/ICDE.2009.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812431","XML;keyword;ranking;search","Data engineering;Databases;Guidelines;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Optical computing;Search engines;Statistics;Web search;XML","XML;database management systems;search engines","XML database;XML document;XReal;effective XML keyword search engine;information retrieval style keyword search;keyword ambiguity problems;relevance oriented ranking;scoring function;search intention identification;text database;user search intention","","35","1","25","","","March 29 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new shape descriptor for 3D model retrieval. A shape descriptor of 3D model requires a model normalization in order to be invariant to translation, rotation, and scale for its model. Our method is based on principal component analysis (PCA) for normalizing all the models. The shape descriptor is using a histogram of 2D images sliced along the x-, y-, and z-coordinates for measuring the similarity in 3D models. Sliced shapes for a 3D model involve a hundred planes to orthogonalize with the x-y-, and z-coordinates, respectively. Therefore, sliced shape is the 2D plane images created by intersecting at between 3D model and the planes. Our approach is to compute the slices of 3D model for the x-y-, and z-coordinates, respectively and to set by the principal axis based on principal component analysis (PCA) in order to match the 3D model between the given query and the database. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the previous approaches. We demonstrate the proposed 3D retrieval system with an intermediate example at each step.","0098-3063;00983063","","10.1109/TCE.2009.4814441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4814441","3D model retrieval;A query;a descriptor;sliced shape image","Animation;Design automation;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexes;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Principal component analysis;Shape measurement","image matching;image retrieval;principal component analysis","2D plane images;3D database;3D model retrieval;matching shape;model normalization;principal component analysis;shape descriptor;sliced image histogram","","5","","16","","","February 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They play important role in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) because most users' requests have been found to have NEs, and majority of out-of-vocabulary terms are NEs. Therefore, missing their translations has a significant impact to the retrieval effectiveness. In this paper, we examined the effect of high quality translations of NEs in event driven information exploration, where the existence of NEs is even more common. With the focus on the effect of NE translations obtained by using information extraction (IE) techniques, we conducted several experiments using TDT test collections. Our results demonstrate that NEs and their translations play critical roles in improving CLIR effectiveness, and it makes positive impact in CLIR to use high quality translations of NEs obtained by IE techniques.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2780-2; POD:978-1-4244-2779-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906770","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906770","Named entity;cross-language information exploration","Data mining;Dictionaries;Helium;Humans;Information analysis;Information management;Information retrieval;Radiofrequency interference;Testing;USA Councils","information retrieval;language translation;natural language processing","TDT test collections;cross-language information exploration;cross-language information retrieval;human languages;information extraction techniques;named entities translations","","2","","19","","","19-22 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new challenging issue along the same direction is IR-styled m-keyword query processing in a RDBMS framework over an open-ended relational data stream. The capability of supporting m-keyword queries over a relational data stream makes it possible for users to monitor events, that are implicitly interrelated, over a relational data stream in a timely manner. In brief, the problem is to find all connected trees whose size is less than or equal to a user-given threshold in terms of number of nodes for a m-keyword query, {k<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub>, middot middot middot , k<sub>m</sub>}, over a relational data stream on a database schema GS. The difficulty of the problem is related to the number of costly joins to be processed over time, which is affected by the parameters such as the number of keywords (m), the maximum size of connected trees (Tmax), as well as the complexity of the database schema when it is viewed as a schema graph (G<sub>S</sub>). In this paper, we propose a new demand-driven approach to process such a query over a high speed data stream. We show that we can significantly reduce the number of intermediate results when processing joins over a data stream, and therefore can achieve high efficiency.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:978-1-4244-3422-0","10.1109/ICDE.2009.200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812500","relational database stream","Costs;Data engineering;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Monitoring;Product design;Query processing;Relational databases;Tree graphs","computational complexity;graph theory;query processing;relational databases","IR-styled m-keyword query processing;RDBMS framework;database techniques;information retrieval;open-ended relational data stream;scalable keyword search;schema graph","","2","","18","","","March 29 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Semantic caching enhances the performance of normal caching by locally answering the partially overlapped queries. Query processing (generation of probe and remainder query from the incoming queries) and cache management need to be addressed in its totality to really enjoy these benefits. That is, there is a need of correct, complete and efficient algorithms to process incoming queries and to manage semantic and data cache. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of query processing. We have observed that the algorithm proposed by Q. Ren and his colleagues has some inefficiencies and redundancies. To overcome these inefficiencies and redundancies, we have proposed an algorithm for query matching with hierarchal stored query semantics. Proposed algorithm performs matching of stored semantics in cache with semantics of incoming query. It also has capability to generate amending query efficiently and rejects incorrect queries at initial level. Comparison of proposed algorithm is made with existing algorithm. Complexity of proposed query matching algorithm is O(n) which is smaller then the existing which have O(2n-1), n is number of attributes in a relation. Also, the proposed algorithm is capable to stop the useless processing as was done in the previous algorithms.","","POD:978-1-4244-3313-1","10.1109/IC4.2009.4909246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4909246","Algorithms;Query matching;Query processing;Relational Databases;Semantic Caching","Database systems;Delay;Distributed computing;Distributed databases;Information retrieval;Probes;Query processing;Relational databases;XML","cache storage;query processing;relational databases","cache management;data access latency;hierarchal stored query semantics;query matching algorithm;query processing;relational data semantic cache","","2","","18","","","17-18 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The transmittance values were measured in spectral region from 350 nm to 1050 nm at the earth's surface. The well known Beer-Lambert law was used in this study to retrieve AOT values from the measured transmittance value. The concentrations of particulate matter of less than 2.5 micron (PM2.5) were measured simultaneously with the measurements of the transmittance data. The station locations of the PM2.5 measurements were detemined using a handheld GPS. Three interpolation techniques, namely Kriging Interpolation, Inverse Distance Interpolation and Natural Neighbour Interpolation, were used for mapping the PM2.5 concentration in this study. The accuracies of the three interpolation techniques were determined in this study in order to select the most suitable technique for mapping the air pollution concentration over Penang Island, Malaysia. The results of the analysis indicated that the AOT values were linearly correlated with the PM2.5 readings. AOT and PM10 maps were generated using an interpolation technique (Kriging) based on the measured data. Basically, both PM2.5 and AOT maps agree reasonably well over Penang Island, Malaysia.

SAW has many unique advantages over possible competing technologies, including the following characteristics: passive, radiation hard, operable over wide temperature ranges, small, rugged, inexpensive, and identifiable. In a multi-sensory environment, it is necessary both to identify the sensor and to retrieve the sensed information. The OFC SAW technology approach has been funded by NASA for possible inclusion in ground, space flight, and space exploration sensor applications. The purpose of this paper is to present the concept of encoding SAW-based sensors for use in a multiple-sensor environment. The emphasis will be on orthogonal frequency coded (OFC) devices overlaid with a form of time division multiplexing (TDM). It will be shown that in addition to the benefits of OFC such as enhanced processing gain and lower interrogation power spectral density (PSD), the TDM allows for a decrease in overlapping energy and therefore a decrease in intersensory collisions which are shown to cause peak ambiguity. This approach should be applicable to many different SAW-based sensors (such as temperature, pressure, liquid, gas, etc.), as well as allow for proper IDing. Measured device results are presented and compared with coupling of modes (COM) model predictions to demonstrate performance. This paper will discuss the use of SAW OFC in a temperature sensor application. Devices are then used in computer-simulated transceiver design, and the results of a prototype sensor system are discussed.","2374-0221;23740221","POD:978-1-4244-3337-7","10.1109/RFID.2009.4911213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4911213","","Information retrieval;Land surface temperature;Radiofrequency identification;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Space technology;Spread spectrum communication;Surface acoustic waves;Temperature sensors;Time division multiplexing;Wireless sensor networks","orthogonal codes;radiofrequency identification;spread spectrum communication;surface acoustic wave sensors;temperature sensors;time division multiplexing;transceivers","SAW based RFID sensors;computer-simulated transceiver design;coupling of modes model;ground applications;multi-sensory environment;orthogonal frequency coded devices;power spectral density;space exploration sensor applications;space flight applications;spread spectrum OFC technology;spread spectrum TDM technology;surface acoustic wave sensors;temperature sensor application;time division multiplexing","","12","","16","","","27-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The non-parametric KDE technique allows reliable characterization of a diverse set of shapes and yields descriptors which remain relatively insensitive to small shape perturbations and mesh resolution. Density-based characterization also induces a permutation property which can be used to guarantee invariance at the shape matching stage. As proven by extensive retrieval experiments on several 3D databases, our framework provides state-of-the-art discrimination over a broad and heterogeneous set of shape categories.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4760150","Curve;Feature evaluation and selection;Feature representation;Invariants;Nonparametric statistics;Retrieval models;Shape;and object representations;solid;surface","Application software;Content based retrieval;Design automation;Gaussian processes;Information retrieval;Kernel;Probability density function;Shape;Spatial databases;Statistics","Gaussian processes;edge detection;image matching;image retrieval;transforms","3D databases;3D model retrieval;Gauss transform;content-based retrieval;kernel density estimation;sampled multivariate probability density functions;shape descriptors;shape matching","1","54","","44","","20090123","June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although this topic has been previously studied, the existing solution may sometimes produce k points that appear in an arbitrarily tiny cluster, and therefore, fail to be representative. Motivated by this, we propose a new definition of representative skyline that minimizes the distance between a non-representative skyline point and its nearest representative. We also study algorithms for computing distance-based representative skylines. In 2D space, there is a dynamic programming algorithm that guarantees the optimal solution. For dimensionality at least 3, we prove that the problem is NP-hard, and give a 2-approximate polynomial time algorithm. Using a multidimensional access method, our algorithm can directly report the representative skyline, without retrieving the full skyline. We show that our representative skyline not only better captures the contour of the entire skyline than the previous method, but also can be computed much faster.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:978-1-4244-3422-0","10.1109/ICDE.2009.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4812463","","Clustering algorithms;Data engineering;Databases;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Polynomials;Web server","computational complexity;dynamic programming;information retrieval;minimisation","NP-hard problem;arbitrarily tiny cluster;distance minimization;distance-based representative skyline computing;dynamic programming algorithm;multidimensional access method;polynomial time algorithm;skyline retrieval","","40","","27","","","March 29 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Historical data about past decisions can be analyzed to try to discover rules to help in defining such ranking. Moreover, samples have a temporal dynamics. To exploit this possibly useful information, here we propose a method that incrementally builds a committee of classifiers (experts), each one trained on the newer chunks of samples. The prediction of the committee is obtained as a combination of the rankings proposed by the experts which are ldquocloserrdquo to the data to rank.

To find the number of data points around another point, region queries are adopted. Region queries are the most expensive construct in density based algorithm, so it should be optimized to enhance the performance of density based clustering algorithms specially on large data sets. Finding the optimum set of region queries to cover all the data points has been proven to be NP-complete. This optimum set is called the skeletal points of a data set. In this paper, we proposed a generic algorithms which fires region queries at most 6 times the optimum number of region queries (has 6 as approximation factor). Also, we have extend this generic algorithm to create a DBSCAN (the most wellknown density based algorithm) derivative, named ADBSCAN.

In this study, we would like to check whether the wind speed had only minimal effect on the sea surface temperature, as was assumed in the prior literature. A new algorithm which included the term of SSE in the function of wind speed was established. The new algorithm was compared with the day split multichannel (MCSST) algorithm.

The algorithm coefficients of MCSST were retrieved by regression analysis with large amount of SST in-situ data.

A large chunk of users' searching/browsing patterns are centered around people present in the video. Doing it at scale in videos remains hard due to a) the absence of labeled data for such a large set of people and b) the large variation of pose/illumination/expression/age/occlusion/quality etc in the target corpus. We propose a system that can learn and recognize faces by combining signals from large scale weakly labeled text, image, and video corpora. First, consistency learning is proposed to create face models for popular persons. We use the text-image co-occurrence on the web as a weak signal of relevance and learn the set of consistent face models from this very large and noisy training set. Second, efficient and accurate face detection and face tracking is applied. Last, the key faces in each face track is select by clustering to get compact and robust representation. The face tracks are further clustered to get more representative key faces and remove duplicate key faces. For each cluster of face tracks, a combination of majority voting and probabilistic voting is done with the automatically learned models. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated by results on image and video corpora, in which we can achieve 92.68% in 37 million images and 80% top-5-precision in 1500 hours videos.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2154-1; POD:978-1-4244-2153-4","10.1109/AFGR.2008.4813381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4813381","","Content based retrieval;Face detection;Face recognition;Image recognition;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Lighting;Text recognition;Videos;Voting","Internet;face recognition;information retrieval;object detection;probability;target tracking;video signal processing","Web videos;face detection;face models;face recognition;face tracking;information retrieval;large scale learning;probabilistic voting;text-image co-occurrence;video content","","10","9","17","","","17-19 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes Jigsaw Distributed File System (JigDFS) which can be used to securely store and retrieve files on a P2P network anonymously. JigDFS is designed to provide strong encryption and a certain level of plausible deniability. Files in JigDFS are sliced into small segments using an information dispersal algorithm (IDA) and distributed onto different nodes recursively to increase fault tolerance against node failures. Moreover, layered encryption is applied to each file with keys produced by a hashed-key chain algorithm, so that data (file segments) and keys reside on different hosts. In such a scheme, if an attacker compromises a host and retrieves the data, the attacker will still need the correct key to decipher the data. Furthermore, recursive IDA and layered encryption ensure users' anonymity. It is difficult for an adversary to identify who owns a file, even who has retrieved a file in JigDFS. Often, a strong adversary may have the power to monitor the network or even force a user to give up the password. Design of JigDFS provides users with plausible deniability which enhances privacy. When being questioned, a JigDFS user can simply argue that he/she is merely a relaying node, rather than the file owner. Moreover, a user, when forced, can give up a valid, however, incorrect encryption key. There is no way for an adversary to verify either correctness of a key or the identity of file owner. JigDFS is developed using platform independent Java technologies and is envisioned to utilize mobile computing elements such as PDAs and smart phones.","","POD:978-1-4244-2769-7","10.1109/CICYBS.2009.4925093","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4925093","","Availability;Buildings;Cryptography;Fault tolerance;File systems;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Personal digital assistants;Privacy;Relays","Java;cryptography;data privacy;information retrieval;mobile computing;peer-to-peer computing;software fault tolerance;ubiquitous computing","P2P network;fault tolerance;files retrieval;hashed-key chain algorithm;independent Java technologies platfrom;information dispersal algorithm;jigsaw distributed file system;layered encryption;mobile computing elements;node failures;secure distributed file system;ubiquitous connectivity","","14","2","30","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Univ., Ankara","2009 IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference","20090512","2009","","","1","6","The most difficult challenge for the design of wireless sensor networks (WSN) is to maintain long network lifetimes since the sensor nodes are severely energy-constrained. Traditional WSN assumes employment of conventional RF transmitters which consume most of the stored power on the sensor node. In this regard, modulated backscattering (MB) emerges as a promising communication technique alternative, in which the sensor nodes reflect the incident signal of an RF source and modulate their data on the reflected signal. With the use of MB, the power consumption of the nodes reduce drastically since it replaces the most power consuming component of a typical sensor node, i.e., the RF transmitter. In addition, the nodes acquire relatively long-range communication ability through MB. Furthermore, the incident RF power can be converted into DC power in order to drive the sensing and processing circuitries. This, in turn,i leads to the design of battery-free wireless passive sensor networks (WPSN), which stands as a radically distinct solution approach for the energy problems of WSN. The objective of this paper is to revisit the main design challenge of WSN from entirely different perspective. To this end, the fundamental principles of WPSN are first introduced. In addition, in order to realize the potential benefits of WPSN, a new clustering-based energy-efficient communication protocol, i.e., PADRE (PAssive Data REtrieval), is presented for WPSN operating via MB technique. Simulations show that PADRE protocol achieves high performance in terms communication reliability and network lifetime.","1525-3511;15253511","POD:978-1-4244-2947-9","10.1109/WCNC.2009.4917879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4917879","","Backscatter;Circuits;Employment;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Protocols;RF signals;Radio frequency;Transmitters;Wireless sensor networks","backscatter;protocols;telecommunication network reliability;wireless sensor networks","battery-free wireless sensor network design;clustering-based energy-efficient communication protocol;modulated backscattering;network lifetime reliability;passive data retrieval protocol;power consumption","","4","","11","","","5-8 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was verified that points in a vector space are projected to a random subspace of suitably high dimension, and then the distances between the points are approximately preserved. Although such a random projection can be used to reduce the dimension of the document space, it does not bring together semantically related documents. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) projects documents to lower dimensional LSI space from higher dimensional term space with singular-value decomposition (SVD) for the purpose of reducing the dimensions of the document space and bringing together semantically related documents. But the computation time of SVD is a bottleneck because of the higher dimensions of documents. In this paper, a novel method of dimension reduction for improving LSI is provided. A term-to-concept projection matrix based on domain ontology was created in this method. This way documents were projected to lower dimensional concept space by the projection matrix.

TTI uses the lower rank approximation technique to reduce noise by eliminating anecdotal terms, to mitigate synonymy by merging the dimensions associated with terms that have similar meanings, and to mitigates polysemy, since components of polysemous words that point in the ldquorightrdquo direction are added to the components of words that share a similar meaning.

Accordingly, current uses of context are limited to individual domains/organizations and do not provide a programmable mechanism for rapid creation of context-aware services. This paper describes a presence virtualization architecture, where a virtualized presence server receives customizable queries from multiple presence clients, retrieves the necessary data from the base presence servers, applies the required virtualization logic and notifies the presence clients. To support both query expressiveness and computational efficiency, virtualization queries are structured to separately identify both the XSLT-based transformation primitives and the presence sources over which the transformation occurs. For improved scalability, the proposed architecture offloads the XSLT-related processing to a high-performance XML processing engine.

The cosine of the angle or the Euclidean distance between the query vector and each document vector is commonly used to measure similarity for query matching. Even though the vector space model starts with a term-by-document matrix, it inevitably loses the information of relations between query terms in the document in the first place. This paper presents a modified vector space model for measuring similarity between the query and the document when responding to a multi-term query. More weight is assigned to the keywords based on the adjacency between the terms in the documents. Thus, when a document contains the adjacency terms, its vector will typically move closer to the query vector to show stronger relevancy between query and the document.","","POD:978-1-4244-2765-9","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938677","","Databases;Euclidean distance;Extraterrestrial measurements;Impedance;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information systems;Logic;Mathematical model;Web sites","information retrieval;matrix algebra;text analysis;vectors","Euclidean distance;document vector;information retrieval;multiterm queries;query matching;query vector;term-by-document matrix;text document search;vector space model","","1","","17","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, a graph-based image modeling which assigns image regions to labeled nodes and their adjacency to weighted edges is used. Also, the image similarity measure is tuned according to the user's evaluation, by way of parameter selection using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)[1][2]. In the experiments, a small-scale CBIR system based on graph modeling of images was developed. Using the system, it was confirmed that images including the query image of different size and rotation angle could be successfully retrieved.

As the explosion and popularity of images in the Internet, there are increasing attentions to utilize millions of or even billions of these images for helping image related research. Beyond the opportunities brought by unlimited data, a great challenge is how to design more effective classification methods under these large scale scenarios. Most of existing attempts are based on k-nearest-neighbor method. However, in spite of the optimistic performance in some tasks, this strategy still suffers from that, one single fixed global parameter k is not robust for different object classes from different semantic levels. In this paper, we propose an alternative method, called lscr<sup>1</sup>-nearest-neighbor, based on a sparse representation computed by lscr<sup>1</sup>-minimization. We first treat a testing sample as a sparse linear combination of all training samples, and then consider the related samples as the nearest neighbors of the testing sample. Finally, we classify the testing sample based on the majority of these neighbors' classes. We conduct extensive experiments on a 1.6 million natural image database on different semantic levels defined based on WordNet, which demonstrate that the proposed lscr<sup>1</sup>-nearest-neighbor algorithm outperforms k-nearest-neighbor in two aspects: 1) the robustness of parameter selection for different semantic levels, and 2) the discriminative capability for large scale image classification task.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960432","ℓ<sup>1</sup>-nearest-neighbor;Image classification;WordNet;k-nearest-neighbor;sparsity","Computer vision;Image classification;Image recognition;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Layout;Robustness;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Testing","image classification;visual databases","Internet;k-nearest-neighbor method;large scale natural image classification;natural image database","","7","","16","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A pillar algorithm for K-means optimization by distance maximization for initial centroid designation","A. R. Barakbah; Y.

Usually the initial centroids for the K-means clustering are determined randomly so that the determined centroids may reach the nearest local minima, not the global optimum. This paper proposes a new approach to optimizing the designation of initial centroids for K-means clustering. This approach is inspired by the thought process of determining a set of pillars' locations in order to make a stable house or building. We consider the pillars' placement which should be located as far as possible from each other to withstand against the pressure distribution of a roof, as identical to the number of centroids amongst the data distribution. Therefore, our proposed approach in this paper designates positions of initial centroids by using the farthest accumulated distance between them. First, the accumulated distance metric between all data points and their grand mean is created. The first initial centroid which has maximum accumulated distance metric is selected from the data points. The next initial centroids are designated by modifying the accumulated distance metric between each data point and all previous initial centroids, and then, a data point which has the maximum distance is selected as a new initial centroid. This iterative process is needed so that all the initial centroids are designated. This approach also has a mechanism to avoid outlier data being chosen as the initial centroids. The experimental results show effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for improving the clustering results of K-means clustering.","","POD:978-1-4244-2765-9","10.1109/CIDM.2009.4938630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4938630","","Algorithm design and analysis;Biology;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Design optimization;Image classification;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern recognition","iterative methods;optimisation;pattern clustering","K-means optimization;clustering method;distance maximization;distance metric;initial centroid designation;iterative process;pillar algorithm","","10","","18","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web 2.0 technologies enable easy collaboration and sharing by allowing users to contribute, modify, and aggregate content using applications like Wikis, Blogs, Social Networking communities, and Mashups. Web 2.0 applications also make heavy use of Ajax, which allows asynchronous communication between client and server, to provide a richer user experience. In this paper, we analyze the effect of these new features on the infrastructure that hosts these workloads. In particular, we focus on the data-centricity, inherent in many Web 2.0 applications, and study its impact on the persistence layer in an application server context. Our experimental results reveal some important performance characteristics; we show that frequent Ajax requests, and other requests arising from the participatory nature of Web 2.0, often retrieve and update persistent data. This can lead to frequent database accesses, lock contention, and reduced performance. We also show that problems in the persistence layer, arising from the data-intensive nature of Web 2.0 applications, can lead to poor scalability that can inhibit us from exploiting current and future multicore architectures.","","POD:978-1-4244-4184-6","10.1109/ISPASS.2009.4919645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4919645","","Aggregates;Asynchronous communication;Blogs;Collaborative work;IP networks;Information retrieval;Mashups;Network servers;Social network services;Web server","Internet;Java;XML;client-server systems;groupware","Ajax;Asynchronous Java script;Internet;Web 2.0 technology;XML;asynchronous communication;client-server system;data-centricity","","3","","24","","","26-28 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Locally linear embedding (LLE), one of effective manifold learning algorithms, addresses this problem by computing low-dimensional, neighborhood preserving embeddings of high-dimensional data. The embedding is derived from the symmetries for locally linear reconstructions. And the computation of this embedding is related to an eigen-problem in the implement. Since LLE was proposed, it has been being applied to deal with image data only because it originated from facial recognition. However, the problem of curse of dimensionality is very prevalent. Therefore, we here try to apply this algorithm for text processing. In this paper, we introduce the LLE briefly and analyze its advantage and latent disadvantages, and the relationship between LSI and LLE in the graph embedding framework is then discussed from a theoretic view.

To search these vectors efficiently, a variety of indexing methods have been proposed. However, the performance of these indexing methods degrades dramatically with increasing dimensionality, which is known as the dimensionality curse. To resolve the dimensionality curse, dimensionality reduction methods have been proposed. They map feature vectors in high-dimensional space into vectors in low-dimensional space before the data are indexed. This paper proposes an improvement for the previously proposed dimensionality reduction. The previous method uses the norm and the approximated angle for every subvector. However, more storage space and a number of cosine computations are required because of multiple angle components. In this paper, we propose an alternative method employing a single angle component instead of respective angles for all the subvectors. Because only one angle for every subvector is considered, though the loss of information regarding the original data vector increases, which degrades the performance slightly, we can successfully reduce storage space as well as a number of cosine computations. Finally, we verify the superiority of the proposed approach via extensive experiments with synthetic and real-life data sets.","","POD:978-1-4244-2760-4","10.1109/CIIP.2009.4937885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4937885","","Degradation;Equations;Euclidean distance;Filtering;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Query processing;Videos","database indexing;information retrieval;multimedia databases","approximated angle;cosine computation;dimensionality reduction;indexing method;multimedia database;multimedia information retrieval;single angle component","","0","","14","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that the DTM model can both detect transition boundaries and accurately cluster coherent segments. The similarities between the dynamic textures which define these segments are based on both timbral and rhythmic qualities of the music, indicating that the DTM model simultaneously captures two of the important aspects required for automatic music analysis.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4959902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4959902","Music modeling;automatic segmentation;dynamic texture model;music similarity","Cepstral analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer vision;Data mining;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Timbre;Video sequences","audio signal processing;music","audio feature-vectors;automatic music analysis;automatic song segmentation;dynamic texture;dynamic texture mixture model;musical signal;rhythmical quality;timbral quality","","2","","23","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, we construct the seeds set with an automatic method instead of by hand. Finally, we build hierarchical clusters of the candidate attribute values to gain more accurate and complete results.

For example, enhanced versions of root MUSIC and standard ESPRIT for non-circular sources as well as the entirely real-valued NC unitary ESPRIT algorithm have been proposed. We can achieve further enhancements in the R-dimensional (R-D) case by using tensor algebra to express and manipulate multidimensional signals in their natural R-D structure. This has led to tensor-based parameter estimation algorithms with enhanced estimation accuracy such as R-D unitary tensor- ESPRIT. In this paper we demonstrate how to achieve both benefits at the same time. This is not straightforward since the usual method to exploit non-circular sources destroys the tensor structure and therefore a new approach had to be found. This approach allows us to derive the NC R-D unitary tensor-ESPRIT algorithm which exploits the non-circularity of the sources and the R-D structure of the measured signals jointly. Numerical computer simulations demonstrate the benefit in terms of a significantly improved accuracy compared to state of the art algorithms.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-2353-8","10.1109/ICASSP.2009.4960399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4960399","Array signal processing;Direction of arrival estimation;Multidimensional signal processing;Parameter estimation","Array signal processing;Computer simulation;Multidimensional signal processing;Multidimensional systems;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Parameter estimation;Radar signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Tensile stress","array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;multidimensional signal processing;signal classification;signal resolution;tensors","ESPRIT algorithm;direction-of-arrival estimation;high-resolution parameter estimation;multidimensional unitary tensor algebra;noncircular source;root MUSIC","","2","","13","","","19-24 April 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a framework to discover latent topics via analyzing contents of dark Websites. The content and data from dark Websites are gathered and extracted by crawlers and exported to documents. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm is used to analyze the extracted documents so as to discover latent topics from web sites of terrorists or extremists.

The contour segments with common transformation values are grouped and hypothesized as belonging to the contour in the search template. The search template is then transformed for each possible transformation value. A second belief propagation (BP II) is applied to perform a deformable contour matching. The matching score or cost function determines whether there is an actual match. The algorithm overcomes the weaknesses of the other approaches since it does not require any pre-processing to detect feature points, it can match targets at any position, scale, or rotation transformations, and it does not use any accumulation space that my have peak clustering problems such as in the Hough transform.","","POD:978-1-4244-2760-4","10.1109/CIIP.2009.4937886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4937886","","Belief propagation;Degradation;Equations;Euclidean distance;Filtering;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Query processing;Shape","belief networks;image matching;image recognition","Hough transform;cluttered image;deformable contour matching;dual belief propagation method;second belief propagation;shape matching;shape recognition;shape searching","","0","","16","","","March 30 2009-April 2 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first result this paper presents is a complete single-letter characterization of achievable storage and identification rates (measured in bits per feature dimension) subject to vanishing probability of identification error as the dimensionality of feature vectors becomes very large. This single-letter characterization is then extended for a multistage system whereby depending on the number of entries, the identification is performed by utilizing part or all of the recorded bits in the database.

Normally, human being has an amazing ability to understand a scene quickly by extracting visual information such as object shape, stereo vision cue, size, placement and etc. However, in computer vision, finding 3-d position from an image is still a challenging task, though many researches have been proposed for decades. Many methods have been presented some efficient solutions using image acquisition from both one and several images. Nevertheless, there is no generic solution to recover precise depth from a single image without any prior knowledge. Object placement is one of vision cues usually used to identify 3-d position efficiently, while extraction of such information is not so trivial. Our approach presents an adaptive algorithm defining placement information as a constraint to estimate depth from a single scene image having many arbitrary objects. Our experimental result shows that our algorithm can estimate precise depth from a wide range of image scenes.","","POD:978-1-4244-2678-2","10.1109/ROBIO.2009.4913291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4913291","Computational Photography;Depth estimation;Object Relation","Biomimetics;Computer vision;Data mining;Humans;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Layout;Robot vision systems;Shape","computer vision;image reconstruction;object detection","3D image reconstruction;computer vision;depth estimation;image acquisition;object placement relation","","1","","11","","","22-25 Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effectiveness of data fusion techniques in such situation depends on the ability of the fusion techniques to be able to boost the signals from relevant documents and reduce the effect of noise that often comes from low quality retrieval results. Our studies on Malach spoken document collection and HARD collection have demonstrated that CombMNZ, the most widely used data fusion method, does not have such ability. We, therefore, developed two versions of signal boosting mechanisms on top of CombMNZ, which result in two new fusion methods called WCombMNZ and WCombMWW. To examine the effectiveness of the two new methods, we conducted experiments on Malach and HARD document collections. Our results show that the new methods can significantly outperform CombMNZ in combining retrieval results that are low and diverse. When the tasks are to combine retrieval results that are in similar quality, which have been the scenarios that CombMNZ are applied often, the two new methods still can obtain often better, sometimes significantly, fusion results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2780-2; POD:978-1-4244-2779-6","10.1109/NLPKE.2008.4906754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4906754","CombMNZ;Data fusion;Malach;Spoken document retrieval;TREC HARD","Boosting;Diversity reception;Fusion power generation;Helium;Information management;Information resources;Information retrieval;Noise reduction;Robustness;Thesauri","information retrieval;sensor fusion","HARD collection;Malach spoken document collection;WCombMNZ;WCombMWW;document retrieval;post-search data fusion;signal boosting techniques","","0","","16","","","19-22 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, it is unknown how to prevent some honest-but-curious storage-provider from learning the private information of the user, such as, searching criterion and access pattern, etc. In CRYPTO'07, Boneh et al. put forward a privacy-preserving solution to solve this open problem, under the public key infrastructure. They made use of PIR (private information retrieval) and several other techniques, which are theoretically interesting and likely to be the best approach in the underlying setting. In this paper, we investigate the practicality of the proposed scheme by Boneh et al.

Indeed, precise knowledge of the user's current activity is necessary in order to thoroughly tailor services to the user's context. To this aim, in the last years many research efforts have been devoted to devise statistical techniques for recognizing basic physical activities based on data retrieved from body- worn sensors. An intriguing research issue is how to integrate those statistical techniques with symbolic ones in order to i) refine statistical predictions, and ii) derive more complex activities. The intuition behind this research direction is that the current user's context (e.g., artifacts and persons in the user's surrounding environment) may give useful hints about the possible activities performed by the user herself. Given an ontology that models the addressed scenario, those hints can be automatically derived through ontological reasoning and used to refine the prediction of the statistical classifier. Moreover, ontological reasoning can be performed to derive complex activities described in terms of simpler activities and symbolic constraints about the user's context.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3304-9","10.1109/PERCOM.2009.4912886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4912886","","Accelerometers;Context-aware services;Geographic Information Systems;Global Positioning System;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Network servers;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Sensor fusion","inference mechanisms;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;ubiquitous computing","activity recognition;body-worn sensors;complex activities;context-aware system;ontological reasoning;physical activities;statistical classifier;statistical prediction;statistical techniques;symbolic constraints;symbolic techniques","","0","","5","","","9-13 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This information is useful to properly drive the dialog prompting for missing concepts, clarifying for wrong concepts, ignoring unnecessary concepts and retrieving those required and optional.
