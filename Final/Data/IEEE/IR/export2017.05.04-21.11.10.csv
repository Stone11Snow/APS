In this paper, we address the problem of enabling effective peer-to-peer resource sharing in this type of networks. Starting from the well-known Chord protocol for resource sharing in wired networks, we propose a specialization (called MESHCHORD) that accounts for peculiar features of wireless mesh networks: namely, the availability of a wireless infrastructure, and the 1-hop broadcast nature of wireless communication. Through extensive packet-level simulations, we show that MESHCHORD reduces message overhead of as much as 40% with respect to the basic Chord design, while at the same time improving the information retrieval performance.","","POD:978-0-7695-3113-7","10.1109/PERCOM.2008.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4517395","Wireless mesh networks;community networks;cross-layering;distributed hash tables;peer-to-peer resource sharing","Availability;Broadcasting;IP networks;Information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Resource management;Web and internet services;Wireless application protocol;Wireless communication;Wireless mesh networks","mobile computing;protocols;radio access networks","1-hop broadcast;Chord protocol;MeshChord;cross layer specialization;peer-to-peer resource sharing;wireless infrastructure;wireless mesh networks","","9","","16","","","17-21 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several retrieval systems are proposed to retrieve necessary, interested and effective information such as key-word based image retrieval and content based image retrieval. However, the results of these approaches are generally unsatisfactory, unpredictable and don't match human perception due to the well gap between visual features and semantic concepts [1]. In this paper, we propose a new approach allowing semantic satellite image retrieval, describing the semantic image content and managing uncertain information. It's based on ontology model which represents spatial knowledge in order to provide semantic understanding of image content. Our retrieval system is based on two modules: ontological model merging and semantic strategic image retrieval. The first module allows developing ontological models which represent spatial knowledge of the satellite image, and managing uncertain information. The second module allows retrieving satellite images basing on their ontological model. In order to improve the quality of retrieval system and to facilitate the retrieval process, we propose two retrieval strategies which are the opportunist strategy and the hypothetic strategy. Our approach attempts to improve the quality of image retrieval, to reduce the semantic gap between visual features and semantic concepts and to provide an automatic solution for efficient satellite image retrieval.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1752-0; POD:978-1-4244-1751-3","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4529997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529997","Semantic image retrieval;knowledge representation;ontology merging;scene interpretation;semantic similarity","Content based retrieval;Content management;Humans;Image retrieval;Information management;Information retrieval;Merging;Ontologies;Remote sensing;Satellites","image retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","ontological model merging;semantic satellite image retrieval;semantic strategic image retrieval;spatial knowledge","","2","","25","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper provides algorithms within a statistical framework to extend active learning for online content-based image retrieval (CBIR). The classification framework is presented with experiments to compare several powerful classification techniques in this information retrieval context. Focusing on interactive methods, active learning strategy is then described. The limitations of this approach for CBIR are emphasized before presenting our new active selection process RETIN. First, as any active method is sensitive to the boundary estimation between classes, the RETIN strategy carries out a boundary correction to make the retrieval process more robust. Second, the criterion of generalization error to optimize the active learning selection is modified to better represent the CBIR objective of database ranking. Third, a batch processing of images is proposed. Our strategy leads to a fast and efficient active learning scheme to retrieve sets of online images (query concept).

In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal and multilevel (MMML) ranking framework to attack the challenging ranking problem of content-based video retrieval. We represent the video retrieval task by graphs and suggest a graph based semi-supervised ranking (SSR) scheme, which can learn with small samples effectively and integrate multimodal resources for ranking smoothly. To make the semi-supervised ranking solution practical for large-scale retrieval tasks, we propose a multilevel ranking framework that unifies several different ranking approaches in a cascade fashion.

It aims at finding an appropriate joint multivariate model whose parameters are the image signatures. The objective of this work is to compare the retrieval performances of the two following multivariate models: the Multivariate Generalized Gaussian Distribution (MGGD) model and a copula-based model. To this respect, an appropriate goodness-of-fit test is used in order to compare the adjustment of the the two models with the empirical histogram of the multivariate wavelet coefficients. Secondly, we compare the performances of retrieval in terms of precision, recall and complexity given by the multivariate approach based on the two models.

A color histogram describes the global color distribution of an image. It is very easy to compute and is insensitive to small changes in viewing positions. However, the histogram is not robust to large appearance changes. Moreover, the histogram might give similar results for different kinds of images if the distributions of colors are same in the images. On the other hand, color Correlogram is efficiently used for image indexing in content-based image retrieval. Color Correlogram extracts not only the color distribution of pixels in images like color histogram, but also extracts the spatial information of pixels in the images. The characteristic of the color Correlogram to take into account the spatial information as well as the distribution of color pixels greatly attracts the researcher for content based image retrieval. In this paper, we propose the image bin (histogram value divisions) separation technique followed by extracting maxima of frequencies and plotting a Correlogram. At first, the histogram is first calculated for an image. After that, it is subdivided into four equal bins. Each bin is subdivided into four more bins and for every such subdivision the maxima of frequencies s calculated. This information is stored in the form of a Correlogram. The distance between Correlogram of the query image with the corresponding Correlogram of database images is calculated.

Such can be ensured with a variation of searchable encryption scheme; With Alice's help, Bob can search through the encrypted log and specify the entries which contain the keyword. It is a common step to extend a simple search to a search with boolean queries, such as AND and OR. However, it is not simple to disclose entries which contain more than a single keyword, without leaking information on the undisclosed entries.

Our proposed method is thus reliant on edge gradient information, thus we call it the color edge gradient co-occurrence histogram (CEGCH). We also introduce a novel color quantization scheme based in the hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space, illustrating that it is more suitable for image retrieval in comparison to the color quantization scheme introduced with the CECH.

Also, it is important to generate the representative vectors using the mapping vectors. This representative vector can describes the features of the images, so the similarity between images is directly calculable from representative vectors.

However, many challenging research problems continue to attract researchers from multiple disciplines. Content-based image retrieval uses the visual contents of an image as features to represent and index the image to be searched from large scale image databases. The quality of the selected features relies mainly on the degree of the invariance property that is ensured under acceptable manipulations. This paper proposes an efficient method for compactly representing color and texture features and combining them for image retrieval.

Compared to phones, graphemes have a number of potential advantages. For out-of-vocabulary search terms, phone- based approaches must generate a pronunciation using letter-to-sound rules. Using graphemes obviates this potentially error-prone hard decision, shifting pronunciation modelling into the statistical models describing the observation space. In addition, long-span grapheme language models can be trained directly from large text corpora. We present experiments on Spanish and English data, comparing phone and grapheme-based STD. For Spanish, where phone and grapheme-based systems give similar transcription word error rates (WERs), grapheme-based STD significantly outperforms a phone- based approach. The converse is found for English, where the phone- based system outperforms a grapheme approach. However, we present additional analysis which suggests that phone-based STD performance levels may be achieved by a grapheme-based approach despite lower transcription accuracy, and that the two approaches may usefully be combined. We propose a number of directions for future development of these ideas, and suggest that if grapheme-based STD can match phone-based performance, the inherent flexibility in dealing with out-of-vocabulary terms makes this a desirable approach.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-1483-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518773","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4518773","Spoken term detection;graphemes","Computer errors;Error analysis;Humans;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Lattices;Natural languages;Performance analysis;Speech;Vocabulary","speech processing;statistical analysis","error-prone hard decision;grapheme-based spoken term detection;grapheme-based subword units;letter-to-sound rules;long-span grapheme language model;out-of-vocabulary search terms;phone spoken term detection;pronunciation modelling;statistical model;transcription word error rates","","8","","9","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two texture features, called multi-scale complexity texture descriptors, based on 2D-C0 and multi-resolution image analysis are presented for medical image retrieval. One is multi-resolution complexity histogram and the other is wavelet-based multi-scale complexity feature. In order to compute the multi-resolution complexity histogram, a two-dimensional complexity map with the same size as the original image that encodes complexity at every location in the image should be computed and quantized.

In this paper, employing sinusoidal parameters obtained by a fixed dimension modified sinusoidal model (FDMSM) already proposed in [7] a new classification approach is proposed to separate mixed type audio frames based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM). The challenging problem in this work is seeking the most appropriate features to discriminate the underlying classes.

This is perhaps the most vital reason for establishment of data buoy programs by various countries like USA (NDBC), Australia, Canada, UK, Germany, India (NDBP) etc. The wave data measurements not only provide real time wave information for Coastal and Ocean related activities but also form wave data base useful for predicting future events using statistical or stochastic techniques. However some times these wave buoys stop functioning either due to malfunctioning instruments or maintenance-related reasons resulting into loss of data. This paper presents use of soft computing techniques like Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP) to retrieve this lost data by forming a network of wave buoys in a region. For developing the buoy network common data of hourly significant wave heights at six buoys in the Gulf of Mexico namely 42001, 42003, 42007, 42036, 42039 and 42040 for the years 2002 and 2004 is used. A separate network for each buoy is developed as the 'target buoy' with other 5 buoys as 'input buoys' which can be operated to retrieve lost data at a location. The testing results of both approaches when compared showed superiority of Genetic Programming over Artificial Neural Network as evident by higher correlation coefficient between observed and predicted wave heights in all cases. The wave height plots also pointed out that GP estimates wave heights in extreme events (peaks) more accurately than ANN.","","POD:978-1-4244-2125-1","10.1109/OCEANSKOBE.2008.4530913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530913","artificial neural networks;buoy network;genetic programming;soft computing techniques;wave buoy","Artificial neural networks;Australia;Computer networks;Genetic programming;Information retrieval;Instruments;Oceans;Sea measurements;Stochastic processes;Testing","genetic algorithms;geophysics computing;neural nets;ocean waves;oceanographic techniques;stochastic processes","AD 2002 to 2004;Artificial Neural Networks;Australia;Canada;Genetic Programming;Germany;Gulf of Mexico;India;UK;USA;buoy programs;ocean wave buoys network development;ocean wave data measurements;soft computing techniques;stochastic techniques","","0","","18","","","8-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we describe the design of ContinuStreaming, a gossip-based P2P streaming system which can maintain high resilience and low overhead while bring a novel and critical property - full coverage of the data dissemination. With the help of DHT, data segments which are likely to be missed by the gossip-based data scheduling can be quickly fetched by the on-demand data retrieval so as to guarantee continuous playback. We discuss the results of both theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations on various real-trace overlay topologies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

By singular-value decomposition of this matrix, each audio clip of the database is mapped into a a point in the latent perceptual space. This is used for indexing the retrieval system. Since each of the initial reference clusters represents a specific perceptual quality in a perceptual space (similar to words that represent specific concepts in the semantic space), querying-by-example results in clips that have similar perceptual qualities.

A centralized database can be an excellent way to streamline data interfaces between the distributed users. This centralization often results in confusion about the process by which data is collected and distributed, increases cost, and without proper architecture can introduce unnecessary risk. Some areas of concern that could be remedied are the number of distinct entities developing data handling processes and introducing distinct boundaries within the data flow that align accountability and data fidelity. We propose a data flow architecture that enables seamless data import and export. The first step involves examining which kinds of teams (who) are involved with what types of data and the required format. In our process all contributors seamlessly provide data (what) into a centralized repository (where) based on satellite development phases (when). All users would then export data from a centralized repository in the format they require (how). And this would be independent of the location and number of providers / users. We would distinguish between the distinct areas of data manipulation to clear up the lines of responsibility and increase the fidelity of the data. First, the data must be stored in a way that relationships between information are created. The scary ""schema"" word applies here and is nothing more than a complicated and blank spreadsheet. Second, the data must be provided from some official source of information, including all the complexities of a particular type of data. Third is data control, whereby data is controlled from unauthorized update, verified to conform to the data input requirements with uniformity across provider inputs, increasing in fidelity as the project matures, and exported in conformance with the data exchange requirements.","1095-323X;1095323X","POD:978-1-4244-1487-1","10.1109/AERO.2008.4526591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4526591","","Biographies;Costs;Data handling;Distributed databases;Hardware;Information resources;Information retrieval;Memory;Satellites;System testing","aerospace computing;data analysis;data flow analysis;database management systems;electronic data interchange","centralized database;data centralization;data exchange requirements;data flow architecture;data handling processes;data manipulation;space programs;streamline data interfaces","","0","1","1","","","1-8 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we need a sound formalism unifying underlying search concepts. The framework of fuzzy logic is often seen as such a unifying framework. Our work identifies some problems with fuzzy logic for multimedia retrieval, namely the dominance problem and the problem of violated logical laws such as idempotence and associativity especially when weighting is involved. Our approach is to apply a mathematical framework inspired by the theory of quantum mechanics and logic. We show that our quantum logic based query language overcomes problems of fuzzy logic in our context. This is due to the fact that we regard more semantics of a query and its involved conditions in comparison to fuzzy logic. A fuzzy t-norm, for example, deals with membership values whereas the conjunction in our framework is performed on subqueries.","","POD:978-1-4244-2351-4","10.1109/NAFIPS.2008.4531329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531329","","Database languages;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Multimedia databases;Psychology;Quantum mechanics;Satellite broadcasting","fuzzy logic;information retrieval;multimedia computing;quantum computing","fuzzy logic;mathematical framework;multimedia retrieval;quantum logic;query language","","1","","37","","","19-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We prove that with high probability, this service ensures that a constant fraction of all possible communications is organized. Interestingly enough, this property holds true even if a node is not able to choose another node uniformly at random. In particular, the dating service can be implemented over existing DHT-based systems. In order to illustrate the expressiveness and the usefulness of proposed service, we also present a possible practical application of the dating service.

In this paper, we propose a clustered on-demand multi-channel MAC protocol (COM-MAQ) to support energy-efficient, high- throughput, and reliable data transmission in WMSNs. The operation of proposed protocol consists of three sessions: request session, scheduling session, and data transmission session. For COM-MAC to achieve high energy efficiency, first, a scheduled multi-channel medium access is used within each cluster so that cluster members can operate in a contention-free manner within both time and frequency domains to avoid collision, idle listening and overhearing. Second, to maximize the network throughput, a traffic-adaptive and QoS-aware scheduling algorithm is executed to dynamically allocate time slots and channels for sensor nodes based on the current data traffic information and QoS requirements. Finally, to enhance transmission reliability, a spectrum-aware ARQ is incorporated to better exploit the unused spectrum for a balance between the reliability and retransmission. Simulation results indicate that COM-MAC can achieve increased network throughput at the cost of a small control and energy overhead.","1550-3607;15503607","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2075-9","10.1109/ICC.2008.451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4533487","","Access protocols;Data communication;Energy efficiency;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Media Access Protocol;Streaming media;Throughput;Wireless application protocol;Wireless sensor networks","access protocols;automatic repeat request;channel allocation;data communication;multimedia communication;quality of service;scheduling;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication traffic;video streaming;wireless sensor networks;workstation clusters","QoS-aware scheduling algorithm;audio streaming;channel allocation;clustered on-demand multichannel MAC protocol;data traffic information;data transmission;energy-constrained devices;multichannel medium access;network bandwidth;scheduling session;spectrum-aware ARQ;traffic-adaptive scheduling algorithm;transmission reliability;video streaming;wireless multimedia sensor networks;wireless sensor networks","","11","","11","","","19-23 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fusion pertains to the merging or integration of information towards an enhanced level of awareness. Multi-sensor fusion can be applied to any system that must retrieve and synthesize data from numerous sources. Its applications can be found in a variety of technology settings, from robotics, structural and vehicle health monitoring to communications, space science and telemedicine. This work is a canonical overview of several major fusion architectures developed from the remote sensing and defense community. We present several types of architecture for managing multi-sensor data fusion, specifically as they relate to the tracking-correlation function and blackboard processing representations in knowledge engineering. Object-Process Methods are used to model the information fusion process and supporting subsystems. Finally, we discuss the importance of fusion to the concept and operation of the Semantic Web. Semantic networks offer powerful ways to exploit the synergy of multi-sensor data platforms. Their operation is based on synthesis of fusion with ontology models for knowledge representation. We discuss the importance of fusion as a reuse process in ontological engineering, and review key lifecycle models in ontology development. The evolutionary approach to ontology development is considered the most useful and adaptable to the complexities of semantic networks. Several potential applications for data fusion are screened and ranked according to the Joint Directors of Laboratories (JDL) process model for information fusion. Based on these predetermined criteria, the case of medical diagnostic imaging was found to offer the most promising applications for fusion, on which future product platforms can be built.","1095-323X;1095323X","POD:978-1-4244-1487-1","10.1109/AERO.2008.4526434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4526434","","Information retrieval;Merging;Ontologies;Orbital robotics;Remote monitoring;Robot sensing systems;Sensor fusion;Space technology;Space vehicles;Telemedicine","blackboard architecture;correlation methods;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;semantic networks;sensor fusion","blackboard processing representations;data fusion architectures;knowledge engineering;multi-sensor fusion;object-process methods;ontological engineering;semantic Web;semantic networks;sensor platforms;tracking-correlation function","","3","1","17","","","1-8 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The STAR code is an extension of the double-erasure-correcting EVENODD code and a modification of the generalized triple-erasure-correcting EVENODD code. The STAR code is an Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) code and thus is optimal in terms of node failure recovery capability for a given data redundancy.

This paper investigates technologies able to offer several opportunities for supporting cultural institutions in the process of information dissemination and in the development of systems able to attract, engage users by delivering information according to their needs and preferences. Nowadays, AH is no longer perceived as just a set of isolated objects, stored in museums or collections, without any links to the specific historical and social contexts of reference. Rather objects have to be connected to additional information concerning those reference contexts. Since such information evolves over time, based on the research carried out by archaeologists, historical experts, and sociologists, the knowledge base needs to be updated to reflect new discoveries. Moreover, information should be presented at different levels of detail and should support an exploratory approach to information discovery by users. This paper presents a system addressing such requirements. The system uses 360 panoramic images to disseminate AH information retrieved from an open knowledge network, defined as a set of interrelated knowledge sources. In particular the paper explores the integration of panoramic images with ontologies in the context of an application in the area of archaeology (specifically, the Etruscan civilization). The paper also discusses the relevant technical issues for the design of the panoramic image interactive system. Those issues concern on one hand the possible organizations for the domain knowledge and on the other hand the architecture of the system and its interaction patterns. Such interactions are crucial in order to facilitate the development of applications that are easily customizable users and are characteriz- d by a high level of interactivity.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1752-0; POD:978-1-4244-1751-3","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4529908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529908","Cultural Knowledge base;Data integration;Interactive museum Tools;Narrations;Panoramic image","Application software;Cultural differences;Environmental management;Human computer interaction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Interactive systems;Isolation technology;Knowledge management;Ontologies","archaeology;human computer interaction;interactive systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","archeological heritage;data management;historical expert;human computer interaction;information dissemination;information retrieval;knowledge management;ontology;panoramic image interactive system;semantically interconnected interactive environment;sociologists","","0","","11","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

EDGAR is the SEC's (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) means of automating the collection, validation, indexing, acceptance, and forwarding of submissions. Some entities are regulated by the SEC (e.g. publicly traded firms) and are required, by law, to file with the SEC. Our focus is on making use of EDGAR to get information about company filings. These offers are filed with companies, using their Central Index Key (CIK). The CIK is used on the SEC's computer system to identify entities that filed a disclosure with the SEC. We show how to map a stock ticker symbol into a CIK. The methodology for converting the web data source into internal data structures is based on using HTML as the input into a context-sensitive parser-callback facility. Screen scraping is a popular means of data mining, but the unstructured nature of HTML pages makes this a challenge. The stop-and-wait nature of HTTP queries, as well as the non-deterministic nature of the response time, adversely impacts performance. We show that a combination of caching and multi-threading can improve performance by several orders of magnitude.","1530-2075;15302075","POD:978-1-4244-1693-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2008.4536453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4536453","","Data analysis;Data mining;Data security;Data structures;HTML;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information security;Java;Performance analysis","Java;data mining;hypermedia markup languages;information networks;multi-threading","EDGAR CIK;EDGAR system;HTMLEditorKit;HTTP queries;Java Swing;Web data source;central index keys;company filings;context-sensitive parser-callback facility;internal data structures;multithreaded Web data mining;multithreaded data mining;screen scraping;ticker symbols","","0","","8","","","14-18 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the advantages of this approach is to deliver discriminated answers instead of flat sets of elements. In this paper, preferences are conveyed thanks to fuzzy predicates whose truth values are a matter of degree. The focus is put on queries involving a division, operator which plays a central role far beyond relational database systems, especially in information retrieval systems or Web search engines. The regular division is not flexible at all and small variations in the data may lead to totally different results. The approach suggested here is to weaken the division and different rationales for that are proposed and discussed with a double requirement: to have a clear meaning from a user point of view and to deliver a resulting relation which is a quotient.","","POD:978-1-4244-2351-4","10.1109/NAFIPS.2008.4531207","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531207","","Context modeling;Fuzzy sets;Heart;Information retrieval;Relational databases;Search engines;Web search","Boolean algebra;fuzzy set theory;query processing","Boolean queries;Web search engines;information retrieval systems;tolerant division operators","","0","","13","","","19-22 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is particularly challenging due to the evading techniques that attackers use: IP spoofing and attacking across stepping stones. A number of attack traceback methods have been proposed; most of them deal with DoS/DDoS attacks or do not perform well in a non-cooperate or hostile environment. In this contribution, we propose a single packet and host-based traceback scheme. It consists of two phases: Cross-Validation for coping with IP spoofing; and Pebble-Trace for uncovering original attack host location. Cross-Validation is the process that a validation server analyzes an attack packet and determines whether its source IP address is spoofed for making a decision on the feasibility and strategy of traceback. If a source IP address is invalid, we can only black-list and block it. Otherwise, we propose a new technique called Pebble-Trace to uncover the attack original source by probing packets. While a probing packet from the validation server traverses through stepping stones to the attacker it spreads tracing packets on its way, which ""report"" the IP address of the machine that it traverses (or its payload passes) through back to the validation server. All the trace operations are done automatically and secretly to prevent the attacker from detecting and evading the process.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1978-4; POD:978-1-4244-1977-7","10.1109/THS.2008.4534481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4534481","","Authentication;Computer crime;Computer science;Computer security;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Information security;Internet;Payloads","IP networks;Internet;security of data;telecommunication security","DoS/DDoS attack;IP address spoofing;Internet attack traceback;cross-validation process;cyber space security;host-based traceback scheme;pebble tracing;single packet traceback scheme","","1","","23","","","12-13 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present Pastel, an extension to Pastry that bridges the gap between the two types of overlays. Pastel maintains both Pastry routing tables and a full information table, and we show how we can exploit synergies between the maintenance of the two. We also propose a novel API that is richer than the one offered by existing overlays, to give applications control over the type of lookups (structured, multi-hop routing, or attempt direct contact). We implemented Pastel in a discrete-event packet level simulator and our results show that Pastel has lookups that are usually more efficient than Pastry's.

Utilizing the occurrence of high strength detections generated by the specular geometric condition, a cueing approach can be used to selectively extract further data which is stored locally on the individual sonar nodes. This approach can significantly reduce the false alarm rate at the input to the fusion/tracking algorithm, and reduce node-to-fusion- center communication link throughput requirements. The cost of this approach is increased detection latency, while waiting for specular cues to occur. For this concept to be viable there must be sufficient statistical probability that specular detections will occur within the field to initiate the cueing process. The specular detection cues will also have to occur with acceptable latency, compared to the ASW surveillance mission's operational time scale. This paper describes a new modeling methodology which has been developed, enabling the evaluation of distributed multistatic fields for specular detection occurrence. Metrics are presented which enable this evaluation, and applications to example multistatic fields are shown.","","POD:978-1-4244-2125-1","10.1109/OCEANSKOBE.2008.4530903","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530903","cueing;information fusion;multistatic sonar;specular;tracking","Delay;Information retrieval;Robustness;Sonar detection;Sonar measurements;Strontium;Surveillance;Target tracking;Throughput;Uncertainty","oceanographic techniques;sonar;target tracking","ASW surveillance mission;Anti-submarine warfare;cueing process;false alarm clutter;fusion/tracking algorithm;multistatic active sonar contacts;sonar nodes;specular detections;specular geometric condition;statistical probability","","5","2","12","","","8-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a cooperative mechanism for data distribution that increases system reliability, and at the same time keeps the memory consumption for data storage low on each device. A Reed-Solomon coding scheme is applied as a solution where a certain number of unavailable devices can be tolerated without jeopardizing the system reliability. A prototype of a system is implemented to test the protocol behavior under realistic conditions. Prototyping is done on the OpenSensor platform developed at Aalborg University. To observe the system performance in different settings, additionally a simulator is developed. Performance results indicate that the proposed cooperative data distribution method outperforms the non-cooperative one.

But it is natural to raise the question of how much an image can be compressed and still preserve sufficient information for a given clinical application. Evaluation of the diagnostic quality of compressed medical image still remains an important issue. In this paper, three different medical image modalities have been compressed and decompressed using DWT for different compression ratios and evaluated using objective and subjective testing. The quality of the reconstructed images has been measured using objective measures such as MSE, MAE, SNR, and PSNR. Ten observers have been involved to carry out the subjective evaluation. Based on the quality of the reconstructed images, the PSNR obtained has been between 35.3 dB to 58.0 dB for CT scan images, 38.6 dB to 55.0 dB for MRI and 34.5 dB to 51 MB for X-ray images. For radiology applications, the compression ratio of 30:1 is acceptable for CT images, and a compression ratio of 40:1 is acceptable for MRI, and compression ratio of 20:1 is acceptable for X-ray images.","2376-1164;23761164","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3136-6","10.1109/AMS.2008.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530599","Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT);Medical Image;Telemedicine.;Teleradiology","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;PSNR;X-ray imaging","discrete wavelet transforms;image reconstruction;medical diagnostic computing;medical image processing","CT scan images;X-ray images;compressed medical images;discrete wavelet transform;medical diagnostic","","8","","9","","","13-15 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Only statistical information about future queries is available during encoding. While temporal correlations can be exploited by coding over large blocks, the growth in encoding complexity renders this approach impractical and hence the interest in a low complexity predictive coding approach. However, the design of optimal predictive fusion coding systems is considerably complicated by the presence of the prediction loop, and the potentially exponential growth of the query sets. We propose a complexity-constrained predictive fusion coder and derive an iterative algorithm for its design, which is based on the ""Asymptotic Closed Loop"" framework and hence, circumvents convergence and stability issues of traditional predictive quantizer design. The proposed predictive fusion coder optimizes the distortion - retrieval rate tradeoff, given a fixed storage capacity, and provides significant gains over storage schemes that perform only joint compression or memoryless fusion coding of all sources.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-1483-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4518158","Data compression;Database query processing;Linear predictive coding;Multisensor systems;Vector quantization","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Databases;Encoding;Information retrieval;Iterative algorithms;Predictive coding;Rate distortion theory;Streaming media;Vector quantization","correlation methods;iterative methods;query processing;sensor fusion;source coding;spatiotemporal phenomena;statistical analysis","encoding complexity;iterative algorithm;multisensor;predictive fusion coding;query sets;spatio-temporally correlated source;storage capacity","","0","","6","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our proposed scheme, we first construct a steerable multivariate sub-Gaussian model, where the fractional lower-order moments of a given image are associated with those of its rotated versions. The feature extraction step consists of estimating the so-called covariations between the orientation subbands of the corresponding steerable pyramid at the same or at adjacent decomposition levels and building an appropriate signature that can be rotated directly without the need of rotating the image and recalculating the signature. The similarity measurement between two images is performed using a matrix-based norm that includes a signature alignment in angle between the images being compared, achieving in this way the desired rotation-invariance property. Our experimental results show how this retrieval scheme achieves a lower average retrieval error, as compared to previously proposed methods having a similar computational complexity, while at the same time being competitive with the best currently known state-of-the-art retrieval system. In conclusion, our retrieval method provides the best compromise between complexity and average retrieval performance.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2008.924390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4539851","Fractional lower-order moments (FLOM);rotation-invariant texture retrieval;steerable multivariate sub-Gaussian model","Computer science;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Iron;Performance evaluation;Rotation measurement;Samarium;Spatial databases","feature extraction;image retrieval;image texture","decomposition levels;feature extraction;fractional lower order moments;matrix-based norm;orientation subbands;rotation-invariance property;rotation-invariant texture retrieval;signature alignment;similarity measurement;steerable multivariate sub-Gaussian model;steerable pyramid","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Normal Distribution;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Rotation;Subtraction Technique","10","","22","","","July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Secondly, projection profiles are used in location refinement step. Color-based k-means clustering is adopted in text segmentation. Compared to grayscale image which is used in most existing methods, color image is more suitable for segmentation based on clustering.

The question-specific model achieves 32.2% reduction in word error rate from the baseline using the questions where pronominal references are resolved.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:978-1-4244-1483-3","10.1109/ICASSP.2008.4518809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4518809","Spoken question answering;speech recognition;spoken dialog systems","Application software;Computer science;Data mining;Error analysis;Information retrieval;Information systems;Interactive systems;Merging;Natural languages;Speech recognition","information retrieval;interactive systems;speech recognition;speech-based user interfaces","AQUAINT corpus;interactive question answering;name-aware speech recognition;named entity specific model;voice-enabled question answering application","","0","","13","","","March 31 2008-April 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A New Scheme for Distributed Density Estimation based Privacy-Preserving Clustering","C. Su; F. Bao; J. Zhou; T. Takagi; K. Sakurai","Dept of Comput. Sci. & Commun. Eng., Kyushu Univ., Tokyo","2008 Third International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security","20080523","2008","","","112","119","The sensitive information leakage and security risk is a problem from which both individual and enterprise suffer in massive data collection and the information retrieval by the distrusted parties. In this paper, we focus on the privacy issue of data clustering and point out some security risks in the existing data mining algorithms. Associated with cryptographic techniques, we initiate an application of random data perturbation (RDP) which has been widely used for preserving the privacy of individual records in statistical database for the distributed data clustering scheme. Our scheme applies linear transformation of Gaussian distribution perturbed data and general additional data perturbation (GADP) schemes to preserve the privacy for distributed kernel density estimation with the help of any trusted third party. We also show that our scheme is more secure against the random matrix-based filtering attack which is based on analysis of the distribution of the eigenvalues by using two RDP methods.","","POD:978-0-7695-3102-1","10.1109/ARES.2008.129","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4529328","RDP;data clustering;privacy-preserving","Clustering algorithms;Cryptography;Data mining;Data privacy;Data security;Distributed databases;Gaussian distribution;Information retrieval;Information security;Kernel","Gaussian distribution;cryptography;data mining;data privacy;estimation theory;information retrieval;pattern clustering;statistical databases","Gaussian distribution perturbed data scheme;cryptographic techniques;data clustering privacy;data mining algorithms;distributed kernel density estimation scheme;general additional data perturbation schemes;information retrieval;massive data collection;privacy-preserving clustering;random data perturbation;security risk;sensitive information leakage;statistical database","","3","","12","","","4-7 March 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
