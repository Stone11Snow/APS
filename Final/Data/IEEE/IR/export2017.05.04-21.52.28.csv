"Evaluation of high-resolution ocean surface vector winds measured by QuikSCAT scatterometer in coastal regions","Wenqing Tang; W. T. Liu; B. W.

Such spatial resolution is not sufficient to resolve small-scale processes, especially in coastal oceans. Based on range-compressed normalized backscatter and a modified wind retrieval algorithm, a coastal wind dataset at 12.5-km resolution was produced. Even with larger error, the high-resolution winds, in medium to high strength, would still be useful over coastal ocean. Using measurements from moored buoys from the National Buoy Data Center, the high-resolution QuikSCAT wind data are found to have similar accuracy as standard data in the open ocean. The accuracy of both high- and standard-resolution winds, particularly in wind directions, is found to degrade near shore. The increase in error is likely caused by the inadequacy of the geophysical model function/ambiguity removal scheme in addressing coastal conditions and light winds situations. The modified algorithm helps to bring the directional accuracy of the high-resolution winds to the accuracy of the standard-resolution winds in near-shore regions, particularly in the nadir and far zones across the satellite track.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.831685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323132","Coastal ocean;scatterometer;vector wind","Backscatter;Degradation;Geophysical measurements;Information retrieval;Measurement standards;Oceans;Radar measurements;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Spatial resolution","atmospheric techniques;backscatter;geophysical signal processing;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;wind","National Buoy Data Center;QuikSCAT scatterometer;SeaWinds scatterometer;ambiguity removal scheme;coastal conditions;coastal oceans;coastal regions;coastal wind dataset;far zones;geophysical model function;global ocean;high-resolution ocean surface vector winds;light wind situations;moored buoys;nadir zones;near-shore regions;range-compressed normalized backscatter;satellite track;wind directions;wind retrieval algorithm","","36","","17","","","Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Integration of cluster ensemble and text summarization for gene expression analysis","Xiaohua Hu","Coll. of Inf. Sci. & Technol., Drexel Univ., Philadelphia, PA, USA","Proceedings. Fourth IEEE Symposium on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering","20040726","2004","","","251","258","Generating high quality gene clusters and identifying the underlying biological mechanism of the gene cluster are the important goals of clustering gene expression analysis. To get high quality cluster results, most of the current approaches rely on choosing the best cluster algorithm whose design biases and assumptions meet the underlying distribution of the data set. There are two issues for this approach: (1) usually the underlying data distribution of the gene expression data sets is unknown, and (2) there are so many clustering algorithms available and it is very challenging to choose the proper one. To provide a textual summary of the gene clusters, the most explored approach is the extractive approach that essentially builds upon techniques borrowed from the information retrieval, in which the objective is to provide terms to be used for query expansion, and not to act as a stand alone summary for the entire document sets. Another drawback is that the clustering quality and cluster interpretation are treated as two isolated research problems and are studied separately. But cluster quality and cluster interpretation are closely related and must be addressed in a coherent and unified way. It is essential to have relatively high quality clusters first, in order to get a correct, informative biological explanation of the gene cluster, otherwise, the biological explanation will be incorrect or misleading, no matter how good or robust the text summarization technique is. Based on this consideration, we design and develop a unified system GE-Miner (gene expression miner) to address these challenging issues in a principled and general manner by integrating cluster ensemble and text summarization and provide an environment for comprehensive gene expression data analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can obtain high quality clusters and provide concise and informative textual summary for the gene clusters.","","POD:0-7695-2173-8","10.1109/BIBE.2004.1317351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317351","","Algorithm design and analysis;Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Data mining;Educational institutions;Gene expression;Genomics;Information analysis;Information retrieval","DNA;biology computing;data mining;genetics;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering;query formulation","GE-Miner;cluster ensemble integration;cluster interpretation;cluster quality;gene expression analysis;gene expression miner;information retrieval;query expansion;text summarization","","2","","34","","","19-21 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such hyper-dimensional databases pose significant problems to existing high-dimensional indexing techniques which have been developed for indexing databases with (commonly) less than a hundred dimensions. To support efficient querying and retrieval on hyper-dimensional databases, we propose a methodology called local digital coding (LDC) which can support k-nearest neighbors (KNN) queries on hyper-dimensional databases and yet co-exist with ubiquitous indices, such as B+-trees. LDC extracts a simple bitmap representation called digital code(DC) for each point in the database. Pruning during KNN search is performed by dynamically selecting only a subset of the bits from the DC based on which subsequent comparisons are performed. In doing so, expensive operations involved in computing L-norm distance functions between hyper-dimensional data can be avoided. Extensive experiments are conducted to show that our methodology offers significant performance advantages over other existing indexing methods on both real life and synthetic hyper-dimensional datasets.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2065-0","10.1109/ICDE.2004.1319980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319980","","Audio databases;Bioinformatics;Computer science;Data mining;Extraterrestrial phenomena;Image databases;Indexing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Multimedia databases","indexing;multimedia databases;query processing;tree data structures;tree searching","B+-tree;bioinformatics;bitmap representation;hyper-dimensional database;indexing database;indexing technique;local digital coding;multimedia","","13","2","13","","","30 March-2 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite a wide range of sophisticated indexing and data retrieval features, search engines often deliver satisfactory results only when users know precisely what they are looking for. Traditional textual interfaces present results as a list of links to Web pages. Because most users are unwilling to explore an extensive list, search engines arbitrarily reduce the number of links returned, aiming also to provide quick response times. Moreover, their proprietary ranking algorithms often do not reflect individual user preferences. Those who need comprehensive general information about a topic or have vague initial requirements instead want a holistic presentation of data related to their queries.

The text clusters are used to generate domain specific language models in order to address the problem of language model adaptation. The method relies on a new discriminative n-gram based term selection process (n>l), which reduces the influence of the corpus inhomogeneity, and outputs only semantically focused n-grams as being the most representative key terms in the corpus. These key terms are then used to automatically cluster the whole document collection and generate LM out of these text clusters.

Moreover, speakers present in the detected movie dialogs are further identified based on the audio source parsing. The obtained audio and visual cues are then integrated to index the movie content.

Our service is able to provide fault tolerance and security even in the presence of a fraction of corrupted name servers, avoiding any single point of failure. It further solves the problem of storing zone secrets online without leaking them to a corrupted server, while still supporting secure dynamic updates.

This is implemented by partitioning the image into objects structured in a hierarchical way. The lowest description level is obtained by applying a color segmentation algorithm to the image. On the other hand, the highest level is achieved by a semantic segmentation implemented in a semi-automatic framework. The spatial relationship of the object extracted, at a given description level, is described by a graph structure scheme. In particular, for each object (segment) a graph node is constructed and includes several features of that object. The graph links indicate the spatial relationship of the object with its neighbors. Following the hierarchical object decomposition, a tree-structure is created, providing efficient representation of the visual content.","","POD:0-7803-6290-X","10.1109/MELCON.2000.879992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=879992","","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Humans;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Image storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;MPEG 7 Standard;Tree graphs","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;image segmentation;trees (mathematics)","color segmentation algorithm;efficient hierarchical visual representation;graph node;hierarchical object decomposition;image content;image representation;progressive content-based image indexing;progressive content-based image retrieval;semantic segmentation;spatial relationship;tree-structure graphs;video queries;visual content representation","","0","","17","","","2000","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, these path expressions contain both structural and keyword components. Several methods have been proposed for processing path expressions over graph/tree-structured XML data. These methods can be classified into two broad classes. The first involves graph traversal where the input query is evaluated by traversing the data graph or some compressed representation. The other class involves information-retrieval style processing using inverted lists. In this framework, structure indexes have been proposed to be used as a substitute for graph traversal. Here, we focus on a subclass of CAS queries consisting of simple path expressions. We study algorithmic issues in integrating structure indexes with inverted lists for the evaluation of these queries, where we rank all documents that match the query and return the top k documents in order of relevance.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2065-0","10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320060","","Bridges;Content addressable storage;Indexing;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Middleware;Proposals;Query processing;Tree graphs;XML","XML;database indexing;list processing;query formulation;query processing","CAS query;XML document;graph traversal;graph-structured XML data;information-retrieval style processing;inverted list;path expression processing;structure index;tree-structured XML data","","1","11","3","","","30 March-2 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In This work we propose an approach that retrieves the visible data on demand and is based on a tight integration of the database and visualization systems. We propose to incrementally adjust the observer path by adding and dropping path points. The result is an optimal path that minimizes the interaction with the database system and retrieves all visible objects along the path. The visible objects are retrieved incrementally, and it is possible to precisely control the query load and the number of retrieved objects. The minimal distance path method issues frequent queries and retrieves the lowest possible number of objects at each query point. The end point path method minimizes the number of queries by permitting larger query results. The experimental results show that our implementation reduces the number of I/O operations significantly, is stable, and does not depend on the initial number of path points.","1098-8068;10988068","POD:0-7695-2168-1","10.1109/IDEAS.2004.1319808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319808","","Computer science;Data mining;Data visualization;Database systems;Hardware;Information retrieval;Load management;Nearest neighbor searches;Spatial databases;Visual databases","image retrieval;resource allocation;visual databases","I/O operations;database system;end point path method;incremental visible object extraction;interactive visual data explorations;minimal distance path method;query load balancing;visible data retrieval;visualization system","","1","1","23","","","7-9 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main idea of our approach is to use the information retrieval (IR) technology to reveal the basic connections between features and computational units in source code. Due to the characteristics of the retrieved connections, we use a static representation of the source code named BRCG to further recover both the relevant and the specific computational units for each feature. Furthermore, we recover the relationships among the relevant units for each feature. A premise of our approach is that programmers should use meaningful names as identifiers.

Traditional 'syntactic' data compression methods treat the table as a large byte string and operate at the byte level. The tradeoff in such cases is usually between the ease of retrieval (the ease with which one can retrieve a single tuple or attribute value without decompressing a much larger unit) and the effectiveness of the compression. In this regard, the use of semantic compression has generated considerable interest and motivated certain recent works. We propose a semantic compression algorithm called ItCompress ITerative Compression, which achieves good compression while permitting access even at attribute level without requiring the decompression of a larger unit. ItCompress iteratively improves the compression ratio of the compressed output during each scan of the table. The amount of compression can be tuned based on the number of iterations. Moreover, the initial iterations provide significant compression, thereby making it a cost-effective compression technique. Extensive experiments were conducted and the results indicate the superiority of ItCompress with respect to previously known techniques, such as 'SPARTAN' and 'fascicles'.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2065-0","10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320034","","Compression algorithms;Data analysis;Data compression;Data engineering;Data warehouses;Databases;Information retrieval;Information technology;Monitoring;Upper bound","computational complexity;data compression;data mining;iterative methods;query processing","ItCompress iterative compression;SPARTAN;data compression;iterative semantic compression algorithm","","7","1","18","","","30 March-2 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, XML and its schema languages do not express semantics but rather structure, such as nesting information. Therefore, semantically equivalent documents often present different document structures. We provide an ontology-based framework that aims to make two XML documents intemperate at the semantic level while retaining their nesting structure. In our global-as-view approach, we generate an RDF ontology for each of the participating XML documents, which preserves the nesting structure of the document. An RDF global ontology is the result of merging the individual ontologies. The global ontology unifies the query access and establishes semantic connections among the underlying individual databases. We consider two types of queries: those that are posed on the global ontology and those that are posed on any of the XML documents, in a P2P fashion. The former type is processed using query translation from an RDF query to an XML query. The latter type entails bidirectional query processing: the translation from an XML query to an RDF query followed by the translation from an RDF query to an XML query. To ensure the correctness of the answer to the query in the latter case, we introduce the concept of reversibility of the query translation.","1098-8068;10988068","POD:0-7695-2168-1","10.1109/IDEAS.2004.1319794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319794","","Books;Computer science;Databases;Information retrieval;Merging;Ontologies;Query processing;Resource description framework;Semantic Web;XML","Internet;XML;electronic data interchange;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing","RDF global ontology;RDF query;World Wide Web;XML documents;XML query;XML semantic integration;bidirectional query processing;data interchange;nesting information;ontology-based framework;query translation","","26","","20","","","7-9 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Obviously, it is a time-consuming strategy. This paper offers a new technique called the piecewise method to overcome this drawback. The basic concept of this method is that the image matching distance between the pair of frames q and v is computed only if q is similar to v. In most cases, the executive time of this method is less than that of traditional methods. However, the piecewise method cannot accurately retrieve the videos satisfying the requirement of the query frame sequence from the database. This paper provides another more precise video retrieval method based on video shot, that is the piecewise refinement method, to remedy this shortcoming. It is a revision of the piecewise method. Experimental results show that the piecewise refinement method gives an impressive performance not only in processing time but also in storage space.","","POD:0-7695-2051-0","10.1109/AINA.2004.1283906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283906","","Cameras;Computer science;Gunshot detection systems;Image databases;Image matching;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Video sequences;Video sharing","content-based retrieval;image matching;image retrieval;video databases","image matching;piecewise method;piecewise refinement;query frame sequence;similarity video retrieval;spatial database;spatial video retrieval;video database;video frame sequences","","0","","11","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Using compressed bytecode traces for slicing Java programs","Tao Wang; A. Roychoudhury","Sch. of Comput., Nat. Univ., Singapore, Singapore","Proceedings. 26th International Conference on Software Engineering","20040726","2004","","","512","521","Dynamic slicing is a well-known program debugging technique. Given a program P and input I, it finds all program statements which directly/indirectly affect the values of some variables' occurrences when P is executed with I. Dynamic slicing algorithms often proceed by traversing the execution trace of P produced by input I (or a dependence graph which captures control/data flow in the execution trace). Consequently, it is important to develop space efficient representations of the execution trace. In this paper, we use results from data compression to compactly represent bytecode traces of sequential Java programs. The major space savings come from the optimized representation of data (instruction) addresses used by memory reference (branch) bytecodes as operands. We give detailed experimental results on the space efficiency and time overheads for our compact trace representation. We then show how dynamic slicing algorithms can directly traverse our compact traces without resorting to costly decompression. We also develop an extension of dynamic slicing which allows us to explain omission errors (i.e. why some events did not happen during program execution).","0270-5257;02705257","POD:0-7695-2163-0","10.1109/ICSE.2004.1317473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317473","","Data compression;Debugging;Flow graphs;Heuristic algorithms;Information retrieval;Java;Programming profession;Read-write memory;Software engineering","Java;data compression;data flow analysis;program debugging;program slicing","Java program slicing;compact traces;compressed bytecode traces;control flow;data compression;data flow;dependence graph;dynamic slicing algorithms;execution trace;memory reference bytecodes;program debugging;program execution;program statements;representation data addresses;sequential Java programs;space savings;trace representation","","20","2","26","","","23-28 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We developed GeneWebEx to effectively mine data of interest in different HTML pages of Web-based databanks, and organize extracted data for further analyses. Gene WebEx utilizes user-defined templates to identify data to extract, and aggregates and structures them in a database designed to allocate the various extractions from distinct biomolecular databanks. Moreover, a template-based module enables automatic updating of extracted data. Validations performed on GeneWebEx allowed us to efficiently gather relevant annotations from various sources, and comprehensively query them to highlight significant biological characteristics.","","POD:0-7695-2173-8","10.1109/BIBE.2004.1317343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1317343","","Bioinformatics;Biological information theory;Biomedical engineering;Data mining;Genomics;HTML;Information retrieval;Oncology;Proteins;Relational databases","Internet;data mining;deductive databases;genetics;medical computing;molecular biophysics","GeneWebEx;Web extraction;Web-based biomolecular databanks;aggregation;data retrieval;databank mining;gene annotation;user-defined queries","","2","","17","","","19-21 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An intermediate structure is employed to judge the validity of a subspace and compute closures more efficiently.

We suggest a new semantic-oriented approach to correct both semantic and lexical errors, which is also more accurate for especially domain-specific speech error correction.

Our approach involves a bottom-up methodology that reuses each block of data in a table to optimize several queries. We define data window as a block of the data residing in the memory brought to the cache. The optimization named data windowing, schedules database queries efficiently by reorganizing queries and its operations based on a data window. Each data window brought into the cache is maximally reused by queries before evicting it from the cache to accommodate another data window. Experimental results show that data windowing yields up to 75% improvement in the cache performance for typical and heavy-duty memory-resident workloads.","1098-8068;10988068","POD:0-7695-2168-1","10.1109/IDEAS.2004.1319802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1319802","","Cost function;Database systems;Information retrieval;Optimization methods;Prefetching;Query processing;Reduced instruction set computing;Software performance;Sorting;System performance","database management systems;query processing","cache performance;data windowing;data-centric approach;memory-resident data retrieval;memory-resident databases;memory-resident workloads;query execution;query optimization;query reorganization;window-based approach","","0","","17","","","7-9 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present an improved version of our earlier work that uses an incremental k-means algorithm to cluster ISVMs. The main advantage of the improved approach is that it is scalable and can accelerate query processing by considering only a small number of cluster representatives, rather than the entire set of accumulated ISVMs. Experimental results against real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7695-2108-8","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286583","","Acceleration;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches;Query processing;Radio frequency;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;image classification;image retrieval;pattern clustering;relevance feedback;support vector machines;visual databases","ISVM clustering;content-based image retrieval;feature space;high level semantics;incremental k-means algorithm;incremental semantic clustering;inter-query learning summarization;intra-query learning;one-class support vector machines;query fuzzy classification;query processing;relevance feedback","","3","","12","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Technologies in software construction are no exception. One of the essential parts of software construction is the underlying programming paradigm. In the last few decades, different software construction paradigms have evolved - for example, structured programming in the 1970s and object-oriented programming in the 1980s. Although OOP dominates current software construction, it introduces several problems that might raise questions about its understandability and efficiency. W. Cave (1995) was the first to propose and develop the separation principle as a programming paradigm. One major contribution is that it moves most complex issues related to data sharing, parameter passing, and scope into a programming model in which simple graphics can represent access to data. The separation principle can simplify or even eliminate these issues. By expressing access permissions in simple, canonical drawings, the separation principle makes it easy to comprehend the full range of relationships between data and instructions, and thus the code's structure. A simple way to show connectivity, a key property affecting program understandability, is by separating data from instructions. Two of prediction systems' flagship products, the visual software environment (VSE) and the general simulation system (GSS), embody this idea. This paper discusses the separation principle in the context of conventional languages such as C and C++.","0740-7459;07407459","","10.1109/MS.2004.1270767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1270767","","Computer networks;Costs;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Permission;Software design","programming environments;software development management","data sharing;general simulation system;object-oriented programming;parameter passing;programming paradigm;separation principle;software construction;structured programming;visual software environment","","9","","15","","","March-April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We advocate fragmentation as a good basis for implementing multi-level security, and to this end we implemented a prototype MLS/DBMS that utilizes the inherent advantages of the distribution scheme in distributed databases for controlling access to single-level fragments. Experiments were instrumented to determine the relative performance of the tuple, attribute, and element level fragmentation schemes. The experiments measured the impact of varying the number of tuples, attributes, security levels, and nodes, for a selection and join query. Overall, our study finds that the attribute level fragmentation scheme demonstrates superior performance to the tuple and element level schemes.

While there exist many algorithms for clustering, the important issue of feature selection, that is, what attributes of the data should be used by the clustering algorithms, is rarely touched upon. Feature selection for clustering is difficult because, unlike in supervised learning, there are no class labels for the data and, thus, no obvious criteria to guide the search. Another important problem in clustering is the determination of the number of clusters, which clearly impacts and is influenced by the feature selection issue. In this paper, we propose the concept of feature saliency and introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate it, in the context of mixture-based clustering. Due to the introduction of a minimum message length model selection criterion, the saliency of irrelevant features is driven toward zero, which corresponds to performing feature selection. The criterion and algorithm are then extended to simultaneously estimate the feature saliencies and the number of clusters.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2004.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1316850","EM algorithm.;Index Terms- Feature selection;clustering;minimum message length;mixture models;unsupervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Computer vision;Data analysis;Degradation;Helium;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","Gaussian processes;maximum likelihood estimation;optimisation;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","Gaussian processes;clustering algorithms;expectation maximization algorithm;feature clustering;feature selection;maximum likelihood estimation;minimum message length model;mixture models;mixture-based clustering;unsupervised learning","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Biological;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","230","2","63","","","Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Most of the techniques proposed so far assume that the two sets are already sorted or utilize preexisting indexing schemes. In contrast, a partition-based technique does not require indexing or sorting. Instead, the containment join is processed by dividing the input sets into smaller partitions. In this paper, we present a new partition-based scheme that gracefully adapts to different document sizes. The advantages of our approach are validated through an experimental comparison with previous work.

TA views the database as a set of d sorted lists storing the feature values. Even though TA is optimal with regard to the number of accesses, its overall access cost can be high since, in practice, some list accesses may be more expensive than others. We therefore propose to make TA access cost aware by choosing the next list to access such that the overall cost is minimized.

If a shape is used as feature, edge detection might be the first step to extract that feature. Invariance to translation, rotation, and scale is required by a good shape representation. Sustaining deformation contour matching is an important issue at the matching process. An efficient and robust shape-based image retrieval system is proposed. We use the Prompt edge detection method [H.J. Lin et al., (2001)] to detect edge points, which is compared with the Sobel edge detection method. We also introduce a shape representation method, the mountain-climbing sequence (MCS), that is invariant to translation, rotation, and scale problems. The results of our proposed method show a superior matching ratio even in the presence of a modest level of deformation.","","POD:0-7695-2087-1","10.1109/ICDCSW.2004.1284018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284018","","Active contours;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image edge detection;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Noise shaping;Robustness;Shape","content-based retrieval;edge detection;feature extraction;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;visual databases","Prompt edge detection;Sobel edge detection;content-based image retrieval;deformation contour matching;feature extraction;feature selection;mountain-climbing sequence;object representation;shape representation;shape-based image retrieval;superior matching ratio","","4","","19","","","23-24 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiresolution triangular mesh (MTM) structures are designed to support applications that use terrain data at variable levels of detail (LOD). Typically, an MTM adopts a tree structure where a parent node represents a lower-resolution approximation of its descendants. Given a region of interest (ROI) and a LOD, the process of retrieving the required terrain data from the database is to traverse the MTM tree from the root to reach all the nodes satisfying the ROI and LOD conditions. This process, while being commonly used for multiresolution terrain visualization, is inefficient as either a large number of sequential I/O operations or fetching a large amount of extraneous data is incurred. Various spatial indexes have been proposed in the past to address this problem, however level-by-level tree traversal remains a common practice in order to obtain topological information among the retrieved terrain data. A new MTM data structure called direct mesh is proposed. We demonstrate that with direct mesh the amount of data retrieval can be substantially reduced. Comparing with existing MTM indexing methods, a significant performance improvement has been observed for real-life terrain data.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2065-0","10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320044","","Application software;Computer science;Data visualization;Information retrieval;Information technology;Layout;Rendering (computer graphics);Sea surface;Spatial resolution;Tree data structures","data visualisation;database indexing;mesh generation;query processing;solid modelling;terrain mapping;tree data structures;visual databases","3D point;data retrieval;data structure;direct mesh;lower-resolution approximation;multiresolution triangular mesh;parent node;region of interest;sequential I/O operation;spatial indexes;terrain data;terrain visualization;tree structure;tree traversal","","3","","21","","","30 March-2 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We compare old experimental and theoretical results for the storage and retrieval of quantum information in atomic dielectrics done on the /sup 23/Na D/sub 1/ lines and based on nonlinear degenerate self-induced transparency (SIT) with more recent experiments and theory based on linearised electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) done on the /sup 87/Rb D/sub 1/ lines. Although the nonlinear SIT theory is very different from the recent linearised EIT theory there are remarkable conceptual similarities at the level of quantum expectation values between the two theories of quantum memory in their modes of storage and retrieval of quantum information. However it has been argued that the linearised theories have the merit of recording information on the atomic dielectric accurate to all (countable) orders of normally ordered correlation functions while this is not true for the nonlinear theories. By working from the closely related theoretical case of the quantum nonlinear dielectric formed from the condensed repulsive Bose gases we bring strong evidence to show that the quantum nonlinear SIT theories can in fact show similar levels of accuracy namely beyond expectation and to all (countable) orders of correlation functions. Up to neglect of incoherence effects the exact quantum theory of EIT is exactly solvable by methods such as the quantum inverse method or Bethe ansatz, and the 3-level /spl Lambda/ atom model of EIT induces dark quantum solitons. We explore the whole set of quantum dielectrics formed by the nonlinear and linearised EIT dielectrics interpreted as quantum memories. We explore how far it is possible in principle to store quantum information accurately for continuous wave optical inputs via a merely countable infinity of correlation functions. We hope to have evaluated quantum correlation functions of arbitrary countable order for the quantum nonlinear EIT system by exact quantum inverse methods and results for quantum mem- ry purposes will be reported. We can already explore the complete Hilbert space for strictly (non-degenerate) resonant SIT at the level of the quantum sine-Gordon equation and quantised breathers here provide generalised qubits for quantum information purposes in which the number of breather states is in general greater than two and is bounded by an adjustable constant coupling in the nonlinearity.","","POD:0-7803-7733-8","10.1109/EQEC.2003.1314271","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1314271","","Atom optics;Dielectrics;Gases;H infinity control;Hilbert space;Information retrieval;Inverse problems;Nonlinear optics;Optical solitons;Quantum mechanics","Bose-Einstein condensation;Hilbert spaces;correlation theory;dark states;optical solitons;optical storage;quantum computing;quantum theory;self-induced transparency;sine-Gordon equation","Bethe ansatz;Hilbert space;atomic dielectrics;breather states;condensed repulsive Bose gases;correlation functions;dark quantum solitons;level /spl Lambda/ atom model;linearised electromagnetically induced transparency;nonlinear degenerate self-induced transparency;quantum information retrieval;quantum information storage;quantum inverse method;quantum memory;quantum sine-Gordon equation;qubits","","0","","2","","","22-27 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TIN, as a component of TerraScope, retrieves images and related information from the distributed database and deals with the effective presentation of this kind of data to the user. TIN allows recursive navigation of the image space by dynamically embedding retrieved sub images as spatial hyperlinks inside other retrieved images. The TIN prototype was implemented using an interactive movie authoring environment (Flash MX) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) to communicate queries and retrieve data and metadata from the server.

Academia and industry have also been challenged to develop realistic applications-from home media library organizers and multimedia lecture archives to broadcast TV content navigators and video-on-demand-in pursuit of the killer application. Current content classification technologies have undoubtedly emerged from traditional image processing and computer vision, audio analysis and processing, and information retrieval.

Many efficient indexing techniques have been developed in this context. Given the improvement in the underlying technology, database applications are increasingly using domain data in transactional semantics. We examine the issue of when during the lifetime of a transaction is it better to incorporate updates in domain indexes. We present our experiences with R-tree indexes in Oracle. We examine two approaches for incorporating updates in spatial R-tree indexes: the first at update time, and the second at commit time. The first approach immediately incorporates changes in the index right away using system transactions and at commit time makes them visible to other transactions. The second approach, referred to as the deferred-incorporate approach, defers the updates in a secondary table and incorporates the changes in the index only at commit time. In experiments on real data sets, we compare the performance of the two approaches. For most transactions with reasonable number of update operations, we observe that the deferred approach outperforms the immediate-incorporate approach significantly for update operations and with appropriate optimizations achieves comparable query performance.","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-2065-0","10.1109/ICDE.2004.1320042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1320042","","Concurrent computing;Genetics;Indexing;Information retrieval;Proposals;Spatial databases;Spatial indexes;Transaction databases;Tree data structures;XML","database indexing;query processing;transaction processing;tree data structures;visual databases","Oracle spatial R-trees;XML;deferred-incorporate approach;domain database;domain indexes;gene sequence data;immediate-incorporate approach;query performance;real data set;retrieval technique;secondary table;spatial database;storage technique;text database;transactional semantics","","0","1","30","","","30 March-2 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that a proxy server, devised to introduce an elastic buffer aimed at decoupling the information retrieval download speed on the outer network from the natural play-out speed used in the vehicular network, results to be an extremely effective approach in reducing the outage probability given by link failure in the outer network (e.g. tunnel crossing).

Multi-dimensional range queries, such as spatial range queries of geographical information for location dependent services, are very popular queries in mobile computing. Query response time is greatly affected by the order in which data items are being broadcast. This paper proposes a non-greedy, low polynomial time cost optimization method to place data over a wireless broadcast channel for multi-dimensional range query processing. Experimental results show that the method, together with proper global constraints based on application semantics, can greatly reduce total access time to the data channel. Compared with the heuristic data placement methods purely based on the access frequencies, the reduction of access time can be as much as 54%.","","POD:0-7695-2070-7","10.1109/MDM.2004.1263071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263071","","Broadcasting;Computer science;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Multidimensional systems;Optimization methods;Query processing;Scalability","broadcast channels;data handling;mobile computing;optimisation;query processing;radio access networks","access frequency;application semantics;data broadcasting;data placement optimization;geographical information;heuristic data placement;location dependent services;low polynomial time cost optimization;mobile computing;multidimensional range query processing;nongreedy optimization;spatial range queries;total access time;wireless broadcast channel","","0","","19","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hierarchical clustering was shown to be effective for evaluating similarity models. Furthermore, visually analyzing cluster hierarchies helps the user, e.g. an engineer, to find and group similar objects.

"A phase signature for detecting wet subsurface structures using polarimetric L-band SAR","Y. Lasne; P. Paillou; T. August-Bernex; G. Ruffie; G. Grandjean","Obs. Aquitain des Sci. de l'Univers, Floirac, France","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20040816","2004","42","8","1683","1694","In this paper, we investigate the ability of L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems to penetrate soils to retrieve information about subsurface wet structures. Our experiment site, the Pyla dune, is a bare sandy area allowing high radar penetration and known to have large wet subsurface structures (paleosoils) at varying depths. Buried paleosoils, which act as moisture tanks, are detectable with radar, since they present a high permittivity due to their water content. By analyzing airborne polarimetric SAR data, we established that a phase signature is correlated to the buried wet palesoils: a phase difference of 23° between the horizontal (HH) and vertical (VV) channels was clearly observed. It allows detection of the paleosoil down to a larger depth (5.2 m) than when only considering HH and HV amplitude signals (3.5 m). In order to confirm this result, field measurements were performed that led to the same observed phase difference. We could fit our observations to the semiempirical model proposed by Oh and Sarabandi, and we reproduced the observed phenomenon using a two-layer integral equation method (IEM) model of the Pyla dune, which was completed by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) numerical simulations. We show that the soil moisture significantly influences the radar response in terms of phase difference between the copolarized modes. Our study also shows that the single-scattering IEM model reproduces the observed phase difference fairly well for a natural outdoor site when combined to FDTD simulation results. This phase signature could be used as a new tool to map subsurface moisture in arid regions.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2004.830645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1323125","FDTD;Finite-difference time-domain;IEM;L-band;SAR;integral equation method;moisture;phase;polarimetry;subsurface;synthetic aperture radar","Finite difference methods;Information retrieval;L-band;Moisture;Phase detection;Radar detection;Radar polarimetry;Soil;Synthetic aperture radar;Time domain analysis","finite difference time-domain analysis;hydrological techniques;integral equations;moisture measurement;radar polarimetry;remote sensing by radar;soil;synthetic aperture radar;terrain mapping","3.5 m;5.2 m;FDTD numerical simulations;HH amplitude signals;HV amplitude signals;L-band synthetic aperture radar systems;Pyla dune;airborne polarimetric SAR data;arid regions;bare sandy area;buried wet paleosoils;finite-difference time-domain;horizontal channels;moisture tanks;permittivity due;phase signature;polarimetric L-band SAR;radar penetration;radar polarimetry;radar response;single-scattering IEM model;soil moisture;subsurface moisture mapping;two-layer integral equation method;vertical channels;water content;wet subsurface structure detection","","19","","37","","","Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It allows the community members to mutually cooperate and share information without loading up any single node excessively. In this paper, an efficient autonomous decentralized community construction technique is proposed to reduce: the communication delays among members with take into consideration the latency among them and the required time to join/leave. This technology organizes the community members into a hierarchy of sub-communities. This paper illustrates the step-step construction technique and the membership management operations for the proposed hierarchical community structure. In addition, it studies the community communication among members to quantify and study the tradeoff between the communication delay and the membership control (join/leave) overhead.","","POD:0-7695-2068-5","10.1109/SAINT.2004.1266097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1266097","","Cellular neural networks;Communication system control;Content based retrieval;Costs;Delay effects;Information retrieval;Information systems;Surges;Terrorism;Web and internet services","Internet;client-server systems;computer network management;delays;public information systems","Internet service providers;autonomous community construction;autonomous community information system;communication delay;community communication;decentralized community construction;end-to-end delay;hierarchical community structure;information sharing;membership control;membership management operations;step-step construction","","2","","21","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
