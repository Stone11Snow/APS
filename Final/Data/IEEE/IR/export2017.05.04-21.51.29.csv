This paper addresses the challenging task of recognizing common objects in color photographic images. We represent images as sets of feature vectors of multiple types of abstract regions, which come from various segmentation processes. We model each abstract region as a mixture of Gaussian distributions over its feature space. We have developed a new semi-supervised version of the EM algorithm for learning the distributions of the object classes. We use supervisory information to tell the procedure the set of objects that exist in each training image, but we do not use any such supervisory information about where (ie. in which regions) the objects are located in the images. Instead, we rely on our EM-like algorithm to break the symmetry in an initial solution that is estimated with error. Experiments are conducted on a set of 860 images to show the efficacy of our approach.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-2128-2","10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1334000","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Gaussian distribution;Image databases;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Object recognition","Gaussian distribution;content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;optimisation;vectors","Gaussian distributions;abstract regions;color photographic images;content based image retrieval;expectation maximization algorithm;feature space;feature vectors;image databases;learning;object class recognition;segmentation processes;supervisory information;training image","","1","","11","","","23-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For their adaptation, they are in need of specific context information, that often has to be derived from other pieces of low-level context information. The process of retrieving context information is highly dynamic since appropriate context sources are often unknown at design time and need to be discovered and understood at runtime. This paper proposes the CoCo concept (context composition) that consists of key infrastructural components supporting the process of context retrieval and context composition, and a graph-oriented language describing the steps that need to be executed to compose context information. CoCo needs an information model specifying the semantics of the information. CoCo is able to automate the process of context retrieving $even in heterogenous environments - to simplify the development and deployment of CASs and to increase their robustness.","","POD:0-7695-2208-4","10.1109/MOBIQ.2004.1331740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331740","","Content addressable storage;Context awareness;Context-aware services;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Pervasive computing;Robustness;Runtime;Temperature;Transportation","graph theory;information retrieval;open systems;ubiquitous computing","context composition;context information retrieval;context-aware services;graph-oriented language;key infrastructural components","","13","","22","","","22-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multiscale Fourier descriptor is formed by applying the complex wavelet transforms to the boundary function of an object extracted from an image.

A positive and a negative space are determined as an approximation of the examples given by the user. The relevant region is represented by a KL subspace of positive examples and is iteratively updated at each feedback iteration. The nonrelevant region is modeled by a MKL space, which better characterizes the variety of negative examples, which very likely could belong to more than one class.

An effective way of addressing this problem is to adopt a ""human-computer"" interactive approach, where the users directly teach the system about what they regard as being significant image features and their own notions of image similarity. We propose a machine learning approach for this task, which allows users to directly modify query characteristics by specifying their attributes in the form of training examples. Specifically, we apply a radial-basis function (RBF) network for implementing an adaptive metric which progressively models the notion of image similarity through continual relevance feedback from users. Experimental results show that the proposed methods not only outperform conventional CBIR systems in terms of both accuracy and robustness, but also previously proposed interactive systems.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2004.834866","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335477","Content-based image retrieval;digital library;machine learning;nonlinear human perception;radial basis function network;relevance feedback","Content based retrieval;Data mining;Feedback;Humans;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Robustness;Shape;Visual system","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;human computer interaction;image retrieval;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;relevance feedback;visual databases;visual perception","CBIR system;RBF network;content-based image retrieval system;digital library;human-computer interface;image similarity;interactive system;machine learning;nonlinear human perception;radial-basis function;relevance feedback;visual information","","46","","35","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Information retrieval techniques can be used to dynamically generate traces and alleviate the need to maintain explicit links, however prior work in this area has focused primarily on establishing intra-requirement links or links between requirements and code. We compare several retrieval techniques for generating links between requirements, code, and UML models. Tracing to UML elements provides a higher perspective on the proposed change than would be possible if links were generated directly to the code and supports the growing trend towards model driven development. Our experiment returned better results for establishing links to UML artifacts than to code, suggesting the usefulness of establishing links to code via UML artifacts. We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of this approach for managing the evolution of a software system.","1550-4077;15504077","POD:0-7695-2211-4","10.1109/IWPSE.2004.1334768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1334768","","Computer science;Documentation;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Performance analysis;Risk management;Software engineering;Software systems;Testing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;information retrieval;object-oriented programming;software maintenance;software prototyping","UML artifacts;explicit links;information retrieval;intra-requirement links;model driven development;software evolution;software system;trace dynamic generation;trace dynamic retrieval;traceability methods","","38","6","16","","","6-7 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The enormous amount of information available in the information sources in a distributed information-providing environment has created a need to provide users with tools to effectively and efficiently navigate and retrieve information. Queries in such an environment often access information from multiple information sources. This may be attributed to navigational characteristics. Clusters provide a structure for organizing the large number of information sources for efficient browsing, searching, and retrieval. This paper presents a stochastically-based clustering mechanism, called the Markov model mediator (MMM), to group the information sources into a set of useful clusters. Each information source cluster groups those information sources that show similarities in their data access behavior. Information sources within the same cluster are expected to be able to provide most of the required information among themselves for user queries that are closely related with respect to a particular application. This can significantly improve system response time, query performance, and result in an overall improvement in decision support. Empirical studies on real databases are performed and the results demonstrate that our proposed mechanism leads to a better set of clusters in comparison with other clustering methods. This serves to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed MMM mechanism.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2004.833599","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335498","","Clustering methods;Data analysis;Data mining;Databases;Delay;Engineering management;Information retrieval;Navigation;Organizing;Stochastic processes","Markov processes;data mining;distributed databases;information resources;information retrieval;pattern clustering","Markov model mediator;data access behavior;decision support;distributed information source;information navigation;information retrieval;query performance;stochastic clustering;system response time","Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computer Communication Networks;Database Management Systems;Databases, Factual;Information Storage and Retrieval;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Stochastic Processes;Systems Integration;User-Computer Interface","6","","54","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, a relevance feedback technique based on the nearest-neighbor rule is proposed. For each image of the database, a relevance score is computed as the ratio between the distances from the nearest non-relevant and relevant images respectively.

Such a capability is also essential to perform impact analysis. This work proposes an automatic approach, inspired on vector space information retrieval, to identify class evolution discontinuities and, therefore, cases of possible refactoring.

To the best of our knowledge, no published work investigates the content-based music style retrieval. This paper describes an approach for CBMR by melody style. We proposed four types of query specification for melody style query. The output of the melody style query is a music list ranked by the degree of relevance, in terms of music style, to the query. We developed the melody style mining algorithm to obtain the melody style classification rules. The style ranking is determined by the style classification rules. The experiment showed the proposed approach provides a satisfactory way for query by melody style.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336130","","Application software;Art;Computer interfaces;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Databases;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Software libraries","content-based retrieval;data mining;music;pattern classification;query formulation","content-based music retrieval;melody style classification rules;melody style mining algorithm;melody style query;query specification;style ranking","","0","2","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If there is a reason for them to share these personal annotations online, they must re-enter them. Given the advent of better computer support for reading and annotation, including tablet interfaces, do people ever share their personal digital ink annotations as is, or do they make substantial changes to them? What can we do to anticipate and support the transition from personal to public annotations? To investigate these questions, we performed a study to characterize and compare students' personal annotations as they read assigned papers with those they shared with each other using an online system. By analyzing over 1,700 annotations, we confirmed three hypotheses: (1) only a small fraction of annotations made while reading are directly related to those shared in discussion; (2) some types of annotations - those that consist of anchors in the text coupled with margin notes - are more apt to be the basis of public commentary than other types of annotations; and (3) personal annotations undergo dramatic changes when they are shared in discussion, both in content and in how they are anchored to the source document. We then use these findings to explore ways to support the transition from personal to public annotations.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336148","","Brushes;Collaborative work;Computer interfaces;Computer science;Documentation;Human factors;Information retrieval;Ink;Software libraries;User interfaces","Internet;digital libraries;document handling;groupware;user interfaces","annotation system design;computer supported reading;digital ink annotation;digital library;education;online discussion;online system;personal annotation;printed document;public annotation;public commentary;tablet interface","","7","6","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigated the problems of traditional focused crawlers caused by local search algorithms and proposed a new crawling approach, meta-search enhanced focused crawling, to address the problems.

To answer this question, we empirically compared the use of unstructured queries to the use of structured queries. We then tested the capability of a simple Bayesian network system, built on top of a DL retrieval engine, to infer the best structured queries from the keywords entered by the user. Experiments performed with 20 subjects working with a DL containing a large collection of computer science literature clearly indicate that structured queries, either manually constructed or automatically generated, perform better than their unstructured counterparts, in the majority of cases. Also, automatic structuring of queries appears to be an effective and viable alternative to manual structuring that may significantly reduce the burden users.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336106","","Bayesian methods;Computer science;Engines;Information retrieval;Information systems;Information technology;Permission;Software libraries;System testing;User interfaces","digital libraries;query processing","Bayesian network system;DL retrieval engine;automatically structured query;computer science literature;digital library;metadata","","0","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim is to traverse a small subset of the database during retrieval. This is made possible by exploiting the multi-resolution capability of spherical wavelet features to successively approximate the salient characteristics of the head models, which are encoded in the form of weight vectors associated with the nodes at different levels (from coarse to fine) of the HSOM. To avoid premature commitment to a possibly erroneous model class, search is propagated from a subset of nodes at each level, which is selected based on a fuzzy membership measure between the query feature vector and weight vector, instead of taking the winner-take-all approach. Experiments show that, in addition to efficiency improvement, model retrieval based on the HSOM approach is able to achieve a much higher accuracy compared with the case where no indexing is performed.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-2128-2","10.1109/ICPR.2004.1333847","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333847","","Application software;Computer aided manufacturing;Computer science;Head;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Organizing;Shape;Spatial databases","database indexing;fuzzy set theory;image retrieval;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;unsupervised learning;vectors","3D models;database organisation;fuzzy membership;head model partitioning;hierarchical SOM;hierarchical indexing structure;multiresolution capability;query feature vector;salient characteristics successive approximation;self organizing map;spherical wavelet features;unsupervised clustering;weight vector","","6","1","9","","","23-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Image-space visibility ordering for cell projection volume rendering of unstructured data","R. Cook; N. Max; C. T. Silva; P. L. Williams","Lawrence Livermore Nat. Lab., CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","20040913","2004","10","6","695","707","Projection methods for volume rendering unstructured data work by projecting, in visibility order, the polyhedral cells of the mesh onto the image plane, and incrementally compositing each cell's color and opacity into the final image. Normally, such methods require an algorithm to determine a visibility order of the cells. The meshed polyhedra visibility order (MPVO) algorithm can provide such an order for convex meshes by considering the implications of local ordering relations between cells sharing a common face. However, in nonconvex meshes, one must also consider ordering relations along viewing rays which cross empty space between cells. In order to include these relations, the algorithm described in this paper, the scanning exact meshed polyhedra visibility ordering (SXMPVO) algorithm, scan-converts the exterior faces of the mesh and saves the ray-face intersections in an A-buffer data structure which is then used for retrieving the extra ordering relations. The image which SXMPVO produces is the same as would be produced by ordering the cells exactly, even though SXMPVO does not compute an exact visibility ordering. This is because the image resolution used for computing the visibility ordering relations is the same as that which is used for the actual volume rendering and we choose our A-buffer rays at the same sample points that are used to establish a polygon's pixel coverage during hardware scan conversion. Thus, the algorithm is image-space correct. The SXMPVO algorithm has several desirable features; among them are speed, simplicity of implementation, and no extra (i.e., with respect to MPVO) preprocessing.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2004.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333667","65;Index Terms- Volume rendering;unstructured mesh.;visibility ordering","Data structures;Finite element methods;Hardware;Image resolution;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Mesh generation;Pixel;Rendering (computer graphics);Sorting","data structures;data visualisation;image colour analysis;image resolution;mesh generation;rendering (computer graphics)","A-buffer data structure;cell projection volume rendering;convex meshes;hardware scan conversion;image plane;image resolution;image-space visibility ordering;meshed polyhedra visibility order algorithm;polygon pixel coverage;ray-face intersection;unstructured data","","11","","32","","","Nov.-Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

ICPR 2004.","20040920","2004","3","","862","865 Vol.3","In music theory, a key specifies the tonal structure of a music piece. Popular songs are mostly composed using particular music keys. It is common that the key changes at some point of the piece for an emotional uplifting effect. The change is usually in pitch of the tonic rather than in key style. Automatically segmenting melody based on the key changes can facilitate content-based music retrieval. Little work has been done for this problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach for detecting multiple keys and locating the key boundaries in the melody of popular songs in MIDI format. A tonality analysis of the melody using diatonic scale model first extracts overlapping segments of the melody that each conforms to the tonal structure of a single key. A modality (key style) analysis then determines the center mode of the melody based on the modes of the extracted melody segments. The segments of unrelated modes are then eliminated, and finally the keys and the key boundaries are determined by grouping remaining segments according to the pitch of the tonic. The proposed method is not confined to the two key styles, major and minor, as the previous techniques. Thus, this method is effective for detecting key changes and insensitive to the presence of accidental notes. Experimental results on 50 randomly selected MIDI songs have demonstrated the performance of the proposed method.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-2128-2","10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1334664","","Content based retrieval;Filters;Humans;Music information retrieval;Probes;Spirals","audio signal processing;electronic music;music","MIDI format;content based music retrieval;diatonic scale model;emotional uplifting effect;key based melody segmentation;modality analysis;multiple key detection;music piece tonal structure;music theory;overlapping segment extraction;popular songs;tonality analysis","","3","","6","","","23-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These high bit rates are leading to a plethora of new wireless services that broadly fall into three categories: information retrieval; mobile commerce; general communication. Next-generation wireless services enables users to carry out specialized, elaborate functions by combining component services offered by various sources.

Spin images are used to derive a view-independent description of both database and query objects. A set of spin images is first created for each object and the parts it is composed of; then, a descriptor is evaluated for each spin image in the set; clustering is performed on the set of image-based descriptors of each object to achieve a compact representation.

Because of this research into retrieval and indexing schemes has focused on the development of various 3D to 2D mappings that characterise a shape as a histogram with a small number of parameters. Many methods of generating such 2D signatures (i.e. histograms) have been proposed, generally based on geometric measures of say curvature or distance. However these geometric signatures lack information about topology and tend to become indistinct as the complexity of the shape increases. This work describes a new method for characterising both the geometry and topology of shapes in a single 2D graph, the surface partitioning spectrum (SPS).

Since the background often dominates the subject in the foreground, a special query selection method was developed. It combines the salient region-of-interest/query-by-example paradigm with coarse segmentation to remove the irrelevant background regions. The proposed search method looks for similar features across all block positions and at several scales. Existing local grid-based methods are constrained by searching for objects in the same position as the query object. Using this framework, the spatial constraint can be eliminated, and steps toward scale invariance can be taken.

Examples include pattern recognition, noise removal, information retrieval, and combinatorial optimization problems. This paper provides an algorithm for implementing the Hopfield ANN on mesh parallel architectures. A Hopfield ANN model involves two major operations; broadcasting a value to a set of processors and summation of values in a set of processors. The main advantage of this algorithm is a high performance and cost effectiveness. An iteration of an N-bit (neuron) Hopfield associative memory only requires O(logN) time, whereas other known algorithms in literature of similar topology require O(N) time. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is cost effective because only higher dimension architectures were reported to achieve a complexity of O(logN) such as hypercubes.","","POD:0-7803-8251-X","10.1109/ISCAS.2004.1329929","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1329929","","Artificial neural networks;Associative memory;Broadcasting;Costs;Hypercubes;Information retrieval;Neurons;Parallel architectures;Pattern recognition;Topology","Hopfield neural nets;content-addressable storage;parallel architectures;systolic arrays","Hopfield ANN model;Hopfield associative memory;artificial neural network;combinatorial optimization problems;cost effective architectures;hypercube architecture;information retrieval;mesh parallel architectures;noise removal;pattern recognition","","0","1","11","","","23-26 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to select a subset of features from a large-scale feature pool and to construct a suitable dissimilarity measure are key steps in RF. Biased discriminant analysis (BDA) has been proposed to select features during relevance feedback iterations. However, BDA assumes all positive feedbacks form a single Gaussian distribution, which may not be the case for CBIR. Although kernel BDA can overcome the drawback to some extent, the kernel parameter tuning makes the online learning unfeasible. To avoid the parameter tuning problem and the single Gaussian distribution assumption in BDA, we construct a new nonparametric discriminant analysis (NDA). To address the small sample size problem in NDA, we introduce the regularization method and the -space method. Because the regularization method may meet the ill-posed problem and the -space method will lose some discriminant information, we proposed here a full-space method. The proposed full-space NDA is demonstrated to outperform BDA based RF significantly based on a large number of experiments in Corel database with 17,800 images.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-2128-2","10.1109/ICPR.2004.1334431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1334431","","Content based retrieval;Gaussian distribution;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kernel;Negative feedback;Radio frequency;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;nonparametric statistics;relevance feedback;visual databases","Corel database;biased discriminant analysis;content-based image retrieval;full-space method;nonparametric discriminant analysis;relevance feedback;single Gaussian distribution","","11","","11","","","23-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

TERSEO implements a method of event ordering based on temporal expression recognition and resolution. TERSEO consists of two different modules, the first module is based on a set of rules that allows the recognition of the temporal expressions in Spanish. The second module is based on a set of rules that allows the resolution of these temporal expressions (which means transforming them into a concrete date, concrete interval or fuzzy interval). Both sets of rules were defined through an empirical study of a training corpus. The extension of the system, that makes the system able to work with multilingual texts, has been made in five stages. First, a direct translation of the temporal expressions in Spanish of our knowledge database to the target language (English, Italian, French, Catalan, etc) is performed. Each expression in the target language is linked to the same resolution rule used in the source language. The second stage is a search in Google for each expression so that we eliminate all those expressions of which non exact instances are found. The third step is the obtaining of a set of keywords in the target language, that is used in the next step to look for new temporal expressions in this language, learning new rules automatically. Finally, every new rule is linked with its resolution. Besides, we present two evaluations: an evaluation of the results obtained in the extension of the system to English and an evaluation of TERSEO system in English using this automatic acquisition of new temporal expressions in which measures of precision and recall are obtained.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2195-9","10.1109/DEXA.2004.1333444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333444","","Concrete;Databases;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Proposals;Software libraries;System testing;Text recognition","knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;natural languages;statistical analysis;temporal databases","Google search;automatic multilingual acquisition;event ordering;fuzzy interval;knowledge database;monolingual TERSEO system;multilingual text;resolution rule;temporal expression recognition;temporal expression resolution system","","2","3","12","","","30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resulted watermarked binary image is an enhancement to the original image in terms of smoothness. The fast computational speed and time complexity makes the method suitable for real-time authentication. Retrieval of the watermark doesn't require the presence of the original binary document image. However the secret key and the location map information are needed for the retrieval. The watermark used in the algorithm is the gold-like sequence.

Based on the statistical properties of the feature space we define a structure, called α-semantics graph, to discover the hidden semantic relationships among the semantic repositories embodied in the image database. With the α-semantics graph, each semantic repository is modeled as a unique fuzzy set to explicitly address the semantic uncertainty and the semantic overlap existing among the repositories in the feature space. A retrieval algorithm combining the built classification tree with the developed fuzzy set models to deliver semantically relevant image retrieval is provided.

Similarity measures are then created for the extracted descriptors and introduced into a 3D model-matching algorithm. This results to a very fast and accurate matching method. Experiments were performed using two different databases and comparing the proposed method with others. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be used for 3D model search and retrieval in a highly efficient manner.","","POD:0-7695-2223-8","10.1109/TDPVT.2004.1335419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1335419","","Data mining;Histograms;Informatics;Information processing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Shape measurement;Solid modeling;Telematics;Volume measurement","Radon transforms;computational geometry;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image matching;solid modelling","3D Radon transform;3D model search;content-based retrieval;feature extraction;shape matching","","4","1","17","","","9-9 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We explore the feasibility of a completely trainable approach to the automated question answering on the Web or large scale digital libraries. By using the inherent redundancy of large scale collections, each candidate answer found by the system is triangulated (confirmed or disconfirmed) against other possible answers. Since our approach is entirely self-learning and does not involve any linguistic resources it can be easily implemented within digital libraries or Web search portals.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336147","","Databases;Government;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Natural languages;Pattern matching;Portals;Software libraries;Web pages;Web search","Internet;Web sites;digital libraries;information filters;natural languages;portals;search engines;unsupervised learning","AOL;AltaVista;Google;Web pages;Web question answering;Web search portals;Yahoo;automatically learned patterns;candidate answer;keyword based access;large scale collection redundancy;large scale digital libraries;linguistic resources;natural language;self-learning","","1","","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose an approach based on modeling the visual part of the rendered document and describing the key characteristics of the data presentation in a general way. As a next step, we propose the way for using this model for locating the instances of the concepts in the document using the approximate tree matching algorithms and regular expressions.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2195-9","10.1109/DEXA.2004.1333471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333471","","Databases;HTML;Information retrieval;Information technology;Joining processes;Navigation;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Solids;Web sites","hypermedia markup languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;text analysis;tree data structures;very large databases","HTML code;HTML document;data presentation;regular expression;semantic Web ontology;tree matching algorithm","","5","","21","","","30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, while these tools provide significant help with short-term reading projects involving small numbers of documents, they provide less help with longer-term reading projects, in which a topic is to be understood in depth by reading many documents. For such projects, readers must Find and manage many documents and citations, remember what has been read, and prioritize what to read next. We describe three integrated software tools that facilitate in-depth reading. A first tool extracts citation information from documents. A second finds on-line documents from their citations. The last is a document corpus browser that uses a zoomable user interface to show a corpus at multiple granularities while supporting reading tasks that take days, weeks, or longer. We describe these tools and the design principles that motivated them.","","POD:1-58113-832-6","10.1109/JCDL.2004.240410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1336104","","Data mining;Information retrieval;Memory management;Permission;Project management;Search engines;Software libraries;Software tools;User interfaces;Visualization","Internet;digital libraries;document handling;online front-ends;search engines;user interfaces","Web browser;digital library;document corpus browser;e-book;electronic document format;in-depth reading;information extraction;on-line document;search engine;short-term reading project;software tool;zoomable user interface","","0","10","","","","11-11 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Vector data format is used to implement vague objects. We store vague objects by extending GRASS vector format capabilities. A point is represented by a triple, containing the location and the membership value of the point. A line is represented by a sequence of triples, each containing the location and the membership value of a point on the line. A region is represented by a set of lines, which depict important characteristics of the region. Data structures are defined to put constraints on the stored data, so that desired properties for vague objects are satisfied. To complete (approximate) information about lines and regions, a linear interpolation and a triangulation-based interpolation method are used, respectively. Modules are built to edit and retrieve information of vague objects. A union operator on vague objects is also implemented.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2195-9","10.1109/DEXA.2004.1333600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333600","","Data structures;Forestry;Fuzzy sets;Geographic Information Systems;Geology;Geoscience;Information retrieval;Interpolation;Soil;Vegetation mapping","data structures;geographic information systems;information retrieval;interpolation;visual databases","GRASS vector format;data structures;information retrieval;linear interpolation;triangulation-based interpolation method;vague spatial objects;vector data format","","4","","13","","","30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the volume of those data enormously increase, it is quite difficult to search and retrieve the desired data among them. More efficient and effective search and retrieval method are required to recover from this problem. In particular, the traditional industrial products such as Japanese crafts have various kinds of attributes and cannot be simply classified to take advantage of the conventional relational database system and retrieval system as opposed to the modern industrial products. In order to overcome those difficulties, we propose tradition industrial arts description language DCML with the use of half structure data model (Digital Crafting Mark up Language). Using DCML, database system for traditional industrial products can be easily defined and implemented to retrieve the desired objects by reflecting the user's feeling.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-2195-9","10.1109/DEXA.2004.1333498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1333498","","Art;Data models;Graphics;High-speed networks;Industrial relations;Information retrieval;Natural languages;Proposals;Relational databases;World Wide Web","XML;art;data models;information retrieval;multimedia databases;tree data structures","Digital Crafting Mark up Language;Web;XML;data model;handicraft searching;industrial arts description language;information retrieval;tree data structure","","1","","6","","","30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simple tool that can retrieve information from different Web sites through a single interface and store the extracted data in a standardized format for efficient future use is critical to scientific discovery. We discuss an approach that combines agent and database technologies for biological data integration. To illustrate this, we employ two software tools: WinAgent, for building agents, and dbXML, for XML data management. WinAgent learns from its users by recording a browsing session on Web sites and successive data extraction from regions of interest on retrieved Web pages. The results are stored in a XML document and can be managed, queried and updated using a native XML database system such as dbXML.
