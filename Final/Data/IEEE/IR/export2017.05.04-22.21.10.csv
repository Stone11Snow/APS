These contents, normally in forms of RDF triples, make the Internet a huge knowledge base. Hence, the Internet now empowers virtual communities than ever before. This paper introduces a framework for web publishing community that focuses on a domain of interest. The system starts from a predefined domain ontology, and crawls resources from the web of data. By semantic match making, the system facilitates users finding related resources and sharing content. The knowledge base can evolve with users' participation.

"Interactive Exploration of Surveillance Video through Action Shot Summarization and Trajectory Visualization","A. H. Meghdadi; P. Irani","Department of Computer Science, University of Manitoba","IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","20131016","2013","19","12","2119","2128","We propose a novel video visual analytics system for interactive exploration of surveillance video data. Our approach consists of providing analysts with various views of information related to moving objects in a video. To do this we first extract each object's movement path. We visualize each movement by (a) creating a single action shot image (a still image that coalesces multiple frames), (b) plotting its trajectory in a space-time cube and (c) displaying an overall timeline view of all the movements. The action shots provide a still view of the moving object while the path view presents movement properties such as speed and location. We also provide tools for spatial and temporal filtering based on regions of interest. This allows analysts to filter out large amounts of movement activities while the action shot representation summarizes the content of each movement. We incorporated this multi-part visual representation of moving objects in sViSIT, a tool to facilitate browsing through the video content by interactive querying and retrieval of data. Based on our interaction with security personnel who routinely interact with surveillance video data, we identified some of the most common tasks performed. This resulted in designing a user study to measure time-to-completion of the various tasks. These generally required searching for specific events of interest (targets) in videos. Fourteen different tasks were designed and a total of 120 min of surveillance video were recorded (indoor and outdoor locations recording movements of people and vehicles). The time-to-completion of these tasks were compared against a manual fast forward video browsing guided with movement detection. We demonstrate how our system can facilitate lengthy video exploration and significantly reduce browsing time to find events of interest. Reports from expert users identify positive aspects of our approach which we summarize in our recommendations for future video visual analytics systems.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2013.168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6634090","Data visualization;Image segmentation;Interactive states;Navigation;Surveillance;Tracking;Video visual analytics;Visual analytics;surveillance video;video browsing and exploration;video summarization;video visualization","Data visualization;Image segmentation;Interactive states;Navigation;Surveillance;Tracking;Visual analytics","data analysis;data visualisation;image representation;information retrieval;spatial filters;video signal processing;video surveillance","action shot representation;action shot summarization;manual fast forward video browsing;movement detection;movements overall timeline;multipart visual representation;object movement path extraction;regions-of-interest;sViSIT;single action shot image;space-time cube;spatial filtering;surveillance video data interactive exploration;tasks time-to-completion;temporal filtering;trajectory visualization;video visual analytics system","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Graphics;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Photography;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;User-Computer Interface;Video Recording","14","2","33","","","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This work proposes a method, TravelLight, which improves interactive traveling across very large temporal datasets by exploring the temporal consistency of data items. The proposed method consists of two algorithms: the data retrieval and the memory management algorithm, both contributing to improve memory usage and, most important, to reduce the turnaround time. Results are reported concerning experiments with a temporally linear navigation across two datasets of one million items, which differ in the average time span of items.

SoR performs stream reconstruction and selection using string matching. After on-the-fly reconstruction of stream data, SoR extracts the required information using a software-based character string analyzer. For wire-rate string matching and for design flexibility, a software-based string-matching accelerator is required.

We argue that, given the envisioned diversity, capabilities, and sheer number of smart things, this obstructs the possibility of creating diverse and exciting applications that benefit of the generated information in public, global usage scenarios. In this paper, we thus aim to initiate the discussion of creating a true Internet of Things, i.e., interconnected IoT networks, based on provision and requests of generated information in a public infrastructure. We highlight the challenges in designing this infrastructure for feasible integration in the current Internet and IoT designs, comprehensive provision and retrieval of information, and versatile derivation of higher information contexts from single information sources.

For a social storage system to keep pace with increasing amounts of user data and activities, a natural solution is to deploy more servers. An important design problem then is how to partition the data across the servers so that server efficiency and load balancing can both be maximized. Although data partitioning is well-studied in the literature of distributed data systems, social data storage presents a unique challenge because of the social locality in data access: we need to factor in not only how actively users read and write their own data but also how often socially connected users read the data of one another. We investigate the socially aware data partitioning problem by modeling it as a multi-objective optimization problem and exploring the applicability of evolutionary algorithms in order to achieve highly-efficient and well-balanced data partitions.

Presenting large software systems visually to support reverse engineering requires having the right summary to convey the important details. An experienced engineer knows the important details and can customize the view accordingly. In a reverse engineering context without this upfront knowledge and experience, any derived insights are strongly dependent on the (perhaps incorrectly) chosen view. We propose a lightweight visual approach to reverse engineering that supports users in interactively extracting high-level information from software at large scales with little or no upfront system knowledge. To support this we provide a matrix-based visualization method capable of displaying full systems in space-constrained views. The view visually emphasizes high level structural properties and employs a novel dependency display method to summarize and aggregate dependencies as the view changes, eliminating the need for user-directed aggregation decisions.

When investigating the identity of criminals LEAs may apply totally different technical tools than when gathering evidences for charge, because the data provided by investigating may not be valid in court. For that reason, a new monitoring system that goes beyond state of the art is needed. Three organizational layers need attentions: 1) LEA, the people that actually retrieve and store the information. 2) Prosecutors and their offices, how they get access to the information. 3) Courts, the final destination of the retrieved information. Until now, the information gathering tools for LEAs have been engineered focusing only on the best way to retrieve the information from the target.

As users' behaviours and social statuses play a more important role in CQA services than traditional answer retrieving websites, researchers' concerns have shifted from the need to passively find existing answers to actively seeking potential reply providers that may give answers in the near future. We analyse datasets derived from an online CQA system named “Quora”, and observed that compared with traditional question answering services, users tend to contribute replies rather than questions for help in the CQA system. Inspired by the findings, we seek ways to evaluate the users' ability to offer prompt and reliable help, taking into account activity, authority and social reputation characteristics.

Gallery codes are decomposed at multiple scales, and according to their most reliable components at each scale, the position in an n-ary tree determined. In retrieval, the probe is decomposed similarly, and the distances to multiscale centroids are used to penalize paths in the tree. At the end, only a subset of the branches is traversed up to the last level. When compared with related strategies, the proposed method outperforms them on degraded data, particularly in the performance range most important for biometrics .

Recently, topic models have been successfully used in SDR as well as general information retrieval (IR). These models fall into two categories: probabilistic topic models (PTM) and non-probabilistic topic models (NPTM). One major difference between PTM and NPTM is that the former only takes the words occurring in a document into account, whereas the latter, such as latent semantic analysis (LSA), explicitly models all the words in the vocabulary (including both occurring and non-occurring words). We believe that the non-occurring words can provide additional information that is also useful for SDR. However, to our best knowledge, there is a dearth of work investigating the effectiveness of the non-occurring words for SDR and IR. In order to make effective use of those non-occurring words of documents for semantic analysis, we propose a weighted matrix factorization (WMF) framework, in which the impact of the non-occurring words on the semantic analysis can be modulated properly. The results of SDR experiments conducted on the TDT-2 (Topic Detection and Tracking) collection highlight the performance merits of our proposed framework when compared to several existing topic models.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-0356-6; POD:978-1-4799-0357-3; USB:978-1-4799-0355-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639330","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6639330","Spoken document retrieval;non-occurring words;non-probabilistic;topic model","Abstracts","information retrieval;matrix decomposition;probability;speech processing","IR;LSA;NPTM;PTM;SDR;TDT-2 collection;WMF framework;general information retrieval;latent semantic analysis;multimedia data;nonprobabilistic topic models;probabilistic topic models;public spoken document retrieval;topic detection and tracking collection;weighted matrix factorization","","2","","26","","","26-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Movie summarization, being a special class of video summarization, is particularly challenging since a large variety of movie scenarios and film styles complicate the problem. In this paper, we propose a two-stage scene-based movie summarization method based on mining the relationship between role-communities since the role-communities in earlier scenes are usually used to develop the role relationship in later scenes. In the analysis stage, we construct a social network to characterize the interactions between role-communities. As a result, the social power of each role-community is evaluated by the community's centrality value and the role communities are clustered into relevant groups based on the centrality values. In the summarization stage, a set of feasible summary combinations of scenes is identified and an information-rich summary is selected from these candidates based on social power preservation. Our evaluation results show that in at most test cases the proposed method achieves better subjective performance than attention-based and role-based summarization methods in terms of semantic content preservation for a movie summary.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2269186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6542654","Movie analysis;movie summarization;social network analysis;video adaptation;video summarization","","information retrieval;multimedia communication;video signal processing","attention-based summarization method;community centrality value;film style;full-length video;movie scenario;role-based summarization method;role-communities;role-community networks;scene summary combination;semantic content;semantic content preservation;social network;social power preservation;two-stage scene-based movie summarization method;video summarization technique","","14","","34","","20130618","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper presents a hardware accelerator that efficiently extracts features from audio data. The architecture is designed for Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) and Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Quantitative results confirm a speed up of up to factor 5 compared to an Intel Core i7 2640M CPU with a concurrent reduced power consumption of at least factor 7 regarding the FPGA implementation. Furthermore, the ASIC implementation is up to 70000 times more energy efficient than a CPU and is therefore suitable even for mobile devices.","2378-8143;23788143","Electronic:978-1-4799-0892-9; POD:978-1-4799-0891-2","10.1109/GCCE.2013.6664775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664775","","Application specific integrated circuits;Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Power demand","acoustic signal detection;acoustic signal processing;application specific integrated circuits;audio signal processing;feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;information retrieval;integrated circuit design;mobile computing;music;signal classification","ASIC;FPGA;MIR;advanced audio signal processing;application-specific integrated circuits;artist detection;auditory scene recognition;comfortable huge music database management;consumer products;energy consumption;energy-efficient acoustic feature extraction;field programmable gate arrays;hardware architecture;hardware-accelerator design;mobile devices;music classification;music information retrieval","","1","","12","","","1-4 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed a maximum subsequence segmentation (MSS) algorithm and discussed its application in the domain of news web sites. Differing from the tree structure analysis and VIPS, the algorithm divided the web into text segmentation and label segmentation.

Based on the analysis of features of cheating clicks, a novel automatic click spam detection approach is proposed in this paper, which consists of: 1) detect the single click record spam, by which 0.54% of all the clicks are detected as spams; 2) model user sessions with a triple sequence which by the first time, to be best of our knowledge, takes not only user action, but also action object and time interval between actions into consideration in related research; 3) based on the detected single click record spam and other features, find seed cheating session modes; and then use bipartite graph iterative algorithm to get higher precision and recall of click spam detection. Experiments have been made on Chinese commercial search engine real log data, containing around 80 million user clicks per day. As a result, 2.1% of all the clicks can be detected as spams, and the precision reaches to 97%.

Users through their activities on these networks are leaving traces of their expertise, interests and personalities. With the advances in Web mining and user modeling techniques it is possible to leverage the user social network activity history to extract the semantics of user-generated content. In this work we explore various techniques for constructing user profiles based on the content they publish on social networks. We further show that one of the advantages of maintaining social network user profiles is to provide the context for better understanding of microposts. We propose and experimentally evaluate different approaches for entity disambiguation in social networks based on syntactic and semantic features on top of two different social networks: a general-interest network (i.e., Twitter) and a domain-specific network (i.e., StackOverflow). We demonstrate how disambiguation accuracy increases when considering enriched user profiles integrating content from both social networks.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1050-2; POD:978-1-4799-2669-5; USB:978-1-4799-1049-6","10.1109/IRI.2013.6642462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6642462","","Companies;Context;Data mining;Semantics;Twitter;User-generated content","content management;data mining;information retrieval;natural language processing;programming language semantics;social networking (online);ubiquitous computing;user modelling","Twitter;Web mining;domain-specific network;entity disambiguation;micropost;pervasive Web network;semantic feature;semantics extraction;social network user profile;syntactic feature;user generated content;user modeling technique;user social network activity;user social profile","","1","","30","","","14-16 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This difference leads to deterioration in the performance of the system. Hence, there is a requirement to carry out sampling rate compensation. It is proposed to introduce a sampling rate compensation block in the language identification system. Sampling rate compensation ensures that the system is independent of the effects of sampling rate variation between the test and training language data. Also, it is proposed to use gender based language models. This approach has better performance in terms of language identification task and it also gives the gender of the speaker. Gender information extracted is useful when gender based user classification is being carried out or while providing customized gender based services. This technique of gender based language identification along with sampling rate compensation has been found to improve results for both the Vector Quantization codebook and Gaussian Mixture Model for languages.

Although Hadoop clusters are highly scalable and ensure data availability in the face of server failures, their efficiency is poor. We study data placement as a potential source of inefficiency. Despite networking improvements that have narrowed the performance gap between map tasks that access local or remote data, we find that nodes servicing remote HDFS requests see significant slowdowns of collocated map tasks due to interference effects, whereas nodes making these requests do not experience proportionate slowdowns. To reduce remote accesses, and thus avoid their destructive performance interference, we investigate an intelligent data placement policy we call 'partitioned data placement'. We find that, in an unconstrained cluster where a job's map tasks may be scheduled dynamically on any node over time, Hadoop's default random data placement is effective in avoiding remote accesses. However, when task placement is restricted by long-running jobs or other reservations, partitioned data placement substantially reduces remote access rates (e.g., by as much as 86% over random placement for a job allocated only one-third of a cluster).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4979-8; POD:978-1-4799-1372-5","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6651096","Hadoop;MapReduce;data placement;remote accesses","Availability;Bandwidth;Delays;Interference;Resource management;Runtime;Servers","distributed databases;distributed programming;information retrieval;pattern classification;pattern clustering;public domain software","Hadoop cluster;Hadoop default random data placement;MapReduce cluster;data availability;distributed processing;intelligent data placement policy;interference effect;placement data partitioning;remote HDFS request;remote data access;server cluster;server failure;unconstrained cluster","","2","","26","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intelligent search in those communities may support users to obtain their own needed information. As other social networks there are different types of entities in a learning community, such as learning materials, `similar' persons, learning groups, tags. Accordingly there may be different relationships among them. We argue that those data can be accurately modeled by heterogeneous networks, and explore unified intelligent search that incorporates different types of entities using a spreading activation approach. We propose ISC-Search, which provides users with three types of search possibilities/strategies, in addition to the traditional one, and give them choices to fit their own information needs. These different search strategies leverage social data and content data in different ways to satisfy users' needs. They are (1) Intelligent search, which finds the relevant entities of different types in an online learning community; (2) Social first search, which searches first by social relationships; (3) Content first search, which finds the relevant entities first by content; (4) traditional search, which focuses on the search words themselves.

In this paper we introduce an approach, based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), to extract coded information islands, such as source code, stack traces, and patches, from free text at a token level of granularity. We train a HMM for each category of information contained in the text, and adopt the Viterbi algorithm to recognize whether the sequence of tokens-e.g., words, language keywords, numbers, parentheses, punctuation marks, etc.-observed in a text switches among those HMMs. Although our implementation focuses on extracting source code from emails, the approach could be easily extended to include in principle any text-interleaved language. We evaluated our approach with respect to the state of art on a set of development emails and bug reports drawn from the software repositories of well known open source systems. Results indicate an accuracy between 82% and 99%, which is in line with existing approaches which, differently from ours, require the manual definition of regular expressions or parsers.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5739-5; POD:978-1-4673-5738-8","10.1109/SCAM.2013.6648197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6648197","HMM;Mailing list mining;Natural Language Parsing","Accuracy;Context;Electronic mail;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Natural languages;Syntactics","hidden Markov models;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","HMM;Viterbi algorithm;coded information island extraction;emails;free text;hidden Markov model;issue reports;natural language;open source systems;software repositories;source code;text-interleaved language;unstructured text","","1","","24","","","22-23 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The discourse model can be related to Swales's “discourse moves” and the derived “argumentative zoning” procedures for scientific documents. However due to the nature of the considered texts, zones are defined in more “generalist” terms, following the classic Narration-Description-Argumentation-Prescription typology and especially C. Smith's notion of “discourse modes”. The paper presents some preliminary steps performed in order to test the feasibility of the project. First of all, in order to ground our research on firm observations, we decided to build a corpus of journalistic texts, annotated according to the discourse model in view. Quantified results concerning the organization of discourse modes within texts could be obtained thanks to these annotations.

Enabling robots to understand human route descriptions can simplify HRI situations in household or industrial settings. However, solving this problem requires handling the ambiguity present in route descriptions and the possible unreliability of the semantic perception capabilities of the robot. We address this problem by absorbing these uncertainties in a probability distribution measuring the likelihood of the different interpretations (paths) of a given route description and selecting its MAP solution. The approach is evaluated on a dataset of route descriptions transcribed into a suitable representation using standard information retrieval metrics. These performance measurements indicate that the method can correctly interpret route descriptions even in challenging environments.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4673-5643-5; POD:978-1-4673-5640-4","10.1109/ICRA.2013.6630881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630881","","Automata;Junctions;Measurement;Probability distribution;Semantics;Topology","control engineering computing;human-robot interaction;information retrieval;probability;terrain mapping","HRI situations;MAP solution;automatic semantic place labeling;household setting;human route descriptions;industrial setting;information retrieval metrics;probability distribution;robot maps;robot-generated maps;route description interpretation;semantic perception capability","","1","","20","","","6-10 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The context-switching between the web browser and the working environment is time-consuming and distracting, and the keyword-based traditional search often does not help much in problem solving. In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that collects the data from three web search APIs-Google, Yahoo, Bing and a programming Q & A site-StackOverflow. It then provides search results within IDE taking not only the content of the selected error into account but also the problem context, popularity and search engine recommendation of the result links. Experiments with 25 runtime errors and exceptions show that the proposed approach outperforms the keyword-based search approaches with a recommendation accuracy of 96%. We also validate the results with a user study involving five prospective participants where we get a result agreement of 64.28%. While the preliminary results are promising, the approach needs to be further validated with more errors and exceptions followed by a user study with more participants to establish itself as a complete IDE-based web search solution.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-1-4799-2931-3; POD:978-1-4799-2932-0","10.1109/WCRE.2013.6671324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671324","API mash-up;Context-based search;IDE-based search;SimHash algorithm","Browsers;Context;Measurement;Programming;Search engines;Search problems;Web search","information retrieval;search engines","Bing;Eclipse IDE-based context-aware meta search engine;Google;StackOverflow;Web browser;Web search;Web search API;Yahoo;application program interface;keyword-based traditional search;search engine recommendation","","2","","9","","","14-17 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the results of the BNP structure are very often incorrect when it is considered within a longer complex NP (CNP). Structural ambiguity prevails in most CNPs and multilingual comparison may help improve disambiguation. We introduce a new NP annotation scheme, which is applicable to multilingual parallel corpora and discriminate genuine flat branching and right branching. Flat branching is preferred instead of binary branching wherever appropriate so as to achieve inter-lingual consistency. As a pilot task to build a gold standard corpus for structural and semantic analysis of CNPs, 381 document titles are extracted from the UN resolutions as typical examples of CNPs. Document titles in Chinese, English and Russian are manually annotated in XML format with the hope to help acquire rules for parsers or machine translators targeted at CNPs.

A common way of doing this is to search journals and conferences for pertinent articles, and then accumulating the affiliations of the authors. In this paper, we present an interactive web-based academic search interface for discovering geographic clusters of academic institutions given a specific field by the user.

The growth of mobile devices has only increased demand for timely updates on online information. To reduce traffic or bandwidth, efficient retrieval scheduling strategies have been developed to monitor new postings. Most of these methods, however, do not take user access patterns into consideration. For example, the strategy for a user who checks news once a day should be different from the strategy for a user who checks news ten times a day. In this paper, we propose a personalized content aggregation model in which delay time depends not only on the retrieval time and posting time, but also on user access patterns. With total expected delay as the objective, we derive a resource allocation strategy and retrieval scheduling strategy that is optimal when postings are Poisson.

MDLSA works by first partitioning each document into paragraphs and building a term affinity graph, which represents the frequency of term cooccurrence in a paragraph. We then conduct a 2-D principal component analysis to achieve an optimal semantic mapping. This analysis involves finding the leading eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix of a training set to characterize the lower dimensional semantic space. A hybrid document similarity measure is designed to further improve the performance of this framework. Our algorithm is examined in two document applications: retrieval and classification.

The toolkit is geared for smartphone applications whose main objective is to collect and share information about the physical world. Information-centric programming refers to a publish-subscribe paradigm that maximizes the amount of information delivered. Unlike a traditional publish-subscribe system where publishers are assumed to have independent content, Minerva is geared for social sensing applications where different sources (participants sharing sensor data) often overlap in information they share. For example, through lack of coordination, they might collect redundant pictures of the same scene or redundant speed measurements of the same street. The main contribution of Minerva, therefore, lies in a data prioritization scheme that maximizes information delivery from publishers to subscribers by reducing redundancy, taking into account the non-independent nature of content. The algorithm is implemented on Android phones on top of the recently introduced named data networking framework. Evaluation results from both two smartphone-based experiments and a large-scale real data driven simulation demonstrate that the prioritization algorithm outperforms other candidates in terms of information coverage.","1095-2055;10952055","Electronic:978-1-4673-5775-3; POD:978-1-4673-5773-9","10.1109/ICCCN.2013.6614152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6614152","","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Data communication;Programming;Receivers;Sensors;Temperature measurement","information management;information retrieval;information use;mobile handsets","Android phones;MINERVA;data networking framework;data prioritization scheme;information centric programming;information coverage;information delivery;publish subscribe paradigm;smartphone applications;social sensing","","6","","24","","","July 30 2013-Aug. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the one hand, consumers are increasingly able to decide whether or not new technologies are worth adopting. On the other hand, ICT manufacturers, seeking to expand their market shares, encourage the continuing purchase of newer versions of their products regardless of their elapsed technology life cycle. These phenomena have prompted the advent of competing ICT platforms, which include mobile telephony, broadband Internet, terrestrial digital TV and cloud computing. Yet, the diffusion of newer platforms still requires suitable conditions to prosper as, for example, an appropriate technological environment. In the case of developing countries, such as Mexico, socio-economic factors also play an important role. In this paper we analyze users' intentions to adopt available ICT platforms. Although a considerable proportion of Mexicans already make use of newer technologies, some are still attached to older ICT platforms, such as analog radio and television. There are several public policy implications for this situation, among which the necessity to encourage the rapid diffusion of more efficient ICT technologies as well as the urgent deployment of an appropriate supportive infrastructure stand out.","2159-5100;21595100","Electronic:978-1-890843-27-4; POD:978-1-4799-1149-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6641758","","Cellular phones;Computers;Convergence;Internet;Mobile communication;TV;Technological innovation","cloud computing;consumer behaviour;digital television;information retrieval;mobile radio;radiotelephony;socio-economic effects","ICT manufacturers;ICT sector;Mexico;analog radio;broadband Internet;cloud computing;competing technologies;consumer behavior;developing countries;digital content access;information and communications technology sector;innovation;market share expansion;mobile telephony;new ICT platform adoption;public policy implication;socio-economic factors;supportive infrastructure deployment;technological environment;technology life cycle;television;terrestrial digital TV;user intention analysis","","0","","21","","","July 28 2013-Aug. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, based on information retrieval techniques, we build a vector model for each symbol based on its sparse representation in a visual vocabulary whose visual words are columns in the learned dictionary. The retrieval task is performed by ranking symbols based on similarity between vector models. The evaluation of our method, using benchmark datasets, demonstrates the validity of our approach and shows that it outperforms related state-of-the-art methods.","1520-5363;15205363","Electronic:978-0-7695-4999-6; POD:978-1-4799-0193-7","10.1109/ICDAR.2013.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6628625","","Context;Dictionaries;Equations;Mathematical model;Shape;Vectors;Visualization","character recognition;dictionaries;information retrieval;vocabulary","dictionary;information retrieval techniques;interest points descriptor;ranking symbols;shape context;sparse representation;symbol description;symbol recognition;vector model;visual vocabulary","","1","","28","","","25-28 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
