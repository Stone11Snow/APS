Many schemes and techniques of relevance feedback exist with many assumptions and operating criteria. Yet there exist few ways of quantitatively measuring and comparing different relevance feedback algorithms. Such analysis is necessary if a CBIR system is to perform consistently. In this paper we propose an abstract model of a CBIR system where the effects of different modules over the entire system is observed. Using this model we thoroughly analyse performance a set of basic relevance feedback algorithms. Besides using standard measures like precision and recall we also suggest two new measures to gauge the performance of any contemporary CBIR system","","CD-ROM:1-4214-042-1; POD:1-4244-0341-3","10.1109/ICARCV.2006.345462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150247","","Algorithm design and analysis;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Information technology;Performance analysis;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;relevance feedback","content based image retrieval;relevance feedback analysis","","1","","12","","","5-8 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach relies on a data-driven animation scheme. From motion data captured thanks to an optical system and data gloves, we try to extract significant features of communicative gestures, and to re-synthesize them afterward with style variation. The proposed model is applied to the generation of a set of French sign language (FSL) gestures. Within this framework, a database involving the whole body, hands motion and facial expressions has been built The analysis of this database makes possible information retrieval about the semantics as well as the execution style of FSL gestures. These characteristics are integrated in gesture synthesis models qualitatively evaluated by their intelligibility and the realism of the produced animations.","1062-922X;1062922X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0100-3; POD:1-4244-0099-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4274599","","Animation;Data analysis;Data gloves;Data mining;Feature extraction;Handicapped aids;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Motion analysis;Spatial databases","computer animation;feature extraction;gesture recognition;virtual reality","French sign language;HuGEx project;body expression;data gloves;data-driven animation scheme;expressive communication gesture;facial expression;feature extraction;hand movement expression;information retrieval;motion expression;optical system;semantic representation;structured multimodal database;virtual humanoid","","3","","37","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two methods were employed to study how naive viewers use modifiers to describe differences in their perceptions and modifiers of color tones. A preliminary elicitation employed the methods of selection description, in which Japanese and Sinhala modifiers meaning - pale, bright, vivid, strong, dull, dark - constituted a high proportion of responses. These modifiers were employed in a triadic comparison. Dissimilarities of all pair wise comparisons of stimuli were submitted to MDS analysis in order to derive a multidimensional perceptual structure for the stimuli. A semantic differential structure was derived applying PCA for modifier responses provided for the same set of stimuli. The results revealed that Japanese and Sinhala native speakers perceptually discriminate the six color tone stimulus into six categories. Furthermore, the semantic structures for each hue were different from one a another. And it was observed that the semantic structures related differently to the dimensions of the perceptual structures.","1062-922X;1062922X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0100-3; POD:1-4244-0099-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4273853","Multidimensional Scaling;Multilingual;Perception of Color Tone;Semantic Differential Analysis","Computational modeling;Cybernetics;Humans;Image color analysis;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Internet;Multidimensional systems;Principal component analysis;Software engineering","multimedia computing;principal component analysis;social aspects of automation","Japanese viewers;PCA;Sinhala viewers;color tone stimuli;color tones;cross-language similarity;multidimensional perceptual structure;multimedia documents;perceptual structures;semantic differential structure;semantic structures","","1","","27","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Each binning is considered through two stages of processing. First, the prototype closest to the query is found. Second, the bin corresponding to the closest prototype is fetched from disk and searched completely. The query process is repeatedly performing these two stages, each time with a binning independent of the previous ones.

ICIT '06. 9th International Conference on","20070716","2006","","","241","242","The use of low-level visual features to retrieve relevant information from image and video databases has drawn much research attention in recent years. Color is perhaps the most dominant and distinguishing visual feature. In modern CBIR systems, statistical clustering methods are often used to extract visual features, index the feature space, and classify images into semantic categories. Statistical clustering methods are tools that search and generalize concepts based on a large amount of high dimensional numerical data.

The goal is to create a more efficient terrain classification algorithm which can be used in real-time, onboard an autonomous vehicle. Instead of building a monolithic classifier with uniformly complex representation for each class, the main idea here is to actively consider the labels or misclassification cost while constructing the classifier. For example, some terrain classes might be easily separable from the rest, so very simple representation will be sufficient to learn and detect these classes. This is taken advantage of during learning, so the algorithm automatically builds a variable-length visual representation which varies according to the complexity of the classification task. This enables fast recognition of different terrain types during testing. We also show how to select a set of feature representations so that the desired terrain classification task is accomplished with high accuracy and is at the same time efficient. The proposed approach achieves a good trade-off between recognition performance and speedup on data collected by an autonomous robot.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270049","","Aircraft navigation;Classification algorithms;Computer science;Costs;Human robot interaction;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Propulsion;Soil","feature extraction;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;image retrieval;mobile robots","autonomous robot;autonomous vehicle navigation;feature representation;image colour analysis;image retrieval;terrain classification algorithm;variable-length representation","","17","","18","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In annotation, the image is matched with keyword models, and the most relevant keywords are assigned to the image. Using existing techniques, the annotation time for large collections is very high, while the annotation performance degrades with increase in number of keywords. Towards the goal of large scale annotation, we present an approach called ""Reverse Annotation "". Unlike traditional annotation where keywords are identified for a given image, in Reverse Annotation, the relevant images are identified for each keyword. With this seemingly simple shift in perspective, the annotation time is reduced significantly. To be able to rank relevant images, the approach is extended to Probabilistic Reverse Annotation. Our framework is applicable to a wide variety of multimedia documents, and scalable to large collections.

These terms are subsequently used to update an existing distance, thereby modifying the neighborhood structure. Experimental results on the Nister-Stewenius dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy. Our efficient search structure for visual word vectors is a two-level scheme using inverted files. The first level partitions the image set into clusters of images. At query time, only a subset of clusters of the second level has to be searched. This method allows fast querying in large sets of images.

A drawback, however, is that these low level image features are often too restricted to describe images on a conceptual or semantic level. The gap between the high level query from the user and low level features extracted by a computer is known as the semantic gap. Translating or converting the question posed by a human to the low level features seen by the computer illustrates the problem in bridging the semantic gap.

They are critical assets for medical diagnosis, research, and teaching. To facilitate automatic indexing and retrieval of large medical-image databases, both images and associated texts are indexed using medical concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) meta-thesaurus. We propose a structured learning framework based on support vector machines to facilitate modular design and learning of medical semantics from images. We present two complementary visual indexing approaches within this framework: a global indexing to access image modality and a local indexing to access semantic local features. Two fusion approaches are developed to improve textual retrieval using the UMLS-based image indexing.

We then associate a histogram with each dimension, and the histogram bins in each dimension correspond to specific states. A range query in the proposed probabilistic framework is the sum of the probabilities of observing a sequence of states within a hyper-sphere.

However, little work thus far has focused on creating an interactive interface to enable users to explicitly explore that data quality information. In this paper, we propose a framework for the linkage between data space and quality space for multivariate visualizations. Moreover, we introduce two novel techniques, quality brushing and quality-series animation, to help users with the exploration of this linkage.

The proposed algorithm learns the characteristic differences between local descriptors sampled from pairs of ""same"" and ""different"" images.

The extremely randomized trees are fast to learn, robust due to the redundant information they carry and they have been proved to be very good clusterers.

In each iteration, the user is requested to select images relevant to the query concept. Salient blocks of the selected images are used as training examples. To guarantee the accuracy of salient block matching, the similarities of block regions are calculated within an optimised concept-specific multi-feature space.

Each gene-string in the initial population only has three matched points while other points are unmatched. During the evolution, each gene-string will have more matched points due to the applications of the crossover and extending operators. The extending operator determines a potential match for an unmatched point near a matched point by searching the local space.

The algorithm modifies the random surfer model by biasing the probability of a user to follow a link in favor of links to pages with similar content. It is our intuition that WordRank is most appropriate in topic based searches, since it prioritizes strongly interconnected pages, and in the same time is more robust to the multitude of topics and to the noise produced by navigation links.

To co-operate with the highly regular P2P network and peer operations, the retrieval unit in one peer is designed to perform multi-instance image query with heterogeneous features and transmit relevant images to its source peer. The peer internal architecture is designed to perform the P2P image retrieval in a regular and scalable approach. The query peer can present the best retrieval results at any time, which is a compromise between the Time-To-Live (TTL) of the query message and the recall rate. Experiments show that the query efficiency (recall-rate/query-scope) of the scalable retrieval approach is better than previous methods, i.e., firework query model and bread first search. Furthermore, an optimal system configuration method is proposed to provide the highest recall rate for a certain number of on-line users.

"Discriminative Cluster Refinement: Improving Object Category Recognition Given Limited Training Data","L. Yang; R. Jin; C. Pantofaru; R.

Unfortunately, a significant shortcoming of this approach is that the clustering and classification are disconnected. Since the clustering into visual words is unsupervised, the representation does not necessarily capture the aspects of the data that are most useful for classification. More seriously, the semantic relationship between clusters is lost, causing the overall classification performance to suffer. We introduce ""discriminative cluster refinement"" (DCR), a method that explicitly models the pairwise relationships between different visual words by exploiting their co-occurrence information. The assigned class labels are used to identify the co-occurrence patterns that are most informative for object classification. DCR employs a maximum-margin approach to generate an optimal kernel matrix for classification. One important benefit of DCR is that it integrates smoothly into existing bag-of-words information retrieval systems by employing the set of visual words generated by any clustering method. While DCR could improve a broad class of information retrieval systems, this paper focuses on object category recognition. We present a direct comparison with a state-of-the art method on the PASCAL 2006 database and show that cluster refinement results in a significant improvement in classification accuracy given a small number of training examples.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270295","","Application software;Computer science;Computer vision;Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Histograms;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Training data","image classification;image representation;matrix algebra;object recognition;pattern clustering;visual databases","PASCAL 2006 database;discriminative cluster refinement;image categorization;image classification;image clustering;image representation;object category recognition;object classification;optimal kernel matrix;semantic relationship;visual words","","4","","29","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such a ""bag-of-words"" representation has led to many significant results in various vision tasks including object recognition and categorization. However, in practice, the clustering of primitive visual features tends to result in synonymous visual words that over-represent visual patterns, as well as polysemous visual words that bring large uncertainties and ambiguities in the representation. This paper aims at generating a higher-level lexicon, i.e. visual phrase lexicon, where a visual phrase is a meaningful spatially co-occurrent pattern of visual words. This higher-level lexicon is much less ambiguous than the lower-level one. The contributions of this paper include: (1) a fast and principled solution to the discovery of significant spatial co-occurrent patterns using frequent itemset mining; (2) a pattern summarization method that deals with the compositional uncertainties in visual phrases; and (3) a top-down refinement scheme of the visual word lexicon by feeding back discovered phrases to tune the similarity measure through metric learning.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270247","","Computer vision;Data mining;Impedance;Information retrieval;Itemsets;Object recognition;Spatial resolution;Text recognition;Uncertainty;Vector quantization","feature extraction;image representation;pattern clustering","bag-of-words representation;collocation patterns discovery;higher-level lexicon;object recognition;pattern summarization method;polysemous visual words;primitive visual features clustering;synonymous visual words;top-down refinement scheme;visual phrase lexicon;visual word lexicon","","106","10","25","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present a novel method to interactively visualize information hierarchies in real-time. We use the World Wide Web as an application example of our techniques. The result is a novel Web browsing and visualization method with an innovative combination of features: (i) Web data is retrieved and displayed in real-time (i.e. Web data is not pre-recorded), (ii) browsing and visualization are synchronized together in the same interface, (iii) tree-based visualization engine, and (iv) space-efficient display of visualization.

Large-scale spammers target commerce queries that they can monetize and attempt to spam as many top search results of those queries as possible. We model the large-scale search spam problem as that of defending against correlated attacks on search rankings across multiple keywords, and propose an autonomic anti-spam approach based on self-monitoring and self- protection. In this new approach, search engines monitor and correlate their own search results of spammer-targeted keywords to detect large-scale spam attacks that have successfully bypassed their current anti-spam solutions. They then initiate self-protection through targeted patrol of spam-heavy domains, targeted hunting at the sources of successful spam, and strengthening of specific weakness in the ranking algorithms. We describe the strider search ranger system which implements this new approach, and focus on its use to defend against an important class of search spam - the redirection spam - as a demonstration of the general concept.

The amount of available data is growing and so do user demands. Users do not need more information to deal with. Rather, they require that the information search process provides them with sensible responses to their requests. There are several problems complicating the search process and lowering the search effectiveness: users rarely present search queries in the form that optimally represents their information needs; the measure of a document's relevance is often highly subjective among different users; and information sources contain heterogeneous documents, stored in multiple formats and without a standardized representation. To alleviate these problems, queries can be extended using the concepts of fuzzy sets. The search system described in this paper models users' information needs in a framework of fuzzy sets, with the aid of two metrics that determine the ""fitness for use"" of the retrieved documents. With the aid of this parameter, an evolutionary computing system performs optimization of search queries based on individual user models. This way, an effective search system is produced, which is able to continuously learn from reinforcements provided by the users.","","CD-ROM:1-4244-1214-5; POD:1-4244-1213-7","10.1109/NAFIPS.2007.383881","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271104","","Application software;Computer science;Evolutionary computation;Fuzzy sets;Heart;Information retrieval;Internet;Web search;Web sites;World Wide Web","Internet;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;online front-ends;query processing","WWW;Web search queries;World Wide Web;evolutionary computing system;fuzzy modeling;fuzzy sets;heterogeneous documents;information search process;information sources","","1","","25","","","24-27 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the proposed approach, each shape is indexed based on a variety of simple and easily computable features which are invariant to articulations and rigid transformations. The features characterize pairwise geometric relationships between interest points on the shape, thereby providing robustness to the approach. Shapes are retrieved using an efficient scheme which does not involve costly operations like shape-wise alignment or establishing correspondences. Even for a moderate size database of 1000 shapes, the retrieval process is several times faster than most techniques with similar performance.

At the application level, the typical complexity behind the emerging distributed multimodal systems is reduced in a transparent manner through multimodal frameworks that handle data on different abstraction levels and efficiently accommodate constituent technologies.

We exploit the truly multi-modal nature of multimedia collections - they have multiple views, or modalities, each of which contributes its own perspective to the collection's organization. For example, in picture galleries, image captions are often provided that form a separate view on the collection. Color histograms (or any other set of global features) form another view. Additional views are blobs, interest points and other sets of local features. Our model, called Comraf* (pronounced Comraf-Star), efficiently incorporates various views in multi-modal clustering, by which it allows great modeling flexibility. Comraf* is a light-weight version of the recently introduced combinatorial Markov random field (Comraf). We show how to translate an arbitrary Comraf into a series of Comraf* models, and give an empirical evidence for comparable effectiveness of the two. Comraf* demonstrates excellent results on two real-world image galleries: it obtains 2.5-3 times higher accuracy compared with a uni-modal k-means.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270248","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Explosions;Histograms;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Markov random fields;Random variables;Unsupervised learning;World Wide Web","Markov processes;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;pattern clustering","color histogram;combinatorial Markov random field;multimedia collection;multimodal clustering;unsupervised learning framework","","22","1","19","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among those distinguishing features, the texture features are one of the main themes in content-based image retrieval (CBIR). In this paper, we propose a novel technique to extract dominant features of images in block-DCT domain. The image is first converted to YUV color space and divided into four subblocks. The Y-component in each subblock is then transformed into DCT coefficients, some regions of which characterize different directional texture feature of that subblock. The directional textures in all subblocks are concatenated together as a single feature vector and used for indexing and retrieval of images. The experimental results show that using proper size of block-DCT to emphasize the regional properties of an image while maintaining its global view performs well in CBIR.","1062-922X;1062922X","CD-ROM:1-4244-0100-3; POD:1-4244-0099-6","10.1109/ICSMC.2006.384692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4274457","","Concatenated codes;Content based retrieval;Digital images;Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Image converters;Image retrieval;Image texture analysis;Indexing;Information retrieval","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture","YUV color space;automatic image retrieval;block-DCT domain;content-based image retrieval;dominant feature extraction;low-level visual features;texture features","","8","","10","","","8-11 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During research there were thought different ways of mitigating the issue of insider threats. The result of this analysis is the Diamond Theory. It ties four methods of increasing the security of personal devices: software design, information retrieval, detection technology design and information policy design. All four corners of the diamond are represented by four different techniques that increase the security of personal devices and thus the defense against insider threats.

We introduce a sub-linear time randomized hashing algorithm for indexing sets of feature vectors under their partial correspondences. We develop an efficient embedding function for the normalized partial matching similarity between sets, and show how to exploit random hyperplane properties to construct hash functions that satisfy locality-sensitive constraints. The result is a bounded approximate similarity search algorithm that finds (1 + epsiv)-approximate nearest neighbor images in O(N<sup>1/1+epsiv</sup>) time for a database containing N images represented by (varying numbers of) local features. We demonstrate our approach applied to image retrieval for images represented by sets of local appearance features, and show that searching over correspondences is now scalable to large image databases.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270250","","Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Nearest neighbor searches;Spatial databases;Visual databases","file organisation;image matching;image retrieval;visual databases","image matching;image retrieval;image-to-image correspondences;pyramid match hashing;query image;sublinear time indexing;sublinear time randomized hashing algorithm;very large image database","","26","","22","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model takes advantage of the intrinsic dimension of the data set, estimated by its correlation fractal dimension.

We will invoke the concept of semantic space to explicitly define the semantic structure in the video in terms of latent states. A dynamic model is used to govern the transition between states, and an observation model is developed to characterize visual features pertaining to different states. Then the problem is formulated as a statistical inference process where we want to infer latent states (i.e., camera views) from observations (i.e., visual features). Two generative models, the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the Segmental HMM (SHMM), are involved in this research. In the HMM, both latent states and visual features are shot-based, and in the SHMM, latent states and visual features are defined for shots and frames respectively. Both models provide promising performance for view-based shot classification, and the SHMM outperforms the HMM by involving a two-layer observation model to accommodate the variability of visual features. This approach is also applicable to other video mining tasks.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.383494","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270492","","Broadcasting;Cameras;Content based retrieval;Data warehouses;Games;Hidden Markov models;Information retrieval;Multimedia communication;Multimedia databases;Video recording","hidden Markov models;sport;statistical analysis;video signal processing","American football games;camera views;intrinsic semantic structures;segmental HMM;segmental hidden Markov models;semantic space;statistical inference process;video mining;view-based sport video analysis;visual features","","7","","17","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, the relational approach seeks to utilize the power of a mature relational database to store and search XML.

However, if we locate a new test sample on the manifold, we have to find its embedding by making use of the learned embedded representation of the training samples. This process often involves accessing considerable volume of data for large sample set. In this paper, an approach of selecting ""landmark points"" from the given samples is proposed for hierarchical structuring of data on manifolds. The selection is made such that if one use the Voronoi diagram generated by the landmark points in the ambient space to partition the embeded manifold, the topology of the manifold is preserved. The landmark points then are used to recursively construct a hierarchical structure of the data. Thus it can speed up queries in a manifold data set. It is a general framework that can fit any manifold learning algorithm as long as its result of an input can be predicted by the results of the neighbor inputs. Compared to the existing techniques of organizing data based on spatial partitioning, our method preserves the topology of the latent space of the data. Different from manifold learning algorithms that use landmark points to reduce complexity, our approach is designed for fast retrieval of samples. It may find its way in high dimensional data analysis such as indexing, clustering, and progressive compression. More importantly, it extends the manifold learning methods to applications in which they were previously considered to be not fast enough. Our algorithm is stable and fast, and its validity is proved mathematically.","1063-6919;10636919","CD-ROM:1-4244-1180-7; POD:1-4244-1179-3","10.1109/CVPR.2007.382981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4270006","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data analysis;Indexing;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Organizing;Partitioning algorithms;Topology","computational geometry;data analysis;data compression;data structures;indexing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","Voronoi diagram;clustering;data analysis;hierarchical data structuring;indexing;landmark point selection;manifold learning;manifold learning method;manifold partitioning;manifold topology;progressive compression","","1","","23","","","17-22 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
