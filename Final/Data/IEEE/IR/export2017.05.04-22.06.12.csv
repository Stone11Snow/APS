These experiments generate very large volumes of “event” data at a very high rate. The volumes of data may reach 100's of terabytes/year and therefore they are stored on robotic tape systems that are managed by a mass storage system. The data are stored as files on tapes according to a predetermined order, usually according to the order they are generated. A major bottleneck is the retrieval of subsets of these large datasets during the analysis phase. STAGS is designed to optimize the use of a disk cache, and thus minimize the number of files read from tape. In this paper, we describe an interesting problem of disk staging coordination that goes beyond the one-file-at-a-time requirement. The problem stems from the need to coordinate the simultaneous caching of groups of files that we refer to as “bundles of files”. All files from a bundle need to be at the same time in the disk cache in order for the analysis application to proceed. This is a radically different problem from the case where the analysis applications need only one file at a time. In this paper, we describe the method of identifying the file bundles, and the scheduling of bundle caching in such a way that files shared between bundles are not removed from the cache unnecessarily. We describe the methodology and the policies used to determine the order of caching bundles of files, and the order of removing files from the cache when space is needed","1099-3371;10993371","POD:0-7695-0686-0","10.1109/SSDM.2000.869788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=869788","","Data analysis;Design optimization;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Physics computing;Read only memory;Robot kinematics;Scheduling;Sensor systems;Space technology","cache storage;nuclear electronics;physics computing;scientific information systems","High Energy and Physics experiments;STAGS;bundle caching;disk cache;disk staging coordination;file bundles;large datasets;mass storage system;robotic tape systems;simultaneous caching;storage access coordination system;tertiary storage","","2","","5","","","2000","26 Jul 2000-28 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to use CLEAN to retrieve precipitation parameters from multispectral passive-microwave imagery, extensions of the algorithm to accommodate nonlinear, multispectral, and statistical data mere designed and implemented. The primary advantage of the nonlinear multispectral statistical (NMS) CLEAN retrieval algorithm relative to existing algorithms is the use of high-resolution (high-frequency) imagery to guide the retrievals of precipitation parameters from lower resolution (Low-frequency) imagery. The NMS-CLEAN retrieval algorithm was used to estimate rain rate (RR) and integrated ice content (IIC) using simulated imagery of oceanic convection as would be observed from six channels of the proposed Advanced Microwave-Scanning Radiometer. Both the accuracy and structural detail of the retrieved rain rate were improved relative to the retrievals from a single-step, nonlinear, statistical algorithm.

Therefore, a multimedia server's ability in delivering a high DM data throughput without degrading its CM data throughput deserves more attention. In this paper, we address this issue by optimizing the use of disk bandwidth spent on CM service at run-time and redirecting the saved bandwidth to service DM requests. Based on a new cost model of disk access incurred in CM service, we formulate strategies to control the size of each disk read at run time. These strategies improve the efficiency of each disk access and improve the DM data throughput of a multimedia server, without jeopardizing the CM throughput. Through experimental evaluations, the improvements achieved are demonstrated.

The proposed technique casts classification problems and regression problems into a unified regression problem. This unified view enables classification problems to use numeric information in the output space that is available for regression problems but are traditionally not readily available for classification problems. A doubly clustered subspace-based hierarchical discriminating regression (HDR) method is proposed. The major characteristics include: (1) Clustering is performed in both output space and input space at each internal node, termed ""doubly clustered."" Clustering in the output space provides virtual labels for computing clusters in the input space. (2) Discriminants in the input space are automatically derived from the clusters in the input space. (3) A hierarchical probability distribution model is applied to the resulting discriminating subspace at each internal node. This realizes a coarse-to-fine approximation of probability distribution of the input samples, in the hierarchical discriminating subspaces. (4) To relax the per class sample requirement of traditional discriminant analysis techniques, a sample-size dependent negative-log-likelihood (NLL) is introduced. This new technique is designed for automatically dealing with small-sample applications, large-sample applications, and unbalanced-sample applications. (5) The execution of the HDR method is fast, due to the empirical logarithmic time complexity of the HDR algorithm. Although the method is applicable to any data, we report the experimental results for three types of data: synthetic data for examining the near-optimal performance, large raw face-image databases, and traditional databases with manually selected features along with a comparison with some major existing methods.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/34.888712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=888712","","Algorithm design and analysis;Image analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Probability distribution;Spatial databases","computational complexity;covariance matrices;image classification;image retrieval;pattern clustering;probability;statistical analysis;visual databases","coarse-to-fine approximation;doubly clustered subspace-based hierarchical discriminating regression method;empirical logarithmic time complexity;hierarchical probability distribution model;high-dimensional data;large raw face-image databases;large-sample applications;near-optimal performance;numeric information;output space;probability distribution;sample-size dependent negative-log-likelihood;small-sample applications;synthetic data;unbalanced-sample applications;unified regression problem;virtual labels","","60","4","27","","","Nov 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since ocean surface winds are the major force that controls the strength of the backscattering signals, it is very desirable to examine or “explain” the measured ocean backscattering using ocean surface wind fields. To this end, the authors examined the feasibility of retrieving ocean surface winds from TRMM PR data for the benefit of the surface reference technique. A geophysical model function, a forward model, is developed based on ocean surface wind speed retrieved from TRMM Microwave Imager data. A field-wise wind retrieval procedure, an inverse model, is formulated using maximum likelihood estimation. TRMM PR data are analyzed to demonstrate that the PR derived ocean wind speed can explain the ocean backscattering successfully.

Strict adherence to this notion in query evaluation is, however, increasingly unsatisfactory because decision makers are more prone to adopting an exploratory strategy for information search which we call “getting some answers quickly, and perhaps more later”. From a decision-maker's perspective, such a strategy is optimal for coping with information overload and makes economic sense (when used in conjunction with a micropayment mechanism). These new requirements present new opportunities for database query optimization. In this paper, we propose a progressive query processing strategy that exploits this behavior to conserve system resources and to minimize query response time and user waiting time. This is accomplished by the heuristic decomposition of user queries into subqueries that can be evaluated on demand. To illustrate the practicality of the proposed methods, we describe the architecture of a prototype system that provides a nonintrusive implementation of our approach. Finally, we present experimental results obtained from an empirical study conducted using an Oracle server that demonstrate the benefits of the progressive query processing strategy","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/69.877503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=877503","","Computer Society;Costs;Databases;Delay;Information retrieval;Internet;Investments;Prototypes;Query processing;Web server","Internet;information resources;query processing","Oracle server;database query;database query optimization;decision makers;heuristic decomposition;information overload;micropayment mechanism;query evaluation;query processing;query response time;query rewriting;system resources;tuples;user waiting time","","1","","17","","","Sep/Oct 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

ClusterTree incorporates the cluster presentation into the index structure to achieve effective and efficient retrieval.

We extend the traditional similarity search methods on time series data to support a multidimensional data sequence, such as a video stream. We investigate the problem of retrieving similar multidimensional data sequences from a large database. To prune irrelevant sequences in a database, we introduce correct and efficient similarity functions. Both data sequences and query sequences are partitioned into subsequences, and each of them is represented by a Minimum Bounding Rectangle (MBR). The query processing is based upon these MBRs, instead of scanning data elements of entire sequences. Our method is designed: (1) to select candidate sequences in a database, and (2) to find the subsequences of a selected sequence, each of which falls under the given threshold. The latter is of special importance in the case of retrieving subsequences from large and complex sequences such as video. By using it, we do not need to browse the whole of the selected video stream, but just browse the sub-streams to find a scene we want. We have performed an extensive experiment on synthetic, as well as real data sequences (a collection of TV news, dramas, and documentary videos) to evaluate our proposed method. The experiment demonstrates that 73-94 percent of irrelevant sequences are pruned using the proposed method, resulting in 16-28 times faster response time compared with that of the sequential search","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-0506-6","10.1109/ICDE.2000.839473","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839473","","Databases;Design methodology;Information retrieval;Layout;Multidimensional systems;Performance evaluation;Query processing;Search methods;Streaming media;TV","multimedia databases;query processing;search problems;time series;very large databases;video databases;video signal processing","Minimum Bounding Rectangle;TV news;candidate sequences;complex sequences;data elements;data sequence retrieval;database applications;documentary videos;irrelevant sequences;large database;multidimensional data sequences;one dimensional real numbers;query processing;query sequences;response time;sequential search;similarity functions;similarity search;similarity search methods;subsequences;time series data;video stream","","25","2","13","","","2000","29 Feb 2000-03 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, our algorithm is more computationally efficient than the POCS algorithm since it converges more quickly and has computational complexity for each iteration. The algorithm alleviates edge blurring by properly amplifying the wavelet transform (WT) of the image. The amplification in the WT domain biases the projection sequence to the subset of interpolated images that has less edge-blurring. In this way, we can obtain an interpolated image that retains a significant amount of edge information.

Previous research has proposed algorithms for efficiently dealing with this kind of query pattern, which is highly relevant with respect to data warehousing, data mining and GIS (geographic information systems). In this paper, we present a cost model that enables a concise estimation of both memory costs and run-time costs for processing queries with restrictions in multiple attributes that may in addition involve a sort operation. Our cost model considers uniformly distributed UB-trees (universal B-trees) with independent dimensions, and it is derived analytically in three steps, starting with a very simple, perfectly idealized partitioning scheme, moving on to imperfect partitioning schemes, and finally evaluating a probabilistically partitioned UB-tree.

The first of these is an SNMP Sensor that may be used to collect data being tracked by SNMP agents. Secondly, a Notification Process provides asynchronous events to interested applications when metrics tracked by NWS are expected to exceed established normal ranges. Finally, an extended SNMP agent daemon has been developed to provide SNMP-enabled applications with the ability to retrieve information from NWS without the need for custom programming. The new modules help to position NWS as an integral component for performing QoS monitoring and fault prediction in an SNMP-based fault management architecture.

The temporal and spatial relations of semantic objects were captured by an unsupervised video segmentation method called the SPCPE (simultaneous partitioning and class parameter estimation) algorithm, and they were modeled by the multimedia input strings. However, the segmentation method used was not able to identify objects that are overlapped together within video frames. The identification of overlapped objects is a great challenge. For this purpose, a backtrack-chain-update-split algorithm is developed in this paper that identifies the split segment (object) and uses this information in the current frame to update the previous frames in a backtrack-chain manner.

The combination of the original and new queries forms a large set of potential queries for a content-based video retrieval system. Through Bayesian relevance feedback, the user narrows the choices to an exemplar set. This exemplar set, or SVTs, represents personalized views of a concept and an effective set of queries to retrieve a general category of images and videos. We have generated SVTs for several classes of videos, including sunsets, high jumpers, and slalom skiers.

During the next several years, the D0 experiment will store a total of about 1 PByte of data, including raw detector data and data processed at various levels. The design of SAM is not specific to the D0 experiment and carries few assumptions about the underlying mass storage level; its ideas are applicable to any sequential data access. By definition, in the sequential access mode, a user application needs to process a stream of data by accessing each data unit exactly once, the order of the data units in the stream being irrelevant. The units of data are laid out sequentially in files. The adopted model allows for a significant optimization of system performance, a reduction in user file latency and an increase in the overall throughput. In particular, caching is done with the knowledge of all the files that are needed “in the near future”, which is defined as all the files being used by already-running or submitted jobs. The bulk of the data is stored in files on tape in the mass storage system Enstore.

Rehabilitation interventions such as functional neuromuscular stimulation can be used to restore lost function in this population, but due to the mechanical complexity of the shoulder, implementing such interventions is a difficult task. Musculoskeletal modeling can be used to gain a better understanding of shoulder function following cervical SCI and to aid in the design of rehabilitation interventions that restore lost function. Following spinal cord injury, some muscles will become completely paralyzed and the strength of the muscles remaining under partial voluntary control will vary across subjects depending on the level and extent of the injury. In order to reflect SCI, the musculoskeletal model needs to be customized for each individual, specifically to include maximum muscle forces. An algorithm to estimate shoulder maximum muscle forces based on experimental measurements of shoulder moments and muscle activation has been developed and applied to simulated trial data.

However, supporting ad-hoc queries across multiple data resources and correlating the data retrieved from these is still difficult. To address this, we are building a mediator based on the functional data model database, P/FDM, which integrates access to heterogeneous, distributed biological databases, while making use of existing search engines and indexes, without infringing on the autonomy of the underlying databases. Central to our design philosophy is the use of schemas.

In this paper, given a set of clients, we show how these clients may be partitioned into “sync-classes” sets of clients who can be serviced through allocation of a single set of resources. As a set of clients may be partitioned into sync-classes in many different ways, we show that a very large class of cost functions may be used to determine which partition to choose. We provide algorithms to compute such optimal splits. Our framework is very generic in the following ways: the system may plug-in any cost function whatsoever, as long as it satisfies four common-sense axioms that evaluate costs; and the system may evaluate the future anticipated requests of a user using any user model (e.g., a Markovian model) that has a specified I/O interface.

Because of the continuous global measurements of SST that satellites can provide they play a fundamental role in acquiring the data sets necessary for studies of such global processes. However, the satellite data still need to be validated against in-situ measurements in order to assess the accuracy of satellite SST retrieval algorithms. Since 1997 radiometric sea surface skin temperatures have been recorded monthly using a TASCO radiometer along a cross shelf transect extending 40 km offshore from a coastal location north of Perth, Western Australia. This SST measurement program is one component of the Hillarys Transect, an ongoing multidisciplinary oceanographic study which aims to quantify the seasonal variation of physical and biological variables in the coastal Indian Ocean. Validation of satellite SST retrieval algorithms is the primary aim of the SST measurement program component of the Hillarys Transect, which also aims to develop a data set which captures the seasonal variation of SST off the coast of southern Western Australia (WA). The radiometric SST measurements are made at 9 stations along the transect and each measurement is calibrated using a portable water-filled blackbody unit. Though the study is low budget, the seasonal variation in SST is clearly captured by the data set and good agreement between in-situ and satellite SST estimates are obtained. Calibration of the radiometer is discussed along with the seasonal cycle of SST off the WA coast and the suitability of the instrumentation for validation of remotely sensed SST","","POD:0-7803-7031-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2001.976684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=976684","","Australia;Global warming;Information retrieval;Ocean temperature;Particle measurements;Radiometry;Satellite broadcasting;Sea measurements;Sea surface;Temperature measurement","oceanographic regions;remote sensing","El Nino;Hillarys Transect sea surface temperature measurement and validation program;Indian Ocean;SST;TASCO radiometer;data sets;global warming;in-situ measurements;radiometric sea surface skin temperatures;retrieval algorithms;satellite data;seasonal variation","","0","","10","","","2001","09 Jul 2001-13 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most previous analysis attempts have made certain simplifying assumptions about the data sets and/or queries to keep the analysis tractable. As a result, they may no be universally applicable. This paper proposes a set of five analysis techniques to estimate the selectivity and number of index nodes accessed in serving a range query. The underlying philosophy behind these techniques is to maintain an auxiliary data structure called a density file, whose creation is a one-time cost, which can be quickly consulted when the query is given. The schemes differ in what information is kept in the density file, how it is maintained and how this information is looked up. It is shown that one of the proposed schemes, called “cumulative density” (CD), gives very accurate results (usually less then 5% error) using a diverse suite of point and rectangular data sets, that are uniform or skewed, and a wide range of query window parameters. The estimation takes a constant amount of time, which is typically lower than 1% of the time that it would take to execute the query, regardless of data set or query window parameters","1063-6382;10636382","POD:0-7695-0506-6","10.1109/ICDE.2000.839451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839451","","Application software;Computer science;Costs;Electronic switching systems;Geographic Information Systems;Image databases;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Performance analysis;Spatial databases","database theory;query processing;spatial data structures;visual databases","auxiliary data structure;cumulative density;data lookup method;density file;index node access;information maintenance;multidimensional data;one-time cost;point data sets;query window parameters;range query analysis;rectangular data sets;selectivity estimation;skewed data sets;spatial data;uniform data sets","","15","","27","","","2000","29 Feb 2000-03 Mar 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the approach of query by example, the index-matching algorithm takes a multiresolution approach by hierarchically comparing histograms at different resolutions.

As recent theoretical results show, state of the art approaches to nearest-neighbor search are not efficient in higher dimensions. In our new approach, we therefore precompute the result of any nearest-neighbor search which corresponds to a computation of the Voronoi cell of each data point. In a second step, we store conservative approximations of the Voronoi cells in an index structure efficient for high-dimensional data spaces. As a result, nearest neighbor search corresponds to a simple point query on the index structure. Although our technique is based on a precomputation of the solution space, it is dynamic, i.e., it supports insertions of new data points. An extensive experimental evaluation of our technique demonstrates the high efficiency for uniformly distributed as well as real data.

Though we may have multi-temporal, multi-spectral, and now even multiangular observations, the increasing of information in data is often accompanied with an increasing of number of unknown parameters. Thus in present remote sensing practice, we should make the best use of prior knowledge by a developing suitable inversion strategy. This is the key to resolving this problem. In order to achieve this, we studied the multi-stage, sample-direction dependent, target-decisions (MSDT) inversion strategy. Here a traditional intelligent problem is used to illustrate how prior knowledge is propagating in a multi-stage procedure, and how the information is accumulated in each stage through inversion using new observations. The solution of this problem demonstrates how MSDT concept works.

These schemes include a class of latin-square-based schemes, Disk Modulo, Fieldwise Exclusive-OR, Hilbert Curve Allocation Method, and a random assignment scheme. We show that, unlike the case of range queries, disk module outperforms other schemes and gives nearly optimal performance for navigation queries. In addition, we propose a new scheme under the constraint of bounded window size-a common constraint in practice due to resource limitation such as monitor resolution or memory size.

The signal decomposition capability of SVD is exploited to extract the significant feature components of the ECG by decomposing the ECG into a set of basic patterns with associated scaling factors. The signal information is mostly concentrated within a certain number of singular values with related singular vectors due to the strong interbeat correlation among ECG cycles. Therefore, only the relevant parts of the singular triplets need to be retained as the compressed data for retrieving the original signals. The insignificant overhead can be truncated to eliminate the redundancy of ECG data compression. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital arrhythmia database was applied to evaluate the compression performance and recoverability in the retrieved ECG signals. The approximate achievement was presented with an average data rate of 143.2 b/s with a relatively low reconstructed error. These results showed that the truncated SVD method can provide efficient coding with high-compression ratios. The computational efficiency of the SVD method in comparing with other techniques demonstrated the method as an effective technique for ECG data storage or signals transmission.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/4233.966104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=966104","","Data compression;Data mining;Databases;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Hospitals;Information retrieval;Redundancy;Signal resolution;Singular value decomposition","data compression;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;singular value decomposition","143.2 bit/s;ECG data compression;ECG data storage;ECG signal transmission;Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital arrhythmia database;coding;feature components;recoverability;redundancy;scaling factors;signal decomposition;singular triplets;singular vectors;strong interbeat correlation;truncated singular value decomposition","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Databases as Topic;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electrocardiography;Humans;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","69","","23","","","Dec. 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To guarantee continuous service during disk failure, parity data is stored on-disk and then used to reconstruct missing data. Data pages are clustered into groups and for each group a parity page is computed by applying bitwise exclusive-or over the data pages in the group. The data and parity pages in a group are stored on different disks. If a disk fails then the system can reconstruct a page on the faulty disk by applying bitwise exclusive-or to the other data pages in the group and the parity page. However, retrieving the parity and data pages imposes additional demands on the operational disks. We propose two grouping techniques that aim to minimize the overhead of retrieving the other pages in the parity group. These techniques cluster pages that are likely to be retrieved simultaneously into one parity group. By integrating our grouping techniques with BIBD-based data placement, we produce fault-tolerant layouts for multimedia data. These layouts were evaluated and compared with the declustered parity scheme using a simulation study.
