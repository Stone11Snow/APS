In this paper we address this challenge by proposing a multi-modal version of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model which provides a joint latent representation. We evaluate this representation on the Million Song Dataset by integrating three fundamentally different modalities, namely tags, lyrics, and audio features. We show how the resulting representation is aligned with common 'cognitive' variables such as tags, and provide some evidence for the common assumption that genres form an acceptable categorization when evaluating latent representations of music. We furthermore quantify the model by its predictive performance in terms of genre and style, providing benchmark results for the Million Song Dataset.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-0356-6; POD:978-1-4799-0357-3; USB:978-1-4799-0355-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638242","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638242","Audio representation;Million Song Dataset;genre classification.;multi-modal LDA","Computational modeling;Music;Mutual information;Resource management;Standards;Support vector machines;Vocabulary","audio signal processing;information retrieval;music;speech processing","Latent Dirichlet allocation model;audio information analysis;audio information retrieval;cognitive variables;joint latent representation;multimodal data sources;music;universal representation","","1","","30","","","26-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, location privacy has become one of the most critical concerns for ensuring users' right to protection. Despite the fact that one of the best ways to protect the location information is not to reveal it, there are advantages on using this information to personalize services, however it is necessary to guarantee its protection. Private Information Retrieval is a technique that creates a common language between users and service provider so that external actors cannot understand most of the information being transferred. This paper introduces MaPIR, a mapping-based private information retrieval technique that uses mathematically generated mapping to create redundancy in order to provide multiple answers to a user with an undistinguishable location. This technique is decentralized and focuses on Point of Interest Search-based application, not on tracking services. For performance evaluation, were compared in two scenarios MaPIR, a regular spatial query and the Dummy Query technique, the results show that MaPIR takes only half the time of regular geographical queries on database processing, and 5 times less than the Dummy Query technique, while providing a similar level of redundancy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0540-9; POD:978-1-4799-0538-6","10.1109/LCNW.2013.6758539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6758539","LBIS;Location obfuscation;geographical query;point of interest;privacy","Conferences;Databases;Information retrieval;Privacy;Redundancy;Security;Servers","cartography;data privacy;geographic information systems;information retrieval;mobile computing;query processing;security of data","LBIS;MaPIR;database processing;dummy query technique;geographical queries;location privacy;mapping-based private information retrieval technique;mobile device;performance evaluation;point-of-interest search-based application;regular spatial query","","2","","17","","","21-24 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, maintaining such variants becomes difficult and expensive over the time. To re-engineer such software variants into a software product line (SPL) for systematic reuse, it is important to identify source code elements that implement a specific feature in order to understand product variants code. Information Retrieval(IR) methods have been used widely to support this purpose in a single software. This paper proposes a new approach to improve the performance of IR methods in a collection of similar software variants. Our proposal produces following two improvements. First, increasing the accuracy of IR results by exploiting commonality and variability across software variants. Secondly, increasing the number of retrieved links that are relevant by reducing the abstraction gap between feature and source code levels. We have validated our approach with a set of variants of two different systems.

This has two objectives: a comparison of metrics in the domain and study the impact of various methods like ontology comparison and clustering on the metrics as a whole. This will lead to further refinement of the metrics for current and future needs in the domain. Earlier works in the domain have highlighted the fact that the results of the similarity measures are more or less the same.

The general idea of the proposed data driven approach is to model the uncertainty pertaining to this missing data. We chose the general model of belief functions as it encompasses as special cases both classical and probability models. Several uncertainty models are then compared based on (1) an expressiveness criterion (non-specificity or randomness) and (2) objective measures of performance typical to the Information Retrieval domain.

In this paper, we are proposing an information retrieval approach that is not making any assumption about the user. It offers a straightforward way to choose and navigate the available interpretations. Our approach relies on a navigation model that is based on a new paradigm called multi-space interpretation index and projection operations. We have derived a mathematical model of a Web information retrieval system based on the new paradigm.

We propose a Context-aware Personal Information Retrieval (CPIR) algorithm, which considers both the participatory and implicit-topical properties of the context to improve the retrieval performance. Since both the context and the user's web information are usually short and ambiguous, the participatory context is utilized to formulate and expand the query. Moreover, the implicit-topical context is exploited to implicitly determine the importance of each web information of the targeting user in the given context.

An important aspect of the clustering process is calculating the semantic similarity of Web services. Most current clustering approaches are based on similarity-distance measurement, including keyword, ontology and information-retrieval-based methods. Problems with these approaches include a shortage of high quality ontologies and a loss of semantic information. In addition, there has been little fine-grained improvement in existing approaches to service clustering. In this paper, we present a new approach to grouping Web services into functionally similar clusters by mining Web service documents and generating an ontology via hidden semantic patterns present within the complex terms used in service features to measure similarity. If calculating the similarity using the generated ontology fails, the similarity is calculated by using an information-retrieval-based term-similarity method that adopts term-similarity measuring techniques used by thesaurus and search engines. Another important aspect of high performance in clustering is identifying the most suitable cluster center. To improve the utility of clusters, we propose an approach to identifying the cluster center that combines service similarity with the term frequency-inverse document frequency values of service names. Experimental results show that our clustering approach performs better than existing approaches.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5025-1; POD:978-1-4799-0489-1","10.1109/ICWS.2013.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6649597","Ontology Learning;Web Service Clustering","Clustering algorithms;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Matched filters;Ontologies;Semantics;Web services","Web services;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;search engines;text analysis;thesauri","Web service clustering;Web service document mining;cluster center identification;complex term;hidden semantic pattern;information retrieval-based term similarity;keyword;ontology learning;search engine;semantic similarity measure;service feature;service name;similarity distance measurement;term frequency inverse document frequency value;thesaurus","","9","","18","","","June 28 2013-July 3 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Toward the new MIR, we propose an architecture of MIR driven by EEG signals in this paper. While the architecture contains many issues to be solved, the point of the architecture is to construct user's music query in multi-layered aggregation of EEG signals. We describe in this paper the preliminary experiments conducted for selecting some appropriate low-level features for our multi-layered query construction and matching.

Although there are some SMS based applications in m-Learning, most of them are only for administrative purposes, like delivering messages to students as reminders or alerts for some learning activities. In this paper, we introduce a SMS Server [1] for querying information and knowledge by the use of SMS in a mobile learning environment. The proposed system consists of a GSM Module (GSMM), a Dialogue Control Module (DCM) which also works as a Querying Processing Module (QPM). GSMM includes a micro-controller and a GSM communication device with a SIM card in it. It processes the user's messages according to our defined protocol and acts as the interface between the mobile infrastructure and the rest of the system. DCM handles the content of the requesting messages and produces suitable querying tasks for QPM which in turn searches and matches information from Internet to produce suitable answering messages for the users according to their requesting messages.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0400-6; POD:978-1-4799-0397-9","10.1109/ICIEV.2013.6572597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6572597","Internet;Mobile;SMS;Search;Server;System","Databases;Feeds;GSM;Internet;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Servers","Internet;computer aided instruction;electronic messaging;mobile computing;mobile handsets;query processing","China;DCM;GSM communication device;GSM module;GSMM;Internet;QPM;SIM card;SMS based information retrieval system;SMS server;dialogue control module;information querying;knowledge querying;low end mobile devices;m-Learning;microcontroller;mobile infrastructure;mobile learning environment;mobile phone;querying processing module;short message service","","0","","15","","","17-18 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under these circumstances, a major challenge in search engines is the ranking operation. Ranking is the process of ordering the returned documents in decreasing order of relevance, that is, so that the “best” answers are on the top. Over the past decade, several studies in field of relevance propagation models have been done to improve the quality of web search. These models propagate content information with the assistance of the web structure. In this paper we explore and extend one of the propagation models, called Slash-Based Relevance Propagation Model. We are going to embed a field-based similarity function in it and then conduct experimental evaluations over the extended model to know how much the extended model is effective in compared to the old one. To evaluate the extended propagation model, Letor 3.0 - a standard web test collection including two standard data sets-was used in the experiments. We have concluded that using field-based content similarity function in the propagation process provides significant improvement in the relevance propagation accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6490-4; POD:978-1-4673-6488-1","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620121","Webpage Ranking;World Wide Web;propagation model","Algorithm design and analysis;Benchmark testing;Computational modeling;Search engines;Standards;Web pages","Internet;information dissemination;information retrieval;search engines","Letor 3.0;WWW;Web information retrieval;Web test collection;World Wide Web;content information propagation;field-based content similarity function;field-based similarity function;field-slash based relevance propagation;ranking operation;search engines","","0","","42","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, semi-automatically or fully-automatically generating accurate trace links remains an open research challenge, especially for legacy systems. Vector Space Model (VSM), a notably known Information Retrieval (IR) technique aims to remedy this situation. However, VSM's low-accuracy level in practice is a limitation. The contribution of this paper is an improved VSM-based post-requirements trace ability recovery approach using a novel context analysis. Specifically, the analysis method can better utilize context information extracted from use cases to discover relevant source code files. Our approach is evaluated by using three different embedded applications in the domains of industrial automation, automotive and mobile. The evaluation shows that our new approach can achieve better accuracy than VSM, in terms of higher values of three main IR metrics, i.e., recall, precision, and mean average precision, when it handles embedded software applications.","1089-6503;10896503","Electronic:978-0-7695-5091-6; POD:978-1-4799-1490-6","10.1109/SEAA.2013.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6619519","context analysis;embedded system;functional requirements;post-requirements traceability;trace link recovery;vector space model (VSM)","Accuracy;Context;Context modeling;Ice;Software;Standards;Vectors","embedded systems;information retrieval;program diagnostics;program testing;program verification;software metrics;source coding","IR metrics;VSM-based post-requirements traceability recovery approach;automotive domains;context analysis;context information extraction;context-based information retrieval technique;design documents;embedded software applications;embedded software system development;industrial automation;legacy systems;mean average precision;mobile domains;source code;source code file discovery;test cases;use-case-to-source-code trace link recovery;vector space model","","0","","31","","","4-6 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a dynamic handwritten signature verification based access control system that can be employed in the legal, banking and commercial domains for designing secure information retrieval systems. The dynamic handwritten signature in this system is captured by using a digital tablet or PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) with contact sensitive acquisition system. After preprocessing, the signature data is compared with the templates of authorized signatures by employing an innovative neuro-fuzzy pattern recognition system based on sensing the pressure variable and total time required for executing the signature for uniquely identifying the potential user. The error in matching is used to arrive at the decision regarding permission or denial of access to the classified document. The neuro-fuzzy technique applied in the dynamic signature system is based on evolving fuzzy neural network. This technique has been tested on signatures drawn from signature verification competition database obtained from the internet.

Beyond counting on relevance between documents and query, diversity IR takes consideration of relationship among documents in ranking order to promote diversity and reduce redundancy. To promote diversity means to provide various aspects of information in the ranking results list and to reduce redundancy aims to deduce repeatedly mentioned information. The application of diversity IR has drawn great attention and shown beneficial in previous studies when query turns out to be ambiguous, especially in the scenario of biomedical IR investigated in TREC<sup>1</sup> 2006 and 2007 Genomics Tracks where biologists tend to query a certain type of entities covering different aspects that are related to the question, for example, genes, proteins, diseases, and mutations [1]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no learning-to-rank algorithm that processes the biomedical information retrieval in the perspective of addressing the domain specific features that may reflect the novelty of single document and the diversity of whole ranking list. We argue that it is promising to define and make use of diversity reflecting features to better model diversity information. Unlike previous studies, we tackle this problem in the learning-to-rank [3] perspective view. The main challenges are how to find salient features for biomedical data and how to tackle the problem of utilizing dynamic features with learning-to-rank technology. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine the dynamic diversified features with the learning-to-rank technology. Firstly we rank results using a general learning-to-rank model. Second, using Wikipedia, the topics of each retrieved results are detected which facilitate the generation of diversity-biased features. (Table I lists exampl- of diversity features.) Then a diversity-favored ranking model which awards high novelty and low redundancy ranking results is learned from dataset represented by all features. Final results will be given by combination of both models. Experiment results conducted on the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics collections show our proposed method outperforms BM25, Language Model with Dirichlet Smoothing and general learning-to-rank model. The major contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose several diversity-reflecting features by studying the relationship among documents. Second, we propose a learning to rank framework to combine the diversity-biased model with a general ranking model learned from the common features. Extensive experiments on the TREC 2006 and 2007 Genomics Tracks[1] demonstrate that the using of diversity-based features is beneficial for promoting diversity in biomedical IR.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1309-1; POD:978-1-4799-1311-4","10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732579","","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Educational institutions;Genomics;Information retrieval;Information technology;Knowledge management","genomics;information retrieval;medical information systems","2007 Genomics Tracks;TREC1 2006;Wikipedia;biomedical information retrieval;disambiguation;diversity information;diversity-favored ranking model;documents;information ranking results list;learning-to-rank technology;personalization;rich features;user queries","","1","","4","","","18-21 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The group delay function, which is the negative derivative of the phase spectrum, yields robust spectral estimates. Hence the group delay spectral estimates are first computed over frequency sub-bands after passing the speech signal through a bank of filters. The filter bank spacing is based on a multi-pitch algorithm that computes the pitch estimates of the competing speakers. An affinity matrix is then computed from the group delay spectral estimates of each frequency sub-band. This affinity matrix represents the correlations of the different sub-bands in the mixed broadband speech signal. The grouping of correlated harmonics present in the mixed speech signal is then carried out by using a new iterative graph cut method. The signals are reconstructed from the respective harmonic groups which represent individual speakers in the mixed speech signal. Spectrographic masks are then applied on the reconstructed signals to refine their perceptual quality. The quality of separated speech is evaluated using several objective and subjective criteria. Experiments on multi-speaker automatic speech recognition are conducted using mixed speech data from the GRID corpus. A cell phone based multimedia information retrieval system (MIRS) for multi-source meeting environments are also developed.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2013.2247391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470685","Group delay cross correlation function;iterative graph cut method;multi-speaker speech recognition;multimedia information retrieval;speaker separation","Correlation;Delay;Frequency modulation;Harmonic analysis;Indexes;Speech;Time frequency analysis","channel bank filters;delays;graph theory;information retrieval systems;iterative methods;matrix algebra;mobile handsets;multimedia systems;signal reconstruction;speaker recognition","GRID corpus;MIRS;affinity matrix;cell phone based multimedia information retrieval system;correlated harmonic grouping;filter bank spacing;frequency subbands;group delay based methods;group delay cross-correlation function;group delay function;group delay spectral estimation;iterative graph cut method;mixed broadband speech signal;mixed speech data;multipitch algorithm;multisource meeting environments;multispeaker automatic speech recognition;negative derivative;objective criteria;perceptual quality;phase spectrum;pitch estimation;signal reconstruction;single channel speaker segregation;spectrographic masks;subjective criteria","","2","","51","","20130225","Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The information need is expressed by the user as a query. Documents that satisfy the given query in the judgment of the user are said to be relevant. The documents that are not of the given topic are said to be non-relevant. An IR engine may use the query to classify the documents in a collection, returning to the user a subset of documents that satisfy some classification criterion. There are several search engines to find information in the given repositories containing large amounts of unstructured form of text data. However, the task of ad hoc information retrieval is, finding documents within a corpus like Bible, that are relevant to the user remains a hard challenge. Sometimes the relevant documents may not contain the specified keyword. The lack of the given term in a document does not necessarily mean that the document is not a relevant. Because more than one terms can be semantically similar although they are lexicographically different.

The outlined research activities are based on Lexicon-Grammar (LG), a method devised for natural language formalization, automatic textual analysis and parsing. Thanks to its main characteristics, LG is independent from factors which are critical for other approaches, i.e. interaction type (voice or keyboard-based), length of sentences and propositions, type of vocabulary used and restrictions due to users' idiolects.

Singer identification in polyphonic music is based on general audio classification methods. The presence of instruments is detrimental to voice identification performance, and eliminating the effect of instrumental accompaniment is an important aspect of the prob-lem. The results show that classification of singing voices can be done robustly in polyphonic music when using source separation. Lyrics transcription is approached as a speech recognition prob-lem, with specific elements for dealing with singing voice. The variability of phonation in singing poses a significant challenge to the speech recognition approach. The word recognition accuracy of the lyrics transcription from singing is quite low, but it is shown to be useful in a query-by-singing application, for performing a textual search based on the words recognized from the query.

The novel matching functions called Overall Matching Function (OMF) and Virtual Center based Matching Function (VCF) are proposed for improving the retrieval performance. Overall Matching Function gives the results by finding the average of matching scores from classical matching functions and VCF is based on finding the virtual center from the set of centroids present in clustering space.

Audio search algorithms should be efficient in terms of speed and memory to handle large audio files. In general, approaches derived from the well known dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm suffer from scalability problems. To overcome such problems, an Information Retrieval-based DTW (IR-DTW) algorithm has been proposed recently. IR-DTW borrows techniques from Information Retrieval community to detect regions which are more likely to contain the spoken query and then uses a standard DTW to obtain exact start and end times. One drawback of the IR-DTW is the time taken for the retrieval of similar reference points for a given query point. In this paper we propose a method to improve the search performance of IR-DTW algorithm using a clustering based technique.

In this paper we propose a new approach to term weighting in which term weights are assigned using the structural information from the source code. We then evaluate the proposed approach by conducting an empirical study of a TR-based FLT.

"Suffix stripping algorithm for Kannada information retrieval","Y. Hegde; S. Kadambe; P. Naduthota","NIEIT, Mysore, India","2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics (ICACCI)","20131021","2013","","","527","533","Due to the explosion of usage of the internet and websites a huge amount of data on the web is available in languages other than English. Hence, it is important to develop Information Retrieval (IR) tools for other languages too for web searches. This is as challenging as developing an IR tool for English since each language has unique characteristics of its own. In the development of an IR tool for a particular language we need to consider the specifics of that language. Due to unique characteristics of each language, many efficient algorithms developed for the IR in English language cannot be used directly. Here we consider a south Indian language Kannada and propose a suffix stripping algorithm. This algorithm is for the Kannada text available on-line in unicode. It is a rule based approach that strips fourteen different major classifications of suffixes (pratyaya in Kannada) and some sub classes. It also covers suffixes associated with nouns, verbs, articles, adjectives and stop words. This algorithm will be very useful to rank Kannada documents( that are represented by a bag-of-words) based on relevance upon a query in web searches. It can also be used in Kannada (i) text extraction, (ii) natural language processing tools and (iii)speech recognition engines. We have implemented this suffix stripping stemming algorithm and have evaluated it using Kannada documents from “Kendasampige” a web based magazine with and without our stemming algorithm. We used several metrics for the evaluation. Our results indicate that the recall factor is much better after stemming. This promising preliminary results imply the applicability of this algorithm to the above mentioned applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6217-7; POD:978-1-4799-1664-1","10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637227","Information Retrieval;Kannada;Stemming;Suffix Stripping","Foot;Instruments","Internet;Web sites;natural language processing;query processing;text analysis","English language;IR tool;Internet;Kannada documents;Kannada information retrieval;Kannada text unicode;Kendasampige;Web based magazine;Web search;Web search query;Web sites;information retrieval tools;natural language processing tools;pratyaya;rule based approach;south Indian language;speech recognition engines;suffix stripping stemming algorithm;text extraction","","2","","21","","","22-25 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Transcribing recordings greatly enhances their usefulness by making them easy to search. However, the number of recordings accumulates rapidly, rendering manual transcription impractical. Automatic transcription, on the other hand, suffers from low levels of accuracy, partly due to the special language of academic disciplines, which standard language models do not cover. This paper looks into the use of Wikipedia to dynamically adapt language models for scholarly speech. We propose Ranked Word Correct Rate as a new metric better aligned with the goals of improving transcript search ability and specialist word recognition. The study shows that, while overall transcription accuracy may remain low, targeted language modelling can substantially improve search ability, an important goal in its own right.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786171","","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Crawlers;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet","Web sites;educational technology;further education;information retrieval","Wikipedia;academic disciplines;academic lecture transcription;audio data;automatic transcription;information retrieval;lecture capture systems;ranked word correct rate;search ability;standard language models;university lectures;video data;word recognition","","0","","22","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a demand in building Applications of IR in Local languages, which allows common people with minimal knowledge in at least one language to avail the information services. Word mismatch is a common problem in IR System Applications. The research is started to overcome this problem in 4 decades back and still the problem is unsolved. The methods were moving from word replacement to knowledge replacement to solve word mismatch and concept mismatches. This paper mainly explored towards solving word mismatch problem in India language context particularly Telugu language. IR in Telugu Language is in inception phase and need huge research to solve many issues in information processing and retrieval. Cross Lingual IR is quite comfortable stage with parallel rule conversion techniques, where as it is difficult to process Telugu alone and build Information Retrieval System. Telugu is morphologically rich with high conflational rate. In this paper we build IR in Telugu Language and extended to solve vocabulary mismatch problem using Synset relationships. When compared to base Retrieval system, expanded search yield offered results. This paper identified many issues related to topical search and given direction to solve with base proof with implementation results.

We are presenting the skeleton of such a system based on ontology. In this system, a user enters a query from which the meaningful concepts are extracted; using these concepts and domain ontology, query expansion is performed. For all the terms (expanded and initial query terms), SPARQL query is built and then it is fired on the knowledge base that finds appropriate RDF triples in knowledge Base. Web documents relevant to the requested concepts and individuals specified in these triples are then retrieved. Finally, the retrieved documents are ranked according to their relevance to the user's query and then are sent to the user. If a user wants to find specific information; can search with another module of our system that works without query expansion. The approach of query expansion makes use of query concepts as well as synonyms of these concepts and the new terms relate with the original query terms within a threshold.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0317-7; POD:978-1-4799-0316-0","10.1109/ISSP.2013.6526942","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526942","Automatic query expansion;Information Retrieval;SPARQL;Semantic Search;WordNet;ontology;semantic similarity","Java;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Search engines;Semantics;Signal processing algorithms","Internet;SQL;document handling;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;search engines","RDF triples;SPARQL query;Web documents;automatic query expansion;document;domain ontology based semantic search;information retrieval;knowledge base;search engine","","3","","15","","","1-2 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this, natural language information retrieval techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential faulty source files given bug reports. While these techniques are very scalable, in practice their effectiveness remains low in accurately localizing bugs to a small number of files. Our key insight is that structured information retrieval based on code constructs, such as class and method names, enables more accurate bug localization. We present BLUiR, which embodies this insight, requires only the source code and bug reports, and takes advantage of bug similarity data if available. We build BLUiR on a proven, open source IR toolkit that anyone can use. Our work provides a thorough grounding of IR-based bug localization research in fundamental IR theoretical and empirical knowledge and practice. We evaluate BLUiR on four open source projects with approximately 3,400 bugs.

The accessibility to these resources requires the development of environments which allow both to manage multilingual complexity and to preserve the semantic interoperability. The creation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications is finalized to the achievement of CrossLingual Information Retrieval (CLIR). This paper presents an ongoing research on language processing based on the LexiconGrammar (LG) approach with the goal of improving knowledge management in the Cultural Heritage repositories. The proposed framework aims to guarantee interoperability between multilingual systems in order to overcome crucial issues like cross-language and cross-collection retrieval. Indeed, the LG methodology tries to overcome the shortcomings of statistical approaches as in Google Translate or Bing by Microsoft concerning Multi-Word Unit (MWU) processing in queries, where the lack of linguistic context represents a serious obstacle to disambiguation. In particular, translations concerning specific domains, as it is has been widely recognized, is unambiguous since the meanings of terms are mono-referential and the type of relation that links a given term to its equivalent in a foreign language is biunivocal, i.e. a one-to-one coupling which causes this relation to be exclusive and reversible. Ontologies are used in CLIR and are considered by several scholars a promising research area to improve the effectiveness of Information Extraction (IE) techniques particularly for technical-domain queries. Therefore, we present a methodological framework which allows to map both the data and the metadata among the language-specific onto","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3170-5; POD:978-1-4799-3171-2; USB:978-1-4799-3169-9","10.1109/DigitalHeritage.2013.6744767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6744767","Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval;Knowledge Management;Ontologies","Compounds;Dictionaries;Grammar;Ontologies;Pragmatics;Resource description framework;Semantics","history;knowledge management;meta data;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems","Bing;CLIR;English-Italian language pair;European Library;Europeana;Google Translate;IE techniques;LG approach;MWU processing;Microsoft;NLP applications;cross-lingual information retrieval strategies;cultural content;cultural heritage repositories;foreign language;information extraction techniques;institutions;knowledge management;language-specific ontologies;lexicon-grammar approach;metadata;methodological framework;multilingual systems;multiword unit processing;natural language processing applications;one-to-one coupling;providers;semantic interoperability;semantic search;statistical approaches;technical-domain queries","","0","","24","","","Oct. 28 2013-Nov. 1 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
