"A Blocking Strategy to Improve Gene Selection for Classification of Gene Expression Data","G. Bontempi","Departement d'Informatique, Univ. Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","20070507","2007","4","2","293","300","Because of high dimensionality, machine learning algorithms typically rely on feature selection techniques in order to perform effective classification in microarray gene expression data sets. However, the large number of features compared to the number of samples makes the task of feature selection computationally hard and prone to errors. This paper interprets feature selection as a task of stochastic optimization, where the goal is to select among an exponential number of alternative gene subsets the one expected to return the highest generalization in classification. Blocking is an experimental design strategy which produces similar experimental conditions to compare alternative stochastic configurations in order to be confident that observed differences in accuracy are due to actual differences rather than to fluctuations and noise effects. We propose an original blocking strategy for improving feature selection which aggregates in a paired way the validation outcomes of several learning algorithms to assess a gene subset and compare it to others. This is a novelty with respect to conventional wrappers, which commonly adopt a sole learning algorithm to evaluate the relevance of a given set of variables. The rationale of the approach is that, by increasing the amount of experimental conditions under which we validate a feature subset, we can lessen the problems related to the scarcity of samples and consequently come up with a better selection. The paper shows that the blocking strategy significantly improves the performance of a conventional forward selection for a set of 16 publicly available cancer expression data sets. The experiments involve six different classifiers and show that improvements take place independent of the classification algorithm used after the selection step. Two further validations based on available biological annotation support the claim that blocking strategies in feature selection may improve the accuracy and the quality of the solut- - ion. The first validation is based on retrieving PubMEd abstracts associated to the selected genes and matching them to regular expressions describing the biological phenomenon underlying the expression data sets. The biological validation that follows is based on the use of the Bioconductor package GoStats in order to perform gene ontology statistical analysis","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2007.1014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196539","Bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases;data mining;feature evaluation and selection.;machine learning","Aggregates;Cancer;Classification algorithms;Design for experiments;Fluctuations;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Machine learning algorithms;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance","cancer;data mining;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;molecular biophysics;ontologies (artificial intelligence);optimisation;statistical analysis;stochastic processes","bioconductor package GoStats;blocking strategy;cancer expression;data classification;feature selection;fluctuations;gene ontology statistical analysis;gene selection;learning algorithms;machine learning;microarray gene expression;noise effects","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Gene Expression Profiling;Models, Biological;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Proteome;Signal Transduction","20","","35","","","April-June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

QA systems emerged several decades back. In this paper, we perform a measurement study of a popular, large scale Web-QA system, i.e. iAsk, and systematically investigate various behavior patterns and the system performance. To evaluate such a Web-QA system, we propose three performance metrics, namely reply-rate, reply-number, and reply-latency, which are most closely related to the QoS of a Web-QA system. Based on extensive measurement results, we propose a mathematical framework for the three performance metrics that capture our observation precisely. The framework reveals that the QoS of a Web-QA system actually heavily depends on three key factors: the user scale, user reply probability and a system design artifact (related to Webpage layout). We study their respective impacts on the system performance. Finally, we propose several ways through which current Web-QA system can be improved.

This paper presents a number of possible generalizations of musical instruments sounds classification which can be used to construct different hierarchical decision attributes. Each decision attribute will lead us to a new classifier and the same to a different system for automatic indexing of music by instrument sounds and their generalizations. Values of a decision attribute and their generalizations are used to construct atomic queries of a query language built for retrieving musical objects from MIR database (see http://www.mir.uncc.edu). When query fails, the cooperative strategy will try to find its lowest generalization which does not fail, taking into consideration all available hierarchical attributes. Thus, the music object representing most similar object in the database is returned as the query answer.

In addition to fast searching using this compact descriptor, we further improve retrieval time by applying pruning technique, which looks for the candidate images similar to the query image from the database and ignore the rest that are not likely to the query image. The descriptors of the candidate images are then matched with that of the query. The most similar images will be retrieved and ordered according to their distance to the query.

Debugging such SOCs is hard. Based on a classification of debug scope and granularity, we propose that debugging should be communication-centric and based on transactions. Communication-centric debug focuses on the communication and the synchronisation between the IP blocks, which are implemented by the interconnect using transactions. We define and implement a modular debug architecture, based on NOC, monitors, and a dedicated high-speed event-distribution broadcast interconnect. The manufacturing-test scan chains and IEEE1149.1 test access ports (TAP) are re-used for configuration and debug data read-out. Our debug architecture requires only small changes to the functional architecture. The additional area cost is limited to the monitors and the event distribution interconnect, which are 4.5% of the NOC area, or less than 0.2% of the SOC area. The debug architecture runs at NOC functional speed and reacts very quickly to debug events to stop the SOC close in time to the condition that raised the event. The speed at which data is retrieved from the SOC after stopping using the TAP is 10 MHz. We prove our concepts and architecture with a gate-level implementation that includes the NOC, event distribution interconnect, and clock, reset, and TAP controllers.

Modern substations are equipped with different types of IEDs. DFRs are traditionally used to capture data from various events and disturbances in the power system that may need to be analyzed. Most of the modern IEDs such as digital relays, power quality meters, and sequence of event recorders can offer data recording function that is quite similar to that of DFRs. In some recent substation designs there are cases where DFR function is replaced by an equivalent function provided by DPRs. There are also cases when both DFRs and DPRs are used and configured to record the same events. In this case records from DPRs are used as a redundant source for event analysis. The paper addresses main requirements for integration of substation data: communication and automated IED data retrieval, unifying event data file formats, verification of event data content, and proper handling of the system configuration parameters. Examples of substation data integration using the proposed concept are discussed through expansion of an existing DFR data integration and analysis system and through introduction of data coming from different substation IEDs.

Unlike the current Web, in the semantic Web, metadata and ontology play important roles for advanced information retrieval systems. For describing semantics and reasoning about information resources on the Web, RDF, RDF Schema and OWL are proposed by W3C. OWL has rich expressive power and is considered as the next standard language for describing metadata and ontology. The related information resources are placed in distributed systems on the Web. So, for providing seamless services without the awareness of far distance, efficient management of the distributed information resources is required. And to be provided with richer query results, people need to acquire related information through integrating the distributed ontologies. Among languages for describing metadata and ontology, only OWL can support dispersibility of Web. In this paper, first we classify features of OWL for supporting distributed environment on the Web and propose strategies for united query processing of the distributed ontologies. Secondly, we suggest methods of storing ontologies according to the proposed strategies.

The first step is to define tags as the process of extracting tags after making DOM tree, parsing XML document. And, the second step is to make synonym-set as the process of making set by using a glossary defined by users.

The limited resources in these systems make minimizing their context acquisition a practical need, and the uncertainty in the mobile environment makes missing and erroneous context inputs a major concern. In this paper, we propose an approach based on Bayesian networks (BNs) for building recommender systems that minimize context acquisition. Our learning approach iteratively trims the BN-based context model until it contains only the minimal set of context parameters that are important to a user. In addition, we show that a two-tiered context model can effectively capture the causal dependencies among context parameters, enabling a recommender system to compensate for missing and erroneous context inputs. We have validated our proposed techniques on a restaurant recommendation data set and a Web page recommendation data set. In both benchmark problems, the minimal sets of context can be reliably discovered for the specific users. Furthermore, the learned Bayesian network consistently outperforms the J4.8 decision tree in overcoming both missing and erroneous context inputs to generate significantly more accurate predictions.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1065","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216312","Bayesian networks.;Recommender systems;context-awareness","Bayesian methods;Collaboration;Context modeling;Decision trees;Filtering;Information retrieval;Recommender systems;Robustness;Uncertainty;Web pages","","","","15","","44","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We named the intended purposes for a place ""space-human activity association"". Intended purposes for a place will be different depending on the purpose of activities, even if observed activities are almost the same. Therefore, estimation of space-human activity association is important for intelligent environments to design services provided for individual human according to his/her current situation. The spatial memory system enables human users to store computerized information into the real world by assigning a three-dimensional position to the information, and to retrieve the information by directly indicating the point using their own hands. In the spatial memory system, what associates computerized information with a three-dimensional position is called ""spatial-knowledge-tag (SKT)"". The users actively create SKTs based on their need. As a result, arranged SKTs in a specified environment correspond to activity histories of the users. Also, users' intended purposes for the environment are reflected in the arrangement. Therefore, classification of arranged SKTs leads to classification of human activities, and accordingly estimation of intended purposes for places. In this paper, we describe two approaches to classify human activities. More specifically, the first approach is a classification of arranged SKTs by using only SKTs' information. The second approach is a classification of arranged SKTs by using both SKTs' information and usage history of the spatial memory system. As a result, the classification based on usage history of the spatial memory system showed multiple activities in the same area. On the other hand, the first approach resulted in a single cluster in the same area.

Many protocols for wireless networks - routing, topology control, information storage/retrieval and numerous other applications - have been based on the idealized unit-disk graph (UDG) network model. The significant deviation of the UDG model from many real wireless networks is substantially limiting the applicability of such protocols. A more general network model, the quasi unit-disk graph (quasi-UDG) model, captures much better the characteristics of wireless networks. However, the understanding of the properties of general quasi-UDGs has been very limited, which is impeding the designs of key network protocols and algorithms. In this paper, we present results on two important properties of quasi-UDGs: separability and the existence of power efficient spanners. Network separability is a fundamental property leading to efficient network algorithms and fast parallel computation. We prove that every quasi-UDG has a corresponding grid graph with small balanced separators that captures its connectivity properties. We also study the problem of constructing an energy-efficient backbone for a quasi-UDG. We present a distributed localized algorithm that, given a quasi-UDG, constructs a nearly planar backbone with a constant stretch factor and a bounded degree. We demonstrate the excellent performance of these auxiliary graphs through simulations and show their applications in efficient routing.","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215839","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Impedance;Information retrieval;Network topology;Routing protocols;Spine;Wireless application protocol;Wireless networks","graph theory;protocols;radio networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology","auxiliary graphs;balanced separators;connectivity properties;constant stretch factor;distributed localized algorithm;grid graph;information retrieval;information storage;network protocols;network routing;network separability;parallel computation;quasi unit disk graph network model;structural properties;topology control;wireless networks","","13","","14","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

People utilize Internet services more and more to communicate with each other, e.g., via VoIP or chat. The next step would be to reutilize the same applications to achieve ubiquitous communication, anytime and anywhere, also where network support is not available, such as in ad-hoc networks. Existing Internet protocols must be modified for working in the ad-hoc server-less environment. The session initiation protocol (SIP) is a fundamental element in the Internet for establishing multimedia communication sessions. However, SIP cannot be used in ad-hoc networks, as it relies on the support of SIP servers in the network; e.g, in ad-hoc networks it is not possible to locate SIP users since the assistance of a dedicated SIP server is missing. A solution for this problem is presented in this paper, which describes and evaluates a fully decentralized mechanism for locating SIP users in ad-hoc networks","","CD-ROM:0-7803-9792-4; POD:0-7803-9791-6","10.1109/MOBIQW.2006.361724","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4205249","","Ad hoc networks;Broadcasting;Information retrieval;Internet;Mobile ad hoc networks;Mobile communication;Network servers;Protocols;Ubiquitous computing;Web server","Internet;ad hoc networks;mobile radio;multimedia communication;signalling protocols;ubiquitous computing","Internet protocols;Internet services;Internet-based communication;SIPCache;decentralized mechanism;distributed SIP location service;mobile ad-hoc networks;multimedia communication sessions;session initiation protocol;ubiquitous communication","","1","","5","","","17-21 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These algorithms are distributed, need very little global information and do not need knowledge about the location of sensors or the network topology.

Increasing amount of data and data intensive applications on the network, user queries may spend lots of computational resources, these requirements swells cache size, along with the increasing overheads of storage and retrieval of query semantics. We need to devise an efficient indexing scheme that is able to fetch the cache semantics precisely and at a fast rate for increasing efficiency of the semantic cache and to cope up with current querying pressures.

Every year India loses 15 % cotton and tea yield due to pestilence. This happens primarily due to lack proper forecasting facilities and inadequate precautionary and preventive measures. The ignorance of the farmers further accrues this loss, as they are not aware of the cheaper and effective solutions available to them. This paper presents a very innovative and effective solution that would solve this problem timely and hence result in reducing the losses to the agriculture industry. A microcontroller based insect pest detection and management system has been described that would retrieve, process and communicate data and information. This system, a very cost effective and reliable technique, easily provides information based on the ground surveys by subsystems, to the required control center, which then takes the necessary control measures. It relieves the farmer of worrying about the pestilence, instead it shifts the onus to the controlling authorities to effectively predict and take the effective steps to prevent the pestilence related problems. The reliable forecasting measures can help in reducing the problem to a great extent and prevent the unexpected food shortages. It may augment the national economy. Thus it becomes incumbent that an effective solution is introduced that is both robust and can withstand extreme weather and temperature variations, thus making their installation and operation quite feasible.","","CD-ROM:0-7695-2807-4","10.1109/ICONS.2007.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4196345","","Agriculture;Control systems;Costs;Cotton;Economic forecasting;Electrical equipment industry;Information retrieval;Insects;Microcontrollers;Weather forecasting","agriculture;information retrieval;microcontrollers;pest control","agriculture industry;food grains;information retrieval;microcontroller based insect pest detection;microcontroller based pest management system","","1","","7","","","22-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Toward the management of such knowledge structures, an important foundational problem is that of ontology reuse - it is uncommon for new applications or for different components within one application to use an already available ontology in its entirety. Depending on component specific requirements, typical re-usages are restricted to refined versions of an existing ontology, with the refinement taking the form of a contraction of the knowledge contained therein. Furthermore, when the ontology is used to ascribe meaning to independently existing 'resources' (e.g., documents collections, source code, software manuals, process template repositories) by way of meta-data, there exists a direct mapping between different views/re-uses of an ontology and their respective semantic scopes within an annotated resource repository thereby leading to the concept of view/reuse dependent resource retrieval. We implement a framework that supports ontology reuse by way of a requirement driven sub-ontology extraction methodology. Additionally, based on this concept of a sub-ontology, we implement the idea of a user/component 'requirement profile' consisting of semantic descriptions of the user's interest within a 'resource repository' that has been annotated with semantic types from the ontology under consideration. A generic framework that implements these ideas and its application in the domains of medical information retrieval systems and business process management systems (BPMS) is presented.","1530-0803;15300803","POD:0-7695-2778-7","10.1109/ASWEC.2007.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4159667","","Application software;Data mining;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Knowledge representation;Ontologies;Resource management;Semantic Web;Software engineering;Software systems","formal specification;information retrieval;meta data;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic Web;semantic networks","OntoMove;business process management systems;component specific requirements;formal knowledge representation structures;interoperability;knowledge based framework;medical information retrieval systems;meta-data;ontology reuse;resource acquisition;resource retrieval;semantic requirement profiling;software systems;sub-ontology extraction methodology","","4","","31","","","10-13 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Hamming distance is usually used to measure the distance between two vectors (objects) in an NDDS. Due to the coarse granularity of the Hamming distance, a k-NN query in an NDDS may lead to a large set of candidate solutions, creating a high degree of non-determinism for the query result. We propose a new distance measure, called granularity-enhanced Hamming (GEH) distance, that effectively reduces the number of candidate solutions for a query. We have also considered using multidimensional database indexing for implementing k-NN searches in NDDSs. Our experiments on synthetic and genomic data sets demonstrate that our index-based k-NN algorithm is effective and efficient in finding k-NNs in NDDSs.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:1-4244-0803-2; POD:1-4244-0802-4","10.1109/ICDE.2007.367888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221691","","Bioinformatics;DNA;Electronic commerce;Genomics;Hamming distance;Indexing;Information retrieval;Multidimensional systems;Multimedia databases;Sequences","database indexing;query processing","coarse granularity;granularity-enhanced Hamming distance;k-nearest neighbor query retrieval;k-nearest neighbor searching;multidimensional database indexing;nonordered discrete data space","","3","","20","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this reason, such network element needs to access user profile information.

Since the clustering is performed over features that can be automatically extracted, the process is scalable. In addition, because it uses a rich set of metadata, our approach is able to handle a wide range of forms, including content-rich forms that contain multiple attributes, as well as simple keyword-based search interfaces. An experimental evaluation over real Web data shows that our strategy generates high-quality clusters - measured both in terms of entropy and F-measure.

Such a sensor-based information service is useful only if it can be seamlessly accessed across traditional networks and through familiar device interfaces. In order to enable such ubiquitous access to sensor-based services, we need a remote messaging protocol that supports versatile messaging options, interoperates over different types of network, and allows messages to be routed based on flexible attribute-based addressing of endpoints. Furthermore, in order to ensure ease of adoption and deployment within an enterprise as well as in consumer environments, we must leverage communication abstractions that are well-known and already supported on traditional networks. In this paper, we propose TinySIP as a communication abstraction for accessing sensor-based services. TinySIP is based on the session initiation protocol (SIP), which is a standard application-level signaling mechanism. Users on traditional networks remotely interact with a sensor network service by sending SIP messages. A gateway maps the SIP abstractions to the corresponding TinySIP abstractions and propagates the messages to the sensor nodes. We are currently planning on deploying the SIP-based solution that we propose on a research testbed to enable users on a wireless mesh to access the in-network storage and event correlation services offered by a sensor network consisting of 20 MicaZ sensor nodes","","CD-ROM:0-7803-9792-4; POD:0-7803-9791-6","10.1109/MOBIQW.2006.361779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4205304","","Access protocols;Base stations;Collaborative work;IP networks;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Testing;Web and internet services;Wireless sensor networks","internetworking;signalling protocols;telecommunication services;wireless sensor networks","TinySIP;application-level signaling mechanism;attribute-based addressing;collaborative network;communication abstraction;data-related services;device interfaces;event-related information services;gateway maps;passive data-gathering;remote messaging protocol;seamless access;sensor nodes;sensor-based services;session initiation protocol","","0","","27","","","17-21 July 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A three dimensional color descriptor is generated by extracting the average intensity value of the Y, Cb and Cr components for each 8times8 DCT block. Each blocks descriptor is subsequently allocated to its corresponding cluster, whose centroid is updated using a weighted mean. The similarity measure is evaluated using a compact four dimensional feature vector from each cluster, which consists of the quantized centroid coordinates and the percentage contribution to the image composition by the cluster. Retrieval is performed by comparing the feature attributes of the clusters having significant membership in the query image, to those with the database images; the obtained matches are then integrated to evaluate the final ranking.

Research institutes of physics are interested in sharing their computational resources. Currently, Grid resources are not shared between the institutes over a billing system. It is based on an oral agreement. A high communication overhead at a political level is required to start and maintain cooperation. In this paper we propose a mechanism called Token exchange system (TES). Our aim is to facilitate exchange of resources among the different research institutes without any face-to-face agreement. Furthermore, the mechanism has to set the right incentives so that members will share their resources fairly and free-riders are avoided. This approach is the combination of reputation mechanism and the payment mechanism in one coherent system. Since the e-Science community abhors real money as an exchange mechanism, this approach provides a solution to set incentives like payment mechanisms and to implement the advantages of reputation mechanisms.","","POD:0-7695-2833-3","10.1109/CCGRID.2007.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215433","","Computational modeling;Data analysis;Environmental economics;Grid computing;Information management;Information retrieval;Management information systems;Physics computing;Resource management","grid computing;token networks","Grid resources;e-Science grid;incentive mechanism;payment mechanism;reputation mechanism;token exchange system","","0","","18","","","14-17 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This includes videos, images, and audios, where we now have higher expectations in exploiting these data at hands. Typical manipulations are in some forms of video/image/audio processing, including automatic speech recognition, which require fairly large amount of storage and are computationally intensive. In our recent work, we have demonstrated the utility of time series representation in the task of clustering multimedia data using k-medoids method, which allows considerable amount of reduction in computational effort and storage space. However, k- means is a much more generic clustering method when Euclidean distance is used. In this work, we will demonstrate that unfortunately, k-means clustering will sometimes fail to give correct results, an unaware fact that may be overlooked by many researchers. This is especially the case when Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used as the distance measure in averaging the shape of time series. We also will demonstrate that the current averaging algorithm may not produce the real average of the time series, thus generates incorrect k-means clustering results, and then show potential causes why DTW averaging methods may not achieve meaningful clustering results. Lastly, we conclude with a suggestion of a method to potentially find the shape-based time series average that satisfies the required properties.","","POD:0-7695-2777-9","10.1109/MUE.2007.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197360","","Automatic speech recognition;Clustering methods;Euclidean distance;Explosions;Image storage;Information retrieval;Memory;Shape measurement;Storage automation;Videos","data analysis;data structures;information retrieval;multimedia computing;pattern clustering;time series","Euclidean distance;audio processing;automatic speech recognition;data processing;data retrieval;data storage;dynamic time warping;image processing;k-means time warping;multimedia time series data clustering;video processing","","20","","26","","","26-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When data are high dimensional, however, the euclidean distances seem to concentrate; all distances between pairs of data elements seem to be very similar. Therefore, the relevance of the euclidean distance has been questioned in the past, and fractional norms (Minkowski-like norms with an exponent less than one) were introduced to fight the concentration phenomenon. This paper justifies the use of alternative distances to fight concentration by showing that the concentration is indeed an intrinsic property of the distances and not an artifact from a finite sample. Furthermore, an estimation of the concentration as a function of the exponent of the distance and of the distribution of the data is given. It leads to the conclusion that, contrary to what is generally admitted, fractional norms are not always less concentrated than the euclidean norm; a counterexample is given to prove this claim. Theoretical arguments are presented, which show that the concentration phenomenon can appear for real data that do not match the hypotheses of the theorems, in particular, the assumption of independent and identically distributed variables. Finally, some insights about how to choose an optimal metric are given.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216305","Nearest neighbor search;distance concentration;fractional distances.;high-dimensional data","Books;Content based retrieval;DNA;Data analysis;Databases;Digital cameras;Euclidean distance;Extraterrestrial measurements;Information retrieval;Nearest neighbor searches","","","","81","","52","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The false/miss detection problem caused by motion is also very serious. In this paper, we propose a novel wipe detection algorithm that can detect most wipe effects with accurate frame ranges. We carefully model a wipe based on its nature and then use the model to filter out possible confusion caused by motion or other transition effects. More precisely, properties of independence and completeness are proposed to characterize an ideal wipe; frame ranges of potential wipes are located by finding sequences which are a close approximation to an ideal wipe. Bayes rule is applied to each potential wipe to statistically estimate an adaptive threshold for the purpose of wipe verification.

In these applications, there is a compromise between the density of reference data stored and the capacity to identify later the robot localization, when it is not exactly in the same position as one of the reference views. Here we propose the use of a recently developed feature, SURF, to improve the performance of appearance-based localization methods that perform image retrieval in large data sets. This feature is integrated with a vision-based algorithm that allows both topological and metric localization using omnidirectional images in a hierarchical approach. It uses pyramidal kernels for the topological localization and three-view geometric constraints for the metric one. Experiments with several omnidirectional images sets are shown, including comparisons with other typically used features (radial lines and SIFT). The advantages of this approach are proved, showing the use of SURF as the best compromise between efficiency and accuracy in the results.","1050-4729;10504729","CD-ROM:1-4244-0602-1; POD:1-4244-0601-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2007.364077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4209695","","Humans;Image retrieval;Image sensors;Information retrieval;Kernel;Mobile robots;Navigation;Robot localization;Robotics and automation;Robustness","SLAM (robots);feature extraction;image matching;image retrieval;robot vision","SURF features;appearance-based localization;image retrieval;metric localization;omnidirectional images;radial lines;robot localization;topological localization;vision-based algorithm;visual reference maps","","65","","20","","","10-14 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To use of these services, it is required for users to find relevant services from a collection of services dispersed on the web. We currently use UDDI, a distributed registry system for Web services, to find services. However, UDDI only supports exact keyword match and category based query towards UDDI data entries representing each Web service, so it is hard to get a ranked query result and alternate services which are other possible services when a currently chosen service is no more useful or unreachable. Moreover, UDDI does not use WSDI definitions that actually describe service interfaces and message formats of Web services as a target of queries. In this paper, we introduce a framework for XMI Web services retrieval, which can solve the current problems that lie on the UDDI. Our system is located on top of UDDI using UDDI data entries and WSDL files; it provides ranked query result of Web services and finding alternate Web services by using a similarity measure. In addition, we discuss related works and further features needed to improve performance of this Web service retrieval framework.","","POD:0-7695-2777-9","10.1109/MUE.2007.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4197367","","Computer science;Documentation;Home computing;Information retrieval;Keyword search;Service oriented architecture;Telecommunication computing;Web services;Web sites;XML","Internet;Web services;XML;query processing","UDDI;World Wide Web;XML Web services retrieval;distributed registry system;query","","6","","14","","","26-28 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After studying the adversary's behavior patterns, we present countermeasures to this problem. We propose a location-privacy routing protocol (LPR) that is easy to implement and provides path diversity. Combining with fake packet injection, LPR is able to minimize the traffic direction information that an adversary can retrieve from eavesdropping. By making the directions of both incoming and outgoing traffic at a sensor node uniformly distributed, the new defense system makes it very hard for an adversary to perform analysis on locally gathered information and infer the direction to which the receiver locates. We evaluate our defense system based on three criteria: delivery time, privacy protection strength, and energy cost. The simulation results show that LPR with fake packet injection is capable of providing strong protection for the receiver's location privacy. Under similar energy cost, the safe time of the receiver provided by LPR is much longer than other methods, including Phantom routing (Kamat et al., 2005) and DEFP (Deng et al., 2005). The performance of our system can be tuned through a couple of parameters that determine the tradeoff between energy cost and the strength of location-privacy protection.","0743-166X;0743166X","POD:1-4244-1047-9","10.1109/INFCOM.2007.227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215809","","Costs;Diversity reception;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Privacy;Protection;Routing protocols;Sensor systems;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless sensor networks","data privacy;routing protocols;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","DEFP;Phantom routing;defense system;fake packet injection;location-privacy routing protocol;packet movement eavesdropping;path diversity;receiver-location privacy protection;sensor node;traffic direction information;wireless sensor networks","","55","1","20","","","6-12 May 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Content-based retrieval of biomedical media from large databases is becoming increasingly important to clinical, research, and educational communities. In this paper, we present the recently developed entropy balanced statistical (EBS) k-d tree and its applications to biomedical media, including a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) lung image database and the first real-time protein tertiary structure search engine. Our index utilizes statistical properties inherent in large-scale biomedical media databases for efficient and accurate searches. By applying concepts from pattern recognition and information theory, the EBS k-d tree is built through top-down decision tree induction. Experimentation shows similarity searches against a protein structure database of 53 363 structures consistently execute in less than 8.14 ms for the top 100 most similar structures. Additionally, we have shown improved retrieval precision over adaptive and statistical k-d trees. Retrieval precision of the EBS k-d tree is 81.6% for content-based retrieval of HRCT lung images and 94.9% at 10% recall for protein structure similarity search.

Its original task was to find those time series similar to a pattern (query) time series data, where both the pattern and data time series are static. Recently, with an increasing demand on stream data management, similarity-based stream time series retrieval has raised new research issues due to its unique requirements during the stream processing, such as one-pass search and fast response. In this paper, we address the problem of matching patterns over high-speed stream time series data. We will develop a novel representation, called multi-scaled segment mean (MSM), for stream time series data, which can be incrementally computed and thus perfectly adapted to the stream characteristics. Most importantly, we propose a novel multi-step filtering mechanism over the multi-scaled representation. Analysis indicates that the mechanism can greatly prune the search space and thus offer fast response. Extensive experiments show the multi-scaled representation together with the multi-step filtering scheme can efficiently filter out false candidates and detect patterns, compared to the multiscaled wavelet.","1063-6382;10636382","CD-ROM:1-4244-0803-2; POD:1-4244-0802-4","10.1109/ICDE.2007.368967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4221757","","Data analysis;Demand forecasting;Filtering;Information retrieval;Monitoring;Pattern matching;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Streaming media;Technology forecasting;Weather forecasting","information filtering;media streaming;pattern matching;query processing;time series","high speed time-series streams;multiscaled segment mean;multistep filtering;pattern matching;pattern time series data;query time series data;similarity match;similarity-based time series retrieval;stream data management;stream processing","","13","","34","","","15-20 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Exact solutions can be time consuming and difficult to implement, given the distributed and dynamic nature of P2P databases. In this paper, we present novel sampling-based techniques for approximate answering of ad hoc aggregation queries in such databases. Computing a high-quality random sample of the database efficiently in the P2P environment is complicated due to several factors: the data is distributed (usually in uneven quantities) across many peers, within each peer, the data is often highly correlated, and, moreover, even collecting a random sample of the peers is difficult to accomplish. To counter these problems, we have developed an adaptive two-phase sampling approach based on random walks of the P2P graph, as well as block-level sampling techniques. We present extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed solution.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2007.1064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4216308","Approximation methods;computer networks;database systems;distributed database query processing;distributed databases;distributed estimation;distributed systems.","Computer networks;Data analysis;Distributed databases;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Music information retrieval;Peer to peer computing;Query processing;Sampling methods;Temperature sensors","Internet;distributed databases;peer-to-peer computing;query processing;random processes;sampling methods","Internet;P2P graph;ad hoc aggregation query;adaptive two-phase sampling;approximate answering;approximate query processing;block-level sampling;peer-to-peer database;peer-to-peer network;random sampling","","8","","39","","","July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

RDF is a language for representing metadata. An enormous number of keywords on the semantic Web are very important to make practical applications of the semantic Web because most users prefer to search with keywords. In this paper, we classify queries with keyword conditions into three patterns and propose indexing techniques for keyword-search considering both metadata and ontology. The proposed indexing techniques aim at efficient process of keyword-search for RDF/S documents. There are many studies about keyword-search techniques based on XML RDF is different from XML on the Web. So, there is a need for query processing which is appropriate to RDF.
