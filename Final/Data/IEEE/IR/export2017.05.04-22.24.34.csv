Our work in this field develops the design and implementation of a Multi-Agent Systems Based on Dynamic Case Based Reasoning which can initiate learning and provide an individualized follow-up of learner. When interacting with the platform, every learner leaves his/her traces in the machine. These traces are stored in a basis under the form of scenarios which enrich collective past experience. The system monitors, compares and analyses these traces to keep a constant intelligent watch and therefore detect difficulties hindering progress and/or avoid possible dropping out. The system can support any learning subject. The success of a case-based reasoning system depends critically on the performance of the retrieval step used and, more specifically, on similarity measure used to retrieve scenarios that are similar to the course of the learner (traces in progress). We propose a complementary similarity measure, named Inverse Longest Common Sub-Sequence (ILCSS).

Naturally, everyone is not at par with each other when it comes to knowledge about the concepts of a domain. A doctor may be well versed in her field of specialization and probably would search for advanced medical documents on the Internet. But she may look for a much simpler material related to Computer Programming. However, current information retrieval (IR) systems just return a mixed set of results based on similarity and popularity of the web pages. Existing methods which have tried to address the issue of matching readers with texts in domain-specific IR either use an ontology or some seed concepts thereby limiting their application in certain domains only. Moreover, readability methods cannot address the issue in domain-specific IR ranking because they fail to give precise prediction when applied on web pages. We address this problem in domain-specific search using a conceptual model where the sequence of the terms in a document is modeled as a connected conceptual terrain. Our model has achieved significant improvement in ranking documents by technical readability.","","Electronic:978-0-4695-4794-0; POD:978-1-4673-2561-5","10.1109/SKG.2012.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391809","Cohesion;Domain-specific;LSI;Ranking;Readability","Biopsy;Computational modeling;Internet;Large scale integration;Semantics;Vectors;Web pages","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Internet;LSI;Web pages;advanced medical documents;computer programming;conceptual terrain;connected conceptual terrain;domain-specific IR ranking;domain-specific related information;information retrieval systems;ontology;seed concepts;unsupervised technical readability ranking model","","1","","55","","","22-24 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional extraction methods use string matching among pages to detect page template, which is time-consuming. A recent work published in VLDB exploits redundant entities among websites to detect web page coordinates of these entities. The experiment gives good results when these coordinates are used for extracting other entities of the target site. However, OSF websites have few redundant project entities. This paper proposes a modified version of that redundancy-based method tailored for OSF websites, which relies on a similar yet weaker presumption that entity attributes are redundant rather than whole entities. Like the previous work, we also construct a seed database to detect web page coordinates of the redundancies, but all at the attribute-level. In addition, we apply attribute name verification to reduce false positives during extraction. The experiment result indicates that our approach is competent in extracting OSF websites, in which scenario the previous method can not be applied.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4810-4; POD:978-1-4673-2624-7","10.1109/CyberC.2012.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6384938","attribute;open source software;redundancy;verification;web extraction","Data mining;Databases;HTML;Licenses;Measurement;Redundancy","Web sites;information retrieval;public domain software;string matching","OSF Website extraction;VLDB;Web data;Webpage coordinate detection;attribute name verification;attribute redundancy based method;attribute-level;entity attributes;false positive reduction;open source forge Websites;open source research;open source software projects;page template detection;seed database construction;string matching","","1","","9","","","10-12 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To counter these problems, we present an approach to support effective feature location in product variants. The novelty of our approach is that we exploit commonalities and differences of product variants by software differencing and FCA techniques so that IR technique can achieve satisfactory results for feature location in product variants.

Indeed, modern cars are endowed with several sensors forming an in-vehicle network, which provides kinematics information, automotive diagnostic services, etc. Cars can be further equipped with external sensing devices to monitor specific physical parameters, such as pollution, humidity, temperature, etc. If properly collected and delivered, such data can contribute to make the road transport greener, smarter, and safer. With the purpose of supporting and improving data collection and distribution, in this paper a smartphone-based platform is designed that exploits low-cost dedicated hardware to interact with sensors on board and in the vehicle surroundings.

Security, therefore, was very crucial in the management of these libraries, security could not however be addressed in a consistent way without integrating some form of access control. Therefore, we proposed a context-sensitive access control model called Role Based Access Control Manager (RBACM).

The enforcement of copyright rules in the general security framework of the digital library was part of the over all design of the system. Then we used the .NET Framework to develop Role Based Access Control Manager, it provided an access control scheme that can address the unified security needs of a digital library system.

For automatic extraction of interaction information, the machine learning approach is useful. Generally, linguistic features obtained directly from the literature are used for learning, but a non-linguistic feature such as the atomic distance calculated from the protein structure data is often very effective for learning and classification. We call this type of feature a “key feature” in this study. In the machine learning approach, preparing enough training instances to train the classifier is important, but this often requires great cost. In such a situation, transfer learning is one of the better approaches. However, it is difficult to apply a simple transfer learning algorithm to a task in which the key feature cannot be prepared in the source domain. In this study, we propose a new transfer learning method called STEK (Selective Transfer learning based on Effectiveness of a Key feature). In this method, we focus on the effectiveness of the key feature, and divide a set of instances into two categories. One is a set of instances applying transfer learning and the other is a set of instances avoiding the use of transfer learning.

While these have shown success, there remain a number of little-exploited additional sources of information which could enhance the techniques, including the textual similarity between bug reports themselves. Based on successful results in detecting duplicate bug reports, this work asks: if duplicate bugs reports, which by definition are fixed in the same source location, can be detected through the use of similar language, can bugs which are in the same location but not duplicates be detected in the same way? A technique using this information is implemented and evaluated on 372 bugs across 4 projects, and is found to improve performance on all projects. In particular, the technique increases the number of bugs where the first relevant method presented to developers is the first result from 6 to 27, and those in the top-10 from 50 to 57, showing that it can be successfully used to enhance existing bug localisation techniques.","1095-1350;10951350","Electronic:978-0-7695-4891-3; POD:978-1-4673-4536-1","10.1109/WCRE.2012.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6385108","bug localisation;feature location;mining software repositories","Computer bugs;Documentation;Indexes;Java;Large scale integration;Maintenance engineering;Training","information retrieval;program debugging;software maintenance;source coding","bug localisation enhancement;bug report similarity;corpus;duplicate bug report detection;information retrieval;query processing;software maintenance;source code;textual similarity","","7","","25","","","15-18 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It becomes focused on how to implement the interception and control in Video communication system based on SIP in real time. This article puts emphases on the character of SIP and the video communication system themselves and puts forward a design of the model. It uses the feature of media information's interaction in signaling of SIP protocol during the media session establishment. At first, the model judges the communicating parties whether they are target users by analyzing the protocol. Then, it modifies the target users' signaling information. So the model can access the communication parties' media stream. And at the same time, the model uses the multi-modal media recognition technology. It uses the shunt to divide accessed media stream into audio and video stream. And it extracts audio, video and text information by analyzing them. Finally, the model uses these three modes to analysis the contained media content. Simulation results show that the model can not only implement the interception and control of the protocol but also recognize the content of media session effectively in real time.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4719-0; POD:978-1-4673-0721-5","10.1109/CSSS.2012.230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394468","SIP;interception and control;multi-modality;video communication system;video recognize","Media;Monitoring;Protocols;Real-time systems;Speech;Streaming media","audio streaming;information retrieval;next generation networks;signalling protocols;text analysis;video communication;video streaming","NGN development;SIP protocol;audio information extraction;audio stream;control model design;interception model design;media content;media information;media session establishment;media stream;multimodal media recognition technology;signaling information;text information extraction;video communication services;video communication system;video information extraction;video stream","","1","","13","","","11-13 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Mechatronic objects provide a logical view on integrated data from mechanical, electrical, and software engineering but there is limited support of heterogeneous and dynamic engineering tool models. Based on so-called engineering objects this paper introduces the capability of single-click navigation between heterogeneous engineering tools taking into account the different views on common engineering concepts.

Applying the sophisticated background modeling method is a common solution for such dynamic background problem. However, the sophisticated background modeling method is computation intensive and involves huge memory bandwidth on data access. Realizing such approach on a multicamera surveillance system for real-time application can dramatically increase the hardware cost. This paper presents a hardware-oriented foreground detection that is based on human-machine interaction in object level (HMIiOL) scheme. The HMIiOL can vary the conditions for a moving object been regarded as a foreground object. The conditions are depending on background environment and are derived from the information from human-machine interaction. By the HMIiOL scheme, adopting a simple background modeling method can achieve well foreground detection with significant background motions. A processor based on system-on-chip design is presented for the HMIiOL-based foreground detection. The presented processor consists of accelerators to increase throughput of the computationally intensive tasks in the algorithm, and a reduced instruction set computing unit to handle the interaction task and the noncomputation-intensive tasks. Pipelining and parallelism techniques are used to increase the throughput. The detecting capability of the processor reaches HD720 at 30 Hz. The maximum throughput can be up to 32.707 Mpixels/s. Performance evaluation and comparison with existed foreground detection hardware show the improvement of our design.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2012.2202193","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6210374","Dynamic scene;foreground object detection;human–machine interaction;system-on-chip (SoC);very large-scale integration (VLSI)","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Dynamics;Hardware;Histograms;Real time systems;Surveillance","cameras;human computer interaction;image motion analysis;information retrieval;object detection;parallel processing;pipeline processing;surveillance;system-on-chip","HMIiOL-based foreground detection;background environment;background modeling method;background motions tolerance;data access;dynamic background problem;dynamic scene;foreground motion detection;foreground object detection;hardware-oriented foreground detection;huge memory bandwidth;human-machine interaction in object level;intelligent visual surveillance;interaction task;multicamera surveillance system;noncomputation-intensive tasks;parallelism techniques;performance evaluation;pipelining techniques;processor detection capability;real-time application;reduced instruction set computing unit;system-on-chip design-based processor","","8","","39","","20120601","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Past research focused on supporting analysts with techniques based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify candidate links. Because many NLP techniques exist and their performance varies according to context, it is crucial to define and use reliable evaluation procedures. The aim of this paper is to propose a set of seven principles for evaluating the performance of NLP techniques in identifying equivalent requirements. In this paper, we conjecture, and verify, that NLP techniques perform on a given dataset according to both ability and the odds of identifying equivalent requirements correctly. For instance, when the odds of identifying equivalent requirements are very high, then it is reasonable to expect that NLP techniques will result in good performance. Our key idea is to measure this random factor of the specific dataset(s) in use and then adjust the observed performance accordingly. To support the application of the principles we report their practical application to a case study that evaluates the performance of a large number of NLP techniques for identifying equivalent requirements in the context of an Italian company in the defense and aerospace domain. The current application context is the evaluation of NLP techniques to identify equivalent requirements. However, most of the proposed principles seem applicable to evaluating any estimation technique aimed at supporting a binary decision (e.g., equivalent/nonequivalent), with the estimate in the range [0,1] (e.g., the similarity provided by the NLP), when the dataset(s) is used as a benchmark (i.e., testbed), independently of the type of estimator (i.e., requirements text) and of the estimation method (e.g., NLP).","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2011.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112783","Empirical software engineering;equivalent requirements;metrics and measurement;natural language processing;traceability recovery","Context;Matrix decomposition;Measurement;Monitoring;Natural language processing;Semantics;Thesauri","information retrieval;natural language processing;program diagnostics;software engineering","Italian company;NLP techniques;aerospace domain;binary decision;clone detection;defense domain;equivalent requirement retrieval;estimation technique;industrial case study;natural language processing techniques;reliable evaluation procedures;software engineering;traceability recovery","","21","","116","","20111227","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This approach leads to better constructing a set of informative feature vectors that represents both structural and textual aspects of XML documents.

To extract structural information, we employ an existing frequent tree-mining algorithm combined with an information gain filter to retrieve the most informative substructures from XML documents. However, for extracting content information, we propose soft clustering of words using each cluster as a textual feature. We have conducted extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset, namely 20NewsGroups, and an XML documents dataset given in LOGML that describes the web-server logs of user sessions. With regards to the classifier built only using our textual features, the results show that it outperforms a naive support-vector-machine (SVM)-based classifier, as well as an information retrieval classifier (IRC). We further demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating both structural and content information into the process of learning, by comparing our classifier model and several XML document classifiers. In particular, by applying SVM and decision tree algorithms using our feature vector representation of XML documents dataset, we have achieved 85.79% and 87.04% classification accuracy, respectively, which are higher than accuracy achieved by XRules, a well-known structural-based XML document classifier.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2208102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392444","Document classification;XML documents;feature reduction;soft clustering;structural information","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Indexes;Vectors;XML","XML;data mining;feature extraction;information retrieval;support vector machines","IRC;SVM;XML document classification;feature reduction;information gain filter;information retrieval classifier;informative feature vectors;informative substructures;learning process;semistructured document classification;soft clustering;structural feature extraction;support vector machine;textual feature extraction;tree mining algorithm;web server;words reduction","","3","","54","","","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Further in the next module would be uploading the backed up data with cloud interconnectivity.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-2078-9; POD:978-1-4577-2077-2","10.1109/ICCICT.2012.6398203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6398203","Amanda;SQLite;back-up;cloud interactivity;conventional database","Computers;Databases;Encryption;Libraries;Servers;Software;Standards","SQL;information retrieval systems;records management","Amanda backup;SQLite;advanced maryland automated network disk archiver;conventional database;conventional interface;nontechnical user","","0","","9","","","19-20 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The motivation is twofold. First, researchers on Spatial Data Mining often assume that spatial data are already available, thanks to current GIS and positioning technologies. Nevertheless, this is not applicable to the case of spatial information embedded in data without an explicit spatial modeling, such as documents. Second, despite the huge amount of Web documents conveying useful geographic information, there is not much work on how to harvest spatial data from these documents. The problem is particularly challenging because of the lack of annotated documents, which prevents the application of supervised learning techniques. In this paper, we propose to harvest facts on geographic places through an unsupervised approach which recognizes spatial relations among geographic places without supposing the availability of annotated documents. The proposed approach is based on the combined use of a spatial ontology and a prototype-based classifier. A case study on topological and directional relations is reported and commented.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4673-5164-5; POD:978-1-4799-1707-5","10.1109/ICDMW.2012.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406520","Geo-spatial Intelligence;Geographic Documents;Relation Extraction;Spatial Relations","Data mining;Geographic information systems;Natural languages;Ontologies;Prototypes;Spatial databases;Web pages","Internet;data mining;document handling;geographic information systems;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;unsupervised learning","GIS technologies;Web document annotation;directional relations;geographic information harvesting;geographic places;positioning technologies;prototype-based classifier;spatial data mining;spatial ontology;spatial relation recognition;spatial relational facts extraction;supervised learning techniques;topological relations;unsupervised approach","","2","","23","","","10-10 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Locational information is of great significance since it can be used to map information from the online back to the physical world, to contextualize information, or to provide localized recommendations through Location-Based Services (LBS), and can be extended to trajectories and itineraries by adding a time-dimension. Despite all that, location extraction in social networks usually relies on GPS-enabled devices, that provide accurate geodetic coordinates. Nevertheless, most users provide general textual information about their surroundings, such as the city they live in, county or state (or equivalents), without using a GPS-enabled device, which is still valuable information for a number of applications. In this paper, we tackle the problem of extracting location information, usually referred to as geocoding, from additional user-provided content. Instead of using sophisticated and complex algorithms, which are common in online map services but require heavy development and tuning, we rely on software and data which are available online and public ally accessible. We discuss the particularities of geocoding in online social networks and present a simple, lightweight, yet efficient approach for location extraction in such a setting.

We describe our efforts with the National Archives (NARA) to provide searchable access to the 1940 Census data and discuss the HPC resources needed to implement the suggested framework. Instead of trying to recognize the handwritten text, a still very difficult task, we use a content based image retrieval technique known as Word Spotting. Through this paradigm, the system is queried by the use of handwritten text images instead of ASCII text and ranked groups of similar looking images are presented to the user. A significant amount of computing power is needed to accomplish the pre-processing of the data so to make this search capability available on an archive. The required preprocessing steps and the open source framework developed are discussed focusing specifically on HPC considerations that are relevant when preparing to provide searchable access to sizeable collections, such as the US Census. Having processed the state of North Carolina from the 1930 Census using 98,000 SUs we estimate the processing of the entire country for 1940 could require up to 2.5 million SUs.

Events are inherently temporal, evolving over time. Existing visual text analysis systems have provided temporal views of changes based on topical themes extracted from text data.

In this paper, we propose an interactive visual analytics system, LeadLine, to automatically identify meaningful events in news and social media data and support exploration of the events. To characterize events, LeadLine integrates topic modeling, event detection, and named entity recognition techniques to automatically extract information regarding the investigative 4 Ws: who, what, when, and where for each event. To further support analysis of the text corpora through events, LeadLine allows users to interactively examine meaningful events using the 4 Ws to develop an understanding of how and why. Through representing large-scale text corpora in the form of meaningful events, LeadLine provides a concise summary of the corpora. LeadLine also supports the construction of simple narratives through the exploration of events. To demonstrate the efficacy of LeadLine in identifying events and supporting exploration, two case studies were conducted using news and social media data.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4753-2; POD:978-1-4673-4752-5","10.1109/VAST.2012.6400485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400485","","Crawlers;Data mining;Event detection;Lead;Time series analysis;Twitter;Visualization","information retrieval;social networking (online);text analysis","LeadLine;automatically identify meaningful events;entity recognition techniques;event exploration;event identification;information extraction;interactive visual analysis;interactive visual analytics system;large-scale text corpora;microblogs;news data;online news;social media data;support exploration;text data;visual text analysis systems","","44","","43","","","14-19 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We heavily rely on search engines but most existing search tools are key-word based and they often return search results with low precision and recall. The emerging semantic tagging technology provides an automatic way to generate semantic tags from text. It has drawn more and more interest from text mining research communities. It is critical to study how to utilize semantic tags to improve text mining including clustering, which helps users to enhance their experience of searching and browsing documents. Unfortunately, most previous works on text clustering merely based on content information. A few recent researches take user-generated tags into account, however user generated tags are often noisy, inconsistent, redundant and lack of semantic information and hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose a Semantic Text Mining (STeM) framework to generate semantic tags for given documents and then utilize the semantic tags to improve text clustering. Different from the previous works, we represent a document by a combination of domains and high quality noun phrases. We investigate the performance of our methods in two different datasets and the results are evaluated by normalized mutual information. Experiment results demonstrated that our proposed method substantially outperformed the traditional Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) term vector based clustering. We find that incorporating semantic information into document representation is critical to improve the performance of text clustering.","","Electronic:978-0-4695-4794-0; POD:978-1-4673-2561-5","10.1109/SKG.2012.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391817","SteM;clustering;document;semantic tags","Clustering algorithms;Frequency domain analysis;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Semantics;Tagging;Vectors","data mining;information retrieval;pattern clustering;semantic Web;text analysis","Internet content;STeM;TF-IDF term vector based clustering;autogenerated semantic tag;content information;digital documents;document browsing;document representation;document searching;hierarchical structure;high quality noun phrase;information location;keyword based search tool;normalized mutual information;search engine;semantic information;semantic tagging technology;semantic text mining;term frequency-inverse document frequency term vector;text clustering enhancement;user-generated tags","","1","","17","","","22-24 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multi Agent Systems (MASs) are being used more and more as the basis of open systems. Although openness brings a huge opportunity for different systems to operate in a decoupled and autonomous manner, it can introduce untrustworthy agents into the society. For this purpose, Agent Trust Management (ATM) methods have been proposed to try to eliminate this defect. This paper presents a general framework for managing trust in MASs based on the theory of Human Plausible Reasoning (HPR). The goal of the proposed framework is to determine for each user a ranked list of trusted agents and to find newer possible trust relationships between users and agents. We use the HPR certainty parameters to define how trustworthy each agent is in the list. We measure the agent trust according to two metrics: the direct interaction rating and third-party references. For each user, a third party is any other user with whom a HPR relationship exists. We aggregate the direct interaction rating value and the reputation values of third parties to achieve a single quantitative value for the trust. This value is then used to rank the agents. We apply our HPR-based ATM framework to the domain of Web search. The resulting ATM system provides the user a list of trusted search engines ranked according to the reputation the search engine has gained by interacting with other related users as well as the retrieval precision of pages returned in response to the user's query.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4848-7; POD:978-1-4673-5638-1","10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406397","Agent Trust Management;Human Plausible Reasoning;Multi Agent Systems;Reputation;Web Search","Conferences;Privacy;Security;Social network services","Internet;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;multi-agent systems;search engines;security of data","ATM method;HPR certainty parameter;Web search;agent trust management;direct interaction rating;human plausible reasoning;multiagent system;open system;page retrieval precision;reputation value;search engine;third-party reference;trust relationship;untrustworthy agents;user query","","1","","25","","","3-5 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this instrumental e-Learning context, we propose a Score Analyzer service in order to automatically extract difficult parts within a MusicXML piece and suggest advice thanks to a Musical Sign Base (MSB). To do so, we first study how teachers introduce a piece to their students and propose a corresponding descriptive logic.

In this paper, we investigate which of the well-known stemmers perform best in the domain of Java software for concern location and bug localization. For these two problems, we evaluate the use of stemming on over 500 search tasks for six different Java applications. Using MAP and Rank Measure, we conducted an overall qualitative study and a query-by-query quantitative study of the impact of stemming on retrieval effectiveness. As one might expect, our contribution demonstrates that how stemming affects retrieval performance is mediated by other factors, such as the use of tf-idf to filter commonly occurring terms and the precise nature of the queries. Specifically, we find that the extent to which stemming improves the retrieval performance relates to the degree of natural language content in a query.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4783-1; POD:978-1-4673-2398-7","10.1109/SCAM.2012.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392117","bug localization;concern location;stemming;textual analysis of source code identifiers","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Computer bugs;Educational institutions;Java;Natural languages;Software","Java;information retrieval;program debugging;text analysis","Bug localization;Java software;information retrieval community;natural language content;query-by-query quantitative study;strip suffixes;text-based source code search","","6","","36","","","23-24 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fundamental to just-intime descriptive analytics is (a) identifying visual features, such as clusters, outliers, and trends, user might observe in visualizations automatically, (b) determining the semantics of such features by performing statistical analysis as the user is interacting, and (c) enriching visualizations with annotations that not only describe semantics of visual features but also facilitate interaction to support high-level understanding of data. In this paper, we demonstrate just-in-time descriptive analytics applied to a point-based multi-dimensional visualization technique to identify and describe clusters, outliers, and trends. We argue that it provides a novel user experience of computational techniques working alongside of users allowing them to build faster qualitative mental models of data by demonstrating its application on a few use-cases.

More specifically, we apply a data mining technique for discovering the hidden contexts in data access patterns and make prediction based on the inferred context to boost the accuracy. In particular, we performed Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA), a mixture model based algorithm popular in the text mining area, to mine hidden contexts from the collected user access patterns and, then, we run a predictor within the discovered context. We further improve PLSA by applying the Deterministic Annealing (DA) method to overcome the local optimum problem.

Collaborative tagging provides a convenient way to annotate shared content by allowing users to use any tags. User tags have proven to be a useful technique to smooth browsing experience in large document collections. Some web service search engines, such as Seekda, already propose this kind of facility. One of main advantages of tags is that they are very easy to create, where users do not need any constraint or experience. Nevertheless, users have different intentions when tagging. Tags not only describe the functions of Web services, but also express additional semantical information, such as topic domain, location and qualities. These tags between co-occurring represent quite a few different aspects of the Web services. In this paper, we first investigate the different collaborative intention between co-occurring tags in Seekda as well as their dynamical aspects. Inspired by the relationships between co-occurring tags, we designed the social tag network. In order to reveal the collaborative intention, we then analyze the dynamics structure and social properties of social tag network using graph theory. Finally, network analysis results show that the social tag network has small world effect and power law distribution to some extent, and also has obvious densely connected semantic communities surrounding few hub tags. Meanwhile, we provide some beneficial suggestions for tag clustering, service discovery and recommendation based on the network analysis results.","2325-6583;23256583","Electronic:978-0-7695-4786-2; POD:978-1-4673-5005-1","10.1109/EDOCW.2012.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406225","power law;semantic community;small word;tag;web service","Collaboration;Communities;Search engines;Semantic Web;Semantics;Tagging;Web services","Web services;document handling;graph theory;groupware;information retrieval;pattern clustering;search engines","Seekda;User tags;Web service search engines;browsing experience;co-occurring tags;collaborative intention;collaborative tagging;dynamics structure;graph theory;large document collections;location information;network analysis;power law distribution;quality information;semantic structure;semantical information;service discovery;social properties;social tag network;tag clustering;topic domain information","","0","","27","","","10-14 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address the problem, this paper proposes a cooperative downloading strategy with multi-class request. The strategy distinguishes users' downloading priorities according to user-defined downloading class. Under satisfying the fairness of system operation condition, the strategy provides different services according to users' expectation. Furthermore, the strategy helps service providers obtain the most benefit by making use of the repetition ratio of data and user-defined class. Simulation results indicate the benefits of the proposed scheme in terms of increasing service quality for users and benefit for services providers.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4858-6; POD:978-1-4673-4873-7","10.1109/CIT.2012.172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392008","Cooperative downloading strategy;Dynamic slot;VANET","Delay;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Internet;Mobile communication;Road transportation;USA Councils;Vehicles","Internet;information retrieval;mobile computing;random processes;roads;vehicular ad hoc networks","FIFO method;Internet access;VANET;WiFi;cooperative downloading strategy;data repetition ratio;highway scenario;mobile users;multiclass request;random selection scheme;roadside access point distribution;user service demand;user-defined downloading class","","1","","16","","","27-29 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The use of CBR promises a continuous increase in answer quality, given user feedback that extends the case base. In the paper, we present the complete approach, emphasizing the use of CBR techniques, namely the structural case base, built with annotated MultiNet graphs, and corresponding graph similarity measures. We cover a priori relations to experienced answer candidates for former questions. We describe the adequate structuring of the case base and develop appropriate similarity measures. Finally we integrate CBR into an existing framework for answer validation and reranking that also includes logical answer validation and a shallow linguistic validation, using a learning-to-rank approach for the final answer ranking based on CBR-related features. In our experiments on QA@CLEF questions, the best learned models make heavy use of CBR features. The advantage already achieved by CBR will increase with time due to the automatic improvement with new user annotations given by relevance feedback.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406672","answer validation;case-based reasoning;learning to rank;machine learning;question answering systems","Cognition;Decision trees;Machine learning;Pragmatics;Semantics;Training;Vocabulary","case-based reasoning;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);question answering (information retrieval);relevance feedback","CBR-related features;QA@CLEF questions;a priori relations;annotated multinet graphs;answer reranking;case-based reasoning;final answer ranking;graph similarity measures;learning-to-rank approach;logical answer validation;machine learning;question answering system reranking;relevance feedback;shallow linguistic validation;structural case base;user annotations;user feedback;validation-answer scoring","","1","","14","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Kable consists of two major components, which are auto wrapper induction and schema matching respectively. In contrast to the state of the art auto wrappers for semi-structured Web sites, our adopted approach can run around 1'000 times faster, which makes the Web scale knowledge extraction possible. On the other hand, we propose a novel schema matching solution which can work effectively on the auto-extracted structured data.

However, the interoperability between multiple access technologies should be able to realize the vision of 4G technology and beyond to allow mobile user equipment (UE) to roam freely when intersecting the cell-boundaries of different network platforms without losing the service. To achieve such task, a proposed mobility management system designed to detect conditions of the network early enough and effect changes to handover parameters while maintaining the network connectivity is being highlighted. The proposed system investigates how the signal strength threshold (RSS<sub>Th</sub>) influences handover decision for a prioritized network with regards to distance and velocity. Computer simulation based on a designed algorithm for vertical handover optimization is being implemented to trigger the inter-radio access technology (RAT) handover for evaluating the performance of next generation wireless network systems.

We can therefore recognize changes in trends of people's ideas, experiences, and interests through observing the flows of such representative images. This paper presents a novel 3D visualization system to explore temporal changes in trends using images associating with different topics, called Image Bricks.

It is based on CBR, but aided by data mining to extract user patterns and knowledge adaptation from users' interaction history.","2327-185X;2327185X","Electronic:978-1-4673-2725-1; POD:978-1-4673-2726-8; USB:978-1-4673-2724-4","10.1109/CIST.2012.6388077","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388077","context-awareness;frequents patterns extraction;personalisation;pervasive computing;proactivity","Advertising;Context;Context modeling;Monitoring","case-based reasoning;data integration;data mining;information retrieval;ubiquitous computing;user interfaces","CBR;case based reasoning;context-aware adaptation technique;integrated data mining;knowledge adaptation;pervasive application;proactive service;smart environment;user interaction;user pattern extraction;user personalization","","1","","16","","","22-24 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to resolve this problem, this paper proposes a novel approach for small files process, which works as an engine independent with the HDFS. This engine can reduce the overhead of HDFS effectively. It uses Reactor multiplexed IO to build the server and uses non-blocking IO to merge and read small files. And the engine has a cache of small files that can make the reading efficiently. This paper presents the small files processing strategy for files efficient merger, which builds the file index and uses boundary file block filling mechanism to accomplish files separation and files retrieval.

One class of tools that are now widely used in a variety of eCommerce domains are mashups, which combine disparate sources of information (e.g., price, product reviews, and seller reviews) to support buyer decision making. Previous academic studies that examined decision support tools for eCommerce domains have focused on the impacts on information search, consideration set size, and decision quality. This paper discusses dynamic interaction, namely, the degree to which a user can revisit and revise their inputs and consider alternative solutions during a decision. The relationships between dynamic interaction, diagnosticity, confidence, and intention were investigated in an experiment. The results of the study indicated that increasing dynamic interaction increased the perceived diagnosticity (i.e., the extent to which the user believes that the tool is useful to evaluate a product) of the decision support tool and the overall confidence in the decision. In addition, a post hoc analysis of decision quality suggests that increased levels of dynamic interaction also improve the overall quality of the decision made.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2192106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301749","Calibration;Web 2.0 mashups;confidence;dynamic interaction;end-user programming;perceived diagnosticity","Context;Decision making;Decision support systems;Electronic commerce;Humans;Mashups;Reliability","Internet;consumer behaviour;decision making;decision support systems;electronic commerce;information resources;information retrieval;purchasing","buyer decision making support;consumer decision;decision quality;decision support tool;disparate information sources;dynamic interaction;eCommerce domain;eCommerce evolution;information search;mashup;perceived diagnosticity;post hoc analysis;price;product purchasing;product review;seller review;service purchasing;set size;unstructured domain confidence","","1","","82","","20120912","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

NEPTUNE Canada's 800-km subsea infrastructure and 130 diverse instruments established the world's first regional cabled ocean observatory, northeast Pacific Ocean, off Canada's coast. Introducing abundant power and high bandwidth communications into coastal to abyssal environments allows discrimination between short- and long-term events, interactive experiments, real-time data and imagery, and multidisciplinary teams interrogating a vast database over 25 years. The principal scientific themes addressed through the NEPTUNE Canada infrastructure are: plate tectonic processes and earthquake dynamics; dynamic processes of seabed fluid fluxes and gas hydrates; regional ocean/climate dynamics and effects on marine biota; deep-sea ecosystem dynamics; and engineering and computational research. Resulting data can be applied to important science issues such as ocean/climate change, ocean acidification, natural hazards, and nonrenewable and renewable natural resources. Socioeconomic benefits include many applications in sovereignty, security, transportation, data services, and public policy. The Data Management and Archive System has largely been developed internally. It controls the observatory network and gives transparent access using interoperability techniques within a Web 2.0 environment. The principal challenges encountered during design, installation, and operations involve technical innovations, enlarging the user base, management, securing funding, maximizing educational/outreach, and commercialization opportunities.

The semantic web has rapidly spread, appearing as a new challenge for knowledge sharing and automatic processing. However, the reality is that the power of the semantic web is still barely used. This is mostly because of the fact that the semantic web is a powerful but complex technology that most end users cannot afford to use for their common problem-solving activities. This has probably made the semantic web to stay in the background of interactive technologies, unlike other new end-user-oriented paradigms (e.g., the so-called Web 2.0 and later approaches) that have very much increased along these years. Nevertheless, the semantic web can be considered as a highly valuable paradigm that has not been, conveniently, exploited yet. In this paper, we propose a semantic environment to exploit semantic interaction by end users in order to help them access semantic information easily. We follow a programming by demonstration approach, where the user navigates and modifies HTML presentation of data and the system, automatically, infers changes to the underlying semantic models. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the interaction, including the most important results obtained for the proposed approach.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2012.2187052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6168852","Human–computer interaction (HCI);semantic web;user interfaces;user-centered design","HTML;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Semantics;User interfaces;Web pages","human computer interaction;hypermedia markup languages;information retrieval;interactive systems;knowledge management;ontologies (artificial intelligence);personal computing;resource allocation;semantic Web;user centred design","HTML data presentation;automatic processing;demonstration approach;end user-oriented paradigms;human-computer interaction;interaction design;interaction evaluation;interactive technologies;knowledge repositories;knowledge sharing;problem solving;resource description framework-based ontologies;semantic Web;semantic environment;semantic information access;semantic interaction;semantic models","","1","","36","","20120313","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We leverage the bootstrapping strategy to recognize uniqueness from the free-text Web corpus with assistance from semi-structured Web such as lists, tables and query logs. To avoid extracting the subjective entity uniqueness, which may bias user decision making, we propose the probabilistic likelihood of a uniqueness property using bipartite graph models over entities and properties.

Since a user has a specific goal when searching for information, personalized search may provide the results that accurately satisfy user's specific goal and intent for the search. Personalization of web search is to retrieve information according to user's interests which may be inferred from user's action, browsed documents or past query history etc. A real problem before web master of a website is to match the user needs and keep their attention focused to his website. In this paper, we propose a web recommendation approach which recommends user a list of pages based upon user's historic pattern and a list of web pages which have not been visited yet. This approach results in the improvement in the accuracy of the pages presented to the users.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4817-3; POD:978-1-4673-2647-6","10.1109/ICCS.2012.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391711","","Accuracy;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Engines;Navigation;Web pages","Web sites;data mining;information retrieval;recommender systems;search engines","Web search personalization;Web site;Web usage mining;automatic Web page recommendation;information retrieval;search engine","","1","","11","","","14-15 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a large amount of web logs for nearly each topic, where consumers present their needs for new products. These new product ideas are valuable to producers, researchers and developers because they can lead to a new product development process, a well-known task in marketing. However, the current approach towards extraction of these new product ideas involves employed analysts to process these blogs manually and extract the new product ideas. Here, presented is an automated approach towards the extraction of new product ideas through knowledge extraction and using scripting languages, which not only eliminates human error, but also speeds up the entire process of new product idea extraction. Thus, several product development solutions allow engineers, suppliers, business partners and even customers to collaborate throughout the entire product lifecycle via the Internet.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-2078-9; POD:978-1-4577-2077-2","10.1109/ICCICT.2012.6398128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6398128","Data Mining;Knowledge Discovery;Search Engines;Stemming;Web Logs","Arrays;Blogs;Companies;Computers;Google;Product development;Search engines","Internet;Web sites;data mining;information retrieval;knowledge acquisition;marketing data processing;product design;product development;product life cycle management;production engineering computing","Internet blogs;Web logs;Web mining approach;automatical idea identification;business partners;consumer blogs;knowledge extraction;marketing;new product idea extraction;product development process;product lifecycle;scripting languages","","0","","13","","","19-20 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we extract entities from the target news websites and forums using a rule-based and CRF combined method. Secondly, we use the Entity Rank algorithm to calculate the hotness of entities extracted from the news and forums data. Finally, we validate the rationality of our algorithm by comparing our hot entities and current affairs. We believe this work will shed new lights on the online public sentiment supervision.","2162-8998;21628998","Electronic:978-0-7695-4852-4; POD:978-1-4673-3093-0","10.1109/MINES.2012.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6405690","CRF;EntityRank;Named Entity Recognition (NER);PageRank","Couplings;Data mining;Educational institutions;Hidden Markov models;Internet;Organizations;Tagging","Internet;Markov processes;Web sites;information retrieval;knowledge based systems;natural language processing;random processes","CRF combined method;EntityRank algorithm;Internet;conditional random field;entity extraction;forums;key entity detection;named entity ranking;news Website;online public sentiment supervision;rule-based method;sentiment data collection","","0","","7","","","2-4 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Context Search Based on Inconsistent Ontology Reasoning","Z. Zhurong; W. Min","Coll. of Comput. & Inf. Sci., Southwest Univ., Chongqing, China","2012 Eighth International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge and Grids","20121224","2012","","","185","188","In our previous work [1], to improve search quality and user satisfaction by using the user's context of search we have developed a FOCS Model. In this Model, a context ontology is developed to record user's relevant context information and to help the semantic expansion of keywords. To make search results more relevant and personalized, similarity flooding algorithm is used to match context ontology with a faceted ontology, an ontology for annotating the target documents. However, similarity flooding algorithm cannot be used to calculate semantic data, so it is not a desirable method to solve the problem of context search well. Hence, we implemented a new Context Search in the model of IORCS. In this model, we integrate an inconsistent ontology reasoning method into our context search model to improve the accuracy of ontology matching step. First, we consider the ontologies we use in context search model as inconsistent ontologies. Second, to filter sub-ontology which the most similar to Search Ontology from related faceted ontologies, context reasoning function (CRF) is introduced to filter these inconsistent ontologies. Finally, context reasoning algorithm is used to implement ontology matching. The experimental results show the integration of inconsistent ontology reasoning into context search model can tackle the issue of Semantic Similarity Calculation better.","","Electronic:978-0-4695-4794-0; POD:978-1-4673-2561-5","10.1109/SKG.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391828","Context ontology;Context reasoning algorithm;Context reasoning function;Context search;Faceted ontology","Cognition;Context;Context modeling;Educational institutions;Floods;Ontologies;Semantics","inference mechanisms;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","CRA;CRF;IORCS model;context ontology development;context reasoning algorithm;context reasoning function;context search model;inconsistent ontology reasoning method;ontology matching;ontology matching step accuracy;personalized similarity flooding algorithm;related faceted ontologies;semantic data calculation;semantic expansion;semantic similarity calculation;user relevant context information","","0","","12","","","22-24 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
