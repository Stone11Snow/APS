"A Geometric Approach to Lower Bounds for Approximate Near-Neighbor Search and Partial Match","R. Panigrahy; K. Talwar; U. Wieder","","2008 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science","20081202","2008","","","414","423","This work investigates a geometric approach to proving cell probe lower bounds for data structure problems.We consider the {em approximate nearest neighbor search problem} on the Boolean hypercube $(bool^d,onenorm{cdot})$ with $d=Theta(log n)$. We show that any (randomized) data structure for the problem that answers $c$-approximate nearest neighbor search queries using $t$ probes must use space at least $n^{1+Omega(1/ct)}$. In particular, our bound implies that any data structure that uses space $tilde{O}(n)$ with polylogarithmic word size, and with constant probability gives a constant approximation to nearest neighbor search queries must be probed $Omega(log n/ loglog n)$ times. This improves on the lower bound of $Omega(loglog d/logloglog d)$ probes shown by Chakrabarti and Regev~cite{ChakrabartiR04} for any polynomial space data structure, and the $Omega(loglog d)$ lower bound in Patrascu and Thorup~cite{PatrascuT07} for linear space data structures.Our lower bound holds for the {em near neighbor problem}, where the algorithm knows in advance a good approximation to the distance to the nearest neighbor.Additionally, it is an {em average case} lower bound for the natural distribution for the problem. Our approach also gives the same bound for $(2-frac{1}{c})$-approximation to the farthest neighbor problem.For the case of non-adaptive algorithms we can improve the bound slightly and show a $Omega(log n)$ lower bound on the time complexity of data structures with $O(n)$ space and logarithmic word size.We also show similar lower bounds for the partial match problem: any randomized $t$-probe data structure that solves the partial match problem on ${0,1,star}^d$ for $d=Theta(log n)$ must use space $n^{1+Omega(1/t)}$. This implies an $Omega(log n/loglog n)$ lower bound for time complexity of near linear space data structures, slightly improving the $Omega(log n /(log log n)^2)$ lower bound from~cite{PatrascuT06a},cite{Jayra- mKKR03} for this range of $d$. Recently and independently Patrascu achieved similar bounds cite{patrascu08}. Our results also generalize to approximate partial match, improving on the bounds of cite{BarkolR02,PatrascuT06a}.","0272-5428;02725428","POD:978-0-7695-3436-7","10.1109/FOCS.2008.68","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4690975","Cell Probe Lower Bounds;Geometry;Near Neighbor Search;Partial Match","Approximation algorithms;Computational biology;Computer science;Data structures;Hypercubes;Information retrieval;Machine learning algorithms;Nearest neighbor searches;Polynomials;Probes","computational complexity;data structures;search problems","Boolean hypercube;cell probe lower bounds;data structure;geometric approach;nearest neighbor search problem;nonadaptive algorithm;partial match problem;time complexity","","3","","30","","","25-28 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, one of the challenges is how to manage the evolution of the ontology. If ontology evolution was not considered beforehand in the modeling phase of the system, then it may cause potential inconsistencies among the components of the ontology and the dependent applications. Besides the evolution of an ontology may interfere with the running of its dependent applications. Hence, in this paper the approaches of maintaining the consistency and keeping the continuousness of the dependent applications during the evolution are analyzed. Firstly, a virtual space based framework is put forward and most of the changes are to be made in the virtual space. Then two types of property changes are analyzed and solutions for processing them are given in detail. Besides, a register record approach is addressed for checking the dependency between the applications and the ontology schema.","","POD:978-0-7695-3395-7","10.1109/ICEBE.2008.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4690699","information system;ontology engineering;ontology evolution","Buildings;Collaboration;Information management;Information retrieval;Information systems;OWL;Ontologies;Prototypes;Registers;Systems engineering and theory","information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);virtual reality","adaptable information management systems;ontology evolution;register record approach;virtual space","","3","","5","","","22-24 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper proposes an approach for the automated update of existing traceability relations after changes have been made to UML analysis and design models. The update is based upon predefined rules that recognize elementary change events as constituent steps of broader development activities.

In addition, DIMSA deploys attribute allocation scheme to further reduce energy consumption in the condition that some attributes are included in many events. In this condition, traditional data-centric storage schemes consumes more energy because the values for these attributes have to be replicated and stored at different places in the network for each individual event. A distributed index scheme is also proposed to avoid query flooding and extra data transmission. Analysis and simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme.

The system initially retrieves images objectively closest to the query image. The user then subjectively labels retrieved images as relevant or irrelevant. Although such relevance feedback from the user is an effective way of bridging the semantic gap between objective and subjective similarity, it is also very time consuming, requiring huge human effort. Often, the number of labeled images is very small. In an inductive approach the labeled set of images is used for training a CBIR system while the large set of unlabeled images remains unused. In this paper we exploit the transductive support vector machine (SVM) algorithm as a way of taking advantage of unlabeled data in CBIR. Our findings are compared to the results of an inductive SVM. We draw some conclusions as to when the use of unlabeled data might be helpful. The considered systems are tested over images from the Corel 1K dataset.","","POD:978-1-4244-2903-5","10.1109/NEUREL.2008.4685550","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685550","Content based image retrieval;Relevance feedback;Support vector machines;Transductive learning","Content based retrieval;Feedback;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Spatial databases;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;image retrieval;relevance feedback;support vector machines","content-based image retrieval;labeled image;query image;relevance feedback;support vector machine;unlabeled data","","1","","18","","","25-27 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Expansion of the queries based on semantic relation and phrase patterns is an effective approach to improve the retrieval. In this paper, a novel approach to queries expansion is presented. In the first step, keywords and phrases in a query are extracted, and the query is classified using Bayesian classifier. The classification defines the domain of user interest which serves as the context around the query. The phrase is then matched against fixed patterns which are automatically extracted from the set of domain documents and serve as context within the query. This is followed by expansion of the remaining keywords that are not in the phrases. This expansion is based on synonyms and hyponyms in the domain ontology, and is controlled by measuring information gain. Finally, the similarity between the expanded query and the document of the domain is computed by combining the weighted phrases and keywords. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach improves the precision and recall of information retrieval.","2161-9646;21619646","POD:978-1-4244-2107-7","10.1109/WiCom.2008.2543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4680732","","Automatic control;Bayesian methods;Data mining;Information retrieval;Internet;Natural languages;Ontologies;Pattern matching;Search engines;Semantic Web","Bayes methods;feature extraction;pattern classification;query processing","Bayesian classifier;domain ontology;hyponyms;information retrieval;message searching;queries expansion;semantic context;synonyms","","0","1","10","","","12-14 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And intelligent analysis of these data in large scale is of great importance in the post-genome era. While the vector space model (VSM) based TF*IDF feature representation is widely adopted for text document analysis, it has significant limitations when applied to these data, primarily due to the high conciseness and high noisiness of the functional annotations. To improve TF*IDF feature representation, this paper proposes two automatic term expansion (ATE) methods based on query expansion (QE) in information retrieval (IR) theory. The effectiveness of ATE was examined through its application to the measurement of pattern proximity of gene functional annotations. Our comparative results show that ATE is effective in retrieving functionally correlated genes corresponding to a random query gene on this particular data type, and has the capability to produce more accurate measurement of the pattern similarity, with reference to genespsila biological functions.","","POD:978-1-4244-1778-0","10.1109/CIBCB.2008.4675775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4675775","","Automatic control;Biological control systems;Biological system modeling;Data analysis;Functional analysis;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Natural languages;Text analysis;Vocabulary","bioinformatics;genetics;information retrieval;natural languages;text analysis","automatic term expansion;biological function;controlled vocabulary;feature representation;information retrieval theory;intelligent analysis;natural language gene functional annotation;pattern proximity;pattern similarity;query expansion;random query gene;text document analysis;vector space model","","0","","24","","","15-17 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Beyond that, our methods give those values different weights on different spatial and scale sites. The spatial weights are obtained adaptively by counting the ratio and significance of edges detected in the blocks. The scale weights obey the Gaussian distribution with special parameters toward given image datasets. Thus, the prominent identity of each block of filtering response can be reflected adaptively.

Unfortunately, their heterogeneity and distribution make retrieving information from them a difficult process. To overcome these difficulties, several solutions have been proposed. We adopt a virtual data integration approach based on mediation to access various digital libraries. In this context, a query posed to the mediator need to be translated into a sequence of queries to the underlying data sources. In a heterogeneous environment, with sources of diverse and limited query capabilities, not all of the translations are feasible. In this paper, we study the problem of finding feasible and efficient query plans to retrieve data from digital libraries. We present the formalism that we use to describe data sources capabilities. We propose an algorithm for producing equivalent query plans and a cost model for choosing the optimal plan.","2157-4952;21574952","POD:978-2-9532443-0-4","10.1109/NTMS.2008.ECP.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4689136","","Books;Cost function;Data security;Electronic government;Health information management;Information retrieval;Internet;Mediation;Query processing;Software libraries","Internet;digital libraries;middleware;query processing","cost model;digital library mediator;heterogeneous environment;query optimization;query plan;virtual data integration","","0","","32","","","5-7 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the full value of the archived material is hidden from the end user. EASAIER addresses these issues with the development of an innovative remote access system which extends beyond standard content management and retrieval systems. The EASAIER system focuses on sound archives, libraries, museums, broadcast archives, and music schools. However, the tools may be used by anyone interested in accessing archived material; amateur or professional, regardless of the material involved. Furthermore, it enriches the access experience enabling the user to experiment with the materials in exciting new ways.

Although document evolution can be document plagiarism, but it can be descriptions to same events such as reports, news, assignments. The process of document evolution, including insertion, deletion, transposition and transformation is similar to genetics process as by mutation, of one or more nucleotides to a chromosome. Previous systems for detecting documents used word-based detecting method that detects exact match word by quick-indexing in documents. Also current plagiarism detection systems decide plagiarism by using similarity value according to ratio of same words. In this paper, we propose an approach to reconstruct the document evolution in order to detect valuable concerned documents. For this, we propose the approach to detect document evolution similarity using DNA sequence alignment in two dimensions: spatial and temporal similarity. We can get document evolution similarity by combining these two similarities. The main difference of our study to the previous studies is that our method applies to genomic sequence matching and temporal event.

We propose the use of an implicit point order (IPO) of 3-D models to establish such a sequence, defined by the description of a point set in a 3-D model. The novel approach, implicit point order (IPO) steganography, enables the elimination of the need for any pre-processing traversal stage.

Most researchers used the Euclidean distance. This measure considers the difference in magnitude, rather than just the correlation of the features. We propose a new method based on cosine distance and normalized distance measures. The cosine distance metric normalizes all features vector to unit length and makes it invariant against relative in-plane scaling transformation of the image content. The normalized distance combines two distances measures such as cosine distance and Euclidean distance which shows more accuracy than one method alone. The proposed measures take into account the integration of global features (invariant moments and eccentricity) and local features (entropy histogram and distance histogram). It first indexes trademark images database (DB) in order to search for trademarks in narrowed limit and reduce time computation and then calculates similarities for features vector to obtain the total similarity between features vector. We have used retrieval efficiency equation in order to test the accuracy of our method. The obtained results showed that cosine distance and the normalization of cosine and Euclidean distance provide a significant improvement over the Euclidean distance.","2164-7143;21647143","POD:978-0-7695-3382-7","10.1109/ISDA.2008.161","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696383","","Content based retrieval;Entropy;Euclidean distance;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Intelligent systems;Shape measurement;Trademarks","image registration;image retrieval;trademarks","Euclidean distance;cosine distance method;distance histogram;entropy histogram;first indexes trademark images database;invariant moments;normalized distance measures;perceptual similarity;retrieval efficiency equation;shape-based trademark retrieval;similarity measure;trademark images","","4","","12","","","26-28 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 2006, Taiwan launched six low-Earth-orbit satellites as a RO constellation mission, known as FORMOSAT-3. In order to thoroughly understand the process of the RO data retrieval and obtain as much as possible the information for the weather prediction, a National Central University Radio Occultation (NCURO) retrieval algorithm has been developed. The focus of the algorithm development is on the correction of the excess phase of the signal received with open-loop (OL) technique and the criteria for assessment of the data quality. When the OL is activated, the excess phase of the Global Positioning System (GPS) signal is modulated with navigation messages of satellites. In our algorithms, two methods are incorporated to recover the excess phase. Moreover, as the altitude of the received signal decreases, the quality of the GPS signal generally deteriorates, and eventually, the signal is too noisy to be processed. In order to assess the quality of the signal, instead of the signal-to-noise ratio, the degree of unclearness is defined and used in the algorithm. In this paper, the algorithm including the phase-correction methods and the criteria for the quality assessment will be described. The data retrieval using the algorithm will be compared with those obtained from the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center at the University Corporation for Atmosphere Research and Pingtung radiosonde measurement.

Experimental results for homology detection reveal that the proposed measures give at least comparable or significantly better retrieval accuracy than original pairwise statistical significance and database statistical significance reported by BLAST, PSI-BLAST, and SSEARCH.

The performance of such applications has a critical dependency on the efficiency of the underlying object store. Traditional object store systems do not allow for cache management in an application-sensitive manner and therefore provide sub-optimal performance only. In this paper, we propose a novel object store whose caching behavior is driven by an object persistence model. The object persistence model captures an applicationpsilas overall object access patterns, including those extracted from user-defined functions. A model transformer takes the object access patterns as input and creates appropriate caching policies and in-memory object indexes for the cache. We have implemented such an object store on top of a relational database system to utilize the persistence, concurrency control and data integrity mechanisms of the database system. We have further validated our design by deploying and measuring the object store in a business event processing application.","","POD:978-0-7695-3395-7","10.1109/ICEBE.2008.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4690606","model-driven;object store","Acceleration;Concurrency control;Data mining;Database systems;Functional programming;Information retrieval;Maintenance engineering;Navigation;Relational databases;Runtime","cache storage;object-oriented programming","cache behavior;concurrency control;data integrity mechanism;model transformer;model-driven object store;object access pattern;object persistence model;relational database system;secondary storage;user-defined function","","0","","7","","","22-24 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additional scattering from rain causes estimated wind speeds to appear higher than expected. Selected directions of the rain-corrupted wind vectors are biased toward along-track directions under conditions of heavy rain, which is regardless of the true wind direction. Rain becomes more significant for data acquired at a high incidence angle. To compensate for rain-induced backscatter, a simultaneous wind/rain retrieval (SWRR) method, which simultaneously retrieves wind velocity and surface rain rate from ESCAT measurements with an incidence angle >40deg, is developed by using a C-band wind/rain backscatter model. The performance of SWRR under typical wind/rain conditions is evaluated through simulation and validation with collocated TRMM PR and ECMWF data sets. SWRR is shown to significantly improve wind velocity estimates, and the SWRR estimated surface rain rate has relatively high accuracy in moderate to heavy rain cases. Although SWRR-retrieved rain is somewhat biased, it can be corrected. We note that for ESCAT, about 1.5% of all the collocated measurements is affected by significant rain.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.922146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685929","Atmospheric measurements;radar cross section;radar meteorological factors","Backscatter;Information retrieval;Meteorological radar;Radar measurements;Radar scattering;Rain;Velocity measurement;Weather forecasting;Wind forecasting;Wind speed","atmospheric techniques;radar cross-sections;rain;remote sensing by radar;wind","C-band ERS scatterometer;C-band wind-rain backscatter model;ECMWF data;ESCAT;European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts;Precipitation Radar;SWRR method;TRMM PR;Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission;simultaneous wind-rain retrieval method;surface rain rate;wind speeds","","14","","25","","","Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the availability of tremendous amounts of different types of protein data, integrating these datasets to predict function has become a significant opportunity in computational biology. In this paper, to predict protein function we (i) develop a novel Bayesian framework combining relational,hierarchical and structural information with improvement in data usage efficiency over similar methods, and (ii) propose to use it in conjunction with an integrative protein-protein association network, STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of INteracting Genes/proteins), which combines information from seven different sources. At the heart of our work is accomplishing protein data integration in a concerted fashion with respect to algorithm and data source. Method performance is assessed by a 5-fold cross-validation in yeast on selected terms from the Molecular Function ontology in the Gene Ontology database. Results show that our combined use of the proposed computational framework and the protein network from STRING offers substantial improvements in prediction. The benefits of using an aggressively integrative network, such as STRING, may derive from the fact that although it is likely that the ultimate gene interaction matrix (including but not limited to protein-protein, genetic, or regulatory interactions) will be sparse, presently it is still known only incompletely in most organisms, and thus the use of multiple distinct data sources is rewarded.","","POD:978-0-7695-3452-7","10.1109/BIBM.2008.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4684930","Bayesian framework;STRING;information integration;protein function prediction","Bayesian methods;Bioinformatics;Computational biology;Fungi;Genomics;Heart;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Protein engineering;Proteomics","biology computing;cellular biophysics;database management systems;genetics;molecular biophysics;ontologies (artificial intelligence);proteins","Bayesian framework;STRING;computational biology;gene function prediction;gene interactions;gene ontology database;genomic field;heterogeneous data sources;hierarchical inference;molecular function ontology;ontologies;protein;protein-protein association network;protein-protein interactions;proteomic field;regulatory interactions;search tool;yeast","","1","","13","","","3-5 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In SOCT, both the probes inserted into the instrumented service code, and the retrieval of coverage-related information are themselves implemented as pure service invocations. A TCov service is published that makes available these coverage-related services through a WSDL interface.

However, we are still far from having the right methods for sensitive and effective use of the available structural data. The fact that current structural analysis tools are impractical for large-scale applications have given rise to several approaches that try to quickly identify candidate proteins worthy of further analysis. Nonetheless, these approaches do not provide the desired sensitivity of identifying important structural similarities. In this study, we propose a new protein structure retrieval method (RCIndex: Residue-Contacts Index) that is based on accurate and efficient identification of similar residue contacts from a database of available protein structures. By defining a metric distance function for biologically meaningful comparison of residue contacts, distance-based indexing is made applicable for quick retrieval of similar residue contact seeds. These seeds are extended into high scoring segment pairs, which induce structural superpositions. The results show that RCIndex is effective in not only identifying related proteins, but also producing remarkably high quality structural alignments that are comparable to or better than those produced by popular pairwise alignment tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the protein structure retrieval and alignment tasks are successfully handled together.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2845-8; POD:978-1-4244-2844-1","10.1109/BIBE.2008.4696701","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4696701","Protein structure;alignment;distance-based indexing;similarity search","Atomic measurements;Availability;Databases;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large-scale systems;Protein engineering;Sequences;Web services","bioinformatics;indexing;proteins","RCIndex;distance-based indexing;protein structure alignment;protein structure retrieval;residue contacts","","0","","38","","","8-10 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This phenomenon is accounted for by splitting the analysis into two steps. In the first step, we estimate the interferometric phases from the data, whereas in the second step, we use these phases to retrieve the physical parameters of interest, such as line-of-sight (LOS) displacement and residual topography. In both steps, we make the hypothesis that target statistics are at least approximately known. This approach is suited both to derive the performances of InSAR with different decorrelation models and for providing an actual estimate of LOS motion and topography. Results achieved from Monte Carlo simulations and a set of repeated pass ENVISAT images are shown.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2001756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685949","Interferometry;statistics;stochastic processes;synthetic aperture radar","Decorrelation;Information retrieval;Maximum likelihood estimation;Phase estimation;Radar scattering;Statistical distributions;Statistics;Surfaces;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry;Yield estimation","geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;image processing;radar interferometry;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;topography (Earth)","ENVISAT images;Monte Carlo simulations;SAR interferometry applications;decorrelation models;interferometric phases;line-of-sight displacement;line-of-sight motion;multiimage synthetic aperture radar interferometry;physical parameters;residual topography;target statistics","","68","","16","","","Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Community information systems have been highlighted with the emerging term mobile Social Network. In this paper, we explore the impact of mobile social software on the community of cultural heritage management. Furthermore, mobile and ubiquitous technologies have provided capabilities for more sophisticated approach to cultural heritage management. We analyze these features of mobile information systems for cultural communities. We also present a mobile community framework with mobile Web Services to enable professionals to collect, manage and retrieve cultural heritage information in wide user communities. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in a social network. In a social network, nodes and links represent participants and their friendships, respectively. We have designed and implemented a query propagation mechanism and its applications to realize a social network composed by cellular phone users. In these applications, users can retrieve information from their friends or their friends' friends by propagating the query in the network. To propagate a query in a wide range and improve the query success ratio, most users who receive the query must relay it to all their friends. However, this increases communication packets. In this paper, we propose a query routing method to decrease the number of communication packets by using user profiles.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3455-8","10.1109/NWeSP.2008.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4700391","Social Network","Cultural differences;Global communication;Information retrieval;Intelligent networks;Internet;Management information systems;Semantic Web;Social network services;Technology management;Web sites","Web services;mobile computing;semantic Web","Internet;World Wide Web;cellular phone users;collective intelligence;cultural communities;cultural heritage management;mobile Web services;mobile community framework;mobile information systems;mobile social networks;mobile social software;mobile technology;query propagation;semantic Web technology;ubiquitous technology","","0","","6","","","20-22 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC is a joint Taiwan/U.S. mission consisting of six identical low Earth orbit satellites. All six cluster satellites were successfully launched by a single Minotaur launch vehicle on April 15, 2006. The retrieved Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) data have been freely available online to the science community since shortly after the completion of satellite bus in-orbit checkout. Having completed the verification and validation, the worldwide science communities are highly satisfied with the RO data. Scientists have hailed the RO sensors as offering the most accurate, precise, and stable thermometers in space. After one year in orbit, all six FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC satellites were in good condition (except FM2, which had power shortage issues) and were on their way toward the final constellation of six separate orbit planes with 30 <sup>deg</sup> separation. Four out of six satellites had already reached their final mission orbit of 800 km by mid-May 2007. Together, the six satellites have generated a total of more than 2500 RO data per day. However, only 50%-70% of the RO data as received one year after launch could be retrieved into useful atmosphere profiles. The retrieved RO data, about 1800 per day on average, have been assimilated into numerical weather prediction models by many major weather forecast centers and research institutes. This paper provides an overview of the constellation mission, the spacecraft system performance after one year in orbit, the technical challenges we have encountered, and the performance enhancements we have accomplished.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2008.2005203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685955","Constellation;Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC);FORMOSAT-3;radio occultation (RO);remote sensing;satellite;system performance","Global Positioning System;Information retrieval;Ionosphere;Low earth orbit satellites;Meteorology;Satellite broadcasting;Space missions;Space vehicles;System performance;Weather forecasting","Global Positioning System;aerospace instrumentation;artificial satellites;atmospheric measuring apparatus;remote sensing;weather forecasting","AD 2006 04 15;COSMIC constellation spacecraft system;Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate;FORMOSAT-3 mission;GPS radio occultation;National Space Organization of Taiwan;atmosphere profile;global positioning system;numerical weather prediction model;weather forecast center","","21","","29","","","Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since they provide important information about research outcomes, mining techniques targeting them have attracted a great deal of attention. Our final goal is to develop a figure finding system, FigFinder, to retrieve figures relevant to a userpsilas query by mining information contained in figures, their legends, and the main text in an integrative manner. In this study, we worked on figure classification to choose those representing signaling or metabolic pathways, based on textual information contained in biomedical papers, as the first step to develop FigFinder. We took several supervised machine learning methods, and could confirm that the use of main text combined with figure legends was quite effective. Although many groups have considered figure legends, this is the first attempt to address figure classification task by utilizing figure legends together with main text to our knowledge.","","POD:978-0-7695-3452-7","10.1109/BIBM.2008.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4684901","Figure classification;Text mining","Abstracts;Bioinformatics;Computational biology;Data mining;Databases;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Machine learning;Proteins","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;pattern classification;query processing;text analysis","FigFinder;biomedical literature;biomedical papers;figure classification;figure mining techniques;metabolic pathways;signaling pathways;supervised machine learning method;text analysis;textual information;users query processing","","1","","17","","","3-5 Nov. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Enhanced Bidirectional Relaying Schemes for Multi-Hop Communications","M. Feng; X. She; L. Chen","DoCoMo Beijing-Labs., Beijing","IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 - 2008 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference","20081208","2008","","","1","6","This paper focuses on bidirectional relaying schemes for multihop communications. For a two hop communication system, traditional 4-step bidirectional relaying (TBR) method allocates 4 slots, resulting in low efficiency; Coded bidirectional relaying (CBR) method, making use of network coding, needs only 3 slots, can provide throughput improvement up to 33% compared with TBR method; Two-way relaying method performs data bidirectional relaying with 2 slots, by employing interference cancellation algorithms in the relay station, can further improve spectrum efficiency. However due to different channel condition between RS to BS and RS to MS and broadcast transmission utilized from RS to BS and MS, CBR and two-way relaying methods can not fully exploit the channel capacity from RS to BS and RS to MS simultaneously. In order to solve the problem, we propose two enhanced relaying schemes: the first one is hierarchical modulation (HM) based scheme, in which HM is adopted to allocate individual MCS for each hop and a novel network coding pattern is designed to avail the introduction of HM to relaying. To further improve the performance of the first method, another method as hybrid constellation based relaying scheme is proposed, in which each end node jointly utilizes a hybrid constellation and the prior data it previously transmitted to retrieve the information from the other end node. Performance evaluation results show our algorithms solve the problem successfully and can improve system spectrum efficiency by 5-12% compared with traditional CBR method. Finally it is concluded that the enhanced bidirectional relaying schemes are promising relaying schemes candidates for multi-hop communications.","1930-529X;1930529X","POD:978-1-4244-2324-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2008.ECP.887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4698662","","Channel capacity;Costs;Information retrieval;Interference cancellation;Modulation coding;Network coding;Radio broadcasting;Relays;Spread spectrum communication;Throughput","codes;modulation;radio networks","bidirectional relaying schemes enhancement;coded bidirectional relaying method;hierarchical modulation based scheme;hybrid constellation;multihop communications;relay station;two-way relaying methods;wireless networks","","6","1","11","","","Nov. 30 2008-Dec. 4 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
