These web 2.0 applications have become a powerful tool for communication. Each social web site has millions of users whose interact with each other regardless of their location and distance. Therefore, the mechanism of recommendation system for these sites is important for users to find suitable friends. Name recommendation should be made based on the concept of homophily which stated that relationships between individuals who have in common is higher than individuals who have nothing in common. Twitter is one of the popular social web sites that were developed in 2006. Many of the Twitter users are passive users. They just follow other users but on the other side they do not have many followers. This problem arises because reciprocal relationship is not required in Twitter. To overcome this problem, a recommendation system can help users in searching friends by taking into account reciprocal relationships. The main goal of this study is to use collaborative filtering techniques to recommend names based on geographical location. User's location is taken from the user's profile by using coordinates of latitude and longitude. Celebrities profile data sets provided by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) are taken for testing purposes. The result of the testing indicates the potential of exploiting geographical locations in collaboratively recommending names within Twitter environment.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995775","Twitter;collaborative filtering;recommender system","Collaboration;Recommender systems;Testing;Twitter","information filtering;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Twitter;Web 2.0;collaborative filtering techniques;geographical location;microblogs;names recommendation system;social Web sites","","3","","20","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Whilst in the educational domain, learning objects are a fundamental resource. Literally, Content Management Systems and repositories have restricted the means for organising and understanding the captured semantic relationships between the learning objects and other stored documents. To cater this situation, we propose the application of metametadata as a useful semantic based approach to address similarities in a domain to gather definite requirements. This paper focuses on the existing approaches for describing semantic relationships in Content Management Systems and how metametadata capture the pedagogic information which can be applied to enhance the semantic information stored within such a Content Management Systems or repository.

The indexing algorithm is based on the classic vector-space model that is adapted by employing index weighting and a word sense disambiguation. It uses sets of Semantic DNA, extracted from a lexical ontology, to represent the images in a vector space. As discussed in the paper, the use of Semantic DNA in text-based image retrieval aims to overcome some of the major drawbacks of well known traditional approaches such as `bags of words' and term frequency-(TF) based indexing. The proposed approach is evaluated by comparing the indexing achieved using the proposed semantic algorithm with results obtained using a traditional TF-based indexing in vector space model (VSM) with singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. The experimental results show that the proposed ontology-based approach generates a better-quality index which captures the conceptual meaning of the image annotations.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995762","image annotation;semantic image indexing;vector space model","Context;DNA;Hamming distance;Indexing;Ontologies;Semantics","image processing;image retrieval;indexing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);singular value decomposition;word processing","bags of words;image preprocessing;lexical ontology;ontology based annotated image indexing;semantic DNA model;singular value decomposition technique;term frequency-based indexing;text-based image retrieval;vector space model;word sense disambiguation","","0","","19","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of current methods on identification and extraction of non-taxonomic relations is based on predicate representing relationships between two concepts, namely the relation between subject and object that occurs in a sentence. However, the number of relations that has been identified does not properly represent the domain as the methods only identify a portion of the total relations from domain texts.

The inadequacy of consumer evaluation framework to assess culturally-mediated web IA, burden consumer with decisions biased to independent indicators such as aesthetics, quality, credibility and cultural usability. The consumer evaluation usually unsupported, at random and imbalance usage of these indicators. Thus, this paper will provide an overview of the research framework for the development of Consumer Evaluation Measurement Model (CEMMo) in culturally-mediated web IA.

The collection of images attached to entities, such as on-line news articles with images, are abundant on the Internet. Still, it is difficult to retrieve accurate information on these entities. Using entity names in a search engine yields large lists, but often results in imprecise and unsatisfactory outcomes. Our goal is to populate a knowledge base with on-line image news resources in the BBC sport domain. This system will yield high precision, a high recall and include diverse sports photos for specific entities. A multi-modality ontology retrieval system, with relational facts about entities for generating expanded queries, will be used to retrieve results. DBpedia will be used as a domain sport ontology description, and will be integrated with a textual description and a visual description, both generated by hand. To overcome semantic interoperability between ontologies, automated ontology alignment is used. In addition, visual similarity measures based on MPEG7 descriptions and SIFT features, are used for higher diversity in the final rankings.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995779","DBpedia;Image Retrieval;Multi-Modality Ontology and Sport News;Ontology;Text Retrieval","Encyclopedias;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Internet;Ontologies;Semantics","Internet;Web sites;image retrieval;knowledge management;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;sport","BBC sport domain;DBpedia integration;Internet;MPEG7 description;SIFT feature;Wikipedia;automated extraction;knowledge sharing community;machine processing knowledge base;multimodality ontology retrieval system;news image retrieval system;online news article;search engine;semantic interoperability;textual description;visual description;visual similarity","","2","","21","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular this study, it is also concerned with the process of Knowledge Management System (KMS) in supporting the knowledge facilitation of SPI for SHO. In order to understand the support process, we have studied how KM processes are practiced within SHO which includes communication, learning, sharing and documentation process. The findings explain on how the KMS has been practiced and influence the SPI in SHO.

OntoAbsolute relies on the modern quantitative evaluation method to evaluate simplicity and unity concepts (i.e., meta-properties) in the structural domains in concepts and their relations via proposed criteria and related measures. OntoAbsolute has a capacity to develop new criteria and measures to access cognitive results in ontology as a whole.

One of version of KM is based on artificial intelligence (AI) methods. KM based on AI has been investigated in the present work based on natural gas consumption estimation domain. Developing accurate and flexible model to natural gas consumption estimation is a strategic step in policy and decision-making process in energy sector. This paper provides a stage algorithm during that it gains optimal fuzzy regression model for studding natural gas consumption in sixteen countries according to data in years 1989 till 2007. Different countries have selected from Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Middle East based on high, middle and low GDP index and for every one of them nine fuzzy regression models have executed and the results and error of each model have calculated. Preprocess has been done on the initial data to gain better results which the min-max method has been used for this purpose. Two criterions have been used to determining suitable and appropriate fuzzy regression model in each country. Firstly, fuzzy regression models with MAPE value below 10 is deleted from the assessment and remained fuzzy regression models are compared with ANOVA. Upon logic that given algorithm sketches for some countries none of used models are proper while for other countries optimal model is gained in first or second filter of algorithm. To show the applicability and superiority of the proposed flexible Fuzzy regression model the data for oil consumption in Japan, Thailand, Bangladesh from Asia and Norway, Italy, Bulgaria from Europe and Qatar, Iran, Iraq from Middle East and The united state, Mexico, Bolivia from North America and Libya, Tunisia, Nigeria from Africa during 1989 to 2007 are used.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6205023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205023","ANOVA Test;Fuzzy Regression;Natural Gas Consumption","Analysis of variance;Data models;Economic indicators;Estimation;Mathematical model;Predictive models","artificial intelligence;decision making;economic indicators;fuzzy set theory;knowledge management;minimax techniques;natural gas technology;power consumption;power engineering computing;power markets;regression analysis","AI;GDP index;KM;MAPE value;artificial intelligence;decision making;energy sector;fuzzy regression analysis;knowledge management;minimax method;natural gas consumption estimation;oil consumption;variance algorithm","","0","","15","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Like in any data model, it is very important to ensure that the contents of the database always valid even after any attempt of updates. XML Updates validation is a process of checking the correctness of XML documents, in terms of satisfying their constraints, after updates operations. The validation can be generally categorized into structural and semantic validation. The first validation is to ensure that all XML nodes in the documents conform to structural information in its associated schema. Meanwhile, the second validation checks the integrity constraints of the documents, and it involve various factors such as the functional dependencies, domain constraint, inheritance, etc. In this paper, we provide a preliminary survey of semantic validation w.r.t XML Updates. The work of validation usually applied either upon any attempt of updates or in a scheduled period. We compare the output gain by works in terms of operation of update, the composition, types of constraint, etc. It shows that even though there are abundant of studies in this area, not much work has investigated a complete semantic validation of different semantic constraints.

To realize the Semantic Web, the W3C has adopted standards and tools such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). With the development of the Semantic Web, OWL ontology became a W3C recommended mechanism and state-of-the-art technology toward the ideal Semantic Web. Most semantic web applications developed for such an environment require the management of large amounts of semantic data which are stored in semantic models. This requirement has motivated the design of specialized repositories in order to store and manipulate semantic models. However, semantic repositories still have problems related to hierarchical relations in that OWL data cannot be directly represented by a relation table i.e. `a single table'.

The diversity of structures has led to the emergence of heterogeneous structured documents. The heterogeneity of structured documents is one of the reason for query-document mismatch in structured document retrieval. In structured document retrieval, a user is assumed to have intimate knowledge of the document structures and is able to specify contextual constraints in their queries. However, it is impossible for the user to know all structures in heterogeneous structured document collections. In this paper, we propose to include similar correspondence relations in the representation model for structured document retrieval. The similar correspondences make the relations between similar contents explicit in order to improve structured document retrieval effectiveness.

The problem of the tagger approach is to predict the POS for unseen words in the training corpus that can guess word's POS based on their surrounding information. The predictor has been built based on information of word's prefixes, suffixes or combination of them. Linear successive abstraction has been used for smoothing the probability distribution of part of speech for unknown Malay words given their prefixes or suffixes information. However, for the combination of prefixes and suffixes information, the joint probability distribution has been used. The best performance to predict POS of unknown words are obtained through prefixes information by seeing the first three characters of the words. The accuracy of the tagging is 67.9%.

Therefore, a suitable technique is preferred to solve the multi-criteria problem in GDSS.

In spite of its strength and ability to solve MCDM problem, fuzzy AHP still contains mathematical calculations which is considered quite complicated for some people, and lack of voting opportunity for the decision makers. Thus, another method in MCDM is introduced here, which is the Social Choice (SC) method along with its ability to give opportunity of voting for the decision makers.

Recently, the use of local pattern features and the bag of features (BOF) approach has become popular for certain applications. In the BOF approach, software programs choose proper keypoints from the solid textures for computing local pattern features. Our fractal-based technique identifies keypoints from solid textures, and the techniques are examined using a solid texture benchmark dataset.

As this task is tedious, time-consuming and prone to bias, the need for automated grading tool is necessary to reduce the educators' burden and avoid inconsistency and favoritism. Recent researches have claimed that Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has the ability to represent human cognitive knowledge to assess essays, retrieving information, classification of documents and indexing. In this paper, we adapt LSA technique to grade computer programming assignments and observe how far it can be applied as an alternative approach to traditional grading methods by human. The grades of the assignments are generated from the cosine similarity that shows how close students' assignments to the model answers in the latent semantic vector space. The results show that LSA is not able to detect orders of computer programming and symbols; however, LSA is able to grade assignments faster and consistently, which avoid bias and reduces the time spent by human.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995769","computer programming assignments;latent semantic analysis","Humans;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition;Programming profession;Semantics;Training","cognition;document handling;indexing;information retrieval;vectors","LSA technique;automated grading tool;computer programming;cosine similarity;document classification;human cognitive knowledge;indexing;information retrieval;latent semantic analysis;latent semantic vector space","","1","","10","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the effectiveness, accuracy and appropriateness of search results are strongly emphasized. Information retrieval (IR) methods provide high impact in influencing the searching results. Efforts in improving the IR methods have been made due to the fact that names are not unique and have varieties of spelling. This will caused errors during the process of getting accurate names. Searching based on phonetic is said to be a suitable method to solve the aforementioned problem because names have limited spelling standards. Phonetic method is used to recognize and retrieve words that have the same pronunciation. The main aim of this paper is to test the effectiveness of phonetic coding method on Malay name retrieval using Soundex and modified-Asoundex (Asoundex is an Arabic Soundex). The experimental approach used to perform this research consists of two stages; program development and testing Malay name data sets. The development of programs referred to the existing algorithms to generate name code. Code generated from program will be compared with data contained in the test data. The effectiveness of the result is determined by comparing the output with the result obtained from both phonetic approaches. Evaluation is based on the precision and recall measures. The contribution of the research is to provide comparative accuracy of Malay name retrieval using Soundex and modified-Asoundex coding method. Result show that an average of 38.38% improvement of the precision measure has been achieved.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995776","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995776","Asoundex;Soundex;name retrieval;phonetic","Accuracy;Databases;Encoding;Information retrieval;Libraries;Measurement;Speech","information retrieval;natural language processing;program compilers;search engines;speech coding","Arabic Soundex;Information retrieval;Malay name retrieval;Soundex;code generation;information systems;modified Asoundex;phonetic coding method;program development;search engines","","0","","33","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, a Knowledge Management System (KMS) is critical to provide an environment for sharing and sustaining knowledge among members of SM community of practice (CoP). Based on earlier works on KMS framework for collaborative SM, an agent-based KMS prototype system called SM Collaborative Agent Team (SCAT) is designed and developed, to assist maintainers to share information and perform their SM activities. The aims of this paper are to discuss the design of SCAT and to evaluate SCAT's success as a KMS tool. Designing SCAT involves three major aspects: Multi Agent System (MAS) design, Combined Ontology of SM and Domain knowledge areas, and System design. For evaluation, SCAT was benchmark against another agent-based KMS prototype. A survey was conducted to gauge the responses of users and maintainers on the success of both KMS tools, based on Wu & Wang KMS Success model. The results of the survey are analyzed using Rasch rating-scale model to determine if SCAT fares better than Rodriguez. Based on t-test comparison on overall Rasch estimated measures, SCAT KMS is slightly better than Rodriguez KMS. Using Common Person Equating (CPE) plot, SCAT are better than Rodriguez KMS in several key areas. In future, SCAT could be enhanced to improve the weak areas.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6205017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205017","Online collaboration;Second Life;Virtual worlds","Collaboration;Computer science;Knowledge management;Maintenance engineering;Ontologies;Prototypes;Reliability","groupware;knowledge management;multi-agent systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);software agents;software maintenance;virtual reality","CPE plot;CoP;KMS tool;Rasch estimation;Rasch rating-scale model;Rodriguez KMS;SCAT design;SM collaborative agent team;SM community of practice;SM ontology;Wu & Wang KMS success model;agent-based KMS prototype system;agent-based knowledge management system;collaborative software maintenance environment;common person equating plot;domain knowledge areas;information sharing;knowledge sharing;knowledge-driven system;multiagent system design;system design;t-test comparison","","1","","10","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Incorporation of concepts like role, category, topic, class, attributes, etc. to indicate the search target and constraints in a structured query enable better definition of information needs. However, the varieties of usages in application contexts create heterogeneity of structures definition and presentation, thus making it hard of using this information when formulating structured query for a search process. Hence, we are motivated to automate transformation of unstructured queries (which are more common for web user), to structured queries (which support better specification of information needs). This paper first explores two important issues arisen in the process of query transformation, i.e. multiple structures (with respect to the needs of handling multiple structured queries type) and multiple semantics (with respect to the needs of handling different collections of structured resources). Along with these issues, we define research problems, followed by an approach of mediating multiple structures and multiple semantics to support the query transformation from unstructured to structured form.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995785","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995785","Query transformation;search;semantic structures;structured retrieval","Conferences;Context;Legged locomotion;Natural languages;Periodic structures;Rivers;Semantics","data handling;query processing","automated query transformation;multiple semantics;multiple structures;query handling;query transformation;search process;semantically rich structured resources;structured query;unstructured query","","0","","15","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, they suffer from the following problems 1) As they use brute force matching for the entire document, they tend to be slow in their operation 2) words in a document may have similar meaning but they may not be identical in their spelling 3) current techniques fail to match and identify phrases efficiently 4) they also fail to consider for word disambiguation. In this paper, we propose a novel and fast ontological-based webpage classification technique to classify a webpage with high accuracy. To speed up our system, we use a segmentation technique that utilizes visual boundary of a region and matches keywords within the region instead of the entire webpage. We also use a fast clustering technique to match keywords and label the page based on the nearest match.

We count the number of “on” pixels in rectangle boundaries around a centroid, in the event that there are no “on” pixels in a rectangle boundary then the value is zero. The similarity level indicator is introduced to form part of vector a representation of the object shape. This method of image representation shows improved retrieval rate when compared to Density Histogram of Feature Points (DHFP) representation method. This method is capable of grouping object shapes with high probability of being similar using the similarity level indicator before calculation of similarity distance.

However, the Web is still dominated by Web 2.0 in which information and data is presented in an unstructured manner and is only fit for human consumption. Hence, building a semantic search engine is a very challenging task and there is still a lot of improvement that needs to be done to achieve the desirable results. As an example, if we search for “food that is not halal”, existing semantic search engines still ignore the term of “not” resulting in inaccurate search. In view of this problem, this paper proposes a semantic meta search engine that utilizes the power of a traditional search engine (Google) and enriches the search result using DBpedia as the knowledge base to produce better results.

One of the KM initiatives in health care sector is virtual communities of practice (VCoPs). But the effectiveness of its contribution towards the well publicized failure of numerous KM initiatives is questioned by many researchers. In health care sectors Virtual Community of Practice is one of the KM initiatives practiced where practitioners conduct discussions and share experience online. Presently, there is no overall or widely accepted framework that addresses the important aspects of KM to measure the KMS success in health care sector particularly virtual communities in KMS, reflecting the need to build a successful VCoPs model. Basically, VCoPs depends on the interaction between practitioners through the information and communication technologies (ICT). Past researches have identified the technological and social psychological features as some of the key factors for the success of VCoPs. This article reports on a study that proposes a multidimensional VCoPs success model based on the information systems (IS) success theories which focuses on the social psychological perspective. This study adopts the theory of planned behavior (TPB) combined with other social psychological factors derived from the literature. From the technological perspective, the study adopts the DeLone and McLean IS success model as well as the technology acceptance model (TAM). However, technological and social psychological factors are showing a causal chain starting with beliefs and main system's characteristics to expectations about usage and value of the VCoPs.

Traceability will trace the keywords in the requirement to be converted into UML Diagram as proposed. This paper present review on available approaches and tools to support the transformation of requirement into behavior model. The main objective of this paper is to describe and presents the review of the benefits of the existing approach, and the comparison of the tools used in current papers. Finally we will come out with detail discussion and the table shows the differences of the available transformation tools.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6205025","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205025","Behavior Tree;Model Driven Engineering (MDE);Requirement Engineering;Traceability","Automation;Computational modeling;Object oriented modeling;Programming;Software;Testing;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;formal specification;software engineering","UML design diagrams;activity diagrams;behavior design;behavior diagram;model driven development;requirement diagram;requirement transformation;traceability method;use case diagram;use case requirements","","0","","16","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, the growth of new inexperienced users creates new challenges for information retrieval researchers. It has become increasingly difficult for these users to find relevant documents that satisfying their information need. This problem is due to the fact that this category of user is unable to express his exact need of information which leads to the use of inappropriate keywords or queries. This paper presents a study of the user searching behavior on query formulation. In this paper, query formulation is divided into two categories; breadth and depth query strategies.

The algorithm used to grouping is KMeans, KMeans++, Hierchical Clustering, and a combination of these three algorithms with SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). For external validation, Purity and F-Measure are used, whereas Silhouette is used for internal validation. From the experimental results it can be concluded that SVD provides improvements to the clustering results. In addition, the use of abstract does not necessarily improve the performance of clustering, and the use of phrase does not always yield better cluster than the use of the word as index. Moreover, no cluster has purity measure greater than 50%, which means that the existing IPC classification has not been able to accommodate the field of ICT appropriately.","2166-0697;21660697","Electronic:978-1-61284-353-7; POD:978-1-61284-354-4","10.1109/STAIR.2011.5995789","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5995789","Clustering;Information & Communication Technology;Kmeans;Patent;Singular Value Decomposition","Abstracts;Clustering algorithms;Indexing;Matrix decomposition;Patents;Singular value decomposition","document handling;information technology;patents;pattern classification;pattern clustering;singular value decomposition","F-Measure validation;ICT field;KMeans++ algorithm;SVD;Silhouette validation;WIPO;hierarchical clustering;information and communication technology;international patent classification;patent data classification;patent document clustering;patent registration;singular value decomposition;world intellectual property organization","","0","","14","","","28-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different methodologies have been proposed to improve trust management. These approaches can be classified into three groups as follows: the first group used Bayesian statistics and its derivation such as Dempster-Shaffer theory of evidence. The second group used game theory, and the third group depends on algebraic ordinary set operation and fuzzy logic. Despite the previous work in this area, a comprehensive security model to support trust management has yet been accomplished. The critical security threats in this environment necessitate a comprehensive trust and privacy models which require integration of different concepts to evaluate precisely the trustworthiness of entities. In this paper, we propose a trust management scheme by implementing a fusion of the support vector machine (SVM) and fuzzy logic system. The main motivation of the proposed scheme in using the support vector machine is to predict the optimal trust values for approximation purpose, and then those approximated values relate the fuzzy basis functions.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6205031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6205031","Central node;Fuzzy Logic;Interaction;Matrix;Membership;Pervasive;Recommendation;Relationship;Support Vector Machine;Trust management;Trustworthiness;node","Computational modeling;Fuzzy logic;History;Kernel;Pervasive computing;Security;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;approximation theory;data privacy;fuzzy logic;game theory;inference mechanisms;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines;trusted computing;ubiquitous computing","Bayesian statistics;Dempster-Shaffer evidence theory;algebraic ordinary set operation;comprehensive security model;fuzzy basis functions;fuzzy logic system;game theory;hybrid scheme;optimal trust values;pervasive computing;privacy models;security threats;support vector machine;trust management;trust models","","3","","14","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However as organisational knowledge is greatly dependant on the tacit knowledge that its employees possess, it is important to dwell upon some human resource functional strategies to encourage sharing of employees' knowledge and also enhance employee retention. The focus of this paper is predominantly on tacit knowledge sharing. Strategies that organisations can take to share, retain and reuse tacit knowledge have been recommended. The role of the human resource function, as a key enabler of tacit knowledge transfer, has been highlighted. Employee rewards management plays a key part in promoting, creating, sharing and preserving knowledge and its vitality has been discussed.

By studying speech recognition algorithms, this study presents an algorithm for recognition of correct pronunciation of Persian words. First, children are asked to look at the picture of a word. Then, they are required to pronounce the word .In the next phase, the word itself is shown and the child is to pronounce the word. For example, first a picture of ""bread"" is shown and the child is required to name it. Then the word ""bread"" is shown and child is asked to pronounce it. This process fulfills two objectives: correct pronunciation of Persian words and improving children speed reading. Since children pronounce the words with different accents, differentiation of patterns, pattern recognition and recognition of correct or incorrect speech production need to be clarified.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1090-1; POD:978-1-4673-1091-8","10.1109/InfRKM.2012.6204975","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6204975","Sample;fuzzy algorithm;multi -layer average;pattern recognition;pronunciation;sound","Algorithm design and analysis;Fuzzy logic;Hidden Markov models;Image color analysis;Spectrogram;Speech recognition","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;natural language processing;speech recognition","Persian words;children speed reading improvement;fuzzy algorithms;incorrect speech production recognition algorithm;multilayer average method;pattern differentiation;pattern recognition;system design;word correct pronunciation recognition","","0","","10","","","13-15 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, in this paper, we introduce the application of self- similarity surfaces for human action recognition. These surfaces were introduced by Shechtman & Irani (CVPR'07) in the context of matching similarities between images or videos. These surfaces are obtained by matching a small patch, centered at a pixel, to its larger surroundings, aim- ing to capture similarities of a patch to its neighborhood. Once these surfaces are computed, we propose to transform these surfaces into Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HoG), which are then used to train Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Our novelty lies in recognizing the utility of these selfsimilarity surfaces for human action recognition. In addition, in contrast to Shechtman & Irani (CVPR'07), we compute only a few of these surfaces (two per frame) for our task. The proposed method does not rely on the structure recovery nor on the correspondence estimation, but makes only mild assumptions about the rough localization of a per- son in the frame.
