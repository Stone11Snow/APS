It is therefore necessary to take into account the errors particularly when such systems need to manage information of variable quality. Our state of the art leads us to identify difficulties in the comparative evaluation of error correction systems. Our proposal consists in an evaluation model for error correction systems and low-level string similarity (and distance) metrics they rely on.

They are introduced in a general form covering not only the distances of discrete and continuous stochastic observations, but also the distances of random processes and signals. It is shown that the scaled Bregman distances extend not only the classical ones studied in the previous literature, but also the information divergence and the related wider class of convex divergences of probability measures. An information-processing theorem is established too, but only in the sense of invariance w.r.t. statistically sufficient transformations and not in the sense of universal monotonicity. Pathological situations where coding can increase the classical Bregman distance are illustrated by a concrete example. In addition to the classical areas of application of the Bregman distances and convex divergences such as recognition, classification, learning, and evaluation of proximity of various features and signals, the paper mentions a new application in 3-D exploratory data analysis. Explicit expressions for the scaled Bregman distances are obtained in general exponential families, with concrete applications in the binomial, Poisson, and Rayleigh families, and in the families of exponential processes such as the Poisson and diffusion processes including the classical examples of the Wiener process and geometric Brownian motion.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2178139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6157087","Bregman distances;classification;divergences;exponential distributions;exponential processes;information retrieval;machine learning;statistical decision;sufficiency","Concrete;Context;Convex functions;Information theory;Measurement;Probability;Vectors","convex programming;data analysis;exponential distribution;geometry;signal processing;stochastic processes","3D exploratory data analysis;Poisson families;Poisson processes;Rayleigh families;Wiener process;binomial families;continuous stochastic observations;convex divergences;diffusion processes;discrete stochastic observations;exponential processes;geometric Brownian motion;information divergence;information-processing theorem;nonuniform contributions;probability distributions;probability measure divergences;random processes;random signals;scaled Bregman distances","","7","","47","","","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They always aim at achieving the goal of delivering relevant information to the users. Due to the exponential growth of information and imprecise queries, Search engines could not meet the user's information requirements. Users have to reframe their queries until they get their desired information. Also results are not listed based on the users search context. Personalization is re-ordering of the search results that satisfies the needs of the user. This paper presents an approach to capture the user's preferences in order to provide query suggestions. Web search personalization using collaborative filtering adapts a generic search engine for the needs of a community of users.

Image analysis methods can be coupled with text-based methods to improve knowledge discovery. However, automatically harvesting figures along with their associated captions from full-text articles remains challenging. In this paper, we present an automatic system for robustly harvesting figures from biomedical literature. Our approach relies on the idea that the PDF specification of the document layout can be used to identify encoded figures and figure boundaries within the PDF and enforce constraints among figure-regions. This allows us to harvest fragments of figures (subflgures), from the PDF, correctly identify subfigures that belong to the same figure, and identify the captions associated with each figure. Our method simultaneously recovers figures and captions and applies additional filtering process to remove irrelevant figures such as logos, to eliminate text passages that were incorrectly identified as captions, and to re-group subflgures to generate a putative figure. Finally, we associate figures with captions. Our preliminary experiments suggest that our method achieves an accuracy of 95% in harvesting figures-caption pairs from a set of 2,035 full-text biomedical documents from BioCreative III, containing 12,574 figures.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4574-5; POD:978-1-4577-1799-4","10.1109/BIBM.2011.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120505","biomedical documents;biomedical images;figures and captions;images;information retrieval","Biomedical imaging;Databases;Image resolution;Layout;Merging;Portable document format;Robustness","data mining;formal specification;image retrieval;medical computing;text analysis","automatic system;biomedical PDF documents;biomedical articles;caption extraction;document layout PDF specification;figure extraction;filtering process;image analysis methods;knowledge discovery","","3","","13","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to select good expansion terms, similarity kernel function is used in our model to estimate the relevance weight between query and its relevant term extracted from the top-ranked documents in initial retrieval results.

Each type of information allows for applying specialized, domain-specific approaches to music analysis tasks. In this paper, we formulate the idea of a cross-version analysis for comparing and/or combining analysis results from different representations. As an example, we realize this idea in the context of harmonic analysis to automatically evaluate MIDI-based chord labeling procedures using annotations given for corresponding audio recordings. To this end, one needs reliable synchronization procedures that automatically establish the musical relationship between the multiple versions of a given piece. This becomes a hard problem when there are significant local deviations in these versions. We introduce a novel late-fusion approach that combines different alignment procedures in order to identify reliable parts in synchronization results. Then, the cross-version comparison of the various chord labeling results is performed only on the basis of the reliable parts. Finally, we show how inconsistencies in these results across the different versions allow for a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, which not only indicates limitations of the employed chord labeling strategies but also deepens the understanding of the underlying music material.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2012.2190047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6165370","Alignment;chord recognition;music information retrieval;music synchronization","Audio recording;Educational institutions;Harmonic analysis;Labeling;Music;Reliability;Synchronization","music","MIDI-based chord labeling procedures;acoustic domain;alignment procedures;audio recordings;chord labeling strategies;domain-specific approach;late-fusion approach;music analysis tasks;music cross-version harmonic analysis;music material;symbolic domain;synchronization procedures;visual domain","","2","","49","","20120306","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Indeed, although contextual relationships correlate tags, many auto-taggers model tags independently. This paper presents a novel, generative approach to improve automatic music annotation by modeling contextual relationships between tags. A Dirichlet mixture model (DMM) is proposed as a second, additional stage in the modeling process, to supplement any auto-tagging system that generates a semantic multinomial (SMN) over a vocabulary of tags when annotating a song. For each tag in the vocabulary, a DMM captures the broader context the tag defines by modeling tag co-occurrence patterns in the SMNs of songs associated with the tag. When annotating songs, the DMMs refine SMN annotations by leveraging contextual evidence. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of combining a variety of auto-taggers with this generative context model. It generally outperforms other approaches to modeling context as well.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2172423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6047567","Audio annotation and retrieval;Dirichlet mixture models;context modeling;music information retrieval","Acoustics;Context;Context modeling;Correlation;Rocks;Semantics;Vocabulary","audio signal processing;information retrieval;music;polynomials","Dirichlet mixture model;audio clips;auto-taggers model;automatic music annotation;contextual relationship modeling;direct auditory cues;generative context model;semantic associations;semantic multinomial;semantic music annotation;semantic music retrieval;song annotation;tag vocabulary","","16","","37","","20111017","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we observe that, for an important class of queries that we call time-sensitive queries, the publication time of the documents in a news archive is important and should be considered in conjunction with the topic similarity to derive the final document ranking. Earlier work has focused on improving retrieval for “recency” queries that target recent documents. We propose a more general framework for handling time-sensitive queries and we automatically identify the important time intervals that are likely to be of interest for a query. Then, we build scoring techniques that seamlessly integrate the temporal aspect into the overall ranking mechanism.

In this paper we propose a method with which it is possible to efficiently perform diarization of long recordings. We have also applied this method successfully to a collection of a total duration of approximately 15 hours. The method consists of first segmenting long recordings into smaller chunks on which diarization is performed. Next, a speaker detection system is used to link the speech clusters from each chunk and to assign a unique label to each speaker in the long recording or in the small collection. We show for three different audio collections that it is possible to perform high-quality diarization with this approach. The long meetings from the ICSI corpus are processed 5.5 times faster than the originally needed time and by uniquely labeling each speaker across the entire collection it becomes possible to perform speaker-based information retrieval with high accuracy (mean average precision of 0.57).","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2162320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961612","Collection-wide diarization;information retrieval;large-scale diarization;speaker detection;speaker diarization","Data models;Interviews;Joining processes;Materials;Multimedia communication;NIST;Speech","audio recording;hidden Markov models;information retrieval;pattern clustering;speaker recognition","HMM topology;ICSI corpus;agglomerative clustering;audio collections;collection-wide speaker diarization;hidden Markov model;high-quality diarization;large-scale speaker diarization;long recording segmentation;speaker detection system;speaker identification;speaker-based information retrieval;speech clusters;unique label assignment","","10","","25","","20110725","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nowadays, there is an increase amount of data stored in structured databases (Relational Databases). Searching on traditional database management system is done through customized applications which are closely tied to the database schema. Traditional database management systems do not support keyword-based search. Keyword search techniques on the Web cannot directly be applied to databases because the data on the internet and database are in different forms. Therefore, a keyword-based search system for relational database is proposed. The goal is to provide the users, who are not familiar with query language and the schema of the database, to search the relational database with ease. The main contributions of this system compose of indexing of records in database, keyword matching, scoring and filtering of the relevant answer. As long as the database table records can be extended, this system can be easily extendable for further searching records from tables. The experimental results on a real database demonstrate that our method results in improvement in terms of retrieval efficiency as compared to previous strategies.","Pending","Electronic:978-1-4577-1539-6; POD:978-1-4577-1538-9","10.1109/ICDIM.2011.6093372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093372","Information Retrieval;Keyword Search;Relational Database","Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Indexing;Keyword search;Relational databases","Internet;information filtering;online front-ends;query languages;relational databases;search engines","Internet;Web;browsing system;customized applications;database table records;filtering;information discovery method;information retrieval systems;keyword matching;keyword searching;query language;relational databases;scoring;search engines;structured databases;traditional database management system","","0","","20","","","26-28 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Comparative Study of the Performance of IR Models on Duplicate Bug Detection","N. Kaushik; L. Tahvildari","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

One of the tasks of a triager is to identify whether an incoming bug report is a duplicate of a pre-existing report. In order to detect duplicate bug reports, a triager either relies on his memory and experience or on the search capabilities of the bug repository. Both these approaches can be time consuming for the triager and may also lead to the misidentification of duplicates. In the literature, several approaches to automate duplicate bug report detection have been proposed. However, there has not been an exhaustive comparison of the performance of different IR models, especially with topic-based ones such as LSI and LDA. In this paper, we compare the performance of the traditional vector space model (using different weighting schemes) with that of topic based models, leveraging heuristics that incorporate exception stack frames, surface features, summary and long description from the free-form text in the bug report. We perform experiments on subsets of bug reports from Eclipse and Firefox and achieve a recall rate of 60% and 58% respectively. We find that word-based models, in particular a Log-Entropy based weighting scheme, outperform topic based ones such as LSI, LDA and Random Projections. Our findings also suggests that for the problem of duplicate bug detection, it is important to consider a project's domain and characteristics to devise a set of heuristics to achieve optimal results.","1534-5351;15345351","Electronic:978-0-7695-4666-7; POD:978-1-4673-0984-4","10.1109/CSMR.2012.78","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6178863","bug;duplicate;information retrieval","Computer bugs;Entropy;Fires;Large scale integration;Software;Synchronization;Vectors","information retrieval;program debugging;public domain software;report generators","Eclipse;Firefox;IR models;LDA;LSI;Log-Entropy based weighting scheme;bug report assignment;bug repository;bug triagers;duplicate bug detection;duplicate bug report detection automation;free-form text;open source projects;random projections;topic based models;vector space model;word-based models","","12","1","20","","","27-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Caching for Location-Aware Image Queries in Mobile Networks","B. Yang; M. Mareboyana","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Bowie State Univ., Bowie, MD, USA","2011 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia","20120109","2011","","","410","415","Caching has been widely used in mobile networks to improve system performance. However, conventional caching methodologies have two major drawbacks in dealing with spatial queries in a dynamic mobile network: (i) the description of cached data is defined based on the query context instead of data content ignoring the spatial or semantic locality of the data. (ii) the description of cached data does not reflect the popularity of the data, making it inefficient in providing QoS-related services. To address these issues, we propose a location-aware caching (LAC) model which reflects the distribution of images based on the analysis of earlier queries. The novelty of our method stems from several factors including: 1) describing the image data distribution based on a Hilbert space-filling curve, 2) optimizing spatial query resolution through efficient exploitation of locally cached data, and 3) reducing the cost of query resolution with restricted search scope. Through extensive simulations, we show that our model can perform spatial search with less cost. In addition, it is scalable to large environments and voluminous data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4589-9; POD:978-1-4577-2015-4","10.1109/ISM.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123381","caching;information retrieval;mobile networks","Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Semantics;Servers;Spatial resolution;Time factors;Vectors","Hilbert spaces;cache storage;image resolution;image retrieval;mobile computing;quality of service","Hilbert space-filling curve;QoS-related services;location-aware caching;location-aware image queries;mobile networks;query context;query resolution;spatial queries","","1","","12","","","5-7 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A major drawback of such an approach is that whenever a new extraction goal emerges or a module is improved, extraction has to be reapplied from scratch to the entire text corpus even though only a small part of the corpus might be affected. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for information extraction in which extraction needs are expressed in the form of database queries, which are evaluated and optimized by database systems. Using database queries for information extraction enables generic extraction and minimizes reprocessing of data by performing incremental extraction to identify which part of the data is affected by the change of components or goals. Furthermore, our approach provides automated query generation components so that casual users do not have to learn the query language in order to perform extraction. To demonstrate the feasibility of our incremental extraction approach, we performed experiments to highlight two important aspects of an information extraction system: efficiency and quality of extraction results. Our experiments show that in the event of deployment of a new module, our incremental extraction approach reduces the processing time by 89.64 percent as compared to a traditional pipeline approach. By applying our methods to a corpus of 17 million biomedical abstracts, our experiments show that the query performance is efficient for real-time applications. Our experiments also revealed that our approach achieves high quality extraction results.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611526","Text mining;information storage and retrieval.;query languages","Data mining;Database languages;Information retrieval;Information storage;Query processing;Text mining","information retrieval;query languages;relational databases;text analysis","automated query generation components;database queries;generic extraction;incremental information extraction;query language;relational databases;special-purpose processing modules;text corpus","","11","1","43","","20101028","Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently there is no way to tell when a query leads to poor results for IR-based concept location, unless a considerable effort is put into analyzing the results after the fact.

They may search for documents or for data available in the web. In the former situation, the documents are ranked using different techniques to list the relevant documents in the beginning from the huge amount of documents retrieved that contain more irrelevant documents. But in the later case, all the data retrieved are not just relevant to the query but they are all the correct answers to the given query. And there are situations where we cannot order the retrieved tuples using the regular sorting technique. Normally a database query will fetch more tuples and it is not possible to display the whole query result set in one single screen. Even though the users are interested in only few tuples, we cannot reduce the result set unless the query is too selective and user preferences are known. This paper proposes an Abstract Information Model to display only the abstract information of the result set in a single screen instead of showing the actual tuples. And also the users can refine their search so that they can find the required result set in minimum number of steps.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1583-9; POD:978-1-4577-1580-8","10.1109/ICCCI.2012.6158823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158823","data mining;database information retrieval;decision support system;machine learning;ranking query results","Cities and towns;Computational modeling;Computers;Databases;Image color analysis;Informatics;Vehicles","Internet;document handling;query processing","Internet;Web documents;abstract information model;communication systems;database query result presentation;regular sorting technique","","0","","9","","","10-12 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of information retrieval based techniques used to filter domain concepts and relations from the implementation details, so as to obtain a smaller, more informative domain ontology.

In this paper, we address these difficulties by proposing a regularization-based algorithm called ranking adaptation SVM (RA-SVM), through which we can adapt an existing ranking model to a new domain, so that the amount of labeled data and the training cost is reduced while the performance is still guaranteed. Our algorithm only requires the prediction from the existing ranking models, rather than their internal representations or the data from auxiliary domains. In addition, we assume that documents similar in the domain-specific feature space should have consistent rankings, and add some constraints to control the margin and slack variables of RA-SVM adaptively. Finally, ranking adaptability measurement is proposed to quantitatively estimate if an existing ranking model can be adapted to a new domain. Experiments performed over Letor and two large scale data sets crawled from a commercial search engine demonstrate the applicabilities of the proposed ranking adaptation algorithms and the ranking adaptability measurement.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677513","Information retrieval;domain adaptation.;learning to rank;support vector machines","Adaptation model;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Search engines;Support vector machines;Training","data handling;information retrieval;support vector machines","Letor;domain-specific feature space;domain-specific search;information retrieval;labeled data;ranking adaptability measurement;ranking adaptation SVM;ranking model adaptation;regularization-based algorithm;vertical search domain","","13","","32","","20101230","April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we assess this qualitative statement in a quantitative way using common time series models fitted to state-of-the-art music descriptors. These descriptors cover different musical facets and are extracted from a large collection of real audio recordings comprising a variety of musical genres. Our findings show that music descriptor time series exhibit a certain predictability not only for short time intervals, but also for mid-term and relatively long intervals. This fact is observed independently of the descriptor, musical facet and time series model we consider. Moreover, we show that our findings are not only of theoretical relevance but can also have practical impact. To this end we demonstrate that music predictability at relatively long time intervals can be exploited in a real-world application, namely the automatic identification of cover songs (i.e., different renditions or versions of the same musical piece). Importantly, this prediction strategy yields a parameter-free approach for cover song identification that is substantially faster, allows for reduced computational storage and still maintains highly competitive accuracies when compared to state-of-the-art systems.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2162321","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5955095","Acoustic signal analysis;information retrieval;music;prediction methods;time series","Computational modeling;Materials;Predictive models;Timbre;Time series analysis","acoustic signal detection;music","computational storage;cover song detection;music descriptor time series;predictability;qualitative statement","","5","1","54","","20110718","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These protocols are too costly in practice because they invoke complex arithmetic operations for every bit of the database. In this paper, we present pCloud, a distributed system that constitutes the first attempt toward practical cPIR. Our approach assumes a disk-based architecture that retrieves one page with a single query. Using a striping technique, we distribute the database to a number of cooperative peers, and leverage their computational resources to process cPIR queries in parallel. We implemented pCloud on the PlanetLab network, and experimented extensively with several system parameters. Our results indicate that pCloud reduces considerably the query response time compared to the traditional client/server model, and has a very low communication overhead. Additionally, it scales well with an increasing number of peers, achieving a linear speedup.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2010.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611549","Privacy;databases;distributed systems;implementation.;private information retrieval","Computational efficiency;Cryptography;Databases;Distributed computing;Peer to peer computing;Privacy;Protocols;Time factors","client-server systems;database management systems;distributed processing;protocols;query processing","PlanetLab network;cPIR queries;client-server model;complex arithmetic operations;computational private information retrieval protocols;database;disk based architecture;distributed system;pCloud;queried bit;striping technique","","5","","29","","20101028","Jan.-Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It learns from experience and improves its performance with time. The focus is to obtain a user's search intention or requirement from the search query, and then to deliver results accordingly. The user first trains the system according to his search intention, by doing binary classification of the search results. Training is followed by knowledge representation and extraction, and then reasoning and analyzing the new search results to determine their relevance classification. The technique is based on the construction of decision trees.

In practice, the HTML tags are based on the English language and, certainly, the English character set is encoded in the interval [0,127] of the Unicode character set. On the other hand, many languages, such as the Arabic language, use a different interval for their characters. In the first phase of our approach, we apply this distinction for a fast separation of the Non-ASCII from the English characters. After that, we determine some areas of the HTML file with high density of the Non-ASCII character set and low density of the ASCII character set. At the end of this phase, we use this density to identify the areas which contain the main content. Finally, we feed those areas to our parser in order to extract the main content of the Web page. The proposed algorithm, called DANA, exceeds alternative approaches in terms of both, efficiency and effectiveness, and has the potential to be extended also to languages based on ASCII characters.","1529-4188;15294188","Electronic:978-0-7695-4486-1; POD:978-1-4577-0982-1","10.1109/DEXA.2011.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059811","ASCII and Non-ASCII character set;HTML Documents;Information Retrieval;Main Content Extraction;UTF-8","Electronic publishing;Encoding;Encyclopedias;HTML;Internet;Web pages","Internet;hypermedia markup languages;information retrieval;natural languages","Arabic language;DANA;English character set;English language;HTML tags;Web documents;Web page;character encoding;main content extraction;nonASCII;unicode character set","","0","","9","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By introducing Ant Colony Optimization, each peer maintains routing table, which store the amount of pheromone corresponding to classification dropped at the link. Based on the pheromone values, a query is flooded to those peers which are most likely to be resources owner. The update of phenomenon depends on the number of documents found and the link cost in query by all ants' collective cooperation.

Since the resources available for Basque in general, and for this task in particular, were very few, data optimization methodologies had to be applied in various phases of the development. Moreover, the agglutinative nature of Basque required the use of morphemes and other sub-word units. Additionally, some keyword spotting and semantic methods have been also applied in the system in order to retrieve information properly. In most of the cases, the methods employed during this project could suit the requirements of many under-resourced languages, and one of these techniques could be the ontology-based approach.

This requires fast and precise searches over documents. The goal of Information Retrieval (IR) models is to provide users with those documents that will satisfy their information needs. The core of such models is the document representation used in the indexing of documents. Traditional IR models handle the frequency of query terms. The disadvantage of these models is that they exclusively consider terms in the query and ignore similar terms. This paper proposes a topic based indexing approach to represent topics associated to documents. Documents are modeled by using clustering algorithms based on natural language processing. As result of this proposal is a document-topic matrix representation denoting the importance of topics inside documents. In a similar way, each query over documents is converted into a vector of topics. Thus, a similarity measure can be applied over this vector and the matrix of documents to retrieve the most relevant documents.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1013-1; POD:978-1-4577-1011-7","10.1109/ICEEE.2011.6106659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106659","Language technologies for IR;Semantic search;Semi-structured information retrieval","Computational modeling;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Proposals;Semantics;Vectors","document handling;indexing;information needs;matrix algebra;natural language processing;pattern clustering;query formulation;vectors","clustering algorithm;document indexing;document matrix;document querying;document representation;document searching;document-topic matrix representation;information needs;information retrieval model;natural language processing;similarity measure;topic based indexing approach;topics vector","","0","","18","","","26-28 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our novel idea is to integrate the textual chord information provided in the paired chords-lyrics format known from song books and Internet sites into the inference procedure. We propose two novel methods that implement this idea: First, assuming that all chords of a song are known, we extend a hidden Markov model (HMM) framework by including chord changes in the Markov chain and an additional audio feature (chroma) in the emission vector; second, for the more realistic case in which some chord information is missing, we present a method that recovers the missing chord information by exploiting repetition in the song. We conducted experiments with five changing parameters and show that with accuracies of 87.5% and 76.7%, respectively, both methods perform better than the baseline with statistical significance. We introduce the new accompaniment interface Song Prompter, which uses the automatically aligned lyrics to guide musicians through a song. It demonstrates that the automatic alignment is accurate enough to be used in a musical performance.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2159595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5876304","Audio user interfaces;hidden Markov models (HMMs);music;music information retrieval;speech processing","Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Instruments;Internet;Materials;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","audio signal processing;hidden Markov models;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;music;speech processing","HMM;Markov chain;audio thumbnails generation;chord information;emission vector;hidden Markov model;inference procedure;karaoke scores;lyrics-to-audio alignment;mel-frequency cepstral coefficient;phoneme feature;song prompter;song-browsing","","6","","28","","20110616","Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An index of document regions is produced from recursive X-Y trees produced for each page in the corpus. Queries are provided as images of handwritten expressions, for which an X-Y tree is computed. During retrieval, the query is looked up in the document region index using features of its X-Y tree, producing a set of candidate regions. Candidate regions are ranked by the similarity of vertical pixel projections in their upper and lower halves with those of the query image, as computed using Dynamic Time Warping of the image columns.

We address the problem of local key finding by investigating the possible combination and extension of different previously proposed approaches for global key estimation. In this work, key progression is estimated from the chord progression. Specifically, we introduce key dependency on the harmonic and the metrical structures. A contribution of our work is that we address the problem of finding an analysis window length for local key estimation that is adapted to the intrinsic music content of the analyzed piece by introducing information related to the metrical structure in our model. Key estimation is not performed on empirically chosen segments but on segments that are expressed in relationship with the tempo period. We evaluate and analyze our results on two databases of different styles. We systematically analyze the influence of various parameters to determine factors important to our model, we study the relationships between the various musical attributes that are taken into account in our work, and we provide case study examples.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2175385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6074928","Acoustic signal analysis;chord;chroma;downbeat;hidden Markov model (HMM);information retrieval;key;music analysis","Adaptation models;Estimation;Feature extraction;Harmonic analysis;Hidden Markov models;Modulation;Vectors","audio signal processing","audio signal relying;chord progression;global local key estimation;harmonic structures;intrinsic music content;metrical structures;musical key","","5","","46","","20111109","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

First, we implement a prototype system of the focused crawler - a topic-specific news gathering system which is prepared for comparative experiments on different similarity measures with the anchor text. Second, experiments on Chinese text corpus show that using LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing) outperforms using TF-IDF (term frequency- inverse document frequency) for hyperlink topic relevance prediction and pages topic relevance calculation. Third, in real crawling experiments on the prototype system, the crawler using TF-IDF has high performance with the accumulated topic relevance increasing quickly at the beginning of crawling, however the crawler using LSI can find more related pages and tunnel through. Fourth, combining their advantages of LSI and TF-IDF, we propose TFIDF+LSI algorithm to guide the crawling. Last, the crawler using TFIDF+LSI performs the same crawl task and demonstrates the combination advantage of TF-IDF and LSI. The experiment suggests that the crawler's performance using TFIDF+LSI is greatly superior to that using either TF-IDF or LSI respectively.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0653-0; POD:978-1-4577-0652-3","10.1109/ICSMC.2011.6083759","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6083759","Latent Semantic Indexing;Web information retrieval;link prediction;topic relevance;topical crawler","Algorithm design and analysis;Correlation;Crawlers;Large scale integration;Prototypes;Semantics;Vectors","Internet;indexing;information retrieval","Chinese text corpus;focused crawling;latent semantic indexing;term frequency-inverse document frequency;topic relevance algorithm;topic-specific news gathering system","","1","","16","","","9-12 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, the expertise of other users plays an important role when it comes to ensuring the quality of recommendations that arise from their actions. The reputation of these users is important in collaborative and social search tasks, much as relevance is vital in conventional web search.

Systems which could automatically summarize these opinions would be immensely useful for those who wish to use this information to make decisions. The previous work in automatic summarization has completely focused on extractive summarization, in which key sentences are identified from the source text and extracted to form the output. An alternative solution is abstractive summarization in which the information from the source text is first extracted into the form of abstract data which is then post processed to infer the most important message from the original text. This work is built upon past work of extractive summarization methods to create abstractive summaries by creating new sentences in it. This paper conveys the methodology for the abstractive summarization process and its evaluation considering Telugu, a south Indian regional language, as the language of study.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-729-0; POD:978-1-4799-1689-4","10.1109/NLPKE.2011.6138217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6138217","Automatic text summarization;Extractive and abstractive summarization;Information retrieval;Stemming;Word count frequency","Conferences;Data mining;Natural language processing;Speech;Tagging","Internet;Web sites;information retrieval;natural language processing;text analysis","Internet;Telugu;abstract data;abstractive text summarization;blog;extractive summarization;forum discussion;information extraction;key sentence identification;opinion source;opinion summarization;product user review;source text;south Indian regional language","","2","","9","","","27-29 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present two contributions towards trend monitoring over Face book public posts. We propose and evaluate a system for trend detection based on the characteristics of the posts shared on Face book. Based on our results we propose three categories of trending topics: 'disruptive events', 'popular topics' and 'daily routines'. We analyze and compare the characteristics of the proposed categories in terms of distribution and information diffusion in order to increase the understanding of emerging trends on Face book.

Here we find the concepts that user specify in their query by analyzing the semantic equivalencies. The result which is a set of alternate queries to the main search query is then compared with the existing keyword based system's result. Then, according to the alternate queries' search results, the main queries result gets rearranged by assigning new weights. We further personalize the search and then re-rank the results on user preference. The proposed semantic retrieval model is combined with keyword based model to achieve completeness of the knowledge base.

Mamalis","University of Piraeus, Piraeus","IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","20120403","2012","23","5","809","817","A large class of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) applications involve a set of isolated urban areas (e.g., urban parks or building blocks) covered by sensor nodes (SNs) monitoring environmental parameters. Mobile sinks (MSs) mounted upon urban vehicles with fixed trajectories (e.g., buses) provide the ideal infrastructure to effectively retrieve sensory data from such isolated WSN fields. Existing approaches involve either single-hop transfer of data from SNs that lie within the MS's range or heavy involvement of network periphery nodes in data retrieval, processing, buffering, and delivering tasks. These nodes run the risk of rapid energy exhaustion resulting in loss of network connectivity and decreased network lifetime. Our proposed protocol aims at minimizing the overall network overhead and energy expenditure associated with the multihop data retrieval process while also ensuring balanced energy consumption among SNs and prolonged network lifetime. This is achieved through building cluster structures consisted of member nodes that route their measured data to their assigned cluster head (CH). CHs perform data filtering upon raw data exploiting potential spatial-temporal data redundancy and forward the filtered information to appropriate end nodes with sufficient residual energy, located in proximity to the MS's trajectory. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach against as well as its performance gain over alternative methods.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2011.237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6030870","Mobile sinks;clustering;information retrieval;rendezvous nodes.;sensor islands;wireless sensor networks","Clustering algorithms;Energy consumption;Mobile communication;Protocols;Robot sensing systems;Trajectory;Wireless sensor networks","information retrieval;mobile radio;protocols;wireless sensor networks","WSN;balanced energy consumption;buffering;building block;cluster head;cluster structure;data filtering;data processing;delivering task;energy exhaustion;energy expenditure;energy-efficient sensory data collection;environmental parameter monitoring;isolated urban area;mobile sinks;multihop data retrieval process;network connectivity;network lifetime;network overhead;network periphery node;protocol;rendezvous-based approach;sensor node;single-hop transfer;spatial-temporal data redundancy;urban park;urban vehicle;wireless sensor network","","47","","34","","20110929","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This involves improvements at query level and result display level. Personalized retrieval widens the notion of information need to comprise implicit user needs, not directly conveyed by the user in terms of explicit information requests. This can be achieved by expanding the user query and processing the results according to the user needs. Individual pages are retrieved by the traditional IR systems even though the information is spread across multiple pages. Instead composed pages are generated which contains all the query words. Ranking of retrieved pages can be improved by providing composed pages for the given query. As Agents can provide autonomous functioning, they can be used in the design of query expansion, searching and ranking of documents.

A lot remains to be leveraged in engineering computer-based systems for assisting humans via cognitive and performance aids. The performance of knowledge-intensive tasks (simply, knowledge-work) involves complex and dynamic interactions between human cognition and multiple sources of information. For achieving efficient healthcare for patients, a knowledge work Support System focused in the biomedical domain needs complete access to domain information in order to offer correct and precise data to a knowledge worker. The collection of this data and their interrelationships can be automated by gleaning the necessary knowledge from Linked Open Data (LOD) sets available on the Internet. Because LOD sets are interlinked, populating a KwSSs knowledge base with their informational content allows the system to store the relationships among various biomedical concepts, thereby making it a more active consumer of knowledge and improving its ability to aid in any given setting. This paper explores the utility and completion of LOD sets for a KwSS focused on the biomedical domain. In particular, two types of LOD sets are examined: domain-specific (e.g. Dailymed, DrugBank) and general-context (e.g. DBpedia, WordNet). More specifically, this paper investigates the structure of the available data, the extent to which such interlinked data can provide the knowledge content necessary for fulfilling tasks and activities performed in the biomedical domain (e.g. the patient-doctor setting), and how an individual can potentially access this data.","2325-940X;2325940X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1109-1; POD:978-1-4577-1110-7","10.1109/INDCON.2011.6139343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6139343","DBpedia;Dailymed;DrugBank;KwSS;Linked Open Data (LOD);WordNet;biomedical;information annotation;information retrieval;interlinking;knowledge work;medicine","Databases;Diseases;Drugs;Genetics;Physiology;Resource description framework","Internet;health care;knowledge based systems","Internet;biomedical concepts;biomedical linked open data;complex knowledge;engineering computer-based systems;healthcare knowledge systems;informational content;knowledge intensive tasks;knowledge work Support System;linked open data","","0","","10","","","16-18 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
