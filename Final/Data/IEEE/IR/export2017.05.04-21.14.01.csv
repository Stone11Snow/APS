This model uses name-based matching method as a SP finds the contents in directory server. The existing SP based P2P information retrieval method simply depends on queries of requester and content's name shared by peers, however, there is a limit to provide exact matching between query and content's name due to the inaccuracy in the content's name or keyword in the request. In this study, we propose an ISP2P (intelligent super-peer based P2P system) using presented category-based content similarity matching algorithm. The proposed system can solve the problem incurred due to the discrepancy between names of contents.

The mean shift segmentation algorithm, a robust clustering technique based on color is used to extract region of interest, thereby improving the quality of image retrieval. The region feature attribute is computed at the time of ingest into the database. The cluster (region) mode (color value) is used as representative of image in 3-D color space. To efficiently retrieve the images from database cluster-based R *-Tree indexing method is proposed. Here only representative features of clusters are used for indexing, thus reducing the time. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method is compared with R *-Tree and sequential search. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method.

First of all, net short wave radiation was computed with an improved algorithm for atmospheric correction based on dark object scheme associated with topographic information of the target site to account for the topographic affect on radiant regimes, and then a thermal radiant transfer model for accurate estimation of net long wave radiation over mountainous region by using surface temperature derived from the extended mono-window algorithm to integrate with surface energy balance equations was established. The thermal radiation from surrounding surface thus can be estimated, and atmospheric downward long wave radiation was calculated by means of an empirical formula related to surface temperature. With these two terms, Pixel based surface net radiation can be obtained. An evident advantage of this model is that only two atmospheric parameters, i.e. atmospheric mean effective temperature and surface temperature, are needed. The proposed approach was experimentally applied to a mountainous region located in the Hanjiang Basin, south western China. 6S code was utilized to the Landsat ETM+ image acquired over the region to simulate the surface and atmospheric radiative parameters under different geographic zones at selected climatic conditions to examine the performance of the proposed model. It was suggested that the maximum error in albedo extraction by the proposed algorithm is about 17% with mean error less than 10%, the maximum error in retrieved short wave net radiation and long wave net radiation is about 15% and 12% with mean error less than about 11% and 9% respectively, which suggested the proposed approach an valid and operational mean in quantitative reversion of surface long wave radiation with satisfied accuracy.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423140","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423140","Mono-window algorithm;Mountainous thermal radiant transfer model;Net long-wave radiation;Net short wave radiation","Atmospheric modeling;Atmospheric waves;Equations;Information retrieval;Land surface;Land surface temperature;Remote sensing;Satellites;Surface topography;Surface waves","data acquisition;heat transfer;land surface temperature;terrain mapping","Hanjiang Basin;Landsat TM/ETM+ data;albedo extraction;atmospheric correction;atmospheric mean effective temperature;dark object scheme;land surface net long-wave radiation retrieval;land surface temperature;monowindow algorithm;mountainous area;south western China;surface energy balance equations;thermal radiant transfer model;topographic information","","0","","23","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents the preliminary demonstration of the network-based retrieval using data from the first Integration Project (IP1) radar network in Oklahoma. Electromagnetic waves backscattered from a common volume in a networked radar system are attenuated differently along the different paths. The CASA networked-retrieval method is based on a set of governing integral equations describing the backscatter and propagation of common volume with constraints of total path attenuation. The method has been implemented in a multiprocessor environment, which operate simultaneously and collaboratively to meet the real time requirement of CASA. The performance of the implemented retrieval algorithm such as computation requirement will be presented. Comparison of the CASA networked retrieval is made against the conventional attenuation correction based on the principle of coupling the specific attenuation, differential propagation phase and reflectivity.

These applications include data mining (identifying a ""pattern"", e.g., correlation, or an outlier in millions of multidimensional patterns), document classifications (efficiently searching text documents), organization and retrieval of multimedia database, and biometrics (personal identifications based on various physical attributes such as face and fingerprints). The three best known conventional approaches for pattern recognition are: template matching, statistical classification and syntactic or structural matching. The limitations and constraints of these conventional approaches have made researchers to look for alternate techniques based on Artificial Neural Networks. The main characteristics of neural networks are that they have the ability to learn complex nonlinear input-output relationship, use sequential training procedures, and adapt themselves to the data. In this paper, we discuss implementation and fault tolerance analysis of the most commonly used family of neural networks for pattern classification tasks i.e., the feed forward network, which includes a fully interconnected three layered [25-10-1] perceptron. The delta rule weight adjustment is implemented by taking the gradient of error function, which gives the direction in which weights have to be adjusted to get error value within the predefined threshold. Fault tolerance analysis is done for Gaussian and Uniform distribution of weights.

The trajectory of the oil seep, driven by sea surface winds and ocean currents, can sometimes impinge on the environmentally sensitive Mexican coast. For this reason it is necessary for the implementation of slick impact models to determine and track oil slick behaviour on sea surface as an aid to contingency planning. The focus of this study was to improve the confidence of the Cantarell natural seep impact model by utilizing SAR derived ocean surface wind field data and in situ meteo-oceanographic buoy data. The advantage of the SAR wind is that the data provides high resolution, wide-area coverage, up to 500 km by 500 km in the case of RADARSAT-1. The accuracies are +/- 2 m/s for wind speed and +/- 25deg for wind direction. The buoy is stationary and only provides wind data for that location but the instruments are more sensitive and provide higher accuracies than the SAR. The buoy information is recorded in one-minute intervals, transmitted to shore by microwave communication and the accuracies are +/- 0.7 m/s for wind speed and +/-3deg for wind direction. Our approach was to combine the two data sources to provide better coverage and accuracy for oil slick modeling.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423539","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423539","SAR images;oil slick;slick impact models","Business;Computed tomography;Information retrieval;Oceans;Petroleum;Radar measurements;Radar tracking;Remote monitoring;Sea surface;Wind speed","marine pollution;meteorology;oceanographic techniques;oil pollution;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar;wind","Cantarell natural seep;RADARSAT-1;SAR;contingency planning;meteo-oceanographic buoy data;microwave communication;ocean currents;ocean surface wind field;oil seep;oil slick impact model;southern Gulf of Mexico;wind direction;wind speed","","1","","7","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two main problems in applying some machine learning techniques for Web mining are the dynamic and ever-changing nature of Web data and the sheer size of possible dimensions that this data could portray. One such technique, self-organizing maps (SOMs), have been enhanced to deal with these two problems individually. The growing hierarchical self-organizing map can adapt to the dynamic data present on the Web by changing its topology according to the amount of change in input size. In addition, it reduces local dimensionality by splitting features into levels. We extend this model by including bidirectional update propagation over the levels of the hierarchy.

We introduce a modular approach to incorporating feedback information into given retrieval architectures. We propose to fusion the original ranking with those returned by rerankers, each of which trained on feedback given for a distinct, single query. Here, we examine the basic case of improving a query's original ranking qtest by only using one reranker: the one trained on feedback on the ""closest"" query qtrain. We examine the use of various distance measures between queries to first identify qtrain and then determine the best linear combination of the original and the reranker's ratings, that is: to find out which feedback to learn from, and how strongly to use it. We show the cosine distance between the term vectors of the two queries, each enriched by representations of the top N originally returned documents, to reliably answer both questions. The fusion performs equally well or better than a) always using only the original ranker or the reranker, b) selecting a hard distance threshold to decide between the two, or c) fusioning results with a ratio that is globally optimized, but fixed across all tested queries.","","POD:0-7695-3026-5","10.1109/WI.2007.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427160","","Extraterrestrial measurements;Feedback;Frequency estimation;Humans;Information processing;Information retrieval;Neurofeedback;Performance evaluation;Support vector machines;Testing","","","","0","","25","","","2-5 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we address the text clustering problem via a novel strategy, called Pairwise Constraintsguided Non-negative Matrix Factorization (PCNMF for short). Differing from the traditional NMF method, the proposed method can capture the available abundance prior constraints in original space, which result in more effective for clustering or information retrieval. Therefore, PCNMF enforces the discriminative capability in the reduced space. Utilizing the appropriate transformation, PCNMF represents as a new optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by an iterative approach. The cluster membership of each document can be easily determined as the standard NMF.

Using concept forests to represent the semantics of text documents, the semantic similarities of these documents are then measured as the commonalities of their concept forests. Performance studies of text document clustering based on different document similarity measurement methods show that the CF-based similarity measurement is an effective alternative to the existing keywords-based methods. In particular, this CFbased approach has obvious advantages over the existing keywords-based methods, including LSI, in processing short text documents or in P2P or live news environments where it is impractical to collect the entire document corpus for analysis.","","POD:0-7695-3026-5","10.1109/WI.2007.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427122","","Feeds;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Large scale integration;Natural languages;Ontologies;Text analysis;Text mining;USA Councils","","","","14","","24","","","2-5 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Kamel","","Web Intelligence, IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on","20080107","2007","","","26","32","Most of the common techniques in text retrieval are based on the statistical analysis of a term either as a word or a phrase. Statistical analysis of a term frequency captures the importance of the term within a document only. Thus, to achieve a more accurate analysis, the underlying representation should indicate terms that capture the semantics of text. In this case, the representation can capture terms that present the concepts of the sentence, which leads to discover the topic of the document. A new concept-based representation, called Conceptual Ontological Graph (COG), where a concept can be either a word or a phrase and totally dependent on the sentence semantics, is introduced. The aim of the proposed representation is to extract the most important terms in a sentence and a document with respect to the meaning of the text. The COG representation analyzes each term at both the sentence and the document levels. This is different from the classical approach of analyzing terms at the document level. First, the proposed representation denotes the terms which contribute to the sentence semantics. Then, each term is chosen based on its position within the COG representation. Lastly, the selected terms are associated to their documents as features for the purpose of indexing before text retrieval. The COG representation can effectively discriminate between non-important terms with respect to sentence semantics and terms which hold the key concepts that represent the sentence meaning. Large sets of experiments using the proposed COG representation on different datasets in text retrieval are conducted. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial enhancement of the text retrieval quality using the COG representation over the traditional techniques. The evaluation of results relies on two quality measures, the bpref and P(10). Both the quality measures improved when the newly developed COG representation is used to enhance the quality of the text retrieval results.","","POD:0-7695-3026-5","10.1109/WI.2007.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427062","","Data mining;Frequency;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Ontologies;Search engines;Statistical analysis","","","","6","","19","","","2-5 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MSG FAPAR products present a reliable spatial and temporal distribution of retrievals. The inter-comparison of the MSG FAPAR product with different operational products shows the large existing differences among FAPAR products. However, the best consistency is found between MSG and MERIS (only July 2006 was evaluated) or between MSG and CYCLOPES (available only for 2003).

This paper proposes the method to retrieve images based on dominant colors in the foreground image. The foreground of the image only gives semantics compared to the background of the image.

The constant increase in the amount of data to treat issued from satellites images, has made automatic content extraction and retrieval highly desired goals for effective and efficient processing of remotely sensed imagery. One of the main difficulties of these applications is the knowledge representation of objects, scene and interpretation strategy. In this paper, we present an integrated hierarchical approach based on the use of a hierarchical blackboard architecture and multi-agent system in order to increase the degree of semi-automatic interpretation of remotely sensed images. This hierarchical architecture is motivated in order to avoid the bottleneck caused by the growing number of the knowledge sources on a single blackboard, reduce the information complexity and complex tasks and increase the system efficiency whenever the information is distributed over several blackboard levels. In this paper, a stage of image analysis has been examined in order to establish the viability of MAS and hierarchical blackboard architecture for change detection.

To improve image annotation, we propose a hybrid Web image annotation model (HIAM) consisting of two basic submodules, HMIAM and IARM. The former, based on hidden Markov model, associates an image with some keywords like other traditional models, while the latter utilizes textual information in Web documents to evaluate each keyword's importance to image semantics: each keyword is associated with certain weight to quantify its similarity to image semantics. Then keywords with low weight can be removed as noisy data.

The sensitivity of active and passive microwave remote sensing data to surface soil moisture content has been investigated in numerous studies. Recent satellite borne mission concepts, as e.g. the SMOS mission, are dedicated to provide global soil moisture information with a temporal frequency of 1-3 days to capture the high temporal dynamics of surface soil moisture. Passive satellite microwave sensors have spatial resolutions in the order of tens of kilometres. The paper investigates the impact of land surface heterogeneity on soil moisture retrievals from L-band passive microwave data at different spatial scales between 1 km and 40 km. The impact of sensor noise and quality of ancillary information is explicitly considered. A synthetic study is conducted where brightness temperature observations are generated using simulated land surface conditions.

The color moments and moments on Gabor filter responses of these tiles serve as local descriptors of color and texture respectively. This local information is captured for two resolutions and two grid layouts that provide different details of the same image. An integrated matching scheme, based on most similar highest priority (MSHP) principle and the adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph formed using the tiles of query and target image, is provided for matching the images. Shape information is captured in terms of edge images computed using gradient vector flow fields. Invariant moments are then used to record the shape features.

"A Metadata Augmentation for Semantic and Context-Based Retrieval of Digital Cultural Objects","B. Pham; R.

The main problem arises from the disconnection between the content-based indexing approach used by computer scientists and the description-based approach used by information scientists. There is also a lack of representational schemes that allow the alignment of the semantics and context with keywords and low-level features that can be automatically extracted from the content of these cultural objects. This paper presents an integrated approach to address these problems, taking advantage of both computer science and information science approaches. The focus is on the rationale and conceptual design of the system and its various components. In particular, we discuss techniques for augmenting commonly used metadata with visual features and domain knowledge to generate high-level abstract metadata which in turn can be used for semantic and context-based indexing and retrieval.

Much effort, mainly classified into syntactic and semantic approaches, has been given to make the current Web service discovery more precise and efficient. Semantic approach for Web services utilizes predefined concepts and relationships among their concepts to promise intelligent discovery. However, we believe that current semantic approaches are not mature yet and they also should be on a syntactic foundation as well. Nevertheless, syntactic-based discovery still has limitation on their efficiency, e.g. a registry approach has limitation on their query capability and query scope. In addition, registry enhancements and other syntactic studies based on IR techniques also have problems to measure similarity among structured service descriptions. In this paper, we propose a method to maximize the efficiency of syntactic-based service discovery. Our approach is for developing an efficient information retrieval technique for Web services on an off-the-shelf DBMS. It also has a feature to rank service similarity with their distinctive properties, which have not been carefully considered so far.","","POD:0-7695-3038-9","10.1109/ICCIT.2007.303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4420599","","Distributed computing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Ontologies;Pattern matching;Process planning;Testing;Web pages;Web services;World Wide Web","Web services;data mining;database management systems;electronic commerce;query processing","Web service retrieval;business process;information retrieval;intelligent discovery;off-the-shelf DBMS;registry enhancements;service discovery;syntactic-based discovery","","2","","26","","","21-23 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method for measuring semantic similarity, an important type of semantic relationship, between entities. The method is based on Google Directory, a search interface to the Open Directory Project. Via the search engine, we can locate the web pages relevant to an entity and automatically create a profile of the entity according to the directory assignments of its web pages, which capture various features of the entity. Using their profiles, the semantic similarity between entities can be measured in different dimensions. We apply the semantic similarity measurement to two knowledge acquisition tasks: thesaurus construction of entities and fine grained categorization of entities. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method works effectively in these two tasks.","","POD:0-7695-3026-5","10.1109/WI.2007.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4427135","","Humans;Information retrieval;Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge management;Particle measurements;Search engines;Thesauri;USA Councils;Web pages","","","","6","","6","","","2-5 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first phase of the proposed scheme, an information filter that based on user search intents was incorporated in Web search process to quickly filter out irrelevant data. In the second data processing phase, a pattern taxonomy model (PTM) was carried out using the reduced data.

Additional information such as cloud cover and air temperature were added to the process to reduce misidentified snowfall pixels. Two products retrieved from AMSU brightness temperatures were used to estimate surface temperature and to map the snow cover extent. In this project, a neural-network-based model has been developed and has shown a great potential in detecting and estimating the intensity of snowfall events. This algorithm has been applied for different snow storms occurred between 2002 and 2003 in three different locations in the North-East of United States. These locations were selected because of the high amount of snowfall every year. Only pixels with cloud cover and falling within a specific range of temperature are presented to the snowfall detection model. Surface temperature collected from ground station-based observations archived by the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) were used for this test. Different heavy storm events and non-snowfall observations that occurred at the same time as AMSU acquisition were selected. Hourly snow accumulation data collected by the NCDC were used as truth data to train and validate the model. To reduce the risk of erroneous identification of snowfall pixels, only storms lasting more than three hours were selected. Such criteria will undoubtedly increase the level of confidence that snowfall coincides with AMSU acquisition time. The neural network based snowfall product was compared with the snowfall detection algorithm over land developed in 2003 by Kongoli et al [1]. The preliminary results indicate that the neural-network-based model provides a significant improvement in snowfall detection accuracy over existing satellite-based methods.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423295","","Atmospheric measurements;Brightness temperature;Clouds;Event detection;Information retrieval;Land surface temperature;Microwave measurements;Neural networks;Snow;Storms","artificial satellites;atmospheric techniques;geophysics computing;hydrological techniques;land surface temperature;neural nets;radiometry;remote sensing;snow;storms","AD 2002 to 2003;AMSU brightness temperatures;NCDC;National Climatic Data Center;atmospheric condition retrieval accuracy effects;land cover retrieval accuracy effects;land surface temperature;multispectral snowfall detection;multispectral snowfall estimation;neural network;north-east United States;passive microwave data;snow accumulation data;snowfall event detection;snowfall event intensity measurement","","0","","7","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In an effort to determine the amount of user corrected transcripts needed to impact automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio search, a web-based online interface for verification of ASR-generated transcripts was developed. The procedure for enhancing the transcription performance for SpeechFind is also presented. A selection of adaptation methods for language and acoustic models are employed depending on the acoustics of the corpora under test. Experimental results on the CDP corpus demonstrate that the employed model adaptation scheme using the verified transcripts is effective in improving recognition accuracy. Through a combination of feature/acoustic model enhancement and language model selection, up to 24.8% relative improvement in ASR was obtained.

The parameters involved in the training of the BP neural network for inversion of air temperature can be subdivided into six groups, each was used to represent different data sources for testing the sensitivity of these variables on the near-surface air temperature retrieved. These parameters are remotely sensed albedo, NDVI, layered meteorological data of station observed daily mean, maximum and minimum are temperature provided by GIS as well as the DEM of the study site. Five criterions, namely Mean Error (ME), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Relative Error (MRE) and correlation coefficient (R2) were utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing the retrieved and the observed air temperature quantitatively. Systematic analyses suggested that the satisfied retrieval of daily mean and maximum near-surface air temperature can be achieved with MRE of 3.02% and 2.23% and RMSE of 0.93 and 0.9 respectively. However, only when all the parameters including daily mean and maximum near- surface air temperature were used for training the BP neural network, the daily minimum air temperature could be retrieved with the best MRE of 8.31%. From this study, it can be concluded that the BP neural network integrating with surface meteorological observations might be a promising approach for retrieving near-surface air temperature with reliable accuracy.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423146","Air Temperature;BP Neural Network;GIS;Remote Sensing;the Upstream Basin of Hanjiang River","Geographic Information Systems;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Meteorology;Neural networks;Remote sensing;Rivers;Satellites;Temperature sensors;Testing","atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;geographic information systems;inverse problems;neural nets;remote sensing;rivers","China;GIS;Hanjiang River Basin;Landsat enhanced thematic mapper plus;air temperature inversion;landsat ETM+ imagery;near surface air temperature;neural network algorithm;remotely sensing","","2","","12","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Medical image databases contain lot of textual or semantic information. This paper presents an approach by combining low level content features and high level semantic features to perform retrieval on medical image databases. The semantic information is extracted from DICOM header which is used to perform the initial search and images are retrieved. This pre-filtering of the images reduces the number of images to be searched. Content-based retrieval is performed only to the pre filtered imagedatabase which speeds up the retrieval process. Retrieval is performed by extracting shape and texture features. Experimental result shows that by combining the high level semantics (DICOM features) and low level content features (shape and texture) the retrieval time is reduced and the performance of medical image retrieval is increased.","","POD:0-7695-3050-8","10.1109/ICCIMA.2007.427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4426646","CBIR;DICOM;Gabor wavelet;medical images","Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;DICOM;Data mining;Hospitals;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging;Shape","","","","3","1","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In comparison to the deterministic choice of the backup node, the random selection strategy makes it virtually impossible for an attacker to determine and destroy the exact node keeping a particular piece of information. The usage of Bloom filters in the information search engine makes the navigation to a specific data fast and efficient.

The performance of inverted index, fundamentally, depends upon the searching of keyword in the list maintained by search engines. This paper presents a new technique for keyword searching. It uses a trie data structure to index the keyword up to a certain optimum level. While searching a keyword, this index is used to get two offset values, in constant amount of time for every keyword, within which the keyword might lie. Using the two offsets, a binary search is initiated to locate the keyword in the list, and hence the Web pages containing the keyword. Research shows that subsequently increasing the levels of trie will increase the performance of retrieval but also increase the required memory. It also shows that on an average with indexing up to level 2 requires 56% less number of comparisons, as required by binary search, to search a keyword in the list.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1841-1; POD:978-1-4244-1840-4","10.1109/IIT.2007.4430467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4430467","","Crawlers;Data mining;Data structures;Indexing;Information retrieval;Internet;Keyword search;Organizing;Search engines;Web pages","indexing;search engines","Web pages;binary search;inverted indexing technique;keyword searching algorithm;search engines","","0","","15","","","18-20 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To improve our understanding of such interactions, the acquisition of highly detailed information about the 3D architecture of individual plants and communities of plants is required. Recently, Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, both at the ground and the airborne-level, have emerged as useful tools for mapping 3D plant structure. One such ground-based instrument is the Intelligent Laser Ranging and Imaging System (ILRIS 3D), which was developed at Optech Incorporated. This laser scanner, generates a 3D digital reconstruction of any scene, by actively emitting laser pulses and recording the time elapsed for the return of a pulse, thereby measuring the distance of any given object. It is the objective of this research to utilize the ILRIS 3D to measure structural, and biophysical information of individual trees for use as direct inputs into complex radiative transfer models. The key parameters under investigation are crown dimensions (i.e. shape, area, and volume), crown-level gap fraction (GF) and crown- level leaf area index (LAI). The ILRIS 3D was used to acquire 3D point clouds of an artificial 6' Ficus tree, in a controlled laboratory environment. Measured XYZ point cloud data was segmented to retrieve laser pulse return density profiles, which subsequently were used to estimate gap fraction and LAI . Gap fraction estimates were cross-validated with traditional methods of histogram thresholding of digital photographs (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.96). Crown LAI estimates were compared with the actual values (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.95, RMSE = 0.45). The next challenge was to implement the developed algorithms to real crowns, namely olive (Olea europaea L.) orchards in southern Spain. Individual tree-level ILRIS 3D data was collected from 24 structural- y diverse crowns. Crown dimensional profiles were extracted for ILRIS data that was collected from a horizontal view (i.e ground-based) and a nadir view (i.e from platform 12 meters above ground). Preliminary retrievals from the olive orchards dataset is described here, while current ongoing field measurements are being conducted to validate the findings. Successful demonstration of extracting crown-level structural parameters like gap fraction and LAI from ground-based LiDAR will be important new information that can be used for detailed radiative transfer modeling in olive orchards and likely lead to more robust inversion algorithms.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423432","","Clouds;Data mining;Image reconstruction;Information retrieval;Instruments;Intelligent sensors;Laser radar;Optical materials;Optical pulse generation;Pulse measurements","measurement by laser beam;optical scanners;radiative transfer;vegetation;vegetation mapping","3D digital reconstruction;3D plant structure mapping;3D point cloud;Ficus tree;ILRIS 3D system;Intelligent Laser Ranging and Imaging System;Olea europaea L;above-ground plant material;biophysical information;crown dimension;crown- level leaf area index;crown-level gap fraction;evapotranspiration;ground-based scanning laser data;laser pulse return density profile;laser scanner;olive orchard;photosynthesis;photovegetation interaction;plant functional activities;radiative transfer model;spatial organization;tree crown property extraction","","2","","5","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm is implemented in three sequential stages: 1) stochastic cloud clearing (SCC), 2) eigenvector radiance compression and denoising, and 3) neural network (NN) estimation. First, the infrared radiance perturbations due to clouds are estimated and corrected by combined processing of the infrared and microwave data. Second, a Projected Principal Components (PPC) transform is used to reduce the dimensionality of and optimally extract geophysical profile information from the cloud-cleared infrared radiance data. Third, a feedforward neural network is used to estimate the desired geophysical parameters from the projected principal components. The performance of the algorithm (henceforth referred to as SCC/NN) was evaluated using global (ascending and descending) EOS-Aqua orbits co-located with ECMWF forecasts (generated every three hours on a 0.5-degree lat/lon grid) and radiosonde observations (RAOBs) for a variety of days throughout 2003 and 2004. Over 500,000 fields of regard (3times3 arrays of footprints) over ocean and land were used in the study. The performance of the SCC/NN algorithm exceeded that of the AIRS Level 2 (Version 4) algorithm throughout most of the troposphere while achieving approximately four times the yield. Furthermore, the SCC/NN performance in the lowest 1 km of the atmosphere greatly exceeds that of the AIRS Level 2 algorithm as the level of cloudiness increases. The SCC/NN algorithm requires significantly less computation than traditional variational retrieval metho- ds while achieving comparable performance, thus the algorithm is particularly suitable for quick-look retrieval generation for post-launch CrIMSS performance validation.","2153-6996;21536996","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1212-9; POD:978-1-4244-1211-2","10.1109/IGARSS.2007.4423428","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4423428","","Clouds;Hyperspectral imaging;Information retrieval;Microwave technology;Microwave theory and techniques;Moisture;Neural networks;Noise reduction;Ocean temperature;Stochastic processes","atmospheric humidity;atmospheric techniques;atmospheric temperature;clouds;geophysical signal processing;neural nets;nonlinear estimation;principal component analysis;remote sensing;stochastic processes","AIRS;AMSU;ATMS;Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit;Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder;Atmospheric Infrared Sounder;CrIMSS;CrIS;NPOESS Crosstrack Infrared Microwave Sounding Suite;PPC transform;SCC-NN algorithm;atmospheric moisture profiles;atmospheric temperature profiles;clouds;dimensionality reduction;eigenvector radiance compression;eigenvector radiance denoising;feedforward neural network;hyperspectral crosstrack infrared sounder;hyperspectral infrared observations;infrared data processing;microwave data processing;microwave observations;neural network estimation;nonlinear stochastic methods;parameter estimation;projected principal component transform;sounding data;stochastic cloud clearing","","1","","12","","","23-28 July 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose heuristics to bias document showing in order to take good learning performance and good retrieval performance of relevance feedback. This paper introduces two evaluation crietria. One criterion measures the learning performance and the other measures the retrieval performance. We compared a SVM-based system with our heuristic with conventional systems like Rocchio-based system and a SVM-based system without our heuristic by the introduced crietria.

This paper addressed the issue how the SYNTAM method is applied to the national wide MODIS data for retrieval of aerosol optical thickness over China. The retrieval process is time consuming and the EMS (enhanced memory systems) memory required is very high. To solve the problem, we adapted the SYTAM model to the Grid computing environment.

Separating reviews from non-reviews, or subjectivity classification, is potentially important for many text processing applications, such as information extraction and information retrieval. Also, it is a key process in sentiment classification for online customer reviews. As a type of genre classification, the classifications of subjective and objective texts are different from traditional topic-based classifications. Not many studies have been conducted in this domain and most of them were on English texts. Little work has been done on Chinese subjectivity classification. However, the detailed techniques used in English texts can not be applied directly to Chinese due to the different characteristics between these two languages. This paper proposes an approach to perform subjectivity classification on Chinese text based on a supervised machine learning algorithm, Naive Bayes. Experiment studies have been conducted on two kinds of documents: movie reviews and movie plots written in Chinese.

Nonetheless, few researchers have attempted to classify multi-spectral images using the 3D DWT. This study aims to apply the 3D DWT to the classification of multi-spectral images and synthetic aperture radar image. To classify these images, we employ two numerical values: The 3D wavelet coefficients and the energy of each band. And then we evaluate their results quantitatively with those of traditional classification techniques including the 2D wavelet scheme. Therefore, the results show that the classification technique of the 3D DWT is more effective than that of traditional techniques, especially in complicated imagery. The accuracy of the 3D energy in SAR imagery is higher. This study provides new numerical values to classify images effectively.

This paper suggests a new 3D sound reproduction method that can address this problem. In order to prevent the audible frequency band from being over- enhanced, the algorithm suggested in this paper is designed to automatically restrict gain values calculated by the output ratio of the auditory filter designed after the human auditory system. From the results of computer simulations, it is confirmed that the suggested algorithm effectively prevents the audible frequency band from being over-enhanced, which is a problem of the conventional technique.
