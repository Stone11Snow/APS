The topological tree exhibits some interesting properties that can be exploited to extract knowledge from images for information retrieval, image understanding and diagnosis purposes. Examples of applications in dermatology are described. The TT can be constructed after segmentation, by computing the spatial relationships of regions or can be generated directly during the segmentation: to this aim we present a novel recursive fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm based on the Principal Component Analysis of the color space.

However, since humans are accustomed to relying on object-level concepts rather than low-level regions, robust and accurate object segmentation is an essential step. We propose a new multiple-region level image retrieval algorithm based on region-level image segmentation and its spatial relationship. To capture spatial similarity, we apply Hausdorff distance (HD) to our region-based image retrieval system, FRIP (finding region in the pictures). In contrast to other object or multiple region-based retrieval systems, we update classical HD to retrieve similar regions regardless of their spatial translation, insertion, and deletion. Furthermore, we incorporate relevance feedback to reflect the user's high-level query and subjectivity to the system and to compensate for performance degradation due to imperfect image segmentation.

This methodology consists of two steps. First, the contents of databases are indicated approximately by database representatives. Databases are ranked using their representatives with respect to the given query. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition to rank the databases optimally. In order to satisfy this condition, we provide three estimation methods. One estimation method is intended for short queries; the other two are for all queries. Second, we provide an algorithm, OptDocRetrv, to retrieve documents from the databases according to their rank and in a particular way. We show that if the databases containing the n most similar documents for a given query are ranked ahead of other databases, our methodology will guarantee the retrieval of the n most similar documents for the query. When the number of databases is large, we propose to organize database representatives into a hierarchy and employ a best-search algorithm to search the hierarchy. It is shown that the effectiveness of the best-search algorithm is the same as that of evaluating the user query against all database representatives.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1047772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047772","","Databases;Indexes;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Scattering;Search engines;Sufficient conditions","Internet;distributed databases;full-text databases;information resources;information retrieval;search engines","OptDocRetrv;best-search algorithm;database selection;distributed information retrieval;metasearch;multiple databases;query processing;resource discovery;search engine;text document retrieval","","10","","39","","","Nov/Dec 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Considering the color feature, a tool for synthetic image databases generation is proposed. This allows to control the number and location of the dominant colors in the Lab space and provides also their spatial coherency. It is then possible to sort exactly the images for the color feature. We also propose a new similarity measure to compare images described by the color feature. Based on the assumption of a Gaussian distribution for each dominant color, each image is modeled by the sum of these Gaussian distributions. The similarity measure performs a Kullman's distance between two modeled distributions. The objective performance evaluation based on the synthetic database is done for comparing our image retrieval system (IMALBUM) which uses the new similarity measure and MPEG7 approach.

When the number of stored objects and/or the number of dimensions of the feature vectors are large, it will be too slow to linearly search all stored feature vectors to find those that satisfy the query criteria.

In this paper, an effective wipe detection method is proposed using the macroblock (MB) information of the MPEG compressed video. By analyzing the prediction directions of B frames, which are revealed in the MB types, the scene change region of each frame can be found. Once the accumulation of the scene change regions covers most of the area of the frame, the sequence will be considered a motionless wipe transition sequence. Besides, uncommon intracoded MB of the B frame can also be applied as an indicator of the motion wipe transition. A very simple analysis based on small amount of MB type information is sufficient to achieve wipe detection directly on MPEG compressed video. Easy extraction of MB type information, low-complexity analysis algorithm and robustness to arbitrary shape and direction of wipe transitions are the great advantages of the proposed method.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2002.802841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1040959","","Change detection algorithms;Discrete cosine transforms;Image analysis;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Layout;Multimedia databases;Shape;Transform coding;Video compression","data compression;image retrieval;image sequences;multimedia communication;multimedia databases;video coding;video databases","B frames;MPEG compressed video;arbitrary shape;effective wipe detection;low-complexity analysis algorithm;macroblock information;motionless wipe transition sequence;multimedia applications;prediction directions;robustness;scene change region;uncommon intracoded MB;video database;video retrieval;video scene analysis;wipe transition","","18","","28","","","Sep 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since a main-memory DBMS, unlike a disk-resident DBMS, performs all data updates or data retrievals by accessing main-memory only the portion of the cost for the concurrency control manager in the total cost for a data update or a data retrieval is fairly high. Thus, the development of an efficient concurrency control manager greatly accelerates the performance of the entire main-memory DBMS. Our concurrency control manager employs the two-phase locking protocol, and has the following characteristics. First, it adapts the partition as a locking granule, and thus effectively adjusts the trade-off between system concurrency and locking cost. Second, it enjoys low locking costs by maintaining lock information directly in the partition itself. Third, it provides the latch as a mechanism for physical consistency of system data. Our latch supports both shared and exclusive modes. and maximizes CPU utilization by combining the Bakery algorithm and the Unix semaphore facility. Fourth, for solving the deadlock problem, it periodically examines whether a system is in a deadlock state based on lock waiting information. In addition, we discuss various issues arising in development such as mutual exclusion of a transaction table, mutual exclusion of indexes and system catalogs, and phantom problem handling.","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-1727-7","10.1109/CMPSAC.2002.1045075","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1045075","","Acceleration;Catalogs;Concurrency control;Concurrent computing;Costs;Imaging phantoms;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Protocols;System recovery","concurrency control;database management systems","Bakery algorithm;CPU utilization;Tachyon main-memory DBMS;Unix semaphore facility;concurrency control manager;data retrievals;data updates;deadlock problem;exclusive modes;locking cost;locking granule;mutual index exclusion;mutual system catalog exclusion;mutual transaction table exclusion;phantom problem handling;shared modes;two-phase locking protocol","","0","","14","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Seasonal variation in sea ice extent, however, coupled with the difficulties associated with in situ observations of polar sea ice, makes remote sensing the only practical way to estimate this important climatic variable on the space and time scales required. Unfortunately, accurate retrieval of sea ice extent from satellite data is a difficult task. Sea ice and high cold clouds have similar visible reflectance, but some other types of clouds can appear darker than sea ice. Moreover, strong atmospheric inversions and isothermal structures, both common in winter at some polar locations, further complicate the classification. This paper uses a combination of feed-forward neural networks and 1.6-μm data from the new Chinese Fengyun-1C satellite to mitigate these difficulties. The 1.6-μm data are especially useful for detecting illuminated water clouds in polar regions because 1) at 1.6 μm, the reflectance of water droplets is significantly higher than that of snow or ice and 2) 1.6-μm data are unaffected by atmospheric inversions. Validation data confirm the accuracy of the new classification technique. Application to other sensors with 1.6-μm capabilities also is discussed.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2002.803728","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046847","","Arctic;Clouds;Feedforward systems;Information retrieval;Isothermal processes;Neural networks;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Satellites;Sea ice","atmospheric radiation;clouds;feedforward neural nets;geophysical signal processing;image classification;oceanographic techniques;remote sensing;sea ice","1.6 micron;Arctic;atmospheric inversions;cloud;global climate;isothermal structures;lead classification;neural networks;ocean;polar region;remote sensing;sea ice;seasonal variation;visible reflectance;water","","14","","47","","","Sep 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to its compact representation and low complexity, direct histogram comparison is a commonly used technique for measuring the color similarity. However, it has many serious drawbacks, including a high degree of dependency on color codebook design, sensitivity to quantization boundaries, and inefficiency in representing images with few dominant colors. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for color matching that models behavior of the human visual system in capturing color appearance of an image. We first develop a new method for color codebook design in the Lab space. The method is well suited for creating small fixed color codebooks; for image analysis, matching, and retrieval. Then we introduce a statistical technique to extract perceptually relevant colors. We also propose a new color distance measure that is based on the optimal mapping between two sets of color components representing two images. Experiments comparing the new algorithm to some existing techniques show that these novel elements lead to better match to human perception in judging image similarity in terms of color composition.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2002.804260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097760","","Colored noise;Histograms;Humans;Image analysis;Image color analysis;Image databases;Image matching;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Quantization","data compression;feature extraction;image coding;image colour analysis;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;statistical analysis;visual databases;visual perception","Lab space;color codebook design;color composition;color descriptors;color distance measure;color similarity measurement;histogram comparison;human visual system model;image analysis;image database;image matching;image representation;image retrieval;low complexity;optimal color composition distance;optimal mapping;perceptually important colors extraction;quantization boundaries sensitivity;similarity measurement;statistical technique","","52","2","22","","","Nov 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We use paintbrush stroke parameters as features. These strokes are produced by a stochastic paintbrush algorithm which simulates a painting process. Stroke parameters include color, orientation and location. Therefore, it provides information not only about the color content but also about the structural properties of an image.

Data warehouses tend to be extremely large, it is quite possible for a data warehouse to be hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size (Chauduri and Dayal, 1997). Queries tend to be complex and ad hoc, often requiring computationally expensive operations such as joins and aggregation. Given this, we are interested in developing strategies for improving query processing in data warehouses by exploring the applicability of parallel processing techniques. In particular, we exploit the natural partitionability of a star schema and render it even more efficient by applying DataIndexes-a storage structure that serves both as an index as well as data and lends itself naturally to vertical partitioning of the data. DataIndexes are derived from the various special purpose access mechanisms currently supported in commercial OLAP products. Specifically, we propose a declustering strategy which incorporates both task and data partitioning and present the Parallel Star Join (PSJ) Algorithm, which provides a means to perform a star join in parallel using efficient operations involving only rowsets and projection columns. We compare the performance of the PSJ Algorithm with two parallel query processing strategies. The first is a parallel join strategy utilizing the Bitmap Join Index (BJI), arguably the state-of-the-art OLAP join structure in use today. For the second strategy we choose a well-known parallel join algorithm, namely the pipelined hash algorithm. To assist in the performance comparison, we first develop a cost model of the disk access and transmission costs for all three approaches.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1047769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047769","","Computer Society;Costs;Data models;Data warehouses;Databases;Decision making;Information retrieval;Parallel processing;Partitioning algorithms;Query processing","data mining;data warehouses;database indexing;parallel algorithms;query processing;software performance evaluation","Bitmap Join Index;DataIndexes;OLAP;Parallel Star Join;aggregation;data warehouses;decision-support;declustering;disk access costs;experiments;online analytical processing;parallel join strategy;parallel processing;performance evaluation;pipelined hash algorithm;query processing;task partitioning;transmission costs;vertical data partitioning","","6","","28","","","Nov/Dec 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this reason, data partitioning and data allocation are performance critical issues in distributed database application design. We are dealing with data partitioning. Data partitioning requires the use of clustering. Although many clustering algorithms have been proposed, their performance has not been extensively studied. Moreover, the special problem structure in clustering is rarely exploited. We explore the use of a genetic search-based clustering algorithm for data partitioning to achieve high database retrieval performance. By formulating the underlying problem as a traveling salesman problem (TSP), we can take advantage of this particular structure. Three new operators for GAs are also proposed and experimental results indicate that they outperform other operators in solving the TSP. The proposed GA is applied to solve the data-partitioning problem. Our computational study shows that our GA performs well for this application.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2002.804444","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1097734","","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Database systems;Distributed databases;Genetics;Information retrieval;Partitioning algorithms;Relational databases;Spatial databases;Transaction databases","data handling;data structures;distributed databases;genetic algorithms;parallel databases;search problems;travelling salesman problems","data allocation;data partitioning;database partitioning;database retrieval performance;distributed database;experimental results;genetic algorithm-based clustering approach;genetic search-based clustering algorithm;optimization;parallel database;traveling salesman problem","","41","1","48","","","Aug 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We apply this distance to eigenface techniques using image contrast and asymmetric components of face images as the confidence.

These abstractions are used in a system to locate logos in an image database. The utility of this approach is illustrated using some sample queries.","1051-4651;10514651","POD:0-7695-1695-X","10.1109/ICPR.2002.1047991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047991","","Biomedical imaging;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Educational institutions;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape;Signal processing;Spline","Fourier analysis;content-based retrieval;database theory;edge detection;image retrieval;visual databases","Fourier descriptors;content-based retrieval;image database;image retrieval;logos;pictorial query processing;pictorial specification;shape contour abstraction;spatial constraints","","28","4","12","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To utilize bandwidth more effectively in the Internet environment, it is highly desirable that data be kept and sent over the Internet in compressed form. In order to support information retrieval for compressed data, compressed pattern matching has been gaining increasing attention from both theoretical and practical viewpoints. We design and implement a dictionary-based compressed pattern matching algorithm. Our algorithm takes advantage of the dictionary structure common in the LZ78 family. With the help of a slightly modified dictionary structure, we are able to do 'block decompression' (a key in many existing compressed pattern matching schemes) as well as pattern matching on-the-fly, resulting in performance improvement as our experimental results indicate.","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-1727-7","10.1109/CMPSAC.2002.1045116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1045116","","Algorithm design and analysis;Application software;Bandwidth;Dictionaries;Information retrieval;Pattern matching;Protocols;Video compression;Web and internet services;Wireless networks","Internet;data compression;information retrieval;pattern matching","Internet;L-778 family;block decompression;compressed data;dictionary structure;dictionary-based compressed pattern matching algorithm;information retrieval","","0","","6","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, querying these views efficiently requires new techniques. Data usually resides at a remote site and is organized as a set of related HTML documents, with network access being a primary cost factor in query evaluation. This cost can be reduced by exploiting the redundancy often found in site design. We use a simple data model, a subset of the Araneus data model, to describe the structure of a Web site. We augment the model with link and inclusion constraints that capture the redundancies in the site. We map relational views of a site to a navigational algebra and show how to use the constraints to rewrite algebraic expressions, reducing the number of network accesses.

Unfortunately, images are usually indexed by low-level features like color, texture and shape, which often fail to capture high-level concepts well. To address this issue, relevance feedback has been extensively used to associate low-level image features with highlevel concepts. Among all existing relevance feedback approaches, query movement and feature re-weighting have been proven to be suitable for large-scaled image databases with high dimensional image features. We present a feature re-weighting approach using relevant images as well as irrelevant ones in the relevance feedback. As far as feature re-weighting approaches are concerned, one of their common drawbacks is that the feature re-weighting process is prone to be trapped by suboptimal states. To overcome this problem, we introduce a disturbing factor, which is based on the Fisher criterion, to push the feature weights out of sub-optimum. Experimental results on a large-scaled image database with 31,438 COREL images demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented method.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1040017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1040017","","Bridges;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Data engineering;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape;Spatial databases","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;learning by example;relevance feedback;visual databases","COREL images;Fisher criterion;disturbing factor;feature re-weighting approach;high dimensional image features;image color;image databases;image retrieval;image shape;image texture;large-scale image databases;low-level image features;query movement;relevance feedback;suboptimal states","","10","","7","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional time and resource consuming operations like memory copy operations limit the number of streams that can concurrently be transmitted from the server. To avoid this bottleneck and make memory and CPU resources available for other tasks, i.e., more concurrent clients, we have implemented a specialized zero-copy data path from the storage system through the communication system out to the network. In order to perform better than existing related approaches, we remove the overhead of memory related operations by statically allocating the necessary buffers.

We address this issue in the context of our Web warehousing system called WHOWEDA (Warehouse Of Web Data). Specifically, we investigate different types of constraints (related to query execution) which may be imposed on a Web query such as number of query results, time of execution, restrict the evaluation of a query to specified set of Web sites, etc. An important feature of our approach is that it attempts to address the query evaluation issues which may arise due to the existence of broken links and forms in the Web.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-1668-8","10.1109/DEXA.2002.1045996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1045996","","Acquired immune deficiency syndrome;Computer science;Control systems;Cost accounting;Database systems;Electronic switching systems;Information retrieval;Query processing;Remuneration;Telecommunication traffic","Web sites;data warehouses;query processing","WHOWEDA;Web query execution;Web sites;Web warehouse;data warehouse;query evaluation","","0","","5","","","2-6 Sept. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We find that the photoluminescence emission energy decreases with increasing substrate growth temperature. Our second type of optical experiment involves the time resolution of the optical emission from a pulsed laser source. We retrieve time-resolved data using a Hamamatsu streak-camera with attached monochrometer. Our streakcamera measurements yield color-hue plots of intensity versus wavelength versus time. This allows us to tell not only where in the energy spectrum our quantum dots are emitting, but also for how long they emit.

The application domain of data broadcast will be widely expanded in the near future, where the client is expected to perform complex queries or transactions on the broadcast data. To reduce the access latency for processing the complex query, it is beneficial to place the data accessed in a query close to each other on the broadcast channel. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the allocation of the data on the broadcast channel such that frequently co-accessed data are not only allocated close to each other, but also in a particular order which optimizes the performance of query processing.

This paper proposes a possibility based fuzzy relational database management system. Mechanisms to design and implement the database is shown and query processing methods are described. Fuzzy queries are first translated into SQL, and passed to MS-SQL server to process it. The result is then fuzzified. A user can express his (her) request using linguistic terms and can choose different retrieval threshold values. The system is then used to store information about patients whose bone density is measured for diagnosis of osteroporosis.

High-dimensional and sparse vectors are mapped into the a low-dimensional vector space, namely the space representing the latent semantic meanings of words, by using SPCA (simple principal component analysis). An experimental information retrieval system based on the proposed method has been built. Experiments on the Medline collection and Cranfield collection have been carried out. Improved average precision compared with the LSI (latent semantic indexing) model, are 6.80% (Medline) and 67.46% (Cranfield) for the two training data sets, and 4.71% (Medline) and 8.12% (Cranfield) for the test data, respectively.

Firstly, we use multiple frame verification to reduce text detection false alarms. We then choose those frames where the text is most likely clear, thus it is more possible to be correctly recognized. We then detect and joint every clear text block from those frames to form a clearer ""man-made"" frame. Later we apply a block-based adaptive thresholding procedure on these ""man-made"" frames.

It is difficult to obtain satisfactory results when the user wants the image that cannot be explicitly described or can be requested only based on impression. In order to solve this problem and supplement the lack of the user's expression capability, we have developed an image retrieval system based on human preference and emotion by using an interactive genetic algorithm (IGA). This system extracts the feature from images by wavelet transform, and provides a user-friendly means to retrieve an image from a large database when the user cannot clearly define what the image must be. Therefore, this facilitates the search for the image not only with explicit queries, but also with implicit queries such as ""cheerful impression,"" ""gloomy impression,"" and so on. A thorough experiment with a 2000 image database shows the usefulness of the proposed system.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2002.802812","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1046076","","Biological cells;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Software libraries;Wavelet transforms","content-based retrieval;genetic algorithms;image retrieval;interactive systems","cheerful impression;content-based image retrieval;explicit queries;gloomy impression;human preference;human-oriented image retrieval system;image database;implicit queries;interactive genetic algorithm;wavelet transform","","40","","18","","","May 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Color quantization compacts the color information and matches each color instead of color components, and matching of similar colors is accomplished using palette merging. Experimental results show that the proposed MCH method is about 11-32% more precise in the first 20 retrievals for the same image query, and is able to recall 14%-23% more relevant images in the first 100 retrievals, as compared to the conventional RGB-based histogram method.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1039130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1039130","","Distributed computing;Health information management;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image databases;Image retrieval;Indexing;Information retrieval;Merging;Quantization","image colour analysis;image matching;image retrieval;quantisation (signal);statistical analysis;visual databases","CBIR;color image retrieval;color quantization;color-component distributions;content-based image retrieval;content-based retrieval;image databases;image features;image matching;merged-color histogram;palette merging","","8","","8","","","24-28 June 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though such a task may be performed manually by the domain experts, it is unlikely that such human categorization will be able to keep pace with the tremendous growth of the World Wide Web (WWW). The sheer volume of data that is available on the Internet will surely overwhelm these human categorizers. Hence, as the Internet expands, the importance of having this process automated will become increasingly important. Many clustering techniques have been commonly used to retrieve, filter, and categorize documents. The traditional clustering algorithms either use a priori knowledge of document structures to define a distance or similarity among these documents, or use probabilistic techniques such as Bayesian classification. In recent studies, several species of ants have been observed to exhibit collective behavior that has inspired the computation algorithm commonly known as swarm intelligence. This has been used in a variety of different applications, ranging from exploratory data analysis, scheduling, to graph partitioning.

The initial microphysical a priori information on vertical profiles of cloud parameters is derived from a mesoscale cloud-resolving model. In order to complement information from cloud models and to match simulations to the conditions of the area of interest, a new approach is proposed. Climatological constraints over the Mediterranean are derived on a monthly basis from available radiosounding profiles, rain-gauge network measurements, and colocated METEOSAT infrared measurements. In order to introduce the actual surface background in the radiative-transfer simulations, a further constraint is represented by the monthly average and variance maps of surface emissivity derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) clear-air observations.

International Conference on Image Processing","20021210","2002","3","","III-145","III-148 vol.3","Content-based retrieval (CBIR) methods in medical databases have been designed to support specific tasks, such as retrieval of digital mammograms or 3D MRI images. These methods cannot be transferred to other medical applications since different imaging modalities require different types of processing. To enable content-based queries in diverse collections of medical images, the retrieval system must be familiar with the current image class prior to the query processing. We describe a novel approach for the automatic categorization of medical images according to their modalities. We propose a semantically based set of visual features, their relevance and organization for capturing the semantics of different imaging modalities. The features are used in conjunction with a new categorization metric, enabling ""intelligent"" annotation, browsing/searching of medical databases. Our algorithm provides basic semantic knowledge about the image, and may serve as a front-end to the domain specific medical image analysis methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have designed and implemented an Internet portal for browsing/querying online medical databases, and applied it to a large number of images. Our results demonstrate that accurate categorization can be achieved by exploiting the important visual properties of each modality.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038925","","Biomedical equipment;Biomedical imaging;Content based retrieval;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical services;Query processing;Visual databases","Internet;content-based retrieval;information retrieval;medical image processing;portals;visual databases","CBIR;Internet portal;automatic categorization;browsing;browsing/searching;content-based queries;content-based retrieval;domain specific medical image analysis methods;front-end;image class;intelligent annotation;medical databases;medical image databases;modalities;online medical databases;query processing;retrieval system;semantic based categorization;visual features","","14","1","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

No single search engine is capable of searching all data on the Internet. The approach that provides an interface for invoking multiple search engines for each user query has the potential to satisfy more users. When the number of search engines under the interface is large, invoking all search engines for each query is often not cost effective because it creates unnecessary network traffic by sending the query to a large number of useless search engines and searching these useless search engines wastes local resources. The problem can be overcome if the usefulness of every search engine with respect to each query can be predicted. We present a statistical method to estimate the usefulness of a search engine for any given query. For a given query, the usefulness of a search engine in this paper is defined to be a combination of the number of documents in the search engine that are sufficiently similar to the query and the average similarity of these documents. Experimental results indicate that our estimation method is much more accurate than existing methods.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2002.1047777","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1047777","","Costs;Databases;Helium;Information resources;Information retrieval;Internet;Metasearch;Search engines;Statistical analysis;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;full-text databases;information resources;information retrieval;search engines;statistical analysis","Internet;cost effective;documents;experimental results;information resource discovery;information retrieval;metasearch;search engine;searching;statistical method;text databases","","8","","27","","","Nov/Dec 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using the same word or vocabulary to describe different entities creates ambiguity, especially in the web environment where the user population is large. To solve this problem, fuzzy association is used to capture the relationships among different index terms or keywords in the documents, i.e., each pair of words has an associated value to distinguish itself from the others. Therefore, the ambiguity in word usage is avoided. Experiments using data sets collected from two web portals: Yahoo! and Open Directory Project are conducted. We compare our approach to the vector space model with the cosine coefficient. The results show that our approach yields higher accuracy compared to the vector space model.","0730-3157;07303157","POD:0-7695-1727-7","10.1109/CMPSAC.2002.1045052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1045052","","Data mining;Database systems;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Multimedia systems;Portals;Web mining;World Wide Web","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;pattern classification","ambiguity;associated value;data mining;fuzzy association concept;index terms;information retrieval;text categorization;vector space model;web document classification","","6","","21","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spatial relation between the strokes can be used to determine the stroke correspondence between the query sketch and the database sketch. Moreover, the similarity between the relationship among query strokes and database strokes can be used as part of the matching score. Sketch retrieval is useful in various applications, such as retrieval of free-form hand-drawings, hand-written or printed text, and trademarks. For freeform hand-drawings, such as lecture notes captured digitally from a whiteboard, a user can easily search through a database of hand-drawings by inputting a sketch about what he/she is looking for, without the trouble of describing it using keywords. For hand-written or printed text, such as a protest sign in a video scene, sketch retrieval can be used to recognize the text without the need to first identify each character. For trademarks, such as company logos, sketch retrieval is useful in adding automation to the feature extraction and the retrieval process.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1038173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038173","","Automation;Character recognition;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Layout;Shape;Spatial databases;Text recognition;Trademarks","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval","database sketch;feature extraction;free-form hand-drawings;freeform hand-drawings;hand-written text;matching score;multiple strokes;printed text;query sketch;shape information;sketch retrieval;spatial relation;stroke correspondence;trademarks;video scene","","5","1","13","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing methods cannot handle well those texts with different contrast or embedded in a complex background. To handle these difficulties, this paper proposes an efficient text detection approach, which is based on invariant features, such as edge strength, edge density, and horizontal distribution. First, it applies edge detection and uses a low threshold to filter out definitely non-text edges. Then, a local threshold is selected to both keep low-contrast text and simplify complex background of high-contrast text. Next, two text-area enhancement operators are proposed to highlight those areas with either high edge strength or high edge density. Finally, coarse-to-fine detection locates text regions efficiently. Experimental results show that this approach is robust for contrast, font-size, font-color, language, and background complexity.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-7622-6","10.1109/ICIP.2002.1037973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1037973","","Colored noise;Computer science;Engines;Image edge detection;Image texture analysis;Indexing;Information retrieval;Layout;Optical character recognition software;Robustness","edge detection;optical character recognition;video signal processing;viewdata","background complexity;coarse-to-fine detection;contrast;edge density;edge detection;edge strength;font-color;font-size;horizontal distribution;invariant features;language;local threshold;low threshold;text detection;text regions;text-area enhancement operators;video information retrieval;video text","","33","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These two similarity models are based on the assumption that term vectors are orthogonal. But this assumption is not true. Term associations are ignored in such similarity models. In the document categorization context, we analyze the properties of term-document space, term-category space and category-document space. Then, without the assumption of term independence, we propose a new mathematical model to estimate the association between terms and define an ε-similarity model of documents. Here we make best use of existing category membership represented by the corpus as much as possible, and the objective is to improve categorization performance. Experiments have been done with a k-NN classifier over the Reuters-5178 corpus. The empirical results show that utilization of term association can improve the effectiveness of the categorization system and the ε-similarity model outperforms those without term association.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:0-7695-1668-8","10.1109/DEXA.2002.1045908","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1045908","","Conferences;Databases;Euclidean distance;Expert systems;Humans;Information retrieval;Mathematical model;Nearest neighbor searches;Support vector machines;Text categorization","category theory;content-based retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis","&epsiv;-similarity model;Euclidean distance-based similarity model;Reuters-5178 corpus;categorization performance;category membership;category-document space;cosine-based similarity model;document categorization;document similarity;information retrieval;k nearest neighbors algorithm;k-NN classifier;term association;term-category space;term-document space","","0","2","8","","","2-6 Sept. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A premise of our work is that programmers use meaningful names for program items, such as functions, variables, types, classes, and methods. We believe that the application-domain knowledge that programmers process when writing the code is often captured by the mnemonics for identifiers; therefore, the analysis of these mnemonics can help to associate high-level concepts with program concepts and vice-versa. We apply both a probabilistic and a vector space information retrieval model in two case studies to trace C++ source code onto manual pages and Java code to functional requirements.

Temporal color correlograms compute the autocorrelation of quantized HSV color values from a set of frame samples taken from a video shot. In this paper, the efficiency of the temporal color correlogram and HSV color correlograms are evaluated against other retrieval systems participating the TREC video track evaluation and against color histograms used commonly in content-based retrieval.
