"Improving Information Retrieval Precision by Finding Related Queries with Similar Information Need Using Information Scent","S. Chawla; P. Bedi","","2008 First International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology","20080729","2008","","","486","491","Web is a valuable source of information and it is expanding at an enormous speed. Search engines provide the interface to access to this vast pool of information. Users express their information need through the input query to retrieve the relevant information which does not prove to be effective as input query entered by the user is too short to get the information need of the user. To retrieve the information according to a particular information need from a big pool of information available on the web is a big challenge. This paper proposes a method to find the related queries which approximate the information need of the input query issued to the search engine. This is accomplished using Information scent and content of clicked pages in query sessions mining. Information scent is derived from the information foraging theory in which user behavior in the information environment is guided by information scent. Information need of the query sessions is modeled using information scent and content of clicked URLs and query sessions with similar information need are clustered. The clusters which closely approximate the information need of input query are used to suggest queries with similar information need for a given input query. The suggested queries are ranked in order of their degree of relevance with respect to information need of the input query. Retrieval precision of search engine is improved as suggested queries help to retrieve document relevant to the need of user efficiently and quickly. Experimental study has been conducted on the dataset collected from ""Google"" search engine Web history to confirm the improvement of precision of information retrieval.","2157-0477;21570477","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3267-7","10.1109/ICETET.2008.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4579949","Clustering;Information Retrieval;Information Scent;Search engine","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Degradation;History;Information resources;Information retrieval;Search engines;Uniform resource locators;Web search","Internet;information needs;query processing;search engines","World Wide Web;document retrieval;information foraging theory;information need;information retrieval precision;information scent;query session mining;search engine","","6","","13","","","16-18 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The semantic query expansion is constructed by order relation, equivalence relation and inclusion relation between fuzzy concepts defined in fuzzy linguistic variable ontologies.

The main hypothesis is that the inclusion of conceptual knowledge such as ontologies in the information retrieval process can contribute to the solution of major problems currently faced by in information retrieval. Current information retrieval systems mostly use keyword search, which is unsatisfactory option because of its low precision and recall. In this paper, we consider concept- based information retrieval model as a new and promising way of improving search on the Web. Informally, concept- based information retrieval is search for documents based on their meaning rather than on the presence of the keywords in the object. Much more ""smartness"" should be embedded to search tools to manage effectively search, retrieval, filtering and presenting relevant information. The paper is organized as follows. Section 1 introduces the problem of current information retrieval systems. Section 2 presents an overview of the ontology-based information retrieval techniques.

On each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other resources to accomplish its task. Consequently, mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed information retrieval applications. On behalf of a user, by migrating to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-to-end latency. By deploying the abilities of mobile agent, this thesis develops a system which can control and manage the distributed information retrieval processing in order to search for the required technical papers from distributed database throughout a network. In this system, the mobile agents can migrate from a host node to various destinations, perform data processing there and send the relevant information back to the host. In order to facilitate such a set of events and actions, many development platforms are available.

However, the connotation of labeling in ranking is quite different from that in classification. Specifically, the labeling of samples for ranking is usually incomplete, i.e. only a part of samples are labeled. In order to remedy this methodological gap, in this paper we propose a hybrid learning framework, called fuzzy-label learning, which consists of two layers. First, we utilize a label-propagation algorithm to estimate those labels of unlabeled samples by their neighborhoods. Second, we adopt RankBoost on the samples with fuzzy labels. Experiments with five-fold cross-validation using the Letor benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid learning framework can definitively improve the search performance achieved by the RankBoost algorithm for Web information retrieval.","","POD:978-1-4244-2310-1","10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590415","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4590415","Fuzzy Set;Machine Learning","Degradation;Face recognition;Fuzzy sets;Information retrieval;Labeling;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms","Internet;fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","Letor benchmark datasets;RankBoost algorithm;Web information retrieval;five-fold cross-validation;fuzzy-label learning;hybrid learning framework;label-propagation algorithm;machine learning techniques","","0","1","15","","","7-11 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users might need different pieces of information, ranging from information about a single building, to the resolution strategy of a global conflict. Sometimes, the time, location and past history of information access can also shape the information needs of users. Information systems need to help users pull together data from disparate sources according to their expressed needs (as represented by system queries), as well as less specific criteria. Information consumers have varying roles, tasks/missions, goals and agendas, knowledge and background, and personal preferences. These factors can be used to shape both the execution of user queries and the form in which retrieved information is packaged. However, full automation of this daunting information aggregation and customization task is not possible with existing approaches. In this paper we present an infrastructure for context-aware information retrieval to enhance situation awareness. The infrastructure provides each user with a customized, mission-oriented system that gives access to the right information from heterogeneous sources in the context of a particular task, plan and/or mission.

Personalized content retrieval aims at improving the retrieval process by taking into account the particular interests of individual users. The goal of information retrieval systems is to personalize ranking documents based on user profiles. In this paper we proposed new method for personalizing results of information retrieval systems based on extended fuzzy concept networks. In this method both pages and user profiles will be showed as extended fuzzy concept networks. In an extended fuzzy concept network, there are four kinds of fuzzy relationships between concepts (1) fuzzy positive association (2) fuzzy negative association (3) fuzzy generalization (4) fuzzy specialization. An extended fuzzy concept network can be modeled by a relation matrix and a relevance matrix, where the elements in a relation matrix represent the fuzzy relationships between concepts, and the elements in a relevance matrix indicate the degrees of relevance between concepts Advantage of this method is to find the most documents with respect to the user's query and more flexible and better showing user.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1752-0; POD:978-1-4244-1751-3","10.1109/ICTTA.2008.4530007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4530007","Extended fuzzy concept networks;Information Retreival;Personalizaing FuzzyConcept Networks;Search Engine;User Profiles","Computer networks;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;Information technology;Laboratories;Search engines","fuzzy set theory;information retrieval;matrix algebra","electronic documents;extended fuzzy concept networks;information retrieval systems;personalized content retrieval;relation matrix;relevance matrix","","1","","10","","","7-11 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In previous work, we report a proof of concept study on a new approach to NLP-based IR, proposed as a syntactic IR model (SIR). In SIR, Documents and queries are represented on the basis of syntactic parse trees, which are generated by a natural language parser. Based on this tree structured representation of documents and queries, the matching between a document and a query is executed on their tree representations, with tree comparison as the key operation. In this paper, we extend the dataset of the IR experiment for testing SIR into full documents. Additionally, the raw parse trees output by the parser are pruned before being fed into the indexing process of SIR. This operation is necessary and has the similar role of the stop words list strategy in the term based IR index construction.

We propose a new node access scheme for P2P IR that we call Huffman-DHT. Huffman-DHT uses an algorithm similar to Huffman coding, and modifies the DHT structure based on the term distribution.

To make the calculation of semantic similarity between concepts more similar to human's subjective judgment, the similarity be measured by word form or semantic methods. Whether the word to be compared is a compound word or not can be determined by WordNet before calculating word semantic similarity. If the words to be compared contain a compound word, the compound word should be divided into word sequence and the stop words should be removed in the sequence. Then the key part set and the non-key part can be gained by syntax analysis. In the experiment, the algorithm gets the best result, which fits human's judgment.

The communication component serves as the foundation for the nodes to maintain connectivity in the system, while the indexing component prepares the information in a way that enables fast and efficient future search operations. A challenge is to overcome the curse of dimensionality. From both network and database perspectives, decentralized networks are complex; not only we have to accommodate the rapid growth of the network size, but also the multi-dimensionality of the data space.

Our model incorporates corpus independent knowledge from WordNet and corpus dependent knowledge from LSI into query expansion and reduction; and LSI is also adopted to simulate human meaning based judgement of relatedness between investigatorpsilas queries and emails. We compare the performance of the resulting LSI And WordNet based Information retrieval system (LAWIRS) with other three systems we implement, i.e. the LSI system, the Lucene system and the Lucene system with query expansion. Experimental results on several email datasets demonstrate that for short Boolean queries, LAWIRS can successfully capture their meaning and yield substantial improvements in the overall retrieval performance.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2415-3; POD:978-1-4244-2414-6","10.1109/ISI.2008.4565032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4565032","","Application software;Australia;Digital forensics;Humans;Indexing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Internet;Large scale integration;Partial response channels","indexing;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","WordNet;digital forensics;information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;reference ontology","","2","","19","","","17-20 June 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the basis of this concept, this paper presents a new dynamic margin matching algorithm. In this algorithm, the matching problem of information entropy shift sequence is transformed to the matching of the characteristic curve of a binary function; the trend of curve changes is used as the feature to match.

As they are spelling variants of each other in most languages, using a string matching technique against the target database index is the common approach taken to find the target language correspondents of the original query keys. N-gram technique proved to be the most effective among other string matching techniques. The issue arises when the languages dealt with have different alphabets. Transliteration is then applied based on phonetic similarities between the languages involved.

A specially interesting sub-field of research, called single-database PIR, deals with the schemes that allow a user to retrieve privately an element of a non-replicated database. In these schemes, user privacy is related to the intractability of a mathematical problem, instead of being based on the assumption that different replicas exist and do not collude against their users. Single-database PIR schemes have generated an enormous amount of research in the privacy protection field during the last two decades. However, many scientists believe that these are theoretical tools unusable in almost any situation. It is true that these schemes usually require the database to use a lot of computational power, but considering the large number of applications these protocols have, it is important to develop practical approaches that provide acceptable performances for as many applications as possible. We present in this article a proof-of-concept implementation of a single-database PIR scheme proposed by Aguilar and Gaborit [2, 3]. This implementation can run in a CPU or in a GPU using CUDA, nVidia's library for General Purpose computing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU). The performance results highlight that linear algebra PIR schemes allow to process database contents several orders of magnitude faster than previous protocols.","2162-2108;21622108","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3329-2","10.1109/SECURWARE.2008.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4622593","GPU;Private Information Retrieval","Costs;Databases;Information retrieval;Information security;Libraries;Privacy;Protection;Protocols;Space technology;Stock markets","computer graphics;coprocessors;data privacy;information retrieval","CUDA;GPU;general purpose computing;graphics processing units;high-speed private information retrieval computation;nVidia library;single-database PIR scheme;user privacy","","4","","24","","","25-31 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, most of the current Web-based learning systems are still delivering the same educational resources in the same way to learners with different profiles.

In this paper, we aim to compute on-line automatic recommendations to an active learner based on his/her recent navigation history, as well as exploiting similarities and dissimilarities among user preferences and among the contents of the learning resources. First we start by mining learner profiles using Web usage mining techniques and content-based profiles using information retrieval techniques. Then, we use these profiles to compute relevant links to recommend for an active learner by applying a number of different recommendation strategies.","2161-3761;21613761","POD:978-0-7695-3167-0","10.1109/ICALT.2008.198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561676","Automatic Recommendation;E-learning;Information Retrieval;Personalization;Web Mining","Collaboration;Data mining;Electronic learning;History;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Knowledge engineering;Navigation;Uniform resource locators","Internet;computer aided instruction;data mining;information retrieval","Web usage mining technique;World Wide Web;content-based profile;e-learning personalization;information retrieval","","52","","12","","","1-5 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic idea of granular computing is the using of granulars during problem solving. A tolerance granular space model (TGSM) is proposed by intelligence science laboratory. From the perspective of philosophy, the basic idea of the model is based on the human ability, that is, people can abstract or synthetize the knowledge and data relating with special tasks to different degrees or sizes granules, and accomplish the tasks with the helps of the granules and relations among them. From the perspective of technology and theory, TGSM written as 4-tuple (OS, TR, FG, NTC), consists of four parts: object set system OS, tolerance relation system TR, transformation function FG and nested tolerance covering system NTC. The main features of the model focus on the definition of granules and the problem solving methods with the help of the hierachical and nested structure of tolerance granular spaces. Nonstructured Information comes from audio, video, image which no inherent segmentation in basic semantic units, such as characters, words, and sentences. The information retrieval should make the automatic semantic generation through feature binding. We have proposed a novel computational model, Bayesian linking field model, for feature binding in human perception, by combining the idea of noisy neuron model, Bayesian method, linking field network and competitive mechanism. In this talk we will explore how to apply tolerance granular space model for nonstructured multimedia information extraction and retrieval, particular focussing on video streams.","","POD:978-1-4244-2512-9","10.1109/GRC.2008.4664806","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4664806","","Bayesian methods;Computer networks;Humans;Image segmentation;Information processing;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Laboratories;Problem-solving;Streaming media","feature extraction;information retrieval;multimedia systems","Bayesian linking field model;Bayesian method;automatic semantic generation;feature binding;granular computing;information extraction;intelligence science laboratory;linking field network;multimedia information extraction;nonstructured information retrieval;problem solving methods;tolerant granular space model","","0","","","","","26-28 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper, we examine how different translation units contribute to the English-Vietnamese CLIR performance. Similar to translation units, different translation resources tend to have different effects on CLIR. Thus, the use of these linguistic resources should also be investigated. Since bilingual dictionary is the only resource available, we have constructed an English-Vietnamese parallel corpus using automatic system based on web mining. We then experiment three methods to exploit these resources - using the dictionary only, the parallel corpus only, and the parallel corpus to disambiguate translations given by the dictionary. Our experiments have shown that automatically generated parallel corpus is very feasible for both translation and disambiguation in English-Vietnamese CLIR.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2380-4; POD:978-1-4244-2379-8","10.1109/RIVF.2008.4586341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4586341","Bilingual Dictionary;CLIR;Information Retrieval;Parallel Corpus;Query Translation","Cities and towns;Computer science;Dictionaries;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Natural languages;Web mining;White spaces","data mining;dictionaries;information retrieval;language translation;natural languages","English-Vietnamese cross-language information retrieval;English-Vietnamese parallel corpus;Web mining;bilingual dictionary;linguistic resources;translation resources;translation units","","0","","20","","","13-17 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design goal of the system is to form a multipurpose distributed database to share various kinds of information distributed on the campus and to access to the Internet website. Each of peers in the campus submits metadata of its own files to a meta-server (called information server) that forms a local database. As each local database may classify those information into different categories, the cooperative server plays an important role to succeed in reconciling paradox among them. When a certain peer retrieves information from the system, the information servers that have metadata included in the query cooperatively search target files. Consequently the peer gets the target file directly from another peer or a website. InfoShare also has a cache mechanism for well-referred files as a countermeasure taken to avoid peerpsilas leaving. Our experimental results show that InfoShare has an excellent retrieval response time and can be effectively adaptable to many applications of campus information sharing.","","POD:978-4-88552-226-0","10.1109/APSITT.2008.4653567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4653567","Information sharing;distributed database;hybrid P2P network;web application","Distributed databases;File servers;IP networks;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Microcomputers;Peer to peer computing;Privacy;Scattering;Web server","Internet;distributed databases;educational computing;groupware;peer-to-peer computing","InfoShare;Internet website;campus information sharing;hybrid P2P networks;information servers;multiple hybrid peer-to- peer networks;multipurpose distributed database;selectively cooperative retrieval","","0","","18","","","22-24 April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In information retrieval, the users' queries often vary a lot from one to another, so that the documents retrieved from different queries are also distributed differently. Due to this diversity, it is not appropriate to assume all the documents to be ranked are generated i.i.d. (independently and identically distributed) according to a fixed but unknown probability distribution. However, most of the existing learning to rank approaches are proposed on the basis of the conventional i.i.d. assumption. In this paper, the conventional i.i.d. assumption is relaxed to fit the real situations of information retrieval better, and then a new ranking approach, referred to as 'query dependent ranking', is proposed. In our approach, the ranking models for different queries have generality while each of them has its own speciality. The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show the advantage of our approach to conventional ranking approaches.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3185-4","10.1109/WAIM.2008.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4597023","Information retrieval;Learning to rank;structural risk minimization","Collaboration;Educational institutions;Information filtering;Information filters;Information management;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Probability distribution;Statistical learning;Supervised learning","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;query processing","document retrieval;information retrieval;probability distribution;query dependent ranking","","1","","17","","","20-22 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, word order and phrases are often critical to capturing the meaning of text in many text mining tasks. This paper presents topical n-grams, a topic model that discovers topics as well as topical phrases. The probabilistic model generates words in their textual order by, for each word, first sampling a topic, then sampling its status as a unigram or bigram, and then sampling the word from a topic-specific unigram or bigram distribution. Thus our model can model ""white house"" as a special meaning phrase in the 'politics' topic, but not in the 'real estate' topic. Successive bigrams form longer phrases. We present experiments showing meaningful phrases and more interpretable topics from the NIPS data and improved information retrieval performance on a TREC collection.","1550-4786;15504786","POD:0-7695-3018-4","10.1109/ICDM.2007.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4470313","","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Context modeling;Data mining;Information retrieval;Natural language processing;Neuroscience;Sampling methods;Text mining;Vocabulary","data mining;information retrieval;probability;sampling methods;text analysis","information retrieval;phrase/topic discovery;probabilistic model;text mining;topic model;topic-specific bigram distribution;topic-specific unigram distribution;topical n-grams;word sampling","","63","4","15","","","28-31 Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle this problem, a triple is defined in this paper as a data structure for the integration of a pair of concepts as well as a verb phrase or sometimes a special noun we extract from the sentence as the relation of the concepts pair. We applied the advanced ontology-based approach to extract generic concepts and relations by using both UMLS and WordNet, and implemented a new approach to rank retrieved passages from documents corresponding to measuring system performance mentioned in TREC 2007 Genomics Track.

While future networks will need to be able to self-adapt, the dynamic and autonomous nature of such networks will make the supervision process more difficult to implement in programming terms. Stigmergic linking is a lightweight and flexible way to provide some form of optimisation. If evaluation functions can also measure the success of any query, then it may be possible to monitor the performance of the self-optimisation. A supervision system could adjust the link update method until an acceptable balance between search time and quality of service is reached. Thus at least in this respect, autonomic supervision would be possible. The monitoring system might also monitor dasiaconcept driftpsila and detect when it occurs. This measures typical boundaries for concepts of interest and detects when these boundaries are violated. When concept drift occurs, the system would be able to tell if this resulted from a fault or simply a change in the system use and thus be able to apply the appropriate solution.","","CD-ROM:978-963-9799-05-9","10.1109/BIMNICS.2007.4610124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4610124","Stigmergy;self-adaptation;self-organisation;supervision","Automatic testing;Computer networks;Data mining;Dynamic programming;Information retrieval;Joining processes;Mathematics;Monitoring;Permission;Quality of service","distributed processing;fault tolerant computing;quality of service;query processing;system monitoring","autonomic supervision system;autonomous monitoring system;concept drift;distributed information retrieval;information sources network;link update method;quality of service;stigmergic linking;stigmergic self-organisation","","2","","8","","","10-12 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These key objects serve as a catalogue of regions to be searched and matched from rest of the movie, using viewpoint invariant regions calculation, providing the location, size, and orientation of all the objects occurring in the movie in the form of a set of structures collaborating as video profile. The profile provides information about occurrences of every single key object from every frame of the movie it exists in.

We conduct an exploratory study to investigate the suitability of information retrieval (IR) techniques for scalable identification of commonalities and variabilities in requirement specifications for software product lines. Accordingly, based on observations derived from industrial experience and on state-of-the-art research and practice, we also propose an initial framework, leveraging IR to systematically abstract requirements from existing specifications of a given domain into a feature model.

"A Heuristic Approach for Segmentation Granularity Problem in Chinese Information Retrieval","D. Fan; W. Bin; W. Sili","","Sixth International Conference on Advanced Language Processing and Web Information Technology (ALPIT 2007)","20080303","2007","","","87","91","In Chinese information retrieval, documents are usually segmented into words and then indexed by these words. However, segmentation granularity problem (SDP) should be considered because small granularity may lead to low precision and efficiency while big granularity may cause low recall. To solve the problem, this paper proposes an intuitive and heuristic approach. Two-level index for the segmentation dictionary is built by which the original query word could be expanded with its weighted overlaid words. This method not only reserves the advantage of big granularity in precision, but also overcome its disadvantage in recall. The experimental results show that our approach slightly but consistently outperforms the baseline.","","POD:978-0-7695-2930-1","10.1109/ALPIT.2007.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4460620","","Computers;Dictionaries;Frequency;Indexing;Information retrieval;Information technology;Large-scale systems;Natural languages;Particle separators","","","","0","","10","","","22-24 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to identify the key visual patterns of specific objects from either static images or video frames. It is shown how the performance of such visual-to-semantic matching schemes can be improved by describing these key visual patterns using particular combinations of multiple visual features. A multi-objective learning mechanism is designed to derive a suitable merging metric for different features. The core of this mechanism is a widely used optimisation method - the multi-objective optimisation strategies. Assessment of the proposed technique has been conducted to validate its performance with natural images and videos.","2158-5873;21585873","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3130-4; POD:978-0-7695-3344-5","10.1109/WIAMIS.2008.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4556888","","Bridges;Extraterrestrial measurements;Image analysis;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Merging;Optimization methods;Pattern matching;Vectors","image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);merging","multi-feature merging approach;multi-objective learning mechanism;optimisation method;visual information annotation;visual information retrieval","","0","","19","","","7-9 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our formalization relies upon the Schrodinger Picture, creating an analogy between the dynamics of a physical system and the kinematics of probabilities generated by Logical Imaging. By using Quantum Theory, it is possible to model more precisely contextual information in a seamless and principled fashion within the Logical Imaging process. While further work is needed to empirically validate this, the foundations for doing so are provided.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:978-0-7695-3299-8","10.1109/DEXA.2008.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624683","Information Retrieval;Logical Imaging;Quantum Theory;kinematics","Context modeling;Expert systems;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Kinematics;Optical imaging;Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Solid modeling","formal logic;information retrieval;probability;quantum computing;text analysis","Schrodinger Picture;information retrieval;logical imaging process;probability kinematic;quantum system;quantum theory;text document","","0","","25","","","1-5 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GPS is the positioning technology that powers the majority of the navigation devices today, it comes along with high complexity, high energy consumption and limited coverage for indoor. The main idea of this paper is to exploit cooperation among mobile devices to retrieve their geographical position without using GPS. The information used by the proposed mechanism is only based on the cell-id and the signal strength. Google has launched something similar for stand alone mobile phones with its new feature called My Location. We enhance this service using cooperation among mobile devices sharing the knowledge of cell IDs and signal strength. In this paper, after a short introduction about the proposed method, we are going to show how cooperation improves mobile devices' localization. We propose a new architecture that aims to localize mobile phones without using GPS devices. Afterwards, we are going to describe our setup and to discuss the achieved results. The main result of this paper is that the proposed scheme with three cooperating mobile devices can reduce the estimation area of more than five times compared to cell ID approaches such as the one of Google.","2164-7038;21647038","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2052-0","10.1109/ICCW.2008.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531881","","Communications Society;Conferences;Databases;Global Positioning System;Information retrieval;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Navigation;Urban areas;Wireless LAN","Global Positioning System;indoor radio;information retrieval;mobile handsets;search engines","GPS;Global Positioning System;Google;cell IDs;indoor applications;localization information retrieval exploiting cooperation;mobile applications;mobile devices localization;mobile phones;signal strength","","4","1","12","","","19-23 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Music is one of the most popular types of online information and there are now hundreds of music streaming and download services operating on the World-Wide Web. Some of the music collections available are approaching the scale of ten million tracks and this has posed a major challenge for searching, retrieving, and organizing music content. Research efforts in music information retrieval have involved experts from music perception, cognition, musicology, engineering, and computer science engaged in truly interdisciplinary activity that has resulted in many proposed algorithmic and methodological solutions to music search using content-based methods. This paper outlines the problems of content-based music information retrieval and explores the state-of-the-art methods using audio cues (e.g., query by humming, audio fingerprinting, content-based music retrieval) and other cues (e.g., music notation and symbolic representation), and identifies some of the major challenges for the coming years.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2008.916370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4472077","Audio signal processing;content-based music information retrieval;symbolic processing;user interfaces","Cognition;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Digital signal processing;Fingerprint recognition;Marketing and sales;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Organizing;Signal processing algorithms","Internet;content-based retrieval;information retrieval;music","World-Wide Web;cognition;content-based music information retrieval;download services;music content;music downloading;music industry;music perception;music streaming;music tracks;musicology;online music collections;online products;online services","","167","19","133","","","April 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
