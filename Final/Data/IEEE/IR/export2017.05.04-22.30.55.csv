However, with the widely application of Web2.0, the traditional web information extraction technology can't meet the needs of users. The traditional web information extraction is mainly directed against the static HTML pages, while it is powerless with the dynamic web page which contains Ajax. So, how to efficiently extract information in dynamic web pages becomes one of a difficult problem in the information extraction field. In this paper, a method about web information extraction based on Ajax is proposed through the thorough investigation into the traditional Web information extraction. Compared with the traditional web information extraction technology, its advantage is embedded with a dynamic web processing engine in the process of DOM (Document Object Model) tree produce. The engine will be used exclusively to analytic the dynamic web pages for the DOM tree and real-time update the DOM tree. Experimental results show that, this method can better extract information of dynamic web pages.","2378-8941;23788941","Electronic:978-0-7695-4464-9; POD:978-1-4577-0788-9","10.1109/BCGIn.2011.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6003882","Ajax;DOM tree;Embedded processing engine;Information extraction","Data mining;Engines;HTML;Natural language processing;Servers;Web pages;XML","Internet;Java;Web sites;XML;information retrieval","Ajax;DOM tree;HTML;Internet;Web information extraction technology;Web2.0;document object model;dynamic web page;dynamic web processing engine","","2","","6","","","29-31 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The levels are interconnected with forward and backward connections that are used for the robust initialization of multi-reasoning procedures (inheritance, recognition and intersection search) at the semantic level. Multi-reasoning supports reasoning for an unknown concept (i.e., a concept that is not defined at the semantic level), parallel reasoning for more than one concept that is obtained by forward connections from the associative level and used for multiple initialization, and the chaining of associative information retrieval and the reasoning process using forward and backward connections.

This paper discusses how energy consumption is a critical concern for video servers and can limit their throughput. We investigate the energy consumption of storage components (disks) in video servers and propose two ways to reduce it for better throughput. First, we organize data on disks in a way that allows easier access by exploiting the inherent properties of video access patterns and giving priority to more important video data. Second, the prioritized ordering of video data allows the server to retrieve only the data required to meet quality of service agreements in an energy efficient way. Therefore, the video quality delivered to clients may be scaled in order to service more concurrent requests and/or reduce energy consumption. Results show that our strategies can increase the number of clients served by as much as 114% when compared to conventional approaches while also meeting constraints on video quality and energy consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1221-0; POD:978-1-4577-1222-7","10.1109/IGCC.2011.6008589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6008589","Data organization;Disk scheduling;Disks;Energy management;Quality degradation;Video on demand","Niobium","Internet;disc storage;information retrieval;power aware computing;video on demand;video retrieval;video servers","Internet;energy-aware video storage;service agreement;storage component;video access pattern;video retrieval;video server environment;video sharing;video streaming","","3","","10","","","25-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a common practice, the full distance matrix is computed and each row of the matrix interpreted as an artificial feature vector.

A clinical data repository (CDR) therefore requires an efficient format for storing data so it can meet the access demands of prediction algorithms for clinical decision support. We have developed a new hybrid entity-attribute-value (EAV) storage format for CDRs that is compared with the common simple and multidata-type EAV formats. Their performance is evaluated with regard to querying millions of data points from clinical sources to assess the amount of storage space the data use, the speed with which the data can be obtained, and the complexity of the queries required to retrieve the data. Performance results showed that our hybrid EAV approach provides a nice balance of the simple and multidata-type formats that scales well as the amount of data in the CDR increases. The hybrid format is faster, uses less complex queries, and allows the data to remain in its original data type while using the same amount of storage space as the simple and multidata-type formats.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2011.2122850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5738684","Data acquisition;data storage systems;decision support systems;medical information systems;performance evaluation","Biomedical imaging;Biomedical monitoring;Blood;Databases;Laboratories;Monitoring;Pediatrics","data acquisition;information retrieval;medical computing;medical information systems;performance evaluation","clinical data repository;clinical decision support;data retrieval;hybrid entity-attribute-value storage format;hybrid format;medical event;multidata-type format;performance evaluation;prediction algorithm;real-time prediction;storage space;various storage format","","4","","18","","20110324","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper begins with indexing conceptual graphs of the abstracts of technological books by handwork, which results in some frequently-used conceptual relations that are taken as a relation set for indexing conceptual graphs. Then, a conceptual terms library, which is used to help recognize the terms of text, is constructed through thesaurus, and MBL is adopted to construct the conceptual relation of a sentence. And then, an algorithm of automatically generating conceptual graphs is proposed, and a prototype system for semi-automatically indexing conceptual graphs is developed.

We construct a Chinese to Korean CLSMR system that translates Chinese queries into Korean, retrieves content, and then translates the Korean tags in the search results back into Chinese. Our system translates NEs using a dictionary of bilingual NE pairs from Wikipedia and a pattern-based software translator which learns regular NE patterns from the web. The top-10 precision of YouTube retrieved results for our system was 0.39875. The K-C NE tag translation accuracy for the top-10 YouTube results was 77.6%, which shows that our translation method is fairly effective for named entities. A questionnaire given to users showed that automatically translated tags were considered as informative as a human-written summary.

Although online reviews are becoming increasingly important, consumers face two major challenges of usability and robustness when they make purchase decisions based on the available reviews. More specifically, usability issues arise when consumers need to be able to extract relevant information given a high volume of data with uncertainty due to high variance. For robustness, judging the degree of truthfulness of the available recommendations can be a daunting task for consumers. In this paper, we propose a post-purchase tracking system as an enhancement to current online recommendation systems by embracing a peer review process and ask each consumer to score the reviews that previous consumers have posted. Furthermore, we propose to visualize the peer review processes such that people find the recommendation systems more efficient and useful to learn information. Our preliminary user study results indicate that our post-purchase tracking system is a promising approach that can help online consumers determine what information to trust with high confidence.","1095-2055;10952055","Electronic:978-1-4577-0638-7; POD:978-1-4577-0637-0","10.1109/ICCCN.2011.6005882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005882","","Cameras;Color;Context;Interviews;Robustness;Usability;Visualization","Internet;human computer interaction;information retrieval;purchasing;recommender systems;retail data processing","online recommendation systems;peer review process;post-purchase tracking system;product reviews;relevant information extraction;robustness improvement;service reviews;usability improvement","","0","","12","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web prefetching is the process of accessing the web objects before the user's request. Whenever a client requests before accessing the web page a prediction is made for accessing that web page. All the web objects are brought from server to the client. The access to the web objects are on the basis of the data prefetched from the server. This research focused on when a user requests for a web page, how to improve the overall performance of web prefetching mechanism? The proposed mechanism provides the pages locally available to a user or group of users by utilizing bandwidth of the network.

In service-oriented environments, when there are a few service providers providing the same service, a service client would be keen to know the trustworthiness of each service provider in the forthcoming transaction. The trust rating of a delivered service from a service provider can be predicted according to a set of advertised QoS data collected by the trust management authority. Although trust and QoS are qualitative by nature, most data sets represent trust and QoS in the ordinal form for the sake of simplicity. This paper introduces a new approach based on Fuzzy Linear Regression Analysis (FLRA) to extract qualitative information from quantitative data and so use the obtained qualitative information for better modeling of the data. For verification purposes, the proposed approach can be applied for the trust prediction in the forthcoming transaction based on a set of advertised QoS in service-oriented environments.","1098-7584;10987584","Electronic:978-1-4244-7317-5; POD:978-1-4244-7315-1; USB:978-1-4244-7316-8","10.1109/FUZZY.2011.6007745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6007745","Fuzzy linear regression;Quality of service;Trust prediction","Data models;Linear regression;Quality of service;System-on-a-chip;Uncertainty;Web services","information retrieval;quality of service;regression analysis;security of data;service-oriented architecture","QoS;data modeling;fuzzy linear regression analysis;qualitative information extraction;quality of services;quantitative data;service client;service providers;service-oriented computing;service-oriented environments;trust management authority;trust prediction;trust rating prediction","","1","","16","","","27-30 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GC, Tehran, Iran","2011 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing","20110905","2011","","","504","511","Low coupling is a service-oriented design and development principle that should be taken into account during all stages. Having loosely coupled services not only increases service reusability, but also prevents the propagation of changes to other services and thus simplifies maintenance of service-oriented systems as well. In this paper, we focus on measuring conceptual coupling as an indicator of how much a service depends on the other services from functional point of view. Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a well-known technique in the field of information retrieval (IR) which has been widely used to measure the degree of semantic relationship between text based documents. In this paper, a metric namely CCS is proposed to measure the degree of conceptual coupling of a service to its environment based on the LSI technique. The proposed metric is evaluated theoretically based on a set of coupling principles.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4462-5; POD:978-1-4577-0863-3","10.1109/SCC.2011.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009300","Software metric;service conceptual coupling;service-oriented design principle","Business;Couplings;Large scale integration;Matrix decomposition;Measurement;Semantics;Service oriented architecture","indexing;information retrieval;service-oriented architecture","information retrieval;latent semantic indexing;service conceptual coupling;service oriented design;service oriented systems;service reusability","","1","","17","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A layered model of viewing DPSs is proposed consisting of the data acquisition, syntactic and semantic layers. It is shown that by defining all three layers, a DPS may be generated and managed exclusively by its declarative definition. This will increase the agility and efficiency with which DPSs may be deployed and managed. As a development model, a set of reusable messages are created, these messages are to be semantically annotated using a view over the domain ontology and are syntactically represented such that they may be exported to XML Schema. These messages are used within the DPS definition where their views over the domain ontology are parametrized and the data acquisition layer is defined to acquire data from the source.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4463-2; POD:978-1-4577-0842-8","10.1109/ICWS.2011.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009429","","Data acquisition;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics;Syntactics;Unified modeling language;Web services","XML;data acquisition;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","XML schema;data acquisition layer;data providing service;data retrieval;declarative definition;declarative development;development model;domain ontology;multilayered approach;reusable message;semantic description;semantic layer;syntactic layer","","2","","16","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This information, if extracted, could be of significant importance in several realms such as containing the spread of disease, understanding information flow in social systems and predicting likely future interactions. A popular method of discovering structure in networks is through community detection which attempts to capture the extent to which that network is different from a random network. However, communities are not very well defined for time-varying networks. In this paper, we introduce the notion of spatio-temporal communities that attempts to capture the structure in spatial connections as well as temporal changes in a network. We illustrate the notion via several examples and list the challenges in effectively discovering spatio-temporal communities. For example, such communities are lost if the temporal interactions are aggregated in a single weighted network since the concurrency information is lost. We present an approach that first extracts concurrency information via node-clustering on each snapshot. Each node is then assigned a vector of community memberships over time, which is then used to group nodes into overlapping communities via recently introduced link clustering techniques. However we measure similarity (of nodes and edges) based on concurrence, i.e. when they existed, if they existed together. We call our approach the co-community algorithm. We validate our approach using several real-world data sets spanning multiple contexts.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1051-3; POD:978-1-4577-1049-0","10.1109/NSW.2011.6004643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004643","Data mining;community detection;contact graph;social network;temporal data","Clustering algorithms;Communities;Concurrent computing;Data mining;Electronic mail;Humans;Image edge detection","information networks;information retrieval;network theory (graphs);pattern clustering;random processes;spatiotemporal phenomena","cocommunity algorithm;community detection;concurrency information extraction;link clustering technique;node clustering;random network;spatiotemporal community;time-evolving proximity networks;time-varying networks","","3","","13","","","22-24 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Information Extraction technology is one of alternatives that can solve this problem. Conventional Natural Language Processing approach is hampered by its portability, scalability and adaptability. Introduction of Machine Learning into Information Extraction is one of solutions. Inductive Learning only needs annotated training examples. The problem is there is no performance consistency of algorithms on various information domains. Automatic and smart classifier selection from various machine learning algorithms is one of the best way to handle this problem. The goal of this paper is to propose a method for Information Extraction System based on Inductive Learning and Meta Learning that have good performance. In this paper Multi-Inductive Learning is developed to answer that question. Multi-Inductive Learning is consist of several Inductive Learning algorithms that have significant difference in their mechanism. This is to ensure there is bias variance in this method. Through k-fold cross validation on training document, Multi-Inductive Learning algorithm can choose the best classifier for each slot on a certain domain. These best classifiers then employ to do full extraction on testing document. The conducted experiment shows that Multi-Inductive Learning has better performance than that of single Inductive Learning algorithm-based Information Extraction systems. On Reuters Corporate Acquisition, Multi-Inductive Learning gives a score of 46.3 % and has the best performance among other state of the art information systems. Out of nine slots that should be extracted, six of them give the best performance. Multi-Inductive Learning also gives better performance on Job Posting dataset.

Second, traditional search engines treat all keywords as the same importance and cannot differentiate the importance of one keyword from that of another. Third, traditional search engines lack an applicable classification mechanism to reduce the search space and improve the search results. In this paper, we develop a fuzzy search engine, called Fuzzy-Go. First, a fuzzy ontology is constructed by using fuzzy logic to capture the similarities of terms in the ontology, which offering appropriate semantic distances between terms to accomplish the semantic search of keywords. The Fuzzy Go search engine can thus automatically retrieve web pages that contain synonyms or terms similar to keywords. Second, users can input multiple keywords with different degrees of importance based on their needs. The totally satisfactory degree of keywords can be aggregated based on their degrees of importance and degrees of satisfaction.

Existing retrieval methods of multimedia data are annotation-based retrieval, feature-based retrieval and annotation, and feature integration based retrieval. These systems take the annotator a lot of effort and time, and we have to perform complicated calculations for feature extraction. Also, user-friendly and semantic searching techniques are not supported. For this purpose, a new interactive tool for multimedia content acquisition and classification has been developed. The user can decompose a given multimedia content into units and easily annotate each until adding basic information such as place, time, locate, etc. as well classification information such as even type, relationship type, etc. according to the MPEG-7 standard. At the end of this production, the tool automatically produces a semantic description of the overall set of the annotated units.

As the magnitude of Web Coverage Service (WCS) and Sensor Observation Service (SOS) becomes increasingly large, a major problem is how to make fast and fully robust use of such data services in a Web-ready sensors environment. A new method is proposed, Real-time Coverage Service (RCS), for serving observational data based on the integration of WCS and SOS. The RCS method hides the complexity of a series of information models and service interfaces in the Earth Observation (EO) and Sensor Web world, allowing near-real-time on-demand access to geospatial observations. The core components-dynamical schema transformer and automatic information extractor-are designed and implemented based on service middleware technology. The Observations & Measurements (O&M) schema of SOS and coverage schema of WCS are matched by schema transformer dynamically. The coverage information is extracted from a SOS “GetObservation” operation by an information extractor and served by a WCS “GetCoverage” operation on-demand. Experiments on the feasibility of Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) Hyperion data retrieval for the RCS method and OGC Sensor Web SOS method were conducted and their efficiency compared.

Ontology technique plays an important role in data integrating and semantic web searching. However, it is a hard work for experts to abstract ontology network for complex application, especially from the heterogeneous data sources. In this paper, automatic ontology discovery method is researched to generate local ontology network from relational data base schema. The data column characteristic, primary key and foreign key relations of the separated data base dictionary are analyzed. Then, ontology reasoning is used to eliminate the inconsistence among the distributed ontology networks. Business process driven method is proposed to merge the local ontology network into a global ontology network to reflect the enterprise knowledge. Finally, the method is demonstrated in a hospital ontology system constructing. The result shows that ontology discovery method could abstract initial ontology efficiently from data base and the local ontology could be combined to enterprise global ontology.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-181-6; POD:978-1-61284-180-9","10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019626","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6019626","business process model;clinic ontology;distributed information system;ontology discovery","Business;Cognition;Distributed databases;Educational institutions;Merging;Ontologies;Semantics","business data processing;data integrity;dictionaries;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);relational databases;semantic Web","abstract ontology network;business process model;data integrity;database dictionary;domain knowledge;enterprise global ontology;enterprise knowledge;formal description;heterogeneous data sources;hospital ontology system;ontology discovery method;relational database;semantic Web searching","","0","","11","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use an RDF query rewriting algorithm to determine the relevant services. The fuzzy constraints of the relevant services are matched to those of the query using a set of matching methods. We rank-order services using a justification of Pareto dominance, then compute the top-k service compositions. We propose also a method to improve the diversity of returned compositions while maintaining as possible the compositions with the highest scores.

Users often have vague or imprecise ideas when searching the XML and may not be able to formulate queries that accurately express their query intentions. Therefore, user might like to issue fuzzy queries that consist of fuzzy predicates for possibly retrieving. Based on fuzzy sets theory and the knowledge base related to the application domain, this paper presents an approach which can translate the fuzzy predicates of the fuzzy query into the precise predicates and extends the query criteria ranges in order to provide approximate answers to the user. The fuzzy predicate is first defined by a membership function, and then is translated into the precise predicate by using the α-cut operation of the fuzzy number. The document segments of XML document satisfying the fuzzy query are returned by using twig pattern matching method and finally ranked according to their satisfaction degree. Experimental results identified that the fuzzy query answering method can meet user's needs effectively.","2157-9555;21579555","Electronic:978-1-4244-9953-3; POD:978-1-4244-9950-2","10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6022087","XML;fuzzy query;knowledge base;ranking;twig pattern matching","Approximation methods;Educational institutions;Fuzzy set theory;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching;Relational databases;XML","XML;fuzzy set theory;knowledge based systems;pattern matching;query processing;question answering (information retrieval)","α-cut operation;Extensible Markup Language;Internet;XML;data interchange;fuzzy predicate;fuzzy query answering method;fuzzy sets theory;knowledge-based approach;satisfaction degree;twig pattern matching method","","0","","15","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
