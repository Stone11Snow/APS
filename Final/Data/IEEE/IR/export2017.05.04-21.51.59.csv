Proceedings.","20040824","2004","","","278","287","Most offline handwriting recognition approaches proceed by segmenting words into smaller pieces (usually characters) which are recognized separately. The recognition result of a word is then the composition of the individually recognized parts. Inspired by results in cognitive psychology, researchers have begun to focus on holistic word recognition approaches. Here we present a holistic word recognition approach for single-author historical documents, which is motivated by the fact that for severely degraded documents a segmentation of words into characters will produce very poor results. The quality of the original documents does not allow us to recognize them with high accuracy - our goal here is to produce transcriptions that will allow successful retrieval of images, which has been shown to be feasible even in such noisy environments. We believe that this is the first systematic approach to recognizing words in historical manuscripts with extensive experiments. Our experiments show recognition accuracy of 65%, which exceeds performance of other systems which operate on non-degraded input images (nonhistorical documents).","","POD:0-7695-2088-X","10.1109/DIAL.2004.1263256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263256","","Character recognition;Degradation;Handwriting recognition;Humans;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Libraries;Psychology;Working environment noise","document image processing;handwritten character recognition;history;image retrieval;word processing","cognitive psychology;handwritten single-author historical documents;holistic word recognition;image retrieval","","67","2","19","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most feature weighting methods in the literature assume that the space is numeric (either discrete or continuous) and so not applicable to abstract feature weighting.

The emergence of robust and reliable peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies now brings to reality what we call ""cooperative caching "" in which mobile clients can access data items from the cache in their neighboring peers. We discuss cooperative caching in mobile environments and proposes a cooperative caching scheme for mobile systems, called COCA. In COCA, we identify two types of mobile clients: low activity and high activity. They are referred to as low activity mobile client/host (LAM) and high activity mobile client/host (HAM) respectively. Both LAM and HAM can share their cache. The server replicates appropriate data items to LAMs so that HAMs can take advantages of the LAM replicas. The performance of pure COCA and COCA with the data replication scheme is evaluated through a number of simulated experiments which show that COCA significantly reduces both the server workload in terms of number of requests and the access miss ratio when the MHs reside outside of the service area. The COCA with the data replication scheme can improve the overall system performance in other aspects as well.","","POD:0-7695-2087-1","10.1109/ICDCSW.2004.1284083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1284083","","Bluetooth;Communication standards;Communications technology;Cooperative caching;File servers;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;System performance","cache storage;client-server systems;mobile computing;performance evaluation;replicated databases","COCA;data replication scheme;data retrieval performance;high activity mobile client/host;mobile client;mobile client/host;mobile environment;mobile system;peer-to-peer cooperative caching;system performance","","7","","11","","","23-24 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, such alignment algorithms allow us to produce large quantities of ground truth data for evaluating handwriting recognition algorithms. Third, such algorithms allow us to produce indices in a straightforward manner for handwriting material.

One of the standard ways of extracting color feature from an image is to generate a color histogram. Using Haar wavelet or Daubechies' wavelet the texture feature of an image can be extracted. These two feature vectors and the feature vectors in the database are normalized so that the value of a bin is always between [0,1]. During retrieval, both color and texture feature vectors of query image is combined, weighted and compared with the color and texture feature vectors of each of the database images using Manhattan distance metric. The retrieved result is dependent on the weight given to each of the feature vector. We have done a detailed study of the performance of different combination of weights to color (w<sub>c</sub>) and texture (w<sub>t</sub>) features on a large database of images. Different combination weights are used in for evaluation and the results shows that texture feature vector weight (W<sub>t</sub>) in the range of W<sub>c</sub> ±0.1 to w<sub>c</sub> ±0.2 perform better than the other combinations.","","POD:0-7803-8243-9","10.1109/ICISIP.2004.1287638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287638","","Application software;Computer science;Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image storage;Information retrieval;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;visual databases;wavelet transforms","Daubechies wavelet;Haar wavelet;Manhattan distance metric;color feature vectors;color histogram;content based image retrieval;image database;query image;texture feature vectors;weighted feature vector","","13","","20","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the propagation delay is negligible, CSI-based carrier sensing achieves the highest energy efficiency of the opportunistic strategy.

To address the problem, we propose the concept of configurable parameter. A configurable parameter is a constant or a variable defined in a component which, when adjusted, can provide QoS trade-offs. A QoS properties reconfigurable (QoS-R) component is a software component which can be reconfigured either statically or dynamically to provide desired QoS tradeoffs.

This kind of system presents a relatively short set of words that denotes impressions and users estimate one or more words from this with a graphical user interface (GUI) to input into the system. With this approach, an increased number of words presented leads to increased costs for the user, in terms of the time and labor required to enter impressions. Conversely, a set of words that is too limited will often leave users unable to accurately represent their target impressions. We therefore compare the accuracy of retrieval and convenience of using an NLI (natural language interface) and GUI, which we introduced into an impression-based music-retrieval system.

Although the problem of how to deal with non-registered musical instruments is essential in musical instrument identification, it has not been dealt with in previous studies. Our method solves this problem by distinguishing between registered and non-registered instruments and identifying the category name of the non-registered instruments. When a given sound is registered, its instrument name, e.g. violin, is identified. Even if it is not registered, its category name, e.g. strings, can be identified. The important issue in achieving such identification is to adopt a musical instrument hierarchy reflecting the acoustical similarity. We present a method for acquiring such a hierarchy from a musical instrument sound database.

In particular, it is outlined how a suitable choice of the excitation of the impinging wave makes it possible to improve the reconstruction capabilities of the solution algorithm.

The emergence of robust and reliable peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies now brings to reality what we call ""cooperative caching"" in which mobile clients can access data items from the cache in their neighboring peers. This paper considers a COoperative CAching scheme for mobile systems, called COCA. A cache signature scheme is devised for COCA that provides hints for the mobile clients to determine whether a required data item is cached by their neighboring peers based on their local state. The trade-off between the improvement in system performance and the overheads of the cache signature scheme in COCA is discussed. The performance of COCA with and without the cache signature scheme is evaluated through a number of simulated experiments. COCA is shown to be capable of effectively reducing the number of server requests and power consumption, as well as shortening the access latency as the number of neighboring peers increases. The inclusion of cache signature scheme further improves on the access latency.","","POD:0-7695-2051-0","10.1109/AINA.2004.1283894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1283894","","Cache storage;Communications technology;Cooperative caching;Delay;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;System performance","cache storage;cooperative systems;information retrieval;mobile computing","access latency;cache signatures;data retrieval;mobile clients;mobile environments;peer-to-peer cooperative caching;power consumption;server requests","","9","","13","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Trellis-SDP is layered on top of the Trellis infrastructure, a software system for creating overlay metacomputers: user-level aggregations of computer systems. Trellis-SDP provides a master-worker programming framework where the worker components can run self-contained, new or existing binary applications.

The backbone of the semantic Web is a shared uniform structure which defines how Web information is split up regardless of the implementation language or the syntax used to represent the data. This structure is known as an ontology. As information on the Web increases significantly in size, Web ontologies also tend to grow bigger, to such an extent that they become too large to be used in their entirety by any single application. This has stimulated our work in the area of sub-ontology extraction where each user may extract optimized sub-ontologies from an existing base ontology. Sub-ontologies are valid independent ontologies, known as materialized ontologies, that are specifically extracted to meet certain needs. Because of the size of the original ontology, the process of repeatedly iterating the millions of nodes and relationships to form an optimized sub-ontology can be very extensive. Therefore we have identified the need for a distributed approach to the extraction process.

At the early stage of CBIR, research primarily focused on exploring various feature representation and ignored the subjectivity of human perception. There exists a gap between high-level concepts and low-level features. As an effective solution, the RF technique has been used on many CBIR systems to improve the retrieval precision.

MOBIQUITOUS 2004.","20040903","2004","","","236","245","A continuous nearest neighbor (CNN) search retrieves the nearest neighbors corresponding to every point in a given query line segment. It is important for location-based services such as vehicular navigation tools and tourist guides. It is infeasible to answer a CNN search by issuing a traditional nearest neighbor query at every point of the line segment due to the large number of queries generated and the large overhead on bandwidth. Algorithms have been proposed recently to support CNN search in the traditional client-server service model. In this paper, we conduct a pioneering study on CNN search in wireless data broadcast environments. We propose two air indexing techniques, namely, R-tree air index and Hilbert curve air index, and develop algorithms based on these two techniques to search CNNs on the air. A simulation is conducted to compare the proposed air indexing techniques with a naive broadcast approach. The result shows that both of the proposed methods outperform the naive approach significantly. The Hilbert Curve air index is superior for uniform data distributions, while the R-tree air index is a better choice for skewed data distributions.","","POD:0-7695-2208-4","10.1109/MOBIQ.2004.1331730","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331730","","Broadcast technology;Cellular neural networks;Indexing;Information retrieval;Mobile computing;Nearest neighbor searches;Pervasive computing;Radio broadcasting;Road transportation;Satellite broadcasting","broadcasting;client-server systems;database indexing;mobile computing;mobile handsets;mobility management (mobile radio);query processing;statistical distributions;tree searching","Hilbert curve air index;R-tree air index;client-server service model;continuous nearest neighbor search;location-based services;query line segment;skewed data distributions;uniform data distributions;vehicular navigation tools;wireless data broadcast environments","","6","","10","","","22-26 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Efficient phrase-based document indexing for Web document clustering","K. M. Hammouda; M. S. Kamel","Dept. of Syst.

To achieve more accurate document clustering, more informative features including phrases and their weights are particularly important in such scenarios. Document clustering is particularly useful in many applications such as automatic categorization of documents, grouping search engine results, building a taxonomy of documents, and others. This article presents two key parts of successful document clustering. The first part is a novel phrase-based document index model, the document index graph, which allows for incremental construction of a phrase-based index of the document set with an emphasis on efficiency, rather than relying on single-term indexes only. It provides efficient phrase matching that is used to judge the similarity between documents. The model is flexible in that it could revert to a compact representation of the vector space model if we choose not to index phrases. The second part is an incremental document clustering algorithm based on maximizing the tightness of clusters by carefully watching the pair-wise document similarity distribution inside clusters. The combination of these two components creates an underlying model for robust and accurate document similarity calculation that leads to much improved results in Web document clustering over traditional methods.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2004.58","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324634","65;Index Terms- Web mining;document clustering;document index graph;document similarity;document structure;phrase matching.;phrase-based indexing","Artificial intelligence;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data mining;Data models;Indexing;Information retrieval;Taxonomy;Text mining;Web mining","Internet;data mining;document handling;indexing;pattern clustering","Web document clustering;Web mining;automatic categorization;document data set;document index graph;document structure;pair-wise document similarity distribution;phrase matching;phrase-based document index model;search engine;single term analysis;vector space model","","105","15","45","","","Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This emphasizes the importance of information present in the LP residual of audio signals. But it is difficult to extract information from the residual using known signal processing algorithms. Autoassociative neural networks (AANN) models have been used to capture the distribution of feature vectors for pattern recognition tasks.

Two specific problems are studied: similarity search (searching for music sound files similar to a given music sound file) and emotion detection (detection of emotion in music sounds). The Daubechies wavelet coefficient histograms (Li, T. et al., SIGIR'03, p.282-9, 2003), which consist of moments of the coefficients calculated by applying the Db8 wavelet filter, are combined with the timbral features extracted using the MARSYAS system of G. Tzanctakis and P. Cook (see IEEE Trans. on Speech and Audio Process., vol.10, no.5, p.293-8, 2002) to generate compact music features. For the similarity search, the distance between two sound files is defined to be the Euclidean distance of their normalized representations. Based on the distance measure, the closest sound files to an input sound file are obtained. Experiments on jazz vocal and classical sound files achieve a very high level of accuracy. Emotion detection is cast as a multiclass classification problem, decomposed as a multiple binary classification problem, and is resolved with the use of support vector machines trained on the extracted features.

Searching information in these databases is a crucial problem to be solved for the development of visual information system. Therefore efficient retrieval methods are required for the purpose of finding a desired image from a collection of images. This research is focused on developing a shape-based image retrieval system for use in thematic databases. For this purpose, a novel shape similarity matching methodology is needed in order to detect a small similarity difference between two images. In this paper, a new shape transformation approach, referred to as NURBS-warping approach is implemented. In the proposed approach, non uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) and gradient vector flow (GVF) are incorporated to ensure accurate and fast retrieval results. NURBS is a compact and accurate shape descriptor, whereas GVF ensure fast and accurate matching results. The effectiveness of this approach is examined by carrying out experiments on a collection of 1100 similar images from a thematic fish database. The overall retrieval results show that the proposed approach is able to derive an accurate similarity measure that resembles human similarity judgement.","","POD:0-7803-8243-9","10.1109/ICISIP.2004.1287632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1287632","","Art;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Multimedia databases;Shape;Spline;Surface reconstruction;Surface topography;Visual databases","image matching;image retrieval;splines (mathematics);visual databases","gradient vector flow;image databases;multimedia applications;nonuniform rational B-spline warping method;searching information;shape based image retrieval system;shape descriptor;shape similarity matching methodology;shape transformation;thematic database;visual information system","","1","","14","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20040824","2004","","","174","187","A great number of documents are scanned and archived in the form of digital images in digital libraries, to make them available and accessible in the Internet. Information retrieval in these imaged documents has become a growing and challenging problem. For this purpose, a word image coding technique is proposed in this paper, and a Web-based system for efficiently retrieving imaged documents from digital libraries is described. Some image preprocessing is first carried out offline to extract word objects from imaged documents stored in the digital library. Then each word object is represented by a string of feature codes. As a result, each document image is represented by a series of feature code strings of its words, which are stored in a feature code file. Upon receiving a user's request, the server converts the query word into feature code string using the same conversion mechanism as is used in producing feature codes for the underlying imaged documents. Searching is then performed among those feature code files generated offline. An inexact string matching technique, with the ability of matching a word portion, is applied to match the query word with the words in the documents, and then the occurrence frequency of the query word in each corresponding document is calculated for relevant ranking. Preliminary experimental results with some imaged documents of students' theses in the digital library of our university show that the proposed approach is efficient and promising for retrieving imaged documents, with potential applications to digital libraries.","","POD:0-7695-2088-X","10.1109/DIAL.2004.1263247","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263247","","Computer science;Data mining;Digital images;Document image processing;Image coding;Image converters;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Optical character recognition software;Software libraries","Internet;digital libraries;document image processing;feature extraction;image coding;image retrieval;string matching;word processing","Internet;Web-based system;digital images;digital libraries;feature code file;feature code strings;image preprocessing;imaged document retrieval;inexact string matching technique;information retrieval;query word occurrence frequency;word image coding technique","","4","1","32","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extracting a bilingual dictionary from the Internet parallel documents is important to add words that are absent from the traditional dictionaries. This paper describes two algorithms to automatically extract an English/Arabic bilingual dictionary from parallel texts that exist in the Internet archive. The system should preferably be useful for many different language pairs. Like most of the systems done, the accuracy of our system is directly proportional to the amount of sentence pairs used.

We conclude from our multi-modal retrieval experiments the following working hypothesis: even though the automatic speech recognition run is usually better than the visual run, matching against both modalities ensures robustness against choosing the wrong content representation.

By analyzing and evaluating the collected utterances, the flexible processing requirements are discovered according to the user's age group. It becomes impossible to disregard the increase of child users when the system is installed in a public place. The paper proposes an automatic approach discriminating speakers between adult and child users, which is based on statistical learning. This proposal realizes a flexible spoken dialogue to both adult and child users. As for parameter vectors in machine learning, acoustic and linguistic properties extracted from speech recognition logarithm likelihood scores are adopted to discriminate a user's age group. Although GMM-based recognition uses only acoustic properties, this method can also consider linguistic properties. In experiments with SVM-based screening, we obtained a 92.4% discrimination rate to the actual users' utterances. The advantage of using linguistic properties is also shown.

"Biclustering algorithms for biological data analysis: a survey","S. C. Madeira; A. L. Oliveira","Beira Interior Univ., Covilha, Portugal","IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","20040824","2004","1","1","24","45","A large number of clustering approaches have been proposed for the analysis of gene expression data obtained from microarray experiments. However, the results from the application of standard clustering methods to genes are limited. This limitation is imposed by the existence of a number of experimental conditions where the activity of genes is uncorrelated. A similar limitation exists when clustering of conditions is performed. For this reason, a number of algorithms that perform simultaneous clustering on the row and column dimensions of the data matrix has been proposed. The goal is to find submatrices, that is, subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions, where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities for every condition. In this paper, we refer to this class of algorithms as biclustering. Biclustering is also referred in the literature as coclustering and direct clustering, among others names, and has also been used in fields such as information retrieval and data mining. In this comprehensive survey, we analyze a large number of existing approaches to biclustering, and classify them in accordance with the type of biclusters they can find, the patterns of biclusters that are discovered, the methods used to perform the search, the approaches used to evaluate the solution, and the target applications.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2004.2","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1324618","Biclustering;bidimensional clustering;biological data analysis;block clustering;coclustering;direct clustering;gene expression data.;microarray data analysis;simultaneous clustering;subspace clustering;two-mode clustering;two-sided clustering;two-way clustering","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data analysis;Data mining;Gene expression;Information retrieval;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis;Performance evaluation;Semiconductor device measurement","biology computing;genetics;molecular biophysics;pattern clustering","biclustering algorithms;biological data analysis;coclustering;data mining;direct clustering;gene expression;gene subgroups;information retrieval;microarray experiments","Algorithms;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;Gene Expression;Gene Expression Profiling;Humans;Models, Statistical;Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis;Saccharomyces cerevisiae","671","18","52","","","Jan.-March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"Multidimensional text classification for drug information","V. Lertnattee; T. Theeramunkong","Sirindhorn Int. Inst. of Technol., Thammasat Univ., Pathumthani, Thailand","IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine","20040903","2004","8","3","306","312","This paper proposes a multidimensional model for classifying drug information text documents. The concept of multidimensional category model is introduced for representing classes. In contrast with traditional flat and hierarchical category models, the multidimensional category model classifies each document using multiple predefined sets of categories, where each set corresponds to a dimension. Since a multidimensional model can be converted to flat and hierarchical models, three classification approaches are possible, i.e., classifying directly based on the multidimensional model and classifying with the equivalent flat or hierarchical models. The efficiency of these three approaches is investigated using drug information collection with two different dimensions: 1) drug topics and 2) primary therapeutic classes. In the experiments, k-nearest neighbor, naïve Bayes, and two centroid-based methods are selected as classifiers. The comparisons among three approaches of classification are done using two-way analysis of variance, followed by the Scheffe´'s test for post hoc comparison. The experimental results show that multidimensional-based classification performs better than the others, especially in the presence of a relatively small training set. As one application, a category-based search engine using the multidimensional category concept was developed to help users retrieve drug information.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2004.832542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1331408","","Analysis of variance;Classification tree analysis;Drugs;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Markup languages;Multidimensional systems;Search engines;Testing;Text categorization","Bayes methods;drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;search engines;text analysis","Scheffe test;category-based search engine;centroid-based methods;drug information;drug topics;hierarchical model;machine learning;multidimensional category model;multidimensional text classification;multidimensional-based classification;naive Bayes method;natural language processing;primary therapeutic class;variance two-way analysis","Abstracting and Indexing as Topic;Artificial Intelligence;Documentation;Drug Information Services;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internet;Natural Language Processing;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Periodicals as Topic;Pharmaceutical Preparations;Vocabulary, Controlled","6","","20","","","Sept. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Two prototypes were developed, differing in whether the keywords were manually generated by the author, or mechanically extracted by an automatic process. In both prototypes, different types of intra-document and inter-document links were generated. A preliminary evaluation on the first prototype (which was based on manually identified keywords) shows that this prototype system holds promise for further exploration. In the second prototype, keywords were automatically extracted with Oracle Text gist/theme generation tools. Although the automatically extracted keywords were different from those identified by authors, there was a significant overlap between the set of links generated by each prototype. The next step will be testing the usefulness of this automatic approach with a thorough user evaluation.","","POD:0-7695-2108-8","10.1109/ITCC.2004.1286467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1286467","","Automatic testing;Data mining;Humans;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Information science;Materials science and technology;Performance analysis;Prototypes;Technology management","content-based retrieval;hypermedia;information retrieval","Oracle Text gist generation tools;Oracle Text theme generation tools;automatic hyperlink generation;automatic keyword extraction;content analysis;information retrieval;inter-document links;intra-document links;keyword-based links","","1","","10","","","5-7 April 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Today, most spoken-document retrieval systems use large-vocabulary recognition. For the above scenarios, such systems suffer from both the unpredictable vocabulary/domain and generally high word-error rates (WER). We present a vocabulary-independent system to index and to search rapidly spontaneous speech. A speech recognizer generates lattices of phonetic word fragments, against which keywords are matched phonetically. We first show the need to use recognition alternatives (lattices) in a high-WER context, on a word-based baseline. Then we introduce our new method of phonetic word-fragment lattice generation, which uses longer-span language knowledge than a phoneme recognizer. Last we introduce heuristics to compact the lattices to feasible sizes that can be searched efficiently. On the LDC voice mail corpus, we show that vocabulary/domain-independent phonetic search is as accurate as a vocabulary/domain-dependent word-lattice based baseline system for in-vocabulary keywords (FOMs of 74-75%), but nearly maintains this accuracy also for out-of-vocabulary keywords.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-8484-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2004.1325970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1325970","","Asia;Audio recording;Broadcasting;Humans;Indexing;Information retrieval;Lattices;Speech recognition;Vocabulary;Voice mail","error statistics;query processing;speech processing;speech recognition","large-vocabulary recognition;phonetic word fragment lattice generation;speech recognizer;speech recordings;spoken keywords;spoken-document retrieval systems;spontaneous speech;vocabulary-independent search;word-error rates","","22","15","13","","","17-21 May 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key issue is how to encode a document without losing salient information. Current research almost always uses fixed-length vectors based on word (term) frequency (TF) and/or variants thereof. We explore the question of alternative encodings, and we search for such encodings using an evolutionary algorithm (EA). These alternatives consider a variety of other features that can be extracted from a document, and the EA explores the space of weighted combinations of these. Tests on the BankSearch dataset were able to find encodings which outperformed previous results using TF-based encodings. Among several tentative findings it seems clear that the ideal encoding is highly task-dependent, and we can recommend certain features as useful for specific types of document clustering tasks.","","POD:0-7803-8515-2","10.1109/CEC.2004.1330955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1330955","","Computer science;Encoding;Frequency;Information retrieval;Internet;Search engines;Semantic Web;Space exploration;Taxonomy;Web sites","Internet;evolutionary computation;pattern clustering;text analysis","BankSearch dataset;TF-based encodings;Web document clustering;Web intelligence;World Wide Web;document analysis;document encoding;document features;evolutionary algorithm;fixed-length vectors;semantic Web;term frequency","","2","","15","","","19-23 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, tasks like architectural restructuring have to be performed in a way that developed new system architectures allow reuse of all valuable legacy systems' parts with minimal changes. During architectural restructuring there are two major types of modification: detection of architecture disproportions and their refactoring and detection of redundancies and their fusion. We introduce a method for applying domain knowledge for supporting these restructuring steps. The method operates on feature models. Words and terms of features and of architectural documents are analyzed by cluster analysis, information retrieval and metrics techniques. In this way, the method joins the approaches of feature analysis and of enhancing reengineering with domain knowledge by applying feature models for structuring the domain knowledge. The method results in clues and hints for the development of a new architecture. It provides an effective addition to the conventional software architecture design methods. The method was developed and applied in an industrial reengineering project within image processing domain. It has been proved to be applicable to large and complex systems even in case of heavy monolithic parts. We use examples from this project to illustrate the method.","1534-5351;15345351","POD:0-7695-2107-X","10.1109/CSMR.2004.1281403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1281403","","Bridges;Computer architecture;Design methodology;Documentation;Image processing;Information analysis;Information retrieval;Redundancy;Software architecture;Software maintenance","information retrieval;pattern clustering;reverse engineering;software architecture;software maintenance;software metrics;software reusability;systems re-engineering","architectural restructuring;architecture disproportions detection;cluster analysis;feature models method;image processing domain;industrial reengineering project;information retrieval;legacy systems;metrics techniques;redundancy detection;software architecture design methods;system architectures","","3","1","27","","","24-26 March 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Proceedings.","20040824","2004","","","150","173","Large collections of scanned documents (books and journals) are now available in digital libraries. The most common method for retrieving relevant information from these collections is image browsing, but this approach is not feasible for books with more than a few dozen pages. The recognition of printed text can be made on the images by OCR systems, and in this case a retrieval by textual content can be performed. However, the results heavily depend on the quality of original documents. More sophisticated navigation can be performed when an electronic table of contents of the book is available with links to the corresponding pages. An opposite approach relies on the reduction of the amount of symbolic information to be extracted at the storage time. This approach is taken into account by document image retrieval systems. We describe a system that we developed in order to retrieve information from digitized books and journals belonging to digital libraries. The main feature of the system is the ability of combining two principal retrieval strategies in several ways. The first strategy allows an user to find pages with a layout similar to a query page. The second strategy is used in order to retrieve words in the collection matching a user-defined query, without performing OCR. The combination of these basic strategies allows users to retrieve meaningful pages with a low effort during the indexing phase. We describe the basic tools used in the system (layout analysis, layout retrieval, word retrieval) and the integration of these tools for answering complex queries. The experimental results are made on 1287 pages and show the effectiveness of the integrated retrieval.","","POD:0-7695-2088-X","10.1109/DIAL.2004.1263246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263246","","Books;Content based retrieval;Data mining;Image recognition;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Navigation;Optical character recognition software;Software libraries;Text recognition","content-based retrieval;digital libraries;document image processing;image retrieval;indexing;information retrieval systems;optical character recognition","OCR systems;digital libraries;digitized books;document image retrieval systems;electronic content table;image browsing;indexing phase;information retrieval;printed text recognition;query page;scanned documents;symbolic information;user-defined query","","12","1","30","","","2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the manual task, our best system used a query-dependent linear weighting between speech-based and image-based retrieval systems. This system has mean average precision (MAP) performance 20% above our best unimodal system for manual search. For the interactive task, where the user has full knowledge of the query topic and the performance of the individual search systems, our best system used an interlacing approach. The user determines the (subjectively) optimal weights A and B for the speech-based and image-based systems, where the multimodal result set is aggregated by combining the top A documents from system A followed by top B documents of system B and then repeating this process until the desired result set size is achieved.
