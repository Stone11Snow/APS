When large storage devices were integrated to our personal computers, desktop search solved the problem of locating information. With larger storage integrated into mobile devices, a solution for the problem is required in the mobile environment. Users often possess multiple devices, such as laptops, PDAs and smartphones, making information synchronization more important. The Dessy desktop search and synchronization system for mobile devices strives to answer these challenges. This paper introduces some of Dessy's features and demonstrates the Dessy prototype for mobile devices.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6606-1; POD:978-1-4244-6605-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2010.5470552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470552","","Application software;Clouds;Information technology;Internet;Memory management;Microcomputers;Mobile computing;Personal digital assistants;Power system management;Smart phones","Internet;information retrieval;microcomputers;mobile computing;mobile radio","Dessy desktop search;Internet;PDA;cloud-assisted mobile desktop search;information search;information synchronization;laptop;mobile device;mobile environment;personal computer;smartphone;storage device;synchronization system","","0","","12","","","March 29 2010-April 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, traffic flow can be quickly scanned to extract posting behavior. However, it might be difficult to improve the F-measure based on HTTP header fields. Finally, required accuracy is determined by services that use posting behavior; therefore, we need another method, which can be combined with our proposed method for analyzing user behavior using the HTTP body. So far, we assume behavioral targeting advertising (BTA) and Q&A sites as services using posting behavior. Our proposed method might be used for these services.

Most experimental findings pertaining to such interactions are discussed in research papers, which, in turn, get curated by protein interaction databases. Authors, editors, and publishers benefit from efforts to alleviate the tasks of searching for relevant papers, evidence for physical interactions, and proper identifiers for each protein involved. The BioCreative II.5 community challenge addressed these tasks in a competition-style assessment to evaluate and compare different methodologies, to make aware of the increasing accuracy of automated methods, and to guide future implementations. In this paper, we present our approaches for protein-named entity recognition, including normalization, and for extraction of protein-protein interactions from full text. Our overall goal is to identify efficient individual components, and we compare various compositions to handle a single full-text article in between 10 seconds and 2 minutes. We propose strategies to transfer document-level annotations to the sentence-level, which allows for the creation of a more fine-grained training corpus; we use this corpus to automatically derive around 5,000 patterns. We rank sentences by relevance to the task of finding novel interactions with physical evidence, using a sentence classifier built from this training corpus. Heuristics for paraphrasing sentences help to further remove unnecessary information that might interfere with patterns, such as additional adjectives, clauses, or bracketed expressions. In BioCreative II.5, we achieved an f-score of 22 percent for finding protein interactions, and 43 percent for mapping proteins to UniProt IDs; disregarding species, f-scores are 30 percent and 55 percent, respectively. On average, our best-performing setup required around 2 minutes per full text.

Their results are decisive to the accuracy of next processing, such as information searching, information filtration. As separate problems of English, MA, POS, PDR can be considered independent with each other. In a practical research system, however, they are dependent: solution of the prior one forms the base for processing the next one. Considering different features of these problems in this thesis, after a comprehensive study, a divide-and-conqueror strategy is proposed and resolves them separately. First, a knowledge-based method is put forward for the solution of MA. The whole MA processing is completed by many subordinate functions dealing with different particular marks of English words.

In this paper, we investigate two perspectives that use shallow language processing for answering open-ended distillation queries, such as “List me facts about [event]”. The first approach is a summarization-based approach that uses the unsupervised maximum marginal relevance (MMR) technique to successfully capture relevant but not redundant information. The second approach is based on supervised classification and trains support vector machines (SVMs) to discriminate relevant snippets from irrelevant snippets using a variety of features. Furthermore, we investigate the merit of using the ROUGE metric for its ability to evaluate redundancy alongside the conventionally used F-measure for evaluating distillation systems.

The archive system can provide an entire Noh scene from any viewpoint by synthesizing dynamic 3D models with a computer graphics model of a Noh stage. Dynamic 3D models are generated using the graph-cut algorithm but it has a problem that thin parts of the object are cut off. As most of actors of Japanese traditional dramatic arts wear a traditional costume with long sleeves and a fan, it is important to reconstruct thin parts to preserve the arts. We therefore introduced the constraint imposed by the silhouette edges and the core obtained by adaptive erosion process on the volume intersection.

We have prepared three different scenarios using direct, semi-virtual, and virtual attachment models. We have evaluated the proposed models with several workloads including OLTP database, data streaming, file server, Web server, etc. Results of evaluation with different criteria confirm that the virtual technique is a successful alternative for accessing to the storage systems especially in large capacity applications. This technique can therefore be an effective solution for expansion of storage area and reduction of access time. In this way, storage virtualization has the potential to provide high virtual capacity with good scalability as well as a better performance. Results of different evaluation and measurements demonstrate that the full virtual storage technique provides better performance and more agility as well as more effective utilization of the available resources.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6702-0; POD:978-1-4244-6701-3","10.1109/WAINA.2010.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5480867","Semi-Virtual;Storage system;Virtualization;Workload","Application virtualization;Conferences;Control systems;Databases;File servers;Information technology;Memory;Scalability;Telecommunications;Web server","data mining;file servers;information retrieval;virtual storage","OLTP database;Web server;data storage access;data streaming;file server;storage virtualization;virtual storage techniques","","2","","14","","","20-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper deals with both the issue of multisignature and proxy operation, and document verification through workflow processes and electronic archiving. To provide authenticity and the integrity of electronic documents throughout the document life cycle, fully computerized workflow processes should use digital signature technology. When an electronic document is to be signed and approved by multiple users through a sequential workflow, the workflow process stops when any of the signers is absent. In the digital world, if a person wants to delegate their signing power to another person, many technical challenges arise. This paper proposes a mechanism for delegating digital signing capability during a workflow process taking into account the need for verification of digital signature and document integrity after a document is archived.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6349-7; POD:978-1-4244-6347-3","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5485564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5485564","delegation;electronic document;proxy signature scheme;proxy signer;role-signer;signing capability;workflow","Control systems;Digital signatures;Management information systems;Organizational aspects;Protection;Workflow management software","digital signatures;document handling;information retrieval systems","digital form;digital signature technology;digital signing capability;digital world;document integrity;document life cycle;document verification;electronic archiving;electronic document;fully computerized workflow process;multisignature;proxy operation;sequential workflow system","","1","","15","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This supervised machine learning POS tagging approach requires a large amount of annotated training corpus to tag properly. At initial stage of POS-tagging for Malayalam, the model is trained with a very limited resource of annotated corpus. We tried to maximize the performance with this a substantial amount of annotated corpus. The objective of this project was to identify the ambiguities in Malayalam lexical items and develop an efficient and accurate POS Tagger. We have developed our own tagset for training and testing the POS-tagger generators. The present tagset consists of 29 tags. A corpus size of one hundred and eighty thousand words was used for training and testing the accuracy of the tagger generators.

In this paper, through analysis of node's multi-dimensional quality-of-service (QoS) for search, it is found that node state's information is essential for improving search performance. So a State-Based Search (SBS) strategy is presented by improving Sripanidkulchai's interest-based search model, where Node's state evaluation is based on node's QoS fuzzification. The SBS enhances the methods of shortcuts adding, ranking and selecting, and state's life-cycle is predicted by grey theory.

The automated extraction of information from FMs is a thriving research topic involving a number of analysis operations, algorithms, paradigms and tools. Implementing these operations is far from trivial and easily leads to errors and defects in analysis solutions. Current testing methods in this context mainly rely on the ability of the tester to decide whether the output of an analysis is correct. However, this is acknowledged to be time-consuming, error-prone and in most cases infeasible due to the combinatorial complexity of the analyses. In this paper, we present a set of relations (so-called metamorphic relations) between input FMs and their set of products and a test data generator relying on them. Given an FM and its known set of products, a set of neighbour FMs together with their corresponding set of products are automatically generated and used for testing different analyses. Complex FMs representing millions of products can be efficiently created applying this process iteratively. The evaluation of our approach using mutation testing as well as real faults and tools reveals that most faults can be automatically detected within a few seconds.","2159-4848;21594848","Electronic:978-1-4244-6436-4; POD:978-1-4244-6435-7","10.1109/ICST.2010.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477103","","Algorithm design and analysis;Automatic testing;Computer errors;Data mining;Flexible manufacturing systems;Information analysis;Logic programming;Mathematical model;Software testing;System testing","automatic test software;information retrieval;program testing","automated test data generation;automatic information extraction;combinatorial complexity;feature model analysis;metamorphic testing;mutation testing;software product line","","5","","26","","","6-10 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By considering non-binary occurrences of web pages as internal utilities in web access sequences, e.g., time spent by each user in a web page, more realistic information can be extracted. However, the existing utility-based approach has many limitations such as considering only forward references of web access sequences, not applicable for incremental mining, suffers in the level-wise candidate generation-and-test methodology, needs several database scans and does not show how to mine web traversal sequences with external utility, i.e., different impacts/significances for different web pages. In this paper, we propose a new approach to solve these problems. Moreover, we propose two novel tree structures, called UWAS-tree (utility-based web access sequence tree), and IUWAS-tree (incremental UWAS tree), for mining web access sequences in static and dynamic databases respectively. Our approach can handle both forward and backward references, static and dynamic data, avoids the level-wise candidate generation-and-test methodology, does not scan databases several times and considers both internal and external utilities of a web page. Extensive performance analyses show that our approach is very efficient for both static and incremental mining of high utility web access sequences.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7421-9; POD:978-1-4244-7422-6","10.1109/SNPD.2010.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5521504","Data mining;high utility patterns;incremental mining;web access sequences;web mining","Artificial intelligence;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Data mining;Distributed computing;Distributed databases;Frequency;Software engineering;Web mining;Web pages","Internet;data loggers;data mining;information retrieval","Web pages;Web traversal sequence mining;dynamic Web log data;dynamic databases;high utility Web access sequence tree mining;incremental UWAS tree;incremental mining;knowledge discovery;level-wise candidate generation-and-test methodology;static databases;utility-based approach","","6","","13","","","9-11 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The difference between text database and XML database results in three new challenges: 1) Identify the user search intention, i.e., identify the XML node types that user wants to search for and search via. 2) Resolve keyword ambiguity problems: a keyword can appear as both a tag name and a text value of some node; a keyword can appear as the text values of different XML node types and carry different meanings; a keyword can appear as the tag name of different XML node types with different meanings. 3) As the search results are subtrees of the XML document, new scoring function is needed to estimate its relevance to a given query. However, existing methods cannot resolve these challenges, thus return low result quality in term of query relevance. In this paper, we propose an IR-style approach which basically utilizes the statistics of underlying XML data to address these challenges. We first propose specific guidelines that a search engine should meet in both search intention identification and relevance oriented ranking for search results. Then, based on these guidelines, we design novel formulae to identify the search for nodes and search via nodes of a query, and present a novel XML TF*IDF ranking strategy to rank the individual matches of all possible search intentions. To complement our result ranking framework, we also take the popularity into consideration for the results that have comparable relevance scores. Lastly, extensive experiments have been conducted to show the effectiveness of our approach.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2010.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5453374","XML;keyword search;ranking.","","XML;information retrieval;search engines","IR-style approach;Web;XML;XML TF*IDF ranking strategy;XML database;information retrieval style keyword search;relevance oriented ranking;search engine;search intention identification;text database","","19","","29","","20100422","Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By decentralizing fingerprint lookup and update, DEBAR supports a cluster of servers to perform de-duplication backup in parallel, and is shown to scale linearly in both write throughput and physical capacity, achieving an aggregate throughput of 1.7GB/s and supporting a physical capacity of 2PB with 16 backup servers.","1530-2075;15302075","Electronic:978-1-4244-6443-2; POD:978-1-4244-6442-5","10.1109/IPDPS.2010.5470468","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5470468","backup and archive;data de-duplication;post-processing","Aggregates;Bandwidth;Computer industry;Computer science;Data engineering;Fingerprint recognition;Large-scale systems;Protection;Scalability;Throughput","information retrieval systems;records management;storage allocation","DEBAR system;archiving;backup;distributed environment;high-performance data protection;postprocessing de-duplication;scalable high-performance de-duplication storage system;storage industry","","16","7","19","","","19-23 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach is founded on the Galois lattices and on the automation of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) theory. FCA provides a conceptual tool for the analysis of data (e.g. documentation) and for the formal representation of knowledge.

This may be the first attempt at classification of full-text protein interaction documents in wide community. In this paper, we compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different section types in full-text articles for text classification. Moreover, in practice, the less number of true-positive samples results in unstable performance and unreliable classifier trained on it. Previous research on learning with skewed class distributions has altered the class distribution using oversampling and downsampling. We also investigate the skewed protein interaction classification and analyze the effect of various issues related to the choice of external sources, oversampling training sets, classifiers, etc. We report on the various factors above to show that 1) a full-text biomedical article contains a wealth of scientific information important to users that may not be completely represented by abstracts and/or keywords, which improves the accuracy performance of classification and 2) reinforcing true-positive samples significantly increases the accuracy and stability performance of classification.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2010.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473208","BioCreative.;Protein interaction;full-text article;text classification","","bioinformatics;information retrieval;proteins;scientific information systems;text analysis","BioCreative II.5 challenge;article categorization task;binary text classification;biology research;downstream BioNLP applications;full text biomedical article;full text protein interaction;information extraction;information retrieval;scientific information","Abstracting and Indexing as Topic;Automatic Data Processing;Computational Biology;Natural Language Processing;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Periodicals as Topic;Protein Interaction Mapping","0","","17","","20100527","July-Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose two algorithms for learning terminological ontologies using the principle of topic relationship and exploiting information theory with the probabilistic topic models learned. Experiments with different model parameters were conducted and learned ontology statements were evaluated by the domain experts.

Nevertheless, they have some inherent disadvantages such as long access latencies and energy inefficiency due to their build-in mechanical mechanisms. Flash-memory-based solid state disks, on the other hand, although currently more expensive and inadequate in write cycles, offer much faster random read accesses and are much more robust and energy efficient. To combine the complementary merits of hard disks and flash disks, in this paper, we propose a hybrid disk array architecture named hybrid disk storage (HIT) for data-intensive applications. Next, a dynamic data redistribution strategy called performance, energy, and reliability balanced (PEARL), which can periodically redistribute data between flash disks and hard disks to adapt to the changing data access patterns, is developed on top of the HIT architecture. Comprehensive simulations using real-life traces demonstrate that compared with existing data placement techniques, PEARL exhibits its strength in both performance and energy consumption without impairing flash disk reliability.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2009.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5374394","Allocation strategies;energy-aware systems;reliability;secondary storage.","","computer architecture;disc drives;disc storage;information retrieval","data access patterns;disk storage;dynamic data reallocation;dynamic data redistribution strategy;energy consumption;flash disk reliability;flash disks;flash memory based solid state disks;hard disks;hybrid disk array architecture;hybrid disk storage architecture","","8","","35","","20100108","Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The data from such disparate sources has different properties and labeling quality, and thus fusing them in a coherent fashion is another practical challenge. We propose a fusion framework in which each data source is first combined with the manually-labeled set independently. Then, using the hierarchical taxonomy of the categories, a Conditional Random Field (CRF) based fusion strategy is designed. Based on the final fused classifier, category labels are predicted for the new videos.

Yet, despite its vastness, one of the downsides to using Web-based information sources is that the information contained in most Web pages has never been reviewed for accuracy or quality and thus it is often considered unsuitable for application where accuracy is of critical importance. While sites of questionable quality clearly should be avoided, one cannot deny the utility and advantages of Web based resources, and thus a methodology has been developed to identify expert vetted health-related Web resources. The resultant computer software searches for biomedical abstracts via Pubmed that pertain to a health topic of interest and via regular expression based pattern matching extracts all of the URLs that appear in the article abstracts. Given that articles that appear in Pubmed typically endure peer-review processes it can be assumed that all of the resources referenced by these articles have a reasonable level of quality, since they are being cited by experts. Thus the program is able to compile a list of quality Web resources pertaining to health topics. This system has successfully been used to create a list of Influenza related Web resources as a means of illustrating its utility.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5550-8; POD:978-1-4244-5548-5","10.1109/LISAT.2010.5478290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478290","bioinformatics;healthcare;medical informatics;text mining","Abstracts;Application software;Biomedical computing;Data mining;Influenza;Libraries;Pattern matching;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web sites","bioinformatics;information retrieval;pattern matching","Pubmed;Web resources;Web-based information sources;biomedical abstracts;health resource URL extraction;peer-review process;regular expression based pattern matching","","0","","6","","","7-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Super., Montreal, QC, Canada","2010 Second International Conference on Advances in Databases, Knowledge, and Data Applications","20100603","2010","","","185","189","The Semantic Web has made possible the use of the Internet to extract useful content, a task that could necessitate an infrastructure across the Web. With Hadoop, a free implementation of the MapReduce programming paradigm created by Google, we can treat these data reliably over hundreds of servers. This article describes how the Apriori algorithm was adapted to MapReduce in the search for relations between entities to deal with thousands of Web pages coming from RSS feeds daily. First, every feed is looked up five times per day and each entry is registered in a database with MapReduce. Second, the entries are read and their content sent to the Web service OpenCalais for the detection of named entities. For each Web page, the set of all itemsets found is generated and stored in the database. Third, all generated sets, from first to last, are counted and their support is registered. Finally, various analytical tasks are executed to present the relationships found. Our tests show that the third step, executed over 3,000,000 sets, was 4.5 times faster using five servers than using a single machine. This approach allows us to easily and automatically distribute treatments on as many machines as are available, and be able to process datasets that one server, even a very powerful one, would not be able to manage alone. We believe that this work is a step forward in processing semantic Web data efficiently and effectively.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6082-3; POD:978-1-4244-6081-6","10.1109/DBKDA.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5477128","Apriori algorithm;MapReduce paradigm;association rules;web mining","Data mining;Databases;Feeds;Internet;Itemsets;Semantic Web;Testing;Web pages;Web server;Web services","Web services;information retrieval;semantic Web","Google;Hadoop;Internet;MapReduce;OpenCalais;RSS feeds;Web pages;Web service;content extraction;named entities;semantic Web","","4","","13","","","11-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Evolvable and scalable system of content servers for a large digital preservation archives","Q. L. Nguyen; A. Lake; M. Huber","US National Archives and Records Administration, College Park, MD, USA","2010 IEEE International Systems Conference","20100607","2010","","","306","310","Building a large-scale digital preservation archives system (LDPAS) for long-term access is a challenging endeavor. The three most significant system requirements contributing to that challenge are the scalability of the system, accommodation of heterogeneous digital holdings, and the evolvability of both the constituting technologies and the data formats in storage. The amount of digital-born materials requiring long-term preservation and access is overwhelming due to the fast pace of information technology and its widespread utilization in government, business corporations, academic institutions, and the general public. Compounding to the data volume challenge is the heterogeneity of the data, which range from the products of office automation and geospatial images, to multimedia artifacts. Storing and preserving digital objects must be accomplished in a way that allows access to the objects independently of the platform technology and software applications used to create these objects. As the technologies change rapidly, the LDPAS must accommodate the changes to its benefit, while also increasing in scale. A successful LDPAS must be able to adapt to the two-fold evolutionary demands. The evolution of the system software with time is the norm in any large-scale long-term system. But, even more important is the system's capability to cope with the evolution of the very software applications that generated the digital objects archived within it. In this paper, we propose an architecture of a system of Content Servers, which can scale with the data volume growth, continually sustain evolution in the face of technological change, and provide different levels of service to the different kinds of users accessing the LDPAS. We describe the concept, components and services of a Content Server in the context of digital archiving, service-oriented architecture (SOA) and the Open Archive Information System (OAIS) reference model. Several possible deployment configurations a- - re shown to illustrate the efficient utilization of low level services and the flexibility of the system to scale up or down.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5884-4; POD:978-1-4244-5882-0","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482447","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482447","Content Server;Digital Archives;Electronic Records;OAIS;SOA;digital preservation;evolvability","","information retrieval systems;records management;software architecture","LDPAS system;OAIS reference model;content servers;digital archiving;digital-born materials;heterogeneous digital holdings;large-scale digital preservation archives system;long-term preservation;open archive information system;service-oriented architecture;two-fold evolutionary demands","","2","","20","","","5-8 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, it is still a pending issue for the existing Grid workflow based on the DAG-extended scheduling to express complex relationships among various tight-coupling remote sensing algorithms with a series of definition toolkit, such as deletion algorithm, for it can only describe the logical feature of remote sensing processing algorithms but can not show the parallel feature of algorithms.

A partitioned metadata index can rule out irrelevant files and quickly focus on files that are more likely to match the search criteria. Also, in a large file system that contains many users, a user's search should not include confidential files the user doesn't have permission to view. To meet these two parallel goals, we propose a new partitioning algorithm, Security Aware Partitioning, that integrates security with the partitioning method to enable efficient and secure file system search. In order to evaluate our claim of improved efficiency, we compare the results of Security Aware Partitioning to six other partitioning methods, including implementations of the metadata partitioning algorithms of SmartStore and Spyglass, two recent systems doing partitioned search in similar environments. We propose a general set of criteria for comparing partitioning algorithms, and use them to evaluate the partitioning algorithms. Our results show that Security Aware Partitioning can provide excellent search performance at a low computational cost to build indexes, O(n). Based on metrics such as information gain, we also conclude that expensive clustering algorithms do not offer enough benefit to make them worth the additional cost in time and memory.","2160-195X;2160195X","Electronic:978-1-4244-7153-9; POD:978-1-4244-7152-2","10.1109/MSST.2010.5496990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496990","","Clustering algorithms;Computational efficiency;Costs;Data security;File systems;Filters;Information security;Partitioning algorithms;Permission;Scalability","information retrieval;logic partitioning;meta data;security of data","SmartStore;Spyglass;clustering algorithm;file system search;index partitioning technique;metadata search;security aware partitioning","","2","","31","","","3-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been designed to divide the database network sites into a set of disjoint clusters based on a high performance clustering technique. This can reduce the amount of redundant data to be accessed and transferred among different sites, definitely increase the transaction performance, significantly improve database system response time, and result in better distributed network decision support.

Our approach is based on (a) the incorporation of the jellyfish-like structure of the Internet and (b) the consideration of the peer-to-peer and customer-provider relations between ASs. We are the first to capture the distinctive structure of the Internet graph together with utilizing the information provided by the AS relationships in order to create a tool for generating a realistic representation. Compared with existing generators, our tool does not try to satisfy specific metrics; instead, it tries to remain faithful to the conceptual model of the Internet structure. In addition, our approach can lead to (i) the identification of important attributes and patterns in the Internet AS topology, and (ii) the extraction of valuable information on various relationships between ASs and the corresponding impact on the Internet structure.We implement our graph generator and evaluate it using one of the largest and most recent datasets for the AS topology. Our evaluations clearly show the ability of our tool to capture the structural properties of the Internet topology at the AS level with high accuracy.

As the complexity of data centers or telecommunication networks increases, managing such infrastructures involves large amounts of data originating from many and diverse sources. In a typical IT management infrastructure, we find many management components such as commercial and open source products (e.g., for monitoring); custom, be-spoke software (e.g., a home-grown inventory database) as well as additional conventional (e.g., calendar) and unconventional (e.g., Web forums, blogs) data sources. The amount of information and the number of tools that are at the disposal of the system operator for management tasks are both wide-ranging and overwhelming. Finding the set of information and tools that is relevant to solve a given problem is a challenge, and typically requires expertise in how to extract data from the available data sources and how to use that extracted data effectively. A search facility that can locate data and tools is beneficial to systems management, but to maximize its impact, it needs to address the heterogeneity of data and data sources; provide task-focused, structured and enriched results, and be both scalable and cost-effective in the dynamic and changing environment of today's IT infrastructures. This paper describes such a system, called Fusio, that provides a search capability based on a loose coupling of heterogeneous, systems-management-related data in an IT environment. Fusio is based on the Semantic Web and traditional information-retrieval technologies. Tools such as Fusio are useful for system operators in carrying out tasks, such as problem resolution, where pointers to related information and tools can be quickly found to speed up the task. They are also useful for training purposes, e.g., as a reference to available data and tools.
