To probe into using MODIS near-infrared spectrum further, winter wheat yield estimation was taken as example in Hebei Province, China. Firstly, according to winter wheat biological characteristic, three MODIS near-infrared spectrum data were retrieved in heading stage, which central wavelength is 860 nm, 1240 nm and 1640 nm. Secondly, the normalized near-infrared spectral index (NNSI) is defined by every two near-infrared spectrum, such as (860 nm, 1240 nm), (860 nm, 1640 nm) and (1240 nm, 1640 nm). Thirdly, the statistical correlation analysis with yield were carried on and set up models for yield forecasting with NNSI. The result shows their coefficient correlations are greater than 0.77 and better than with NDVI. Especially the NNSI defined by (860 nm, 1640 nm), its coefficient correlation is 0.815. So NNSI can do well to forecast winter wheat yield. So we can conclude that normalized index in near-infrared spectrum can do better and more reliable than normalized index in visual and near-infrared spectrums for yield forecasting. And given play to the hysperspectral advantage of MODIS, it can service to crop condition monitoring and crop yield estimation of Ministry of Agriculture.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2394-1; POD:978-1-4244-2393-4","10.1109/EORSA.2008.4620316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620316","Normalized Near-infrared spectral index;Terra/MODIS;winter wheat;yield estimation with remote sensing","Agriculture;Biological system modeling;Condition monitoring;Crops;Information retrieval;MODIS;Predictive models;Probes;Spatial resolution;Yield estimation","agriculture;crops;geophysical techniques;radiometry;statistical analysis;vegetation mapping","China;Hebei Province;MODIS near infrared spectrum;MODIS normalized near infrared spectral index;NNSI;Terra-MODIS;normalized near-infrared spectral index;statistical correlation analysis;wavelength 1240 nm;wavelength 1640 nm;wavelength 860 nm;winter wheat biological characteristics;winter wheat heading stage;winter wheat yield estimation model;yield forecasting","","1","","10","","","June 30 2008-July 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While several state-of-art aerosol retrieval techniques provide aerosol properties in global scale, the more detail characteristics remain unknown because most of the satellite sensors are limited to 1 km resolution observations. However, a new aerosol retrieval algorithm for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500 m resolution data is developed to retrieve aerosol properties over land, which helps address the aerosol climatic issues on the local/urban scale. The rationale of our technique is to first estimate the aerosol reflectances by decomposing the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from surface reflectance and Rayleigh path radiance. The modified Minimum Reflectance Technique (MRT) is adopted for the determination of the seasonal surface reflectances. A good agreement is revealed between the surface reflectances of MRT images and MODIS land surface reflectance products (MOD09), with a strong correlation of 0.9. Moreover, comprehensive look up tables (LUT) are constructed with the considerations of various aerosol optical properties and sun-viewing geometry in the radiative transfer calculations. The resulting 500 m aerosol optical thickness (AOT) data are highly correlated (r=0.94) with the AERONET sunphotometer observations in Hong Kong. This study demonstrates the applicability of aerosol retrieval at fine resolution in urban areas, which can assist the study of aerosol loading distribution and the impact of transient pollution on urban air quality. In addition, the MODIS 500 m AOT images can also be used to study the cross-boundary aerosols and feasible on locating the pollutant sources in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2394-1; POD:978-1-4244-2393-4","10.1109/EORSA.2008.4620353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620353","","Aerosols;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Land surface;MODIS;Monitoring;Optical sensors;Pollution;Reflectivity;Satellites","aerosols;atmospheric optics;remote sensing","AERONET sunphotometer;Hong Kong;MOD09;MODIS data retrieval;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer;Pearl Rriver Delta region;Rayleigh path radiance;aerosol optical thickness;minimum reflectance technique;satellite observations;surface reflectance;top-of-atmosphere reflectance","","1","","22","","","June 30 2008-July 2 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous works on similarity measure for XML document clustering have no consideration for the semantic information as they consider only the structural information.

Morgera","Dipt. di Mat. e Inf., Univ. di Cagliari, Cagliari","2008 19th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications","20080912","2008","","","155","159","In this paper we analyze some shape-based image retrieval methods which use different types of geometric and algebraic moments and Fourier descriptors. Moments have been widely used in pattern recognition applications to describe the geometrical characteristics of different objects. They provide fundamental geometric properties (e.g. area, centroid, moment of inertia, etc.). We consider various description techniques: Hu, Flusser and Taubin invariants, Legendre and Zernike moments, Generic Fourier Descriptors (GFD). The set of absolute orthogonal (i.e. rotation) moment invariants defined by Hu can be used for scale, position, and rotation invariant pattern identification. Flusser' s complete set of invariants appears as a particular case, with invariance only to rotation. The Taubin's affine moment invariants introduce the concept of covariant matrix. Legendre moments are based on orthogonal Legendre polynomials and are not invariant under image rotation. Zernike moments consist of a set of complex polynomials that form a complete orthogonal set over the interior of the unit circle. GFDs are derived by applying a modified polar Fourier transform on shape image. We have applied the retrieval methods on a collection of images chosen from MPEG7 database.

"An Automatic Document Classifier System based on Naíve Bayes Classifier and Ontology","Yi-Hsing Chang; Hsiu-Yi Huang","Department of information management, Southern Taiwan University, Taiwan","2008 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20080905","2008","6","","3144","3149","An automatic document classifier system based on ontology and the naive Bayes classifier is proposed in this paper. The main concept is to first establish a keyword synonymous table by experts for narrowing down the range and getting the consistency of keywords. The formal concept analysis is then used for establishing knowledge ontology through the complex categories and attributes relation. Finally, the ontology is applied to a naive Bayes classifier to get the automatic document classifier system. In this system, 319 documents divided into 11 categories are used to assess the effectiveness of classification, where 224 and 95 documents are the training and testing documents respectively, and the F1-measure is as the assessment criteria. The experimental results show that nine from 11 categories reaches 80% effectiveness of the documents classification, whereas the other two categories reached over 60% effectiveness of the documents classification. In sum, the average effectiveness of document classification in 11 categories is about 89%.

AS-KNNS firstly proposes the index structure (AS-INDEX) based on angular similarity, which refers to the axis and a reference-line to organize the dataset into some shell-hyper-cone, and it linearly stores them. Then it determines the storage location for the search object, making a hyper-cone which takes the line connecting the origin point and the search object as the axis, and searches the hyper-cone for k-nearest neighbors of the search object.

An interesting and challenging query type over existentially uncertain data is the search of the nearest neighbor (NN), since the probability of a potential dataset object to be the NN of the query object depends on the locations and probabilities of other points in the same dataset. In this paper, following a statistical approach, we estimate the average number of the NNsrequired to answer probabilistic thresholding NN(PTNN) queries as function of the threshold t, allowing us to utilize existing approaches and propose a cost model for such queries.

This may involve mobile clinics (MC) which, while moving from one geographical location to another to treat patients, always maintain contact with the distant medical centre for backup in the patient treatment process. Usually patients in different geographical locations would have varied illnesses and health profiles. These differences create very different case contents for patientspsila medical records. In the information retrieval context these records are largely multimedia data objects. Over the web an MC is conceptually the client that retrieves data objects from the surrogate server. To attain a reasonable information retrieval or service roundtrip time (RTT) the surrogate would maintain a local cache to contain popular or hot data and thus a high hit ratio. Here we propose to apply the dynamic cache tuning model, namely, MACSC(PE) {Model for Adaptive Cache Size Control with Point-Estimate support}, to achieve hit ratio maintenance for surrogates in the M-SFF (Medical Small Form Factor) medical informatics system.

So, the metrics for directories for documents are not suitable for hierarchies for identifier-only data. In this paper, we propose a measurement that considers the unevenness of similarities among objects in the child nodes. We use the unevenness value to express the balance of concept hierarchies.

The cornerstone of their technology is their rank aggregation method, which is the algorithm they use to classify the collected results. In this paper we present three new rank aggregation methods. At first, we propose a method that takes into consideration the regional data for the user and the pages and assigns scores according to a variety of user defined parameters. In the second expansion, not all component engines are treated equally. The user is free to define the importance of each engine by setting appropriate weights. The third algorithm is designed to classify pages having URLs that contain subdomains. The three presented methods are combined into a single, personalized scoring formula, the global KE. All algorithms have been implemented in QuadSearch, an experimental metasearch engine available at http://quadsearch.csd.auth.gr.","","POD:978-0-7695-3323-0","10.1109/PCI.2008.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621534","metasearch;rank aggregation;ranking;ranking algorithm;ranking fusion","Algorithm design and analysis;Bibliometrics;Informatics;Information retrieval;Metasearch;Search engines;System performance;Uniform resource locators;Web pages;Web services","search engines","QuadSearch;URL;Web users;effective ranking fusion methods;global KE;information retrieval process;personalized metasearch engines;personalized scoring formula;rank aggregation method","","1","","14","","","28-30 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The query performance for tracing tags depends upon the distribution of tag trajectories in the data space. We investigate a more efficient representation of tag trajectories by means of ordering the set of values in a 3-dimensional domain. Our analysis shows that the order of LIDs makes a greater contribution to the efficiency of query processing, compared with other domain values. However, there is no rule of assigning an LID to the RFID location in order to process queries efficiently. To solve this problem, we propose a new LID proximity function to rearrange an arbitrary order of LIDs. This function enables logically adjacent tag trajectories, which are accessed simultaneously, to be stored in close proximity on the disk. To determine the optimal sequence of LIDs in the domain, we also propose a reordering scheme of LIDs. Our experiments show that the proposed reordering scheme improves the performance of queries, compared with the previous method of assigning LIDs.","2325-1271;23251271","POD:978-0-7695-3349-0","10.1109/RTCSA.2008.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4617275","RFID system;location identifier;middleware;ordering;proximity;query for tracing tags;tag","Application software;Computer applications;Costs;Embedded computing;Information retrieval;Query processing;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Real time systems;Technology management","query processing;radiofrequency identification;ubiquitous computing","RFID tags;location identifier reordering;query processing;radiofrequency identification","","0","","18","","","25-27 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Whether a student is willing to contribute knowledge to a shared system presents a educational dilemma: Each student saves time and energy by not contributing any information to the system and by using the system only to retrieve information which was contributed by others. But if all students use this strategy, then the system will be empty and, hence, useless for every student. Based on theoretical approaches, one model for fostering the information-sharing behavior of system students are presented in education. Our empirical study examined the influence of information-sharing on learning outcome and learner satisfaction in e-learning environments. Three different settings were studied: two were e-learning environments - with information-sharing, and non-information-sharing. The third was the traditional classroom environment. Results of the experiment showed that the value of knowledge management for learning effectiveness was contingent upon the provision of information-sharing. Students in the e-learning environment that provided information-sharing achieved significantly better learning performance and a higher level of learner satisfaction than those in other settings. However, students who used the e-learning environment that provided non-information-sharing did not improve either. The findings suggest that it may be important to integrate information-sharing into e-learning systems.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620399","Collaborative learning;Computer-mediated communication;Information-sharing;Knowledge management;e-learning","Context;Cybernetics;Education;Educational institutions;Electronic learning;Information analysis;Information management;Information retrieval;Knowledge management;Machine learning","computer aided instruction;distance learning;groupware;knowledge management;teaching","collaborative learning;e-learning;elementary school;information-sharing concept;knowledge exchange;knowledge management;teaching","","0","","16","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The method is based on a coarse-grain data collection approach by using the setting of thresholds and the analysis on the content to be sent over the network. In particular, the paper concentrates on the situation where phenomena under monitoring appear a periodical feature. An initiative data model is first created, and then at each single sensor node, instead of direct delivery of each result data, data communication is needed only when the current data is out of the range constrained by the periodical data model. The performance of the proposed algorithms shows that the proposed methods can achieve better performance than without performing the optimization.","","CD-ROM:978-0-7695-3330-8","10.1109/SENSORCOMM.2008.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4622714","Wireless sensor networks;aggregation;coarse-grain;continuous query;threshold","Data communication;Data models;Energy conservation;Energy consumption;Information retrieval;Query processing;Sampling methods;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Spatial databases;Wireless sensor networks","data communication;query processing;wireless sensor networks","coarse-grain data gathering;continuous query;data communication;query optimization method;wireless sensor networks","","0","","8","","","25-31 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However most current annotation models are not yet sophisticated enough to produce high quality annotations. Given an image, some irrelevant keywords to image contents are produced, which are a primary obstacle to getting high-quality image retrieval. In this paper an approach is proposed to improve automatic image annotation two directions. One is to combine annotation keywords produced by underlying three classic image annotation models of translation model, continuous-space relevance model and multiple Bernoulli relevance models, hoping to increase the number of potential correctly annotated keywords. Another is to remove irrelevant keywords to image semantics based on semantic similarity calculation using WordNet. To verify the proposed hybrid annotation model, we carried out the experiments on the widely used Corel image data set, and the reported experimental results showed that the proposed approach improved image annotation to some extent.","","POD:978-0-7695-3122-9","10.1109/SITIS.2007.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4618752","Automatic Image Annotations;WordNet","Content based retrieval;Educational institutions;Humans;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information filtering;Information filters;Information retrieval;Internet;Web sites","image retrieval","Corel image data set;WordNet;automatic image annotation;continuous-space relevance model;current annotation models;image contents;image retrieval;multiple Bernoulli relevance models;semantic similarity calculation;translation model","","1","1","32","","","16-18 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The success of this knowledge discovery process depends critically on the quality of samples and their associated data. Biological samples are expensive to collect and store. The samples and their associated data pass through a number of processes, generally in multiple locations, from data collection from the participant, to clinical laboratory analyses, to processing in the research laboratory (proteomics, metablomics, etc.) and ultimately to knowledge discovery. The samples are moved in and out of freezers at several different points in this workflow. The potential for errors in sample identification and linking the corresponding data to its sample is therefore very high. This paper describes a novel method based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology to support secure and reliable tracking of both samples and data which minimises the potential for error. The samples are labelled with RFID tags, which allow location-independent recording and updating of sample data as they move along the workflow. The system is linked to a web-based database, which provides the ability to identify and locate individual or group of samples rapidly.","","POD:978-1-4244-2244-9","10.1109/INFTECH.2008.4621657","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621657","","Databases;Diseases;Educational institutions;Information retrieval;Laboratories;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;User centered design","Internet;biology computing;data mining;medical information systems;radiofrequency identification","Web-based database;bio-repositories;biological samples;biomarkers;knowledge discovery;radio frequency identification;reliable tracking;therapeutic targets","","3","","19","","","18-21 May 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the conflict appears in the process of design which may interface the design. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a good method for conflict resolution, which has been applied in the artificial intelligence field successfully. However, due to the uncertainties in knowledge representation, attribute description, and similarity measures of CBR, it is very difficult to find the similar cases from case database. To solve the problem of conflict resolution in collaborative design, a fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is proposed. The process of fuzzy case-based reasoning (CBR) is introduced. Based on the feature attributes and their relative weights determined by a fuzzy technique, a fuzzy CBR retrieving mechanism is developed to retrieve conflict resolution cases that tend to enhance the functions of the database. The theory and methods of fuzzy CBR is applied to define the cases. By indexing, calculating the weight and defuzzication of the cases, the case similarity can be obtained. Then the case consistency is measured to keep the result right. Finally, the method is demonstrated availably for conflict resolution by means of a case study.","2154-9613;21549613","POD:978-0-7695-3290-5","10.1109/CCCM.2008.334","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4609680","case-based reasoning (CBR);collaborative design;conflict resolution;fuzzy;retrieve","Artificial intelligence;Collaborative work;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy systems;Information retrieval;International collaboration;Process design;Product design;Spatial databases","CAD;case-based reasoning;fuzzy reasoning;groupware;knowledge representation;mechanical engineering computing","CBR;artificial intelligence field;attribute description;cases defuzzication;collaborative design;conflict resolution;design process;fuzzy case-based reasoning;knowledge representation","","1","","15","","","3-4 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, some image preprocessing is performed off-line on the underlying imaged document to extract its word objects. Then, each word object is represented by a string known as its feature code, based on which a feature code file of the corresponding document is constructed. On the web interface side, the system allows the user to input a set of query words and indicate either to perform ""AND"" or ""OR"" operation on them. Once receiving user's request, the system will process each query word and combine the results based on the ""AND"" or ""OR"" operation the user has chosen. As for each query word, it is first looked up in an index table that stores words being queried before. If matches are found, results will be retrieved from the index table directly and stored temporarily for subsequent merging. This speeds up searching and makes the system an incremental intelligence system. Otherwise, the system will convert the query word to a feature code string and employ a partial word matching approach to perform search on the pre-generated feature code files. Preliminary experimental results with the imaged documents of students' theses provided by our digital library show that the proposed system is efficient and promising for document image retrieval, and thus has potential applications to digital libraries.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-1900-8","10.1109/CVPRW.2003.10025","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624285","","Character recognition;Data mining;Image converters;Image databases;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Information retrieval;Layout;Optical character recognition software;Software libraries","","","","0","","12","","","16-22 June 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the existing protocols, when many tags are placed on the same range, are increasing the number of query , and expending a great deal of time in identifying tags. In this paper, we proposed the QT-BSC protocol to reduce the number of query. The protocol creates a prefix by using bit change sensing unit and time slot. That is, the proposed protocol is designed so as to send the bits from the next bit of prefix to the bit which has the other value. Consequently, as sending bit group which can easily be tracking a new prefix, this method can reduce the number of query. As a result of a simulation, this paper shows that less time is needed for identifying tags by reducing the number of query-response more than query tree and 4-Ary query tree.","2325-1271;23251271","POD:978-0-7695-3349-0","10.1109/RTCSA.2008.52","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4617276","","Application software;Computer applications;Embedded computing;Information retrieval;Manufacturing;Power supplies;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;Real time systems;Ubiquitous computing","query processing;radiofrequency identification;tree data structures","4-Ary Query Tree;RFID system;anticollision protocol;bit change sensing unit;tag collision problem;tree-based algorithms","","2","","11","","","25-27 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Self-Similarity Metric for Index Pruning in Conceptual Vector Space Models","D. Bonino; F. Corno","Politec. di Torino, Turin","2008 19th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications","20080912","2008","","","225","229","One of the critical issues in search engines is the size of search indexes: as the number of documents handled by an engine increases, the search must preserve its efficiency, despite the growth of indexing structures. A widely agreed solution to this problem is the adoption of smaller, or pruned, indexes that allow increasing the retrieval speed while keeping the search quality as high as possible. This paper extends the notion of pruned index to semantic search systems based on conceptual vector space models and proposes a new self-similarity metric for index pruning. A conceptual vector space model represents documents as vectors in a n-dimensional space where each dimension corresponds to an ontology concept. The pruning algorithm proposed in this paper acts on the basis of document self-similarity, preserving only the most significant components of a document conceptual vector. Unlike many already proposed algorithms, the self-similarity metric is only based on local information and does not require to recompute the whole pruned index when new documents are added, i.e., it can be used on-line, possibly combined with other off-line pruning policies. The proposed metric is tested against two benchmark sets respectively related to Siderurgy (250 documents annotated with respect to the e-Class ontology) and Disability (2500 documents annotated with respect to the Passepartout ontology). Results show that the compression ratio achieved by this technique is satisfying (50%), while ranking similarity with results coming from non-pruned indexes remains sufficiently high (80%), thus preserving the quality of provided results.","1529-4188;15294188","POD:978-0-7695-3299-8","10.1109/DEXA.2008.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624720","conceptual vector space model;index pruning;search index","Benchmark testing;Databases;Expert systems;Extraterrestrial measurements;Frequency;Indexes;Indexing;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Search engines","indexing;information retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);search engines","conceptual vector space models;document conceptual vector;document representation;document self-similarity;e-Class ontology;index pruning;search engines;search indexes;search quality;self-similarity metric;semantic search systems","","0","","11","","","1-5 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, for removing the induced false tolerance in the produce of using semantic tolerance relation model, the method of un-tolerating is introduced in image/key frame representation. On the other hand, a diagram of semantic tolerance-based image/video automatic representation is described, and the structure of large image/video retrieval using image/video semantic representation is proposed. We apply the proposed approach to the representations of images regarding the nature vs. man-made domain, human vs. non-human domain, and temporal domain, and show the categorization results of using and not using semantic tolerance relation model.

First, to deal with the performance problem due to the communication overhead caused by the need for jobs to call a series of AMGA operations in order for them to retrieve a task from the AMGA server in the WISDOM environment, we propose a new AMGA operation which allows jobs deployed on the Grid to retrieve a task in a single operation instead of calling series of existing AMGA operations. According to the performance study that we have done, the throughput of task retrieval using the new AMGA operation can be as much as 70 times higher than the throughput of using the existing AMGA operations. Second, to address the scalability problem when thousands of jobs running have access to the single AMGA server concurrently in an attempt to grab available tasks, we propose the use of multiple AMGA servers for the purpose of task retrieval.

One critical foundation for coordinated action in multi-systems is the ability to exchange representational objects that can be locally interpreted in ways that make sense. Coherent local interpretation of shared representations is needed to create global semantic coherence for the distributed systems. Ontology technology is a useful approach to information integration. But when the categories of the relative concepts of ontologies are different, the semantic interoperation will encounter new obstacles. Except that the schema carries information, the data also carry abundant information, which assists to further interoperate. In the paper, a semantic interoperation framework is proposed which adopts instance assisted ontology technology. The implementation of the framework in distributed Xu Beihong's Galleries is discussed in detail. The emphasis is the process of ontology integration and the approach to further semantic interoperation using instances.

The content-based scheduling algorithm in the model groups the queries over the similar data sources together to enhances the opportunities of data sharing among concurrent queries for the same data source. Furthermore, an approach of multiple queries optimization is proposed to exploit data sharing, and avoid redundant data transfer without sacrificing the autonomy of data sources as well. Experimental results validate that our algorithms improve data integration performance in terms of both communication traffic and response time.","1949-131X;1949131X","POD:978-0-7695-3306-3","10.1109/ChinaGrid.2008.7","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624480","","Computer science;Concurrent computing;Databases;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Large-scale systems;Query processing;Resource management;Scheduling algorithm","data handling;grid computing;optimisation;query processing","content-based scheduling algorithm;data integration queries;data sharing;grid environment;query processing","","1","","20","","","20-22 Aug. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automatic collocation extraction is very important for many natural language processing applications, such as word sense disambiguation, machine translation and information retrieval etc. While traditional collocation extraction approaches use only one single statistical measure, they may not be optimal in that they can not take advantage of multiple statistical measures. In this paper, we propose a logistic linear regression model (LLRM) that combines five classical lexical association measures: x<sup>2</sup>-test, t-test, co-occurrence frequency, log-likelihood ratio and mutual information. Experiments show that our approach leads to a significant performance improvement in comparison with individual basic methods in both precision and recall.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620370","Co-occurrence frequency;Collocation;Log-likelihood ratio;Mutual information;T-test;X<sup>2</sup>-test","Cybernetics;Data mining;Frequency measurement;Information retrieval;Laboratories;Linear regression;Logistics;Machine learning;Magnetic heads;Mutual information","natural language processing;regression analysis;text analysis","automatic collocation extraction;collocation extraction method;information retrieval;log-likelihood ratio;logistic linear regression model;machine translation;multiple association measures;natural language processing applications","","0","","12","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The resource discovery of grid is just based on the proposed similarity measures. And then a formal model of grid resources with three layers is proposed for effectively and efficiently organizing and discovering all kinds of heterogeneous resources. This is helpful to reduce the cost of time and correspondence in discovering resources through describing resources, abstracting resources and providing unified system images. Thirdly, over the organization of resources, the scheme of resource discovery is also described. Finally, analyses show that this approach is more feasible than the pure distance-based ones.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620861","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620861","Grid computing;Hyper topology space;Resource discovery;Resource organization;Similarity measures","Costs;Extraterrestrial measurements;Grid computing;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Power measurement;Power systems;Taxonomy;Topology;Tree graphs","grid computing","grid computing;grid resource discovery;heterogeneous resources;unified system images;uniform similarity measures","","0","","7","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, if an agent migrates to the destination node following user-specified passive routing schedules, it cannot actively cope with some accidental situations, such as communication loss or node obstacles, and requires high cost for node traversals. Therefore, more efficient migration techniques for mobile agents that can solve the excessive network traffic problems are required to guarantee the reliability of migration and reduce traversal task processing time. In this paper, we present the migration method of a mobile agent that uses network traffic perception instead of a user-specified passive routing scheduling system for an automatic migration. Also, we formulate a network traffic measurement model to guarantee the optimality of selected paths, and propose path adjustment and reassignment techniques to ensure the reliability of migrations on distributed nodes and reduce traversal task processing time. The proposed migration method aims at minimizing the required time for traversal processing to all destination nodes in the network by supporting active and automatic routing scheduling in optimal migration path searches. And the purpose of it, as well as path adjustment and reassignment techniques, is to guarantee reliable, stable and fast migration of mobile agents.","","POD:978-0-7695-3322-3","10.1109/NCM.2008.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4624205","Mobile agent;Optimal migration path searching;path adjustment and reassignment","Computer networks;Information management;Information retrieval;Mobile agents;Mobile communication;Protocols;Routing;Telecommunication network reliability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","mobile agents;scheduling;search problems;telecommunication traffic","automatic routing scheduling;mobile agent reassignment;network traffic measurement model;network traffic overload;optimal migration path searching;path adjustment technique;user-specified passive routing schedule","","4","","12","","","2-4 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This algorithm recovers correspondences of points of interest in two images, and then uses these correspondences to construct a similarity measure. This similarity measure can then be used to rank word-images in order of their closeness to a querying image.
