"NUAV - a testbed for developing autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","S. Habib; M. Malik; S. Ur Rahman; M. A.

In a typical scheme, a flight simulator is dovetailed with a machine learning (ML) algorithm. A good simulator provides a realistic environment for simulated aircraft. It also provides the ability to invoke and fly various models of aircraft. The ML algorithm, in turn, allows to find an appropriate set of control inputs that can be useful in flying the aircraft autonomously. Creating UAVs in this way has certain obvious benefits. The process of development can be accelerated largely by employing a testbed that allows a seamless dovetailing between the flight simulator and an ML algorithm of choice. However, an extensive testbed is largely missing from the academic landscape both in terms of implementation and technical details. This papers proposes a new testbed for the development of fully autonomous UAVs. The proposed system allows researchers to simulate UAVs for various scenarios.","","CD:978-1-5090-4447-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-4448-1; POD:978-1-5090-4449-8","10.1109/C-CODE.2017.7918926","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918926","FlightGear;Octave;UAVs;machine learning;software integration","","","","","","","","","","8-9 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first stage is based on the normalized pixel difference (NPD) method, and the second stage uses the deformable part model (DPM) method. The NPD method applied to in the wild image datasets outputs the unbalanced ratio of false positive to false negative face detection when the main goal is to achieve minimal false negative face detection. In this case, false positive face detection is typically an order of magnitude higher. The result of the NPD-based detector is forwarded to the DPM-based detector in order to reduce the number of false positive detections. In this paper, we compare the results obtained by the NPD and DPM methods on the one hand, and the proposed two-stage model on the other. The preliminary experimental results on the Annotated Faces in the Wild (AFW) and the Face Detection Dataset and Benchmark (FDDB) show that the two-stage model significantly reduces false positive detections while simultaneously the number of false negative detections is increased by only a few.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528404","Deformable Part-based Model;Normalized Pixel Difference Model;Unconstrained Face Detection","Computational modeling;Deformable models;Detectors;Face;Face detection;Feature extraction;Silicon","face recognition;object detection","AFW;DPM-based detector;FDDB;NPD-based detector;annotated faces in the wild;deformable part model;face detection dataset and benchmark;false negative face detection;false positive face detection;normalized pixel difference;two-stage cascade model;unconstrained face detection","","","","16","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nearly most of current systems require huge amount of computation for dealing with large amount of data. In this paper, an efficient 3D volumetric object representation, Volumetric Accelerator (VOLA), is presented which requires much less memory than the normal volumetric representations. On this basis, a few 3D digit datasets using 2D MNIST and 2D digit fonts with different rotations along the x, y, and z axis are introduced. Finally, we introduce a combination of multiple CNN models based on the famous LeNet model. The trained CNN models based on the generated dataset have achieved the average accuracy of 90.30% and 81.85% for 3D-MNIST and 3D-Fonts datasets, respectively.

To this end, the proposed method first measures a short-time root mean square (RMS) value of input signal for each channel. Then, it analyzes the RMS difference between the adjacent channels. In addition, the crossing rate of RMS values (RMSCR) is computed for each channel, and then the average value of RMSCR over all the channels is obtained. Some faulty sensors are identified by comparing the RMS difference with a threshold, and others by comparing the ratio between RMSCR of each of them and the average value of RMSCR with a threshold. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the precision of detecting fault sensors is measured. Consequently, it is shown that the proposed method works well in underwater environments with average RMS of -18.6 and -9.7 dB.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528395","acoustic sensor;crossing rate of RMS;fault detection;passive sonar;root mean square","Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Sensor arrays;Sonar detection;Sonar measurements;Underwater acoustics","fault diagnosis;hydrophones;sonar;underwater acoustic communication","fault sensors;multichannel line array hydrophones;passive sonar systems;root mean square value;underwater acoustic sensor fault detection","","","","11","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We capture the point clouds by a static Kinect with the object rotating on a turntable. Different views of scan are combined by ICP and then a globally consistent human model is obtained. Our method simplifies the process of successively registration, which is usually used to solve multi-views registration from a single cycle. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a pairwise-to-global registration method, which aligns several sub-integrate views in a merging order. Our method is consistent with some cycled registration constraints which are suitable for non-rigid registration.

This phenomenon is known as Tidal Effect analogy to the rise and fall of the sea levels. Recognizing and defining traffic load patterns at the base station thus plays a vital role in traffic engineering, network design and load balancing since it represents an important solution for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that face network congestion problems or over-provisioning of the link capacity. Previous works have dealt with the classification and identification of patterns through the use of techniques, which inspect the flow of data of a particular application. But they assume prior knowledge on the stream of data packets, making the trend identification much inefficient. Recent methods based on machine learning techniques build their classification models based on sample data collected at certain points of the network with high accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem by applying matrix factorization based models on real-world datasets, identifying typical patterns from data streams, which frequently occur in the network, without investigating the type of flows. For that, we propose a Collective Non-negative Matrix Factorization based model combining multi-source data, such as point of interests attributes, traffic data and base station information, identifying the basic patterns of those areas of the city that present the same type of attributes. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with the baselines.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4338-5; POD:978-1-5090-4339-2","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917576","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917576","Call Detail Record (CDR);Collective NMF (C-NMF);Machine Learning;Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF);Point of Interest (POI)","Base stations;Data models;Indexes;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Telecommunications;Urban areas","","","","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

College student stress as a construct is important to detect in order to equip students in a timely manner with stress coping strategies. However, the lack of a passive sensing measure accepted as a gold standard impedes real time detection and treatment of stress. Many researchers are studying passive sensing of stress using wrist-worn sensors; however, this effort focuses on understanding the essential features of wrist-worn sensors in detecting stress, and how to best induce stress in a lab setting. Applying machine learning methods increasingly is making it feasible to validly infer in real time through passive sensing of physical features psychological states, such as stress. Given strong participant adherence to wrist-worn sensors, this paper focuses on analyzing the effect of replacing other body sensing platforms (e.g. chest-based heart rate) with their wrist-worn equivalent on stress prediction accuracy. Nine participants were equipped with multiple body sensors and were asked to wear a commercially available Android smartwatch, a custom-designed smartwatch equipped with a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor, a chest-based heart rate sensor, and a finger-based commercial GSR sensor. Based on participant self-reports, singing experiment showed greatest stress levels across participants. This paper further analyzes features for prediction from all sensors compared to wrist-worn only sensors. Using statistical features on one-minute fixed-time sub-divisions and correlation-based feature subset selection and a Random Forest model, the system is capable of detecting stress with 88.8% F-measure.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4338-5; POD:978-1-5090-4339-2","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917644","Android;galvanic skin response;heart rate;machine learning;passive sensing;smartwatch;stress detection;wrist sensors","Atmospheric measurements;Electronic mail;Fingers;Games;Particle measurements;Stress;Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper suggests a data driven framework for 15 min-ahead AC load forecasting based on modern machine learning techniques that includes Support Vector Regression, Ensemble Trees, and Artificial Neural Network. To the end, it utilizes a correlation based feature selection method to identify information that is relevant for machine learning modelling. The effect of spatio-temporal features selection on prediction output and the effect of training data quantity on convergence characteristics were analysed and discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated using a 20-household, half-year data set from an ongoing research testbed set up at the faculty housing units of Singapore University of Technology and Design. An linear combination method was proposed to combine models and the resulting model gave a mean absolute percentage error of 11.27%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4338-5; POD:978-1-5090-4339-2","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917573","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917573","Aggregate load forecasting;air-conditioning load;demand response;feature selection;linear combination;machine learning;neural network;peak load shaving","Correlation;Data models;Load modeling;Meteorology;Power demand;Predictive models;Temperature measurement","","","","","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the continuity characteristics of human emotion, most of the recent research focuses on recognising emotion in a continuous space. While previous attempts for speech emotion annotation adopted the likert-like scaling system in a continuous space and relied on prediction models to predict emotion we, in this research, propose a new method for data labelling based on a pairwise data annotation. A set of constraints was proposed to decrease the number of pairs required to label.

However the current algorithms are sensitive to the variation of input data and parameters. In this paper, we propose a new community detection approach called robust community detection on dynamic network (RCD). The robustness of our algorithm lies in two aspects. Firstly, by adopting the offset of sigmoid function, RCD reduces dependency on the input cluster number. Therefore, RCD is insensitive to the man-made interference and the robustness is guaranteed. Secondly, RCD is not restricted to the type of input networks, because it only depends on the topological structure of network rather than requiring labels or other information of networks. Thus, the application robustness is ensured. RCD are evaluated on both the synthetic and realistic network data. The experiment result shows that by introducing sigmoid function, the error rate of misclassification and iterative times are decreased.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528393","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Complex networks;Detection algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Robustness;Time complexity","complex networks;graph theory;network theory (graphs)","RCD;complex networks;dynamic graph;dynamic network;network topological structure;robust community detection;sigmoid function","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept utilizes 29 image features which are supposed to allow for a reliable model creation during supervised learning. The evaluation of the trained models indicates average accuracies between 82.50 and 94.53%. The investigation of image data from 8 sensors leads to the detection of credible pre-processing filters. Those results adumbrate that our method might be suitable to prove the authenticity of the data origin and the integrity of image data based on the detected preprocessing techniques.

However, it is well known that the performance of speaker and speech recognition systems significantly degrades in noisy conditions. Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the effect of noise on the performance of spoofing detection systems. In this paper, we investigate a multi-conditional training method where spoofing detection models are trained with a mix of clean and noisy data. In addition, we study the effect of different noise types as well as speech enhancement methods on a state-of-the-art spoofing detection system based on the dynamic linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) feature and a Gaussian mixture model maximum-likelihood (GMM-ML) classifier. In the experiment part we consider three additive noise types, Cantine, Babble and white Gaussian at different signal-to-noise ratios, and two mainstream speech enhancement methods, Wiener filtering and minimum mean-square error. The experimental results show that enhancement methods are not suitable for the spoofing detection task, as the spoofing detection accuracy will be reduced after speech enhancement. Multi-conditional training, however, shows potential at reducing error rates for spoofing detection.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528399","","Databases;Feature extraction;Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Speech;Speech enhancement;Training","AWGN;Gaussian processes;Wiener filters;cepstral analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation;mixture models;signal classification;speaker recognition;speech enhancement","Babble noise;Cantine noise;GMM-ML classifier;Gaussian mixture model maximum-likelihood classifier;LFCC feature;Wiener filtering;additive noise type;dynamic linear frequency cepstral coefficient feature;minimum mean-square error;multicondition training;multiconditional training method;noise effect;noisy condition;signal-to-noise ratio;speaker recognition system;speech enhancement method;spoofing detection model training;spoofing detection system;white Gaussian noise","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main motivation of the work was to test whether this type of the classifier can be utilized as an alternative approach instead of the conventional listening test in the area of speech evaluation. The proposed two-level GMM classifier was first verified for detection of four age categories (child, young, adult, senior) as well as discrimination of gender for all but children's voices in Czech and Slovak languages. Then the classifier was applied for gender/age determination of the basic adult male/female original speech together with its conversion.

This paper explores an approach for intelligent language environment monitoring based on the duration of child-to-child and adult-to-child conversations and a child's physical location in classrooms within a childcare center. The amount of child's communication with other children and adults was measured using an i-vector based child-adult diarization system (developed at CRSS). Furthermore the average time spent by each child across different activity areas within the classroom was measured using a location tracking system. The proposed solution here offers unique opportunities to assess speech and language interaction for children, and quantify location context which would contribute to improved language environments.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528412","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528412","child speech;computational paralinguistic;speech activity detection;speech diarization","Data models;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Monitoring;Speech;Support vector machines;Training","computer aided instruction;human computer interaction;speech recognition","adult-to-child conversation;child language environment assessment;child-adult diarization system;child-to-child conversation;classroom environment;i-vector;intelligent language environment monitoring;language acquisition;language development;location information;location tracking system;speech information","","2","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The book assumes that it is not only useful, but necessary, to treat SVM, NN, and FLS as parts of a connected whole. Throughout, the theory and algorithms are illustrated by practical examples, as well as by problem sets and simulated experiments. This approach enables the reader to develop SVM, NN, and FLS in addition to understanding them. The book also presents three case studies: on NN-based control, financial time series analysis, and computer graphics.

"Towards biometrie features for 2D/3D sensoring of forensic handwriting","T. Scheidat; M. Kalbitz; C.

A biometric system utilizes physiological or behavioural characteristics of a human being in order to confirm or to determine its identity. Handwriting as biometric modality can be based on the study of the writing result as well as on the observation of the writing process. While conventional sensors for biometric handwriting acquisition are for example flatbed scanners, graphics tablets or special signature tablets, recently the application of high-resolution, contact-less 2D/3D sensors for forensic handwriting analysis has been suggested. Since biometric and forensic handwriting focus at identification of writers, we carry out an initial study in this paper on feasibility of writing pressure based features of a contact-less 2D/3D optical sensor, providing high resolution images of intensity and topography in the nanometer range. The concept is based on dual-sensor acquisition (biometric and forensic) of writing traces, the adaption of biometric pressure based features towards 3D impressioning in the forensic data and a comparative experimental evaluation of both in terms of biometric verification performance. Therefore, in the first step handwriting probes of five persons are prepared on paper and simultaneously acquired by a biometric signature tablet. In the second step each probe is scanned by the 2D/3D optical sensor to digitize it into a topographical representation. This information is used to carry out a biometric authentication and its results are compared to those based on the signature tablet data. Our first studies show similar verification results for both.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528410","","Authentication;Biosensors;Forensics;Matrix converters;Probes;Writing","biometrics (access control);digital forensics","2D/3D sensoring;3D impressioning;biometric authentication;biometric features;biometric handwriting acquisition;biometric information;biometric modality;biometric pressure;biometric signature tablet data;biometric system;biometric verification performance;computer security;contact-less 2D/3D optical sensor;contact-less 2D/3D sensors;dual-sensor acquisition;flatbed scanners;forensic data;forensic handwriting analysis;graphics tablets;handwriting probes;high resolution images;nanometer range;signature tablets;topographical representation;topography;user authentication;writing pressure;writing process;writing traces","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A potential problem in real applications is that the amount of enrollment data is insufficient. When multiple modalities are available, it is possible to re-train the system online by exploiting the conditional independence between the modalities and thus improving classification accuracy. This can be achieved by the well-known CO-training algorithm [1]. In this work we present a novel modification to the CO-training algorithm, which is concerned with how new observations/samples are chosen at each iteration to re-train the system in order to improve the classification accuracy faster, i.e., better convergence. In our method, the new data are chosen not only based on the score from the other modality but also the score from the self modality. We demonstrate our proposed method on a multimodal person identification task using the MOBIO database, and show that it outperforms the baseline method, in terms of convergency, by a large margin.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528400","Co-training;face recognition;person identification;speaker recognition","Databases;Face;Face detection;Feature extraction;Standards;Training;Training data","face recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);speech recognition","MOBIO database;audio-visual person identification;co-training algorithm;multimodal person identification task","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early experiments have already shown that Parkinson's disease can cause pathological changes in the brain region named Caudate_R (a part of Basal ganglia) while essential tremor cannot. Although there are many research work on the classification of PD and ET, they didn't achieve the automatic classification of the two diseases. In order to achieve this, we proposed a machine learning framework based on principal components analysis (PCA) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the classification of Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. This machine learning framework has two-stage method. At first, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to extract discriminative features from structural MRI data. Then SVM classifier is employed to classify PD and ET. We used statistical analysis and machine learning method to test the differences between PD and ET in specific brain regions. As a result, the machine learning method has a better performance in extracting the differential brain regions. The highest classification accuracy is up to 93.75% in the differential brain regions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3298-3; POD:978-1-5090-3299-0","10.1109/SKIMA.2016.7916256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7916256","Parkinson's disease;classification;essential tremor;machine learning;structural MRI","Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Parkinson's disease;Principal component analysis;Software;Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","15-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, developing a computer-based rehabilitation system to re-train patients to carry out daily activities is an essential step towards facilitating rehabilitation of stroke patients with apraxia and action disorganization syndrome (AADS). This paper presents a real-time hidden Markov model (HMM) based human activity recognizer, and proposes a technique to reduce the time-delay occurred during the decoding stage. Results are reported for complete tea-making trials. In this study, the input features are recorded using sensors attached to the objects involved in the tea-making task, plus hand coordinate data captured using KinectTM sensor. A coaster of sensors, comprising an accelerometer and three force-sensitive resistors, are packaged in a unit which can be easily attached to the base of an object. A parallel asynchronous set of detectors, each responsible for the detection of one sub-goal in the tea-making task, are used to address challenges arising from overlaps between human actions. The proposed activity recognition system with the modified HMM topology provides a practical solution to the action recognition problem and reduces the time-delay by 64% with no loss in accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528413","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528413","","Accelerometers;Dairy products;Decoding;Detectors;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models","diseases;hidden Markov models;image recognition;medical computing;patient rehabilitation","AADS;ADL;HMM;KinectTM sensor;activity of daily living;apraxia and action disorganization syndrome;computer-based rehabilitation system;delay reduction;hidden Markov model;human activity recognition;patient retraining;stroke rehabilitation","","1","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we exploit the use of techniques tailored to the analysis of signals varying across time. Specifically, dynamic time warping (DTW) is a technique to find an optimal alignment between two time-dependent series as it successfully copes with the time deformations and different speeds that are associated with time-dependent data, whereas symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) produces a symbolic representation for a time series and can be used to represent highly time-dependent data in time invariant manner. In this paper we investigate visually evoked potential (VEP)-based EEG signals using DTW and SAX method, in order to analyze the permanence issue of EEG signals by verifying its stability across time.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528407","","Aggregates;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Protocols;Stability analysis;Time series analysis;Visualization","approximation theory;biometrics (access control);electroencephalography;medical signal processing;signal detection;visual evoked potentials","DTW;EEG biometric recognition;SAX;VEP-based EEG signals;dynamic time warping;electroencephalographs signals;signal acquisition;symbolic aggregate approximation;time-dependent data;time-dependent series;visually evoked potentials","","","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a voice conversion approach that does not require training any parameters is proposed: it consists in manually defining frequency warping (FW) based transformations by using piecewise linear approximations. An analysis of the de-identification capabilities of the proposed approach using FW only or combined with FW modification and spectral amplitude scaling (AS) was performed. Experimental results show that, using the manually defined transformations using only FW, it is not possible to obtain de-identified natural sounding speech. Nevertheless, when modifying the FW, both de-identification accuracy and naturalness increase to a great extent. A slight improvement in de-identification was also obtained when applying spectral amplitude scaling.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8917-4; POD:978-1-4673-8918-1; USB:978-1-4673-8916-7","10.1109/SPLIM.2016.7528408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7528408","","Databases;Electronic mail;Frequency conversion;Manuals;Privacy;Speech;Training","approximation theory;speaker recognition","deidentified natural sounding speech;frequency warping;piecewise linear approximation;speaker deidentification;spectral amplitude scaling;transformation function;voice conversion","","1","","","","","6-8 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
