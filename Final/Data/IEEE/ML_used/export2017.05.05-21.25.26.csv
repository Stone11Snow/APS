In this paper, for the data with numerical condition attributes and decision attributes, a new fuzzy classification method (FCM) based on SVM is proposed. This method first fuzzifies decision attributes to some classes (linguistic terms), then trains decision function (classifier). For a new sample, the decision function doesn't forecast the value of its decision attribute, but gives the corresponding class and its membership degree as fuzzy decision. This fuzzy decision result is more objective and easier to understand than crisp decision in common sense. The design principle is given and the classification algorithm is implemented in this paper. The experimental results show that the new method proposed in this paper is effective.

Proteomics is an area in discovery of biomarkers that are molecular parameters associated with presence and severity of specific disease states. Protein samples are analyzed on the basis of mass to charge ratio (m/z) of particles they are composed of. Sequences of intensities (i.e. number of particles with specific value of m/z) can be interpreted using statistical approaches or information theory and data mining tools. The data mining, statistical, and information theoretical approaches have already been successfully applied to identify several types of cancer in gene or protein samples.

In this paper, we propose a new fuzzy support vector machine which improves the traditional SVM by adding fuzzy memberships to each training sample to indicate degree of membership of this sample to different classes.

Owe to the ambiguity, fuzziness and ability of approximating functions of any complexity it provides, neural computing method has gained great success in various fields. However, serious limitations remain accompanying the method concerning accessibility, flexibility, scaling and reliability. Efforts have been made to relieve the problem, of which decomposition approach is typically used. Although it works, the method is greatly confined by the decomposition strategy and scalability of such system which is scarified. Previous researches focus on effectively dividing the input space to build up modular systems for given tasks and that the design of the modules themselves is neglected. In this paper, we introduce the notion of autonomous artificial neural network (AANN) for the first time and use AANN units as the basic building block of a modular neural system. The difference between AANN units and conventional neural network is that AANN units possess the ability of self-reflection. Unlike conventional neural networks, which directly give an output corresponding to an input without commenting on its quality, an AANN unit comments in its own point of view on the output, providing extra information such as whether the result is correct or not or to what degree the result can be believed. With AANN units as building blocks, a modular neural system is greatly relieved from what it suffers. Scalability, reliability and flexibility of such a system are greatly improved. We have also proposed a coding method to implement AANN units. And a neural network ensemble of AANN units is built up, which acquires knowledge progressively by inheriting the learned knowledge of AANN units attached to it.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259653","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259653","","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Control systems;Cybernetics;Hierarchical systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Neural networks;Scalability","encoding;hierarchical systems;neural nets","autonomous artificial neural network;coding method;modular neural system;neural computing method;problem decomposition","","1","","7","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from other self-adaptive control laws, here, the process of self-adaptive and control is divided, i.e., the control is implemented by a fuzzy neural-network, and the self-adaptive is implemented by another fuzzy neural-network that is on-line tracking learning. This make the process of learning does not affect real-control. Simultaneously, the learning (self-adaptive) is on-line tracking.

Yet the convergence of backpropagation algorithms is still an open problem. It is well known that the time cost of backpropagation training often exhibits a remarkable variability, which seems to be of the generic character of heavy-tailed probability distribution. It has been demonstrated that, in most cases, rapid restart (RR) method can prominently suppress the heavy-tailed nature of training instances and improve efficiency of computation. However, it is usually time-consuming to verify whether a training instance is heavy-tailed. Moreover, if the heavy-tailed distribution is confirmed and the RR method is relevant, an optimal RR threshold should be chosen to facilitate the RR mechanism. In this paper, an approximate approach is proposed to quickly check whether a training instance is heavy-tailed or not by calculating the maximal Lyapunov exponent of a few generic running trace. Then a statistical estimator is deduced to determine the optimal RR threshold. The practically experimental results are consistent with the theoretical consideration perfectly.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259705","","Backpropagation algorithms;Computer science;Convergence;Costs;Fractals;Heuristic algorithms;Multiprotocol label switching;Probability distribution;Robustness;Search methods","Lyapunov methods;backpropagation;convergence;multilayer perceptrons;probability","Lyapunov exponent;MLP;backpropagation training;convergence;heavy-tailed distribution;multilayer perceptron;probability distribution;rapid restart method;statistical estimator","","0","","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because a task can be partitioned into a group of subtasks and represented as a DAG (directed acyclic graph), so the problem can be stated as finding a schedule for a DAG to be executed in a parallel multiprocessor system so that the schedule length can be minimized. The tasks scheduling problem is NP-hard in general, except in a few simplified situations. In order to obtain optimal or suboptimal solutions, a large number of scheduling heuristics have been presented in the literature. The most studied heuristics are based on list heuristic. Recently, genetic algorithm has received much attention as a class of heuristic. This paper presents a new genetic algorithm called TEOL (task execution order list based genetic algorithm) to solve the scheduling problem in parallel multiprocessor systems. It guarantees that all feasible schedules can be reached with some probability, and because the TEOL is based on the restrain of predecessor relationship of the DAG only, so other heuristics can be combined into it to improve the performance. Simulation results comparing with two genetic algorithms and a list algorithm, both from the literature, show that TEOL produces encouraging results in terms of quality of solution and execution speed.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259786","","Agriculture;Computer science;Concurrent computing;Educational institutions;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Iterative algorithms;Multiprocessing systems;Processor scheduling;Space exploration","genetic algorithms;multiprocessing systems;parallel processing;probability","NP-hard problems;directed acyclic graph;genetic algorithm;parallel multiprocessor system;parallel multiprocessor systems;scheduling heuristics;tasks scheduling","","9","","8","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presently, several approaches based on classical rough set which aims at complete information system have been proposed for the mining task of updating knowledge. However, many information systems are incomplete in practical application. So it is important to develop approaches for updating knowledge in incomplete information systems in order to support more effective data mining.

A weight hamming distance method is used in detection, which is simple and correct in finding anomalous behavior. A well-trained ANNIDS can monitor the network in real time. The experimental results show that ANNIDS performs best when vigilance parameter is 0.4 to 0.5 and intrusion threshold is 0.4.

Itinerary graph not only describes the migration semantics of mobile agent but also reflects the changes of software and hardware environment where mobile agent lives. During its travel, mobile agent equipped with itinerary graph perceives these changes, react quickly, modify its migration path autonomously and accomplish its task according to certain specified criterions, which embody the reactivity and autonomy of agent.

The essential characteristic of fuzzy decision tree is to take of the value in [0,1] to describe the subordinate relation between examples and linguistic terms, This avoids the unreasonability generated by the classical decision tree, which only use 0 and 1 to describe the subordinate relation. By well using the relation between examples and attributes, the fuzzy decision tree holds high performance, but at the same time, this fuzziness leads to the uncertainty of classification and disturb the building of a good decision tree. So, how to filter fuzzy data properly is an important segment in the building and the application of decision trees. This paper analyzes the effect of fuzzy filter on the fuzzy decision tree by using many experiments, which are based on both fuzzy ID3 heuristic method and the minimal ambiguity based heuristic method.

It lowers the number of the grid unit drastically and gain higher space and time efficiency.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259781","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification tree analysis;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data analysis;Data mining;Electronic mail;Encoding;Partitioning algorithms;Statistics","computational complexity;data mining;tree searching","data analyzing method;data clustering;data mining;density-based grid clustering algorithm;digital search tree;grid division;high-dimensional data space;nonempty space;time complexities","","0","","14","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Modular neural network structure for skill growing and structure expansion","Chien-Kuo Li","Dept. of Inf. Manage., Shih Chien Univ., Taiwan","Proceedings of the 2003 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat. No.03EX693)","20040114","2003","2","","1067","1072 Vol.2","One desirable feature of an intelligent system is the capability of expansion of the system structure as well as the learned techniques. In this study, we investigate the development of such capability. The used neural network structure, sum-of-product neural network (SOPNN), is a modularized neural network. A SOPNN with an initial number of submodules is used to learn the primary skill. To develop more advanced techniques, one or more submodules are added to the network. Weights in the original structure are not altered. This preserves the previously learned skills. New and more complicated skills can be established using newly added submodules. It is expected that, using modular learning architecture, learning and skill growing can be more efficient. Although the purpose of this study is to resolve the problem of skill expansion upon completing design, it is noted that the scheme can also be applied to relax learning difficulty by decomposing the learning of a difficult skill into several stages. Attractive features of the new learning scheme include modular structure, system expansibility, and potential faster learning.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259641","","Current control;Cybernetics;Function approximation;Information management;Intelligent networks;Intelligent structures;Intelligent systems;Legged locomotion;Machine learning;Neural networks","function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","intelligent system;modular neural network structure;skill growing;structure expansion;sum-of-product neural network","","0","","4","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper mainly focuses on the following two issues: the knowledge and problems representation on the Web, and how a reasoning system can provide users on the Web with reasoning Web services. As to the first issue, we propose MSKML (abbr. many-sorted knowledge markup language) as the language for knowledge and problems representation on the Web; as to the second, the automated reasoning server provides Web users with automated reasoning services through the SOAP (simple object access protocol). When a client on the Web need the automated reasoning services, it represents the problem as a XML (extensible markup language) file conforming to the MSKML DTD (document type definition) and sends a SOAP request message including the XML file to the automated reasoning server, and the automated reasoning server represents the solution as a XML file conforming to the MSKML DTD and send it back to the client as the SOAP response message. A prototype system is implemented and an example is given to illustrate our work.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259735","","Computer hacking;Computer science;Information resources;Knowledge representation;Markup languages;Prototypes;Simple object access protocol;Web services;Web sites;XML","Internet;XML;inference mechanisms;knowledge representation languages","Web services;XML-based distributed automated reasoning;computer science;document type definition;extensible markup language;many-sorted knowledge markup language;prototype system;simple object access protocol","","0","","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
