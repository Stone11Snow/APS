"Adaptively Evolving Probabilities of Genetic Operators","F. Vafaee; W. Xiao; P. C. Nelson; C. Zhou","Artificial Intell. Lab., Univ. of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL","2008 Seventh International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20081222","2008","","","292","299","This work is concerned with proposing an adaptive method to dynamically adjust genetic operator probabilities throughout the evolutionary process. The proposed method relies on the individual preferences of each chromosome, rather than the global behavior of the whole population. Hence, each individual carries its own set of parameters, including the probabilities of the genetic operators. The carried parameters undergo the same evolutionary process as the carriers--the chromosomes - do. We call this method Evolved Evolutionary Algorithm (E2A) as it has an additional evolutionary process to evolve control parameters. Furthermore, E2A employs a supplementary mutation operator (DE-mutation) which utilizes the previously overlooked numerical optimization model known as the Differential Evolution to expedite the optimization rate of the genetic parameters. To leverage our previous work, we used Gene Expression Programming (GEP) as a benchmark to determine the performance of our proposed method. Nevertheless, E2A can be easily extended to other genetic programming variants. As the experimental results on a wide array of regression problems demonstrate, the E2A method reveals a faster rate of convergence and provides fitter ultimate solutions. However, to further expose the power of the E2A method, we compared it to related methods using self-adaptation previously applied to Genetic Algorithms. Our benchmarking on the same set of regression problems proves the supremacy of our proposed method both in the accuracy and simplicity of the final solutions.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724989","","Artificial intelligence;Biological cells;Counting circuits;Evolutionary computation;Genetic mutations;Genetic programming;Laboratories;Machine learning;Numerical models;Process control","genetic algorithms;mathematical operators;probability","adaptive method;differential evolution;evolved evolutionary algorithm;gene expression programming;genetic operator probability;numerical optimization model;supplementary mutation operator","","3","","16","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By adapting the neurons to the inputs, the network can conform to the data and form clusters. However, with the classical SOM and growing architectures such as growing cells and growing grid, the neurons are simply points in space and do not cover entire regions of the input space. Therefore, inputs that are introduced after the network is trained need to have cluster membership determined by proximity to the trained neurons. The ParaSOM, being a different SOM architecture, where each neuron actually covers a region of the input space, opens up possibilities for different approaches to clustering and classification. An algorithm has been proposed to take advantage of the unique characteristics of the ParaSOM. The neighbors of each neuron are evaluated by distance to determine cluster separation. Once the clusters have successfully been identified, new inputs can be introduced to effectively determine which, if any, cluster each belongs to.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725080","SOM;clustering;pattern identification","Application software;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Computer networks;Concurrent computing;Information science;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons","data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps","ParaSOM;region-growing parallel SOM neural network;self-organizing map;topologically mapping datasets","","1","","11","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, we compare these classification methods in two training modes: a cost sensitive training mode where different costs for false positives and false negatives are considered in the training phase; and a plain training mode. The exploration of possible cost-sensitive metaheuristics to be applied is not in the scope of this work and all executions are run using Weka, a publicly available software. Although NN is claimed to be widely used in the market today, the evaluated implementation of NN in plain training leads to quite poor results. Our experiments are consistent with the early result of Maes et al. (2002) which concludes that BN is better than NN.

The learning impact can be exacerbated by the class imbalanced training data. We investigate and compare the overall learning impact of sampling such data by using four distinct performance metrics suitable for models built from binary class imbalanced data. Seven relatively free of noise, class imbalanced software engineering measurement datasets were used. A novel noise injection procedure was applied to these datasets. We injected domain realistic noise into the independent and dependent (class) attributes of randomly selected instances to simulate lower quality measurement data. Seven well known data sampling techniques with the benchmark decision-tree learner C4.5 were used. No other related studies were found that have comprehensively investigated learning by sampling low quality binary class imbalanced data containing both independent and dependent corrupted attributes. Two sampling techniques (random undersampling and Wilson's editing) with better and more robust learning performances were identified. In contrast, all metrics concurred on the identification of the worst performing sampling technique (cluster-based oversampling).","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724969","class imbalance;data quality;data sampling;performance metrics;simulated noise","Decision trees;Design for experiments;Machine learning;Noise measurement;Noise robustness;Sampling methods;Software engineering;Software measurement;Software quality;Training data","data analysis;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);software engineering","erroneous attribute values;imbalanced software engineering measurement;impact learning;low quality class-imbalanced data;noise injection procedure;performance metrics;quality binary class imbalanced data;sampling techniques","","4","","19","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Noise disrupts the training data and irrelevant/redundant features prevent the classifier from picking relevant features in building the model. Therefore they may reduce classification accuracy. This paper introduces a novel approach to improve the quality of training data sets with noisy dependent variable and high dimensionality by simultaneously removing noisy instances and selecting relevant features for classification. Our approach relies on two genetic algorithms, one for noise detection and the other for feature selection, and allows them to exchange their results periodically at certain generation intervals. Prototype selection is used to improve the performance along with the genetic algorithm in the noise detection method.

Several approaches to hide collaborative recommendation association rules from static databases have been proposed [10, 11]. However, frequent updates to the database may require repeated sanitizations of original database and added data sets. The efforts of previous sanitization are not utilized in these approaches. In this work, we propose using pattern inversion tree to store the added data set in one database scan. It is then sanitized and merged to the original sanitized database.

The method uses the linear mixed model that makes it possible to model both between-subject and within-subject variation in energy expenditure. More precisely, a random-intercepts model is used. The variance and mean of the acceleration signals at 15-second intervals as well as subject demographics (height, weight, body mass index, age and VO<sub>2</sub>max) are used. Energy expenditure is modelled in four different activities: walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling. This study introduces an effective backward model selection procedure for selecting the fixed-effect variables in the model. The procedure uses leave-one-out cross-validation to be able to effectively exploit the available data set and to ensure the robustness of the model. Estimation accuracy in test sets is used as a criterion of model performance. The model selection procedure proposed notably improves estimation accuracy. In walking, running, Nordic walking and bicycling, average estimation errors of 3.9, 3.6, 1.9 and 13.5 percent are reached. The respective Person correlations for these activities are 0.91, 0.98, 0.97, and 0.81. These results are also compared to the performance of the general linear model.

However, even very accurate classifiers may output class probabilities of rather poor quality. One way of overcoming this problem is by means of calibration, i.e., mapping the original class probabilities to more accurate ones. Previous studies have however indicated that random forests are difficult to calibrate by standard calibration methods. In this work, a novel calibration method is introduced, which is based on a recent finding that probabilities predicted by forests of classification trees have a lower squared error compared to those predicted by forests of probability estimation trees (PETs). The novel calibration method is compared to the two standard methods, Platt scaling and isotonic regression, on 34 datasets from the UCI repository. The experiment shows that random forests of PETs calibrated by the novel method significantly outperform uncalibrated random forests of both PETs and classification trees, as well as random forests calibrated with the two standard methods, with respect to the squared error of predicted class probabilities.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724964","Brier score;calibration;probability-estimation trees;random forests","Area measurement;Calibration;Classification tree analysis;Decision trees;Informatics;Machine learning;Positron emission tomography;Probability distribution;Regression tree analysis;Utility theory","calibration;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;trees (mathematics)","class probability prediction;probability estimation trees;random forests;square error methods;standard calibration methods","","7","","16","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing DDM techniques perform partial analysis of local data at individual sites and then generate global models by aggregating the local results. These two steps are not independent since naive approaches to local analysis may produce incorrect and ambiguous global data models. To overcome this problem, we introduce a distributed knowledge map based on an efficient self-reconfiguration network topology to represent easily and exploit efficiently the knowledge mined in large scale distributed platforms. This will also facilitate the integration/coordination of local mining processes and existing knowledge to build global models. In this paper, we implement this knowledge map and present some preliminary results about its performance.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725077","TreeP;distributed data mining;knowledge map;self-reconfigurable topology","Application software;Data analysis;Data mining;Data models;Distributed decision making;Knowledge management;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Network topology;Performance analysis","data mining;distributed processing","distributed data mining;distributed systems;knowledge mining;self-reconfigurable topology","","1","","15","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CoReJava is unique in that functional forms for regression analysis are expressed as first-class citizens, i.e., as Java programs, in which some parameters are not a priori known, but need to be learned from training sets provided as input. Typical applications of CoReJava include calibration of parameters of computational processes, described as OO programs. To implement regression learning, the CoReJava compiler (1) analyses the structure of the parameterized Java program that represent a functional form, (2) automatically generates a constraint optimization problem, in which constraint variables are the unknown parameters, and the objective function to be minimized is the sum of squares of errors w.r.t. the training set, and (3) solves the optimization problem using an external non-linear optimization solver. CoReJava then executes as a regular Java program, in which the initially unknown parameters are replaced with the found optimal values. CoReJava syntax and semantics are formally defined and exemplified using a simple supply chain example.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725000","Java;Learning.

We focus on NB due to its popularity and linear training time. We investigate the impact of eight discretization algorithms (Equal Width, Equal Frequency, Maximum Entropy, IEM, CADD, CAIM, MODL, and CACC) on the classification with NB and two modern semi-NB classifiers, LBR and AODE.Our comprehensive empirical study indicates that unsupervised discretization algorithms are the fastest while among the supervised algorithms the fastest is maximum entropy, followed by CAIM and IEM. The CAIM and MODL discretizers generate the lowest and the highest number of discrete values, respectively.We compare the time to build the classification model and classification accuracy when using raw and discretized data. We show that discretization helps to improve the classification with the NB when compared with flexible NB which models continuous features using Gaussian kernels. The AODE classifier obtains on average the best accuracy, while the best performing setup includes discretization with IEM and classification with AODE. The runner-up setups include CAIM and CACC coupled with AODE and CAIM and IEM coupled with LBR. IEM and CAIM are shown to provide statistically significant improvements across all considered datasets for LBR and AODE classifiers when compared with using NB on the continuous data.

The design of our classifier is motivated by the special scenario encountered in molecular cancer classification based on the mRNA concentrations provided by gene microarray data. Our classifier is rank-based; it only depends on expression comparisons among selected pairs of genes. Such comparisons are invariant to most of the transformations involved in preprocessing and normalization. Every pair of genes determines a binary classifier - choose the class for which the observed ordering is most likely. Pairs are scored by maximizing accuracy. In our k-TSP (k-disjoint Top Scoring Pairs) classifier, k disjoint pairs of genes are learned from training data; the discriminant function is simply the difference in the number of votes for the two classes. This rule involves exactly 2k genes, is readily interpretable, and provides some state-of-the-art results in cancer diagnosis and prognosis for small values of k, even k=1.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.152","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725033","Molecular classification;cancer;gene expression","Biology computing;Cancer;DNA;Diseases;Gene expression;Machine learning;Probability distribution;Random variables;Training data;Voting","cancer;macromolecules;medical image processing;pattern classification","ICMLA2008;binary classifier;cancer diagnosis;cancer prognosis;k-disjoint top scoring classifier;mRNA concentrations;microarray classification;molecular cancer classification;two-gene expression","","1","","9","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the MTPR problem, several multi-class classification tasks are sequentially given to the learning model without notifying their task categories. This implies that the learning model is supposed to detect task changes by itself and to utilize the knowledge on the previous tasks for learning of new tasks. In addition, the learning model must acquire knowledge of multiple tasks incrementally without unexpected forgetting under the condition that not only tasks but also training samples are sequentially given. The proposed model is evaluated for two artificial MTPR problem.

From the application viewpoint, however, BNCs sometimes produce models too complicated to interpret easily. In this paper, we propose k-Bayesian network classifier (k-BNC), which is a new method to reconstruct the attribute-dependency relationship from data for health promotion planning. From the health promotion viewpoint, it would be highly advantageous if occupational physicians could make effective plans for employees, and if employees could carry out the plans easily. Therefore, we focus on the attribute dependencies in classification models represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and find the effective attributes by measuring the standardized Kullback-Leibler divergence from parent attributes to their children. In experimental evaluation, we firstly compare the accuracy of k-BNC with that of Naive Bayes Classifiers, and other wellknown Bayesian Networks and structure learning methods (k2 algorithm etc.) on some public datasets. We show that our proposed k-BNC method successfully produces classification models for the prioritization of health promotion plans on our health checkup data.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724949","Bayesian Network Classifier;Health Promotion","Bayesian methods;Cardiac disease;Cardiovascular diseases;Data analysis;Learning systems;Machine learning;Medical services;Occupational health;Pediatrics;Pressure measurement","belief networks;directed graphs;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","attribute-dependency relationship;directed acyclic graph;health checkup data;health promotion plan prioritizing;k-Bayesian network classifier;naive Bayes classifier;standardized Kullback-Leibler divergence;structure learning method","","1","","18","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that standard distance-based methods and latent semantic analysis are able to classify the lyrics significantly better than random, but the performance is still quite inferior to that of audio-based techniques. We then introduce a method based on differences between language models that gives performances closer to audio-based classifiers.

However, most works pointed out their inefficiency in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we address the inadequacy of decision trees for behavioral anomaly detection. We first explain why decision trees fail in detecting most of novel attacks. In particular, we provide experimental results showing that minimum description length (MDL) principle used while inducing decision trees is among the main reasons in their failure in detecting novel attacks. Then we propose relaxing MDL principle in order to build compatible decision trees more suitable for novel behavior detection. The strategy of relaxing MDL principle is to exploit additional tests/features in order to discriminate between normal behaviors and intrusive ones while standard decision trees only rely on minimum subset of tests/features. Experimental studies, carried out on real and recent http traffic and several Web attacks, show the significant improvements that can be made by relaxed MDL decision trees.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725046","","Availability;Benchmark testing;Classification tree analysis;Computer networks;Decision trees;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Telecommunication traffic;Training data;Web server","decision trees;security of data","behavioral anomaly detection;decision trees;intrusion detection;minimum description length","","6","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Survival prediction is often accomplished by the TNM system that involves only three factors: tumor extent, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. This prediction from the TNM has been limited, mainly because other potential prognostic factors are not used in the system. Based on availability of large cancer datasets, it is possible to establish powerful prediction systems by using machine learning procedures and statistical methods. In this paper, we present a clustering based approach to develop prognostic systems of cancer patients. Our method starts with grouping combinations that are formed using levels of factors recorded in the data. The dissimilarity measure between combinations is obtained through a sequence of data partitions produced by multiple clusterings. This dissimilarity measure is then used with a hierarchical clustering method in order to find clusters of combinations. Prediction of survival is made simply by using the survival function derived from each cluster. Our approach admits multiple factors and provides a practical and useful tool in outcome prediction of cancer patients. A demonstration of use of the proposed method is given for lung cancer patients.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725055","TNM;clustering;lung cancer;survival prediction","Cancer;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Computer science;Lungs;Lymph nodes;Machine learning;Medical treatment;Neoplasms;Partitioning algorithms","cancer;medical information systems;pattern clustering;statistical analysis","cancer datasets;cancer patients prognostic systems;data partitions sequence;hierarchical clustering method;lung cancer patients;lymph node involvement;machine learning procedures;metastasis;statistical methods;survival prediction;tumor extent","","0","","11","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conclusion is that although positive classifier is slightly better than the negative one, the SCSVM classifier performance does not outperform the AA classifier for current data configuration. The ""vote"" strategy does not change the SCSVM's ROC behavior but increase the confidence of the true positive. Our explanation is that in SCSVM, only one class of training data is available. It is very hard to determine how tight the decision boundary should be to best characterize the known class. Due to the same reason, SCSVM tends to over-fit and under-fit easily.

In recent years, they have become a popular way to share large amounts of data. However, such an architecture adds a new dimension to the process of knowledge discovery and data mining -- the challenge of mining distributed (and often) dynamic sources of data and computing. Furthermore, effective utilization of the distributed resources needs to be carefully analyzed. In this paper, we study the problem of optimization of resources to enable efficient and scalable mining on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. We develop a crawler based on the Gnutella protocol and use it to simulate a P2P network on which we run a classification task. Our results from the case-study indicate that not only do we have an effective utilization of resources but also the accuracy of the distributed mining algorithm is likely to be close to the hypothetical scenario where all data in the network is stored in a central location.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724997","distributed;optimization;peer-to-peer;simplex","Application software;Computer networks;Costs;Crawlers;Data mining;Distributed algorithms;Distributed computing;Machine learning;Master-slave;Peer to peer computing","data mining;peer-to-peer computing","classification task;data mining;distributed mining algorithm;distributed optimization strategies;distributed resources;distributed systems;knowledge discovery;peer-to-peer networks","","2","","22","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

EGA is an efficient alternative to the algorithm (HGA) by Malvestuto, which constructs a model of treewidth k by selecting hyperedges of order k+1. In this paper, we present results of empirical studies that compare HGA, EGA and FSA-K which is a straightforward application of FSA, in terms of approximation accuracy (measured by KL-divergence) and computational time. Our experiments show that (1) on the average, all three algorithms produce similar approximation accuracy; (2) EGA produces comparable or better approximation accuracy and is the most efficient among the three.

While several papers have been published in the literature on speech emotion recognition, the features used are taken or modified from those used for speech recognition purposes. However, not all features used for speech recognition are of equal importance for emotion recognition. This paper addresses this issue and proposes a systematic method on feature selection for emotion recognition from speech signals. The idea is to work on a well-selected small feature set and use it to remove irrelevant information. Specifically, the proposed method uses the similar idea of the Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to estimate the linear relationship between the various features and the emotional states. The outcome is a set of features that are of most relevance to the emotions. Experiments have been conducted using the LDC database and with the use of the Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) as the classification method. The results obtained show that, comparable accuracies can be obtained for the emotional states tested with the use of only about 30% of the features considered. This implies that the computational load can be reduced greatly too.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725081","Emotion;Feature selection;Speech;classification","Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Humans;Machine learning;Neural networks;Spatial databases;Speech analysis;Speech processing;Speech recognition;State estimation","correlation methods;emotion recognition;feature extraction;neural nets;probability;speech processing;speech recognition;statistical analysis","automatic emotional state identification;canonical correlation analysis;feature selection;linear relationship estimation;probabilistic neural network;speech emotion recognition;speech signal","","2","","14","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These rules are useful for understanding trends, making predictions of future events from historical data, or synthesizing data records into meaningful clusters. Through clustering are similar data items grouped together to form clusters. Clustering algorithms usually employ a distance metric based (e.g., Euclidean) similarity measure in order to partition the database such that data points in the same partition are more similar than points in different partitions. In this paper, we study clustering algorithms for data with categorical attributes. Instead of using traditional clustering algorithms that use distances between points for clustering which is not an appropriate concept for Boolean and categorical attributes, we propose a novel concept of HAC (hierarchy of attributes and concepts) to measure the similarity/proximity between a pair of data points. In this study, HAC will be used as an aid to represent medical domain knowledge substructures to simplify the generation process of the databases through clustering. As a result, the research will identify interesting relationships and patterns among the data, and represent them in the form of association rules.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725012","Association Rules;Hierarchical Clustering;Medical Databases","Application software;Association rules;Business;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data analysis;Data mining;Databases;Machine learning;Partitioning algorithms","data mining;medical information systems","association rules;categorical attributes;clustering algorithm;distance metric;medical database","","0","","14","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The coarsened data at the lowest level is then projected using a known linear dimensionality reduction method. The same linear mapping is performed on the original data set, and on any new test data. The methods are illustrated on two applications: eigenfaces (face recognition) and latent semantic indexing (text mining).

This enables us to estimate the number of segment-types within the model, in contrast to previousnon-Bayesian approaches where training and comparing several separate models was required.

Achieving high accuracy in a rule-based system requires the creation of rules containing a good combination of discriminatory clues. Unfortunately, accurate rule-based deduplication often requires significant manual tuning of both the rules and the corresponding thresholds. This need for manual tuning reduces the efficacy of rule-based deduplication and its applicability to real-world data sets. No adequate solution exists for this problem. We propose a novel technique for rule-based deduplication. We apply individual deduplication rules, and combine the resultant match scores via learning-based information fusion.

GSVM-RAND applies bootstrapping to extract a number of subsets of samples from the original training dataset. Each training subset is then projected into a feature subspace randomly selected from the original feature space. Here we call a granule such a subset of samples in such a feature subspace. A local SVM is then modeled in each granule. For a new sample, it is firstly projected into each granule in which the local SVM is fired to make a prediction. After that, all SVM predictions are aggregated by Bayesian Sum Rule for a final decision. GSVM-RAND is easy to be parallelized and hence efficient and highly scalable.

This paper presents a novel DBN-based approach to address these issues. For each node, a differential mutual information is used to select potential parents and a Bayesian scoring metric with a Dirichlet prior for regulation is applied to evaluate its parents. The proposed method is applied to recover a network structure from simulated data with higher accuracy and computational efficiency compared to DBNs with other scoring metrics.

Such recovery is possible thanks to the hypothesis that the components are mutually independent and non-Gaussians. The IFA model assumes furthermore that each component is distributed according to a mixture of Gaussians. This article investigates the possibility of incorporating prior knowledge on the mixing process and partial knowledge on the cluster belonging of some samples to estimate the IFA model. In this way, other learning contexts can be handled such as semi-supervised or partially supervised learning. Such information is valuable to enhance estimation accuracy and remove indeterminacy commonly encountered in unsupervised IFA such as the permutation of the sources.

While static defence technologies such as firewalls and anti-virus provide basic protection for computer networks, an intrusion detection system (IDS) can improve overall security by identifying and responding to novel malicious activities. The current existing IDS methods suffer from low accuracy and system robustness. To overcome such limitations, this paper proposes a multi-expert classification framework for detecting different types of network anomalies. Specifically, different types of intrusions will be detected with different strategies, including different attribute selections and learning algorithms. Several voting approaches are also investigated for the purpose of classifier combination. The Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD-99) dataset is used as a benchmark to compare this method with other existing techniques. Empirical results indicate that the proposed design outperforms other state-of-the-art learning methods in terms of detection cap abilities, misclassification cost and processing overheads.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725085","multi-expert classification;network intrusion detection;single transferable voting","Australia;Computer networks;Decision trees;Event detection;Face detection;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Protection;Voting","computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","attribute selection;computer network security;intrusion detection system;learning algorithm;malicious activity identification;multiexpert classification framework;network anomaly detection;static defence technology;transferable voting","","0","","17","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Bayesian Learning Automaton for Solving Two-Armed Bernoulli Bandit Problems","O. C.

The reward probabilities of each arm are unknown, and thus one must balance between exploiting existing knowledge about the arms, and obtaining new information. In the last decades, several computationally efficient algorithms for tackling this problem have emerged, with learning automata (LA) being known for their Â¿-optimality, and confidence interval based for logarithmically growing regret. Applications include treatment selection in clinical trials, route selection in adaptive routing, and plan exploration in games like Go. The TABB has also been extensively studied from a Bayesian perspective, however, in general, such analysis leads to computationally inefficient solution policies. This paper introduces the Bayesian learning automaton (BLA). The BLA is inherently Bayesian in nature, yet relies simply on counting rewards/penalties and on random sampling from a pair of twin beta distributions. Furthermore, we report that BLA is self-correcting and converges to only pulling the optimal arm with probability 1. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in contrast to most LA, BLA does not rely on external learning speed/accuracy control. It also outperforms recently proposed confidence interval based algorithms. We thus believe that BLA opens up for improved performance in a number of applications,and that it forms the basis for a new avenue of research.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724951","","Application software;Arm;Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Clinical trials;Learning automata;Machine learning;Resource management;Routing;Sampling methods","belief networks;learning automata;optimisation","Bayesian learning automaton;optimization problem;twin beta distributions;two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems","","1","","21","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To simplify the protein contact map prediction, we predict the inter-residue contact clusters centered at the groups of their neighboring contacts instead.Results: In this paper, we adopt a SVM predictor based approach to predict the inter-residue contact cluster centers. The input information of the SVM predictor includes sequence profile, evolutionary rate, and predicted secondary structure. The SVM predictor is based on hydrophobic cores that may be considered as locations of the groups of their neighboring inter-residue contacts.

We model the treatment verification problem as a two-class classification problem and apply artificial neural network (ANN) to classify the cine EPID images acquired during the treatment into corresponding classes-tumor inside or outside of the beam aperture. Training samples of ANN are generated using digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) with artificially added shifts in tumor location-to simulate cine EPID images with different tumor locations. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the training samples and cine EPID images acquired during the treatment.

Then, non Euclidean dissimilarities provide additional information that should be considered to reduce the misclassification errors. In this paper, we incorporate in the classical nu-SVM algorithm a linear combination of non-Euclidean dissimilarities. The weights of the combination are learnt in a HRKHS (hyper reproducing kernel Hilbert space) using an efficient semidefinite programming algorithm. This approach allow us to incorporate a smoothing term that penalizes the complexity of the family of distances and avoids overfitting.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the dimensionality of a POMDP can eventually be reduced by transforming it into an equivalent predictive state representation (PSR). In this paper, we address the problem of finding an approximate and compact PSR model corresponding to a given POMDP model. We formulate this problem in an optimization framework. Our algorithm tries to minimize the potential error that missing some core tests may cause. We also present an empirical evaluation on benchmark problems, illustrating the performance of this approach.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724961","POMDPs;PSRs;compression;online planning","Application software;Approximation algorithms;Benchmark testing;Computer science;History;Machine learning;Predictive models;Probability distribution;State-space methods;Uncertainty","Markov processes;decision theory;error statistics;minimisation;multi-agent systems","POMDP;belief space;error minimization;high dimensionality;multiagent system;optimization;partially observable Markov decision process;prediction-directed compression;predictive state representation","","0","","8","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We observe it is convenient to use some keywords(i.e. class-descriptions) to describe class sometimes. However, short class-description usually does not contain enough information to guide classification. Fortunately, large amount of public data is easily acquired, i.e. ODP, Wikipedia and so on, which contains enormous knowledge. In this paper, we address the text classification problem with such knowledge rather than any labeled documents and propose a co-clustering based knowledge-supervised learning algorithm (CoCKSL) in information theoretic framework, which effectively applies the knowledge to classification tasks.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725064","","Application software;Computer science;Internet;Knowledge engineering;Labeling;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Testing;Text categorization;Wikipedia","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;text analysis","CoCKSL;co-clustering based approach;knowledge-supervised learning;labeled documents;text classification problem;text learning algorithms","","0","","11","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often, however, models should also bring insights into interesting relationships in the domain. It is then desirable that machine learning techniques have the ability to obtain small and transparent models, where the user can control the tradeoff between accuracy, comprehensibility and coverage. In this study, three different decision list algorithms are evaluated on a dataset concerning the interaction of molecules with a human gene that regulates heart functioning (hERG). The results show that decision list algorithms can obtain predictive performance not far from the state-of-the-art method random forests, but also that algorithms focusing on accuracy alone may produce complex decision lists that are very hard to interpret. The experiments also show that by sacrificing accuracy only to a limited degree, comprehensibility (measured as both model size and classification complexity) can be improved remarkably.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725029","Comprehensible Models;Data Mining;Decision Lists;hERG","Biochemistry;Biological information theory;Biological system modeling;Drugs;High temperature superconductors;Humans;Informatics;Machine learning;Pharmaceuticals;Predictive models","biochemistry;biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence)","classification complexity;decision list algorithms;heart-regulating genes;in silico modeling;machine learning;molecular interaction prediction;random forests","","0","","33","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A major problem is the variation of signal distributions caused by multiple factors, which makes the old localization model inaccurate. Therefore, the transfer learning problem in a WILS aims to transfer the knowledge from an old model to a new one. In this paper, we study the characteristics of signal variation and conclude the chief factors as time and devices. An algorithm LuMA is proposed to handle the transfer learning problem caused by these two factors. LuMA is a dimensionality reduction method, which learns a mapping between a source data set and a target data set in a low-dimensional space. Then the knowledge can be transferred from source data to target data using the mapping relationship. We implement a WILS in our wireless environment and apply LuMA on it. The on-line performanceevaluation shows that our algorithm not only achieves better accuracy than the baselines, but also has ability for adaptive localization, regardless of time or device factors. As a result, the calibration efforts on new training data can be greatly reduced.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724994","Transfer leanring;Wi-Fi localization;dimension reduction","Calibration;Computers;Fingerprint recognition;Humans;Machine learning;Mobile computing;Radar;Signal detection;Sun;Training data","Global Positioning System;software performance evaluation;wireless LAN","adaptive localization;dimensionality reduction method;indoor Wi-Fi environment;signal distributions;transfer learning;transfer learning problem","","15","","13","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The loss function is defined by costs associated to the decision options which may include classes, subsets of classes if partial rejection is considered and all classes if total rejection is introduced. A formulation of the general problem is given, a decision rule which is based on the v-1-SVMs trained on each class is defined and a learning method is proposed. This latter optimizes all the v-1-SVM parameters and all the decision rule parameters jointly in order to minimize the loss function. To extend the search space of the v-1-SVM parameters and keep the processing time under control, the v-1-SVM regularization path is derived for each class and used during the learning process. Experimental results on artificial data sets and some benchmark data sets are provided to assess the effectiveness of the approach.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724954","One class SVM;loss function;multiclass;regularization path","Cancer;Cost function;Error correction;Learning systems;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Process control;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Voting","learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","loss function;multiclass learning method;multiclass problems;regularization path;supervised decision rule;v-1-SVM parameters","","0","","23","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, many approaches for the discovery of such anomalies have been proposed. However, most of them use a sample of known typical sequences to build the model. Besides, they remain greedy in terms of memory usage. In this paper we propose an extension of one such approach, based on a probabilistic suffix tree and on a measure of similarity. We add a pruning criterion which reduces the size of the tree while improving the model, and a sharp inequality for the concentration of the measure of similarity, to better sort the outliers. We prove the feasibility of our approach through a set of experiments over a protein database.","","POD:978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4725031","Concentration Inequality;Information Criterion;Outliers;Sequential Databases","DNA;Data analysis;Databases;Genetic mutations;Machine learning;Proteins;Robots;Sequences;Size measurement;Testing","Markov processes;data analysis;database management systems;tree data structures","data analysis;probabilistic suffix tree;protein database;pruning criterion;sequential datasets;sequential outliers;variable length Markov model","","1","","19","","","11-13 Dec. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
