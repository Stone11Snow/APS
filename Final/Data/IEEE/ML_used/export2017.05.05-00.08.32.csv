Traditionally, the device addresses in WSN are given by a Distributed Address Allocation Mechanism (DAAM). Although DAAM has better extensibility, this network topology resulted by DAAM did not consider fast routing between nodes. Although binary tree topology benefits a faster packet routing via a simple Boolean computation, the binary tree is less extensible. In this paper, a new variation of binary tree topology is proposed to assign nodes under routers the addresses for fast routing. The proposed approach improves the low utility rate of the network address for DAAM.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890764","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890764","Addressing Efficiency;Distributed Address Allocation Mechanism;ZigBee Network","Abstracts;Arrays;Network topology;Performance evaluation;Routing;Topology","Boolean functions;Zigbee;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication network topology;trees (mathematics);wireless sensor networks","DAAM;WSN;ZigBee networks;distributed address allocation mechanism;fast packet routing;high efficiency network addressing;improved binary tree topology;simple Boolean computation;telecommunication network topology;wireless sensor network","","0","","8","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From a series of experiments, the error for our orientation angle estimation is below 0.20 for any possible document rotation and the accuracy of inverted music score detection is up to 98.89%.

A major issue is the computational complexity in geometric growth when the dimension of concept space increases. In this paper, we store a portion of the sampling data and calculate its variance, after which the variance minimization method is proposed to investigate the support vectors. Finally, we optimize the support vectors coupled with their weight vectors, and compare the PAC-Bayes bounds. The experimental results of our artificial data sets in low-dimensional spaces show that the optimization is reasonable and effective in practice.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890745","Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC);PAC-Bayes bound;Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS);Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Abstracts;Erbium;Monte Carlo methods;Optimization;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;pattern classification;sampling methods","Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm;PAC-Bayes bound;Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space;classifiers;computational complexity;low-dimensional spaces;posterior distributions;support vectors;tightest risk bounds;variance minimization method;weight vectors","","0","","14","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Health identification of traditional Chinese medicine with tongue images","Chang Feng; Shali Jiang; Hongwu Wang; Shizhong Liao","School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, 3 00072, China","2013 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20140908","2013","01","","398","399","Physical examination, which refers to various organs, depends on a lot of medical apparatus and instruments. The diagnostic result according to the examination reports is objective and reliable, but people cannot get the result instantly. As an important diagnostic method in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), tongue diagnosis is straightforward, which depends on a sophisticated Chinese medicine doctor to examine the tongue of a patient. However, due to its qualitative, subjective and experience-based nature, traditional tongue diagnosis has a very limited application in clinical treatment. In this paper, we bridge the gap between tongue samples and their physical examination reports. With tongue images and diagnostic results according to the physical examination reports taken into account, the Health Identification System (HIS) we developed explores the relations between the tongue and health condition of a patient. Given a new tongue image, HIS automatically suggests a diagnostic result as tongue diagnosis does. Experimental results derived from a group of 1426 patients as well as other 747 volunteers show that SVM with linear kernel can obtain better performance with less computational cost than SVMs with other kernels. Ultimately, we embed SVM with linear kernel into HIS to learn a model for the tongue diagnosis.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890501","Healthy identification;SVM;Tongue diagnosis;Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)","Abstracts;Electronic publishing;Heating;Information services;Internet;Kernel;Tongue","electronic health records;medical image processing;patient diagnosis;support vector machines","HIS;Health Identification System;SVM;TCM;health identification;linear kernel;patient health condition;tongue diagnostic results;tongue images;traditional Chinese medicine","","0","","15","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method to detect dense subgraphs in an undirected and unweighted graph with the adoption of punished similarity.

During the rule activation step, data incompleteness and inconsistency may be seen as paired situations, since the former appears due to lack of information while the latter can be represented as an excess of heterogeneous information activated. To effectively take advantage of this fact, this research presents a Dynamic Rule Activation (DRA) method, which searches for a balance between both incomplete and inconsistent situations to improve the overall performance of the DSS. Although DRA is designed as a flexible method, able to work with most similarity measures, in this research it is applied in the context of Extended Belief Rule-Bases (E-BRBs). The case studies illustrated in this research demonstrate how the use of DRA can improve the accuracy of E-BRB based decision support models. In this regard, the RIMER+ model and the simple weighted average of the activated rules were tested with and without using DRA as pre-processing method.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890895","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890895","Decision making;belief rule-base;decision support system;information incompleteness;spatial decision making;uncertainty;urban regeneration","Abstracts;Breast;Cancer;Engines;Erbium","data integrity;decision support systems;knowledge based systems","DRA method;DSS;E-BRB;RIMER+ model;dynamic rule activation method;extended belief rule-bases;heterogeneous information;information incompleteness;most rule inference methods;preprocessing method;rule activation step;rule-based decision support systems;simple weighted average;uncertainty","","3","","10","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Radar reflectivity cross section was generated based on the cutting line with nearest neighbor interpolation in radial direction as well as azimuth, and linear interpolation in vertical direction. Weak echo region or bounded weak echo region was extracted using boundary detection in different areas which has different echo intensities.

Although this problem has attracted much attention recently, there are still several challenges that have not been addressed so far, even for the most popular one: similarity link prediction based on common neighbors. Most existing algorithms focus on how to enhance neighbors' role to the candidate pair, and takes the neighbors' role as the sole contribution. For this reason, these algorithms seldom pay attention to how neighbors may influence to others since neighbors may link together in real network. To address this issue, in this paper, we investigate the problem of defining the latent correlation between common neighbors and improve several similarity-based methods via two modified naive Bayesian models.

It captures signal information that contains local trends by measuring signal oscillations, which can be quantized by some local high frequency components or local low frequency components, i.e., IMFs. Orthogonality of the IMFs is an important index to measure the performance of the EMD method. However, instead of elaborating theoretically, most literatures only check the orthogonality in practical sense. In other words, the direct IMFs are not exactly orthogonal. In this paper, in order to get orthogonal IMFs, we orthogonalize the IMFs. According to the sequence, two ways of orthogonalization can be developed: one is from the top IMF to the last, and the other is in the contrary sequence. The orthogonal IMFs can express the original signal more accurately. For the first orthogonalization strategy in face recognition, namely from the top IMF to the last, they are sorted from the highest frequency to the lowest frequency, which correspond to the detail of coarse facial information (facial features). In our experiments, several strategies are designed to find the most efficient orthogonal IMF. Excellent performances are obtained on the eMU PIE database.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890897","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890897","Empirical Mode Decomposition;Facial Extraction;Illumination Invariant;Orthogonalization","Abstracts","face recognition;feature extraction;image representation;visual databases","CMU PIE database;EMD method;IMF orthogonality;adaptive signal representation;coarse facial lowest mation;empirical mode decomposition;face recognition;facial feature extraction method;intrinsic mode functions;local high frequency components;local low frequency components;orthogonalization;signal decomposition technique;signal information;signal oscillations","","0","","10","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A particularly modified convolutional neural network is firstly employed as a trainable feature extractor to extract low-dimensional, linear separable, translationally invariant features. Furthermore, a sequential model, modified conditional random field(CRF), is utilized to model the dependency between characters.

Previous work has shown that word senses carry potentially useful information for sentiment analysis. However due to limitations in the existing methods to assign senses to words in open-domain texts, this word sense based approach has not demonstrated significant advantages over the traditional term-based approaches. Also most sentiment lexicons consider limited polarity values (usually 2 or 3), therefore may convey very little information for distinguishing between a sentence that is positive and one that is negative. This paper proposes to address these limitations by making use of term-based sentiment lexicons, by increasing the number of possible polarity values considered in lexicons, and by processing the sentences for local negation. Finally we propose a novel sentiment representation generated by merging the word features with the developed sentiment features in a single sequence. Our evaluations show that and our proposed improvements effectively increased the quality of the sentiment representations. However, these sentiment representations are still behind the best factored representations which exclude the sentiment features.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890481","Information Retrieval;Kernel Methods;Opinion Mining;Polarity Classification;Sentiment Analysis;Social Media;Word Sense Disambiguation","Abstracts;Motion pictures;Tin","data mining;information retrieval;merging;natural language processing;text analysis","effective sentiment classification;limited polarity value;open domain text;sentence processing;sentiment analysis;sentiment feature;sentiment representation;term-based sentiment lexicon;word features merging;word sense assignment","","1","","35","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem becomes more important for wireless local area networks (WLANs), where the radio signals are susceptible to a variety of attacks due to the nature of the open medium. This paper proposes a survey of security positioning systems in WLANs. We classify secure positioning mechanisms into two categories: signal-based and model-based approaches. The former attempts to detect attacks and exclude them during positioning while the latter enhances localization schemes capable of tolerating attacks. This study examines three signal-based approaches, including median-based method, sensor selection, and RSM (Ration-based Signal strength Metric), and three model-based approaches, including cluster-based method, RWGH (Residual Weighting), and IDM (Inclusive Disjunction Model). We evaluate their robustness to attacks, positioning accuracy, and computational complexity. Simulation results show that the model-based techniques generally perform better robustness; However, the improvement is gained at the expense of degrading performance in an attack-free condition and higher computational overhead. This paper also investigates how the number of attacks impact these secure positioning algorithms.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890804","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890804","fingerprinting-based system;mobile positioning;secure localization","Analytical models;Complexity theory;Fingerprint recognition;Robustness","computer network security;fingerprint identification;wireless LAN","IDM;RSM;RWGH;WLAN;attack detection;cluster-based method;computational complexity;fingerprinting localization security;inclusive disjunction model;location based application;median-based method;model-based approach;radio signals;ration-based signal strength metric;residual weighting;security positioning systems;sensor selection;signal-based approach;wireless local area networks","","0","","14","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The multi-scale information system is a new and interesting topic in the theory of GrC. In this paper, the multi-granulation rough set approach is introduced into the multi-scale information systems. Firstly, the notion of multi-scale information systems is introduced. In multi-scale information systems, a hierarchical structure of granules can be obtained. At every level, the optimistic and the pessimistic multi-granulation rough sets can be defined based on a family of the equivalence relations. Analogously, the boundary region can be defined as usual at every level.
