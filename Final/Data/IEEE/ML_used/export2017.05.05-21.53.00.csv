"A Practical Evaluation of Information Processing and Abstraction Techniques for the Internet of Things","F. Ganz; D. Puschmann; P. Barnaghi; F. Carrez","Centre for Communication Systems Research, University of Surrey, Surrey, U.K.","IEEE Internet of Things Journal","20150730","2015","2","4","340","354","The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interaction and communication between billions of devices that produce and exchange data related to real-world objects (i.e. things). Extracting higher level information from the raw sensory data captured by the devices and representing this data as machine-interpretable or human-understandable information has several interesting applications. Deriving raw data into higher level information representations demands mechanisms to find, extract, and characterize meaningful abstractions from the raw data. This meaningful abstractions then have to be presented in a human and/or machine-understandable representation. However, the heterogeneity of the data originated from different sensor devices and application scenarios such as e-health, environmental monitoring, and smart home applications, and the dynamic nature of sensor data make it difficult to apply only one particular information processing technique to the underlying data. A considerable amount of methods from machine-learning, the semantic web, as well as pattern and data mining have been used to abstract from sensor observations to information representations. This paper provides a survey of the requirements and solutions and describes challenges in the area of information abstraction and presents an efficient workflow to extract meaningful information from raw sensor data based on the current state-of-the-art in this area. This paper also identifies research directions at the edge of information abstraction for sensor data. To ease the understanding of the abstraction workflow process, we introduce a software toolkit that implements the introduced techniques and motivates to apply them on various data sets.","2327-4662;23274662","","10.1109/JIOT.2015.2411227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7055837","Data Abstraction;Data abstraction;Internet of Things;Internet of Things (IoT);Semantic Web;Software Tools;machine-learning;semantic Web;software tools","Band-pass filters;Context;Data mining;Information filters;Internet of things;Vectors","Internet of Things;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Internet of Things;IoT;abstraction techniques;data mining;human-understandable information data;information abstraction;information processing;information processing technique;machine-interpretable data;machine-learning;pattern mining;semantic Web;sensor devices","","14","","51","","20150306","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Computing optimal solutions in many of these problems are unmanageable. Heuristic search methods are known to obtain good results in an acceptable time interval. However, parameters need to be adjusted to allow good results. In this sense, learning strategies can enhance the performance of a system, providing it with the ability to learn, for instance, the most suitable optimization technique for solving a particular class of problems, or the most suitable parameterization of a given algorithm on a given scenario. Hyper-heuristics arise in this context as efficient methodologies for selecting or generating (meta) heuristics to solve NP-hard optimization problems. This paper presents the specification of a hyper-heuristic for selecting techniques inspired in nature, for solving the problem of scheduling in manufacturing systems, based on previous experience. The proposed hyper-heuristic module uses a reinforcement learning algorithm, which enables the system with the ability to autonomously select the meta-heuristic to use in optimization process as well as the respective parameters. A computational study was carried out to evaluate the influence of the hyper-heuristics on the performance of a scheduling system.

With the advent of high-resolution time-series power demand data through advanced metering, mining this data could be costly from the computational viewpoint. One of the popular techniques is clustering, but depending on the algorithm the resolution of the data can have an important influence on the resulting clusters. This paper shows how temporal resolution of power demand profiles affects the quality of the clustering process, the consistency of cluster membership (profiles exhibiting similar behavior), and the efficiency of the clustering process. This work uses both raw data from household consumption data and synthetic profiles. The motivation for this work is to improve the clustering of electricity load profiles to help distinguish user types for tariff design and switching, fault and fraud detection, demand-side management, and energy efficiency measures. The key criterion for mining very large data sets is how little information needs to be used to get a reliable result, while maintaining privacy and security.","0885-8950;08858950","","10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2377213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994292","Classification algorithms;clustering algorithms;data mining;energy consumption;machine learning;power demand;smart grids","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Energy consumption;Machine learning;Power demand;Smart grids","data mining;data privacy;demand side management;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;power meters;power system analysis computing;power system economics;power system faults;power system security;tariffs;time series;very large databases","advanced metering;classification algorithms;cluster membership consistency;clustering process efficiency;clustering process quality;commercial sectors;data resolution;demand-side management;energy efficiency measures;fault detection;fraud detection;high-resolution time-series power demand data;information needs;machine learning;power demand profiles;privacy maintenance;raw data temporal resolution;residential electricity load profiles;residential sectors;security maintenance;selected clustering methods;tariff design;tariff switching;very large data set mining","","1","","29","","20141219","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Even though the detection technologies for new threats have improved over time, modern malware still manage to pass even the most secure and well organized computer networks, firewalls and intrusion detection equipments, making all systems vulnerable. This is the main reason that automatic learning is used more often than any other detection algorithms as it can learn from existing attacks and prevent newer ones.

For this purpose, several online sparsification criteria have been proposed to restrict the model definition on a subset of samples. The most known criterion is the (linear) approximation criterion, which discards any sample that can be well represented by the already contributing samples, an operation with excessive computational complexity. Several computationally efficient sparsification criteria have been introduced in the literature with the distance and the coherence criteria. This paper provides a unified framework that connects these sparsification criteria in terms of approximating samples, by establishing theoretical bounds on the approximation errors. Furthermore, the error of approximating any pattern is investigated, by proposing upper bounds on the approximation error for each of the aforementioned sparsification criteria. Two classes of fundamental patterns are described in detail, the centroid (i.e., empirical mean) and the principal axes in the kernel principal component analysis. Experimental results show the relevance of the theoretical results established in this paper.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2015.2442960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120172","Adaptive filtering;gram matrix;kernel-based methods;machine learning;online learning;pattern recognition;resource-allocating networks;sparse approximation;sparsification criteria","Coherence;Computational modeling;Dictionaries;Kernel;Least squares approximations;Principal component analysis","","","","2","","44","","20150609","Sept.1, 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Hence, we motivate deep learning for software language modeling, highlighting fundamental differences between state-of-the-practice software language models and connectionist models. Our deep learning models are applicable to source code files (since they only require lexically analyzed source code written in any programming language) and other types of artifacts. We show how a particular deep learning model can remember its state to effectively model sequential data, e.g., Streaming software tokens, and the state is shown to be much more expressive than discrete tokens in a prefix. Then we instantiate deep learning models and show that deep learning induces high-quality models compared to n-grams and cache-based n-grams on a corpus of Java projects. We experiment with two of the models' hyper parameters, which govern their capacity and the amount of context they use to inform predictions, before building several committees of software language models to aid generalization. Then we apply the deep learning models to code suggestion and demonstrate their effectiveness at a real SE task compared to state-of-the-practice models. Finally, we propose avenues for future work, where deep learning can be brought to bear to support model-based testing, improve software lexicons, and conceptualize software artifacts.

But such reviews have become increasingly onerous to produce due to the exponentially expanding biomedical literature base. This study proposes a step toward mitigating this problem by automating risk of bias assessment in systematic reviews, in which reviewers determine whether study results may be affected by biases (e.g., poor randomization or blinding). Conducting risk of bias assessment is an important but onerous task. We thus describe a machine learning approach to automate this assessment, using the standard Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool which assesses seven common types of bias. Training such a system would typically require a large labeled corpus, which would be prohibitively expensive to collect here. Instead, we use distant supervision, using data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (a large repository of systematic reviews), to pseudoannotate a corpus of 2200 clinical trial reports in PDF format.

In China, there are more than 100 million diabetics. How to help them track and manage real-time glucose level is significant to control diabetic progression. As well known, the glucose level is directly related with food, while the conventional tracking glucose is depending invasive or minimally invasive methods. This phenomenon causes many problems to diabetics for food selection and glucose monitoring. To solve this challenge, we are motivated to propose a postprandial glucose prediction model, which can connect food selection and diabetic self-management seamlessly, without involving invasive glucose monitoring. In this paper, we first build up a glucose tracking system based on Android platform. And then, we conceive a postprandial glucose prediction model based on machine learning methods, in which sample data from diabetics' diet are collected and analyzed for predicting a postprandial glucose level of a user. To verify our model, we compared the prediction results with our clinical tests by using traditional glucose monitoring methods. In order to extract a reliable glucose prediction model, two kinds of linear regression algorithms are adopted, which confidence margin is bounded within 20% that matching with the FDA standard. Our experiment results show that this prediction-based glucose tracking system is helpful to diabetics, and can be used as an auxiliary tool to control their glucose and diet.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6168-9; POD:978-1-4799-6169-6","10.1109/Ubi-HealthTech.2015.7203318","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7203318","DiabeticSelf-Management.;Food Selection;Glucose-Tracking;Machine Learning;Postprandial GlucosePrediction","Androids;Blood;Diabetes;Humanoid robots;Servers;Sugar;Training","Android (operating system);biomedical telemetry;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;regression analysis;sugar","Android platform;FDA standard;clinical tests;diabetic progression;diabetic self-management;glucose monitoring;machine learning methods;minimally invasive methods;postprandial glucose prediction model;prediction-based glucose tracking system","","0","","11","","","28-30 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the scalable and fault-tolerant nature of MapReduce introduces additional costs in disk IO and data transfer, caused by streaming intermediate outputs to disk. In light of these issues, many interesting research projects have been initiated with the goal of improving the compute speed and power efficiency of compute-intensive cloud computing workloads, several with the addition of discrete GPUs. In this work, we present a modified MapReduce approach focused on the iterative clustering algorithms in the Apache Mahout machine learning library that leverage the acceleration potential of the Intel integrated GPU in a multi-node cluster environment. The accelerated framework shows varying levels of speed-up (‚âà45x for Map tasks-only, ‚âà4.37x for the entire K-means clustering) as evaluated using the HiBench benchmark suite. Based on various experiments and in-depth analysis, we find that utilizing the integrated GPU via OpenCL offers significant performance and power efficiency gains over the original CPU based approach. Further analysis is also done to understand the correlations between compute, IO and power efficiency. As such, our results show that embracing the integrated GPU in the Hadoop MapReduce framework represents a promising advance in adding cost and energy efficient compute parallelism to a data parallel multinode environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8128-1; POD:978-1-4799-8129-8","10.1109/BigDataService.2015.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184877","Big Data;GPGPU;Hadoop;Integrated Graphics;Machine Learning;Mahout;OpenCL","Acceleration;Graphics processing units;Java;Kernel;Optimization;Performance gain;Power demand","Big Data;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;pattern clustering;power aware computing","Apache Hadoop;Apache Mahout machine learning library;Hadoop MapReduce framework;HiBench benchmark suite;Intel integrated GPU;MapReduce-based big data processing;OpenCL;acceleration potential;computational speed;data parallel multinode environment;data parallelism;data transfer;discrete GPU;disk IO;energy efficiency;energy efficient compute parallelism;fault-tolerant nature;iterative clustering algorithms;multinode cluster environment;power efficient MapReduce workload acceleration;programming models","","0","","33","","","March 30 2015-April 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By ubiquitous collection of multi-sensor bike data, consisting of visual images, accelerometer information and GPS coordinates of the bikers' smartphone, the proposed system is able to distinguish between 6 different road/terrain types. In order to perform this classification task, the system employs a random decision forest (RDF), fed with a set of discriminative image and accelerometer features. For every instance of road (5 seconds), we extract these features and map the RDF result onto the GPS data of the users' smartphone. Finally, based on all the collected instances, we can annotate geographic maps with the road/terrain types and create a visualization of the route. The accuracy of the novel multi-modal bike sensing system for the 6-class road/terrain classification task is 92%. This result outperforms both the visual and accelerometer only classification, showing that the combination of both sensors is a win-win. For the 2-class on-road/off-road classification an accuracy of 97% is achieved, almost six percent above the state-of-the-art in this domain.

ABI is a technique capable of measuring very subtle X-ray deflection and scatter phenomena when passing through an imaged object producing three parametric images (Absorption, Refraction and ultra-small angle scatter USAXS).

However, most of the canonical classifiers are not well-suited for big data analytics. This is especially vivid in case of distance-based classifiers, where their classification time is prohibitive. Recently, many methods for adapting nearest neighbour classifier for big data were proposed. We investigate simple, yet efficient technique based on random under-sampling of the dataset. As we deal with stationary data, one may assume that a subset of objects will sufficiently capture the properties of given dataset. We propose to build distance-based classifiers on the basis of very small subsamples and then combine them into an ensemble. With this, one does not need to aggregate datasets, only local decisions of classifiers. On the basis of experimental results we show that such an approach can return comparable results to nearest neighbour classifier over the entire dataset, but with a significantly reduced classification time. We investigate the number of sub-samples (ensemble members), that are required for capturing the properties of each dataset. Finally, we propose to apply our sub-sampling based ensemble in a distributed environment, which allows for a further reduction of the computational complexity of nearest neighbour rule for big data.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8322-3; POD:978-1-4799-8323-0","10.1109/CYBConf.2015.7175952","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7175952","big data;classifier ensemble;distributed classifier;machine learning;parallel computing","Accuracy;Aggregates;Big data;Computer architecture;Couplings;Prototypes;Training","Big Data;computational complexity;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods","aggregate dataset;big data analytics;classification time;classifier decision;computational complexity;data volume;dataset random undersampling;distance-based classifier;distributed environment;ensemble member;machine learning system;nearest neighbour classifier;stationary data","","0","","19","","","24-26 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, research on SBST has typically focused on only a few search approaches and basic techniques. A majority of publications in recent years use some form of evolutionary search, typically a genetic algorithm, or, alternatively, some other optimization algorithm inspired from nature. This paper argues that SBST researchers and practitioners should not restrict themselves to a limited choice of search algorithms or approaches to optimization. To support our argument we empirically investigate three alternatives and compare them to the de facto SBST standards in regards to performance, resource efficiency and robustness on different test data generation problems: classic algorithms from the optimization literature, bayesian optimization with gaussian processes from machine learning, and nested monte carlo search from game playing / reinforcement learning. In all cases we show comparable and sometimes better performance than the current state-of-the-SBST-art.

This paper introduces an efficient methodology that could be implemented in hardware to differentiate OSA patients from normal controls, based on the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For this purpose, first, the EEG recorded datasets that were obtained from the Phsyionet website are filtered and decomposed into delta, theta alpha, beta and gamma sub-bands using Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) Butterworth band-pass filters. Second, descriptive features such as energy and variance are extracted from each frequency band that are used as input parameters for classification. Finally, several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes (NB) are employed in order to identify if the OSA exists or not, according to the objective of this study. The results that are obtained from these classifiers are then compared in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The experimental results show that the SVM attained the best classification accuracy of 97.14% as compared to the others.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8643-9; POD:978-1-4799-8644-6","10.1109/LISAT.2015.7160186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160186","EEG signals;EEG sub-bands;Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA);classification;machine learning algorithms","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Sleep apnea;Support vector machines","Butterworth filters;IIR filters;band-pass filters;electroencephalography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;signal classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","ANN;EEG signal analysis;IIR Butterworth band-pass filters;LDA;NB;OSA;SVM;alpha subband;artificial neural networks;beta subband;delta subband;electroencephalography;energy feature;gamma subband;infinite impulse response;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning algorithms;naive Bayes;obstructive sleep apnea classification;sleep-related breathing disorders;support vector machines;theta subband;variance feature","","0","","26","","","1-1 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In light of the need for new innovations to sustain these improvements, we discuss approximate computing, a field that has attracted considerable interest over the last decade. While the core principles of approximate computing - computing efficiently by producing results that are good enough or of sufficient quality - are not new and are shared by many fields from algorithm design to networks and distributed systems, recent e?orts have seen a percolation of these principles to all layers of the computing stack, including circuits, architecture, and software. Approximate computing techniques have also evolved from ad hoc and application-specific to more broadly applicable, supported by systematic design methodologies. Finally, the emergence of workloads such as recognition, mining, search, data analytics, inference and vision are greatly increasing the opportunities for approximate computing.

This review will address this question in the context of AV speech processing, and especially speech recognition, where one of the issues is that the modalities both interact but also sometimes appear to desynchronize from each other. An additional issue that sometimes arises is that one of the modalities may be missing at test time, although it is available at training time; for example, it may be possible to collect AV training data while only having access to audio at test time. We will review approaches to address this issue from the area of multiview learning, where the goal is to learn a model or representation for each of the modalities separately while taking advantage of the rich multimodal training data. In addition to multiview learning, we also discuss the recent application of deep learning (DL) toward AV fusion.

The antenna pattern selection for each UE is considered to be a supervised machine learning classification problem, in which the small-cell BS seek to find the optimal antenna pattern to serve each UE according to its measurement reports (i.e., UE radio-frequency fingerprint). Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach, despite potential inaccuracies in UE measurement reports.

We formulate the problem within a game theoretic framework where the client needs to decide an optimal fusion strategy using both non-trusted information from the cloud and local trusted data, given that the adversary on the cloud is trying to deceive the client by biasing the output to a different value/set of values. We adopt an Iterated Best Response (IBR) scheme for each player to update its action based on the opponent's announced computation. At each iteration, the cloud reveals its output to the client, who then computes the best response as a linear combination of its private local estimate and of the untrusted cloud output. We characterize equilibrium conditions for both the scalar and vector cases of the computed value of interest. Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence for the IBR are derived and insightful geometric interpretations of such conditions is discussed for the vector case.

Solving these problems usually involves building/training a model/classifier and validating its performance for a given task. In this paper we compare two resampling methods for assessment of a random forest classifier: k-fold cross-validation and bootstrap. We use these methods to estimate the generalization error and to create learning curves. Both methods yield similar results on our data. The most important requirement for good generalization error estimates of either method is that the used data sample (i.e. the training dataset) represents the unknown true distribution of the data.

Therefore, various techniques have been developed to deal adequately with MV, especially those based on imputation methods. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was carried out to summarize the existing techniques dealing with MV in SE datasets and to classify the selected studies according to six classification criteria: research type, research approach, MV technique, MV type, data types and MV objective.

Those attempts followed by performance evaluation are repeated until satisfactory results are obtained. The task of performance tuning requires a great deal of time and effort. On account of combinatorial explosion of possible attempts, scientists/tuning experts have a tendency to make decisions on what to be explored just based on their intuition or good sense of tuning. We advocate evidence-based performance tuning (EBT) that facilitates the use of database of facts extracted from tuning histories of applications to guide the exploration of the search space. However, in general, performance tuning is conducted as transient tasks without version control systems. Tuning histories may lack explicit facts about what kind of program transformation contributed to the better performance or even about the chronological order of the source code snapshots. For reconstructing the missing information, we employ a state-of-the-art fine-grained change pattern identification tool for inferring applied transformation patterns only from an unordered set of source code snapshots. The extracted facts are intended to be stored and queried for further data mining.

The current solutions - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and statistical classification, rely on the availability of a training set. In case of these there is a cumbersome need to regularly update the signatures. Further their visibility is limited to classes the classifier has been trained for. Unsupervised algorithms have been envisioned as a an alternative to automatically identify classes of traffic. To address these issues Self Learning Network Traffic Classification is proposed. It uses unsupervised algorithms along with an adaptive seeding approach to automatically lets classes of traffic to emerge, making them identified and labelled. Unlike traditional classifiers, there is no need of a-priori knowledge of signatures nor a training set to extract the signatures. Instead, Self Learning Network Traffic Classification automatically groups flows into pure (or homogeneous) clusters using simple statistical features. This label assignment (which is still based on some manual intervention) ensures that class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, Self Learning Network Traffic Classification uses an iterative seeding approach which will boost its ability to cope with new protocols and applications.

Atlas-based segmentation has shown to be a suitable tool for the segmentation of large structures such as the brainstem or the cerebellum. However, smaller structures such as the optic nerves are more difficult to segment. In this work, we present a novel approach to automatically segment the optic nerves, which is based on Support Vector Machines (SVM).

The FIM utilizes a seven-point ordinal scale to measure patient independence while performing several activities of daily living, such as walking, grooming, and bathing. Wearable inertial sensor data were collected from ecological ambulatory tasks at two time points mid-stay during inpatient rehabilitation. Machine learning algorithms were trained with sensor-derived features and clinical information obtained from medical records at admission to the inpatient facility. While models trained only with clinical features predicted discharge scores well, we were able to achieve an even higher level of prediction accuracy when also including the wearable sensor-derived features.

Although computational techniques including interpolation and substitution have been applied to recover missing information caused by cloud contamination, these algorithms are subject to many limitations. In this paper, a novel smart information reconstruction (SMIR) method is proposed, in order to reconstruct cloud contaminated pixel values from the time-space-spectrum continuum with the aid of a machine learning tool, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). For the purpose of demonstration, the performance of SMIR is evaluated by reconstructing the missing remote sensing reflectance values derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite over Lake Nicaragua, where is a very cloudy area year round. For comparison, the traditional backpropagation neural network algorithms will also be implemented to reconstruct the missing values. Experimental results show that the ELM outperforms the BP algorithms by an enhanced machine learning capacity with simulated memory effect embedded in MODIS due to linking the complex time-space-spectrum continuum between cloud-free and cloudy pixels. The ELM-based SMIR practice presents a correlation coefficient of 0.88 with root mean squared error of 7.4E - 04sr<sup>-1</sup> between simulated and observed reflectance values. Finding suggests that the SMIR method is effective to reconstruct all the missing information providing visually logical and quantitatively assured images for further image processing and interpretation in environmental applications.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2400636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7063914","Artificial neural network;cloud removal;computational intelligence;extreme learning machine;machine learning;satellite images","Clouds;Contamination;Image reconstruction;Neural networks;Remote sensing;Satellites;Training","clouds;geophysical image processing;image reconstruction;lakes;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;reflectivity;remote sensing","ELM-based SMIR practice;Lake Nicaragua;SMIR method;Terra satellite;backpropagation neural network algorithm;cloud contaminated pixel reconstruction;cloud contamination;cloud removal;cloud-free;cloudy area;cloudy pixel;computational technique;enhanced machine learning capacity;environmental application;extreme learning machine;infrared spectral range;machine learning tool;missing information recovery;missing remote sensing reflectance value;moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer;root mean squared error;satellite image processing;smart information reconstruction;time-space-spectrum continuum;visible spectral range","","4","","66","","20150319","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we present some results toward the automated diagnosis of PD by means of computer vision-based techniques in a dataset composed by dozens of patients, which is one of the main contributions of this work. The dataset is part of a joint research project that aims at extracting both visual and signal-based information from healthy and PD patients in order to go forward the early diagnosis of PD patients.

The main challenge remains to reliably find and identify threat objects in the bag from DECT data. This task is particularly hard due to the wide variety of objects, the high clutter, and the presence of metal, which causes streaks and shading in the scanner images. Image noise and artifacts are generally much more severe than in medical CT and can lead to splitting of objects and inaccurate object labeling. The conventional approach performs object segmentation and material identification in two decoupled processes. Dual-energy information is typically not used for the segmentation, and object localization is not explicitly used to stabilize the material parameter estimates. We propose a novel learning-based framework for joint segmentation and identification of objects directly from volumetric DECT images, which is robust to streaks, noise and variability due to clutter. We focus on segmenting and identifying a small set of objects of interest with characteristics that are learned from training images, and consider everything else as background. We include data weighting to mitigate metal artifacts and incorporate an object boundary field to reduce object splitting. The overall formulation is posed as a multilabel discrete optimization problem and solved using an efficient graph-cut algorithm. We test the method on real data and show its potential for producing accurate labels of the objects of interest without splits in the presence of metal and clutter.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2456507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7159062","Baggage screening;Dual-energy X-ray computed tomography;Homeland security;Machine learning;Object labeling;Threat detection;baggage screening;homeland security;machine learning;object labeling;threat detection","Attenuation;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Labeling;Metals;Noise;X-ray imaging","computerised tomography;graph theory;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);national security;object recognition;optimisation;parameter estimation","baggage screening;data weighting;decoupled processes;dual-energy CT images;dual-energy X-ray computed tomography;dual-energy information;graph-cut algorithm;image artifacts;image noise;learning-based object identification;learning-based object segmentation;material identification;material parameter estimate stability;medical CT;metal artifact mitigation;multilabel discrete optimization problem;nondestructive evaluation;object boundary field;object labeling;object localization;object splitting reduction;scanner images;threat object identification;training images;volumetric DECT images","","1","","40","","20150715","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The method will enable future advanced driving assistance systems to determine driving context and predict possible scenarios of driving behavior by segmenting and modeling incoming driving-behavior time series data. In previous studies, we applied the DAA model to driving-behavior data and argued that contextual changing points can be estimated as changing points of chunks. A sequence prediction method, which predicts the next hidden state sequence, was also proposed in a previous study. However, the original DAA model does not model the duration of chunks of driving behavior and is not able to do a temporal prediction of the scenarios. Our DAA-TP method explicitly models the duration of chunks of driving behavior on the assumption that driving-behavior data have a two-layered hierarchical structure, i.e., double articulation structure. For this purpose, the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semi-Markov model is used for explicitly modeling the duration of segments of driving-behavior data. A Poisson distribution is also used to model the duration distribution of driving-behavior segments. The duration distribution of chunks of driving-behavior data is also theoretically calculated using the reproductive property of the Poisson distribution. We also propose a calculation method for obtaining the probability distribution of the remaining duration of current driving words as a mixture of Poisson distribution with a theoretical approximation for unobserved driving words. This method can calculate the posterior probability distribution of the next termination time of chunks by explicitly modeling all probable chunking results for observed data. The DAA-TP was applied to a synthetic data set having a double articulation structure to evaluate its model consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of DAA-TP, we appl- ed it to a driving-behavior data set recorded at actual factory circuits. The DAA-TP could predict the next termination time of chunks more accurately than the compared methods. We also report the qualitative results for understanding the potential capability of DAA-TP.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2376525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990595","Driving data;long-term prediction;machine learning;nonparametric Bayes","Context modeling;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Probability distribution;Time series analysis;Vehicles","Markov processes;Poisson distribution;driver information systems;unsupervised learning","DAA-TP method;Poisson distribution;advanced driving assistance systems;chunk termination time;double articulation analyzer with temporal prediction;double articulation structure;driving-behavior segment duration distribution;driving-behavior time series;hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden semiMarkov model;probability distribution;sequence prediction method;synthetic data set;two-layered hierarchical structure;unsupervised hierarchical contextual changing point prediction modeling;unsupervised hierarchical driving behavior modeling;unsupervised learning method","","7","","28","","20141218","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In particular, crowd monitoring represents a central aspect in many practical applications for managing and preventing emergencies due to panic and overcrowding.

In this paper, we present a unified analytic framework for detecting the early warning signs of churn, and assigning a ""Churn Score"" to each customer that indicates the likelihood that the particular individual will churn within a predefined amount of time. This framework employs a brute force approach to feature engineering, then winnows the set of relevant attributes via feature selection, before feeding the final feature-set into a suite of supervised learning algorithms.

SAETA relies on a sensing infrastructure that monitors both players and their environment, and produces real-time data that is analyzed by different modules of a decision engine. Technical-tactical effort control is based on a dynamic programming model, which selects the best activity and rest durations in interval training, with the goal of maximizing effort while preventing fatigue. Exercise quality control consists of two stages. In the first stage, movements are detected by means of a k-nearest neighbors classifier and in the second stage, movement intensity is classified according to recent statistical data from the player being analyzed. These analyses are reported to coaches and players in real-time. SAETA has been developed in close collaboration with the Universidad CatoÃÅlica San Antonio de Murcia volleyball team, which competes in the Spanish women's premier league.

Many methods exist to reduce feature set dimensionality and construct improved features from an initial set; however, there are few general approaches for the design of features from numeric sequences. Any information lost in preprocessing or feature measurement cannot be recreated during pattern recognition. General approaches are needed to extend pattern recognition to include feature design and selection for numeric sequences, such as time series, within the learning process itself. This paper proposes a novel genetic programming (GP) approach to automated feature design called Autofead. In this method, a GP variant evolves a population of candidate features built from a library of sequence-handling functions. Numerical optimization methods, included through a hybrid approach, ensure that the fitness of candidate algorithms is measured using optimal parameter values. Autofead represents the first automated feature design system for numeric sequences to leverage the power and efficiency of both numerical optimization and standard pattern recognition algorithms. Potential applications include the monitoring of electrocardiogram signals for indications of heart failure, network traffic analysis for intrusion detection systems, vibration measurement for bearing condition determination in rotating machinery, and credit card activity for fraud detection.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2014.2341451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6861439","Feature design;genetic programming;machine learning;pattern recognition;sequence classification;time series classification;time series data mining","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Genetic programming;Pattern recognition;Standards;Time series analysis;Vegetation","data reduction;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;time series","Autofead;GP approach;automated feature design system;bearing condition determination;candidate algorithms;credit card activity;electrocardiogram signal monitoring;feature measurement;feature selection;feature set dimensionality reduction;fraud detection;genetic programming;heart failure;information lost;intrusion detection systems;learning process;maximum-informationfeature sets;minimum-dimension feature sets;network traffic analysis;numeric sequence classification;numerical optimization;numerical optimization methods;optimal parameter values;pattern recognition methods;regression tasks;rotating machinery;sequence-handling functions;time series","","5","","32","","20140721","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are often the underlying cross relatedness amongst these single-task learnings in IQA, which is ignored by the previous approaches. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-task learning framework to train IQA models simultaneously across individual tasks each of which concerns one distortion type. These relatedness can be therefore exploited to improve the generalization ability of IQA models from single-task learning. In addition, pairwise image quality rank instead of image quality rating is optimized in learning task. By mapping image quality rank to image quality rating, a novel no-reference (NR) IQA approach can be derived.

Patients are classified as having HCM if the majority of their recorded heartbeats are recognized as characteristic of HCM. Thus, the classifier's underlying task is to recognize individual heartbeats segmented from 12-lead ECG signals as HCM beats, where heartbeats from non-HCM cardiovascular patients are used as controls. We extracted 504 morphological and temporal features-both commonly used and newly-developed ones-from ECG signals for heartbeat classification. To assess classification performance, we trained and tested a random forest classifier and a support vector machine classifier using 5-fold cross validation. We also compared the performance of these two classifiers to that obtained by a logistic regression classifier, and the first two methods performed better than logistic regression. The patient-classification precision of random forests and of support vector machine classifiers is close to 0.85. Recall (sensitivity) and specificity are approximately 0.90.

The experimental result shows that artificial neural networks are suitable for modeling and predicting systolic blood pressure. This novel method of predicting systolic blood pressure contributes to giving early warnings to adults who may not take regular blood pressure measurements. Also, as it is known that an isolated blood pressure measurement is sometimes not very accurate due to the daily fluctuation, our predictor can provide another reference value to the medical staff.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8128-1; POD:978-1-4799-8129-8","10.1109/BigDataService.2015.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184916","Systolic blood pressure;big data application;bio-medical;hypertension;machine learning","Artificial neural networks;Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Electrocardiography;Heart rate;Training","Big Data;backpropagation;blood pressure measurement;medical computing;radial basis function networks","artificial neural network;back-propagation neural network;big data processing;biomedical application;biomedical prediction system;blood pressure measurement;correlated factors;electrocardiography signal;fasting blood sugar;gender;neural network training;performance testing;radial basis function network;serum cholesterol;systolic blood pressure prediction","","0","","20","","","March 30 2015-April 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, as more household appliances and gadgets are now being DC powered, it is more accurate to perform the measurement and identification on the DC demand side. In addition, the AC identification method is not applicable for the DC household-grid. This paper discusses the application of a computational intelligence technique, k-Nearest Neighbours, to classify and identify DC appliances in a low voltage DC household through their 1st second of DC demand-side waveforms, sampled at 500Hz. Voltage and current waveforms were collected from an experiment conducted using this technique and it has been observed from the data collected that DC appliances generate unique current waveforms, similar to signatures, during the 1st second of operation. This time window can be spilt further into an inrush current stage and a steady-state stage. Two primary features and three secondary features of the waveforms were extracted and employed as attributes in the kNN technique, which was successfully used to classify and identify three appliances: a Peltier technology fridge, LED lights and a DC motor fan.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7992-9; Electronic:978-1-4799-7993-6; POD:978-1-4799-7994-3","10.1109/EEEIC.2015.7165222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7165222","Appliance recognition;Direct Current;Load classification;Machine Learning;kNN","DC motors;Feature extraction;Home appliances;Light emitting diodes;Steady-state;Surges;Training","demand side management;domestic appliances;light emitting diodes;power supply quality","AC identification method;AC power supply side;DC appliance classification;DC appliance identification;DC demand side;DC demand-side waveforms;DC household-grid;DC motor fan;LED lights;Peltier technology fridge;computational intelligence;current waveforms;frequency 500 Hz;household appliances;inrush current stage;k-nearest neighbours technique;steady-state stage;time window;voltage waveforms","","4","","11","","","10-13 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Pairwise constraints (PC) are used to specify the types (intra- or inter-class) of points with labels. Since the number of labeled data is typically small in SSL setting, the core idea of this framework is to create and enrich the PC sets using the propagated soft labels from both labeled and unlabeled data by special label propagation (SLP), and hence obtaining more supervised information for delivering enhanced performance. We also propose a Two-stage Sparse Coding, termed TSC, for achieving adaptive neighborhood for SLP. The first stage aims at correcting the possible corruptions in data and training an informative dictionary, and the second stage focuses on sparse coding. To deliver enhanced inter-class separation and intra-class compactness, we also present a mixed soft-similarity measure to evaluate the similarity/dissimilarity of constrained pairs using the sparse codes and outputted probabilistic values by SLP.

To construct a Random Forest classifier, several decision trees are arranged in a forest while a majority voting leads to the final decision. In order to split each node of a decision tree into two children, several possible variables are randomly selected while a splitting criterion is computed for each of them. Using this pool of possible splits, the Random Forest algorithm selects the best variable according to the splitting criterion. Often, this splitting is not reliable leading to a reduced recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose to introduce an additional condition for selecting the best variable leading to an improvement of the recognition accuracy, especially for a smaller number of trees. We enhance the standard threshold selection by a quality estimation that is computed using a calibration method. The proposed method is evaluated on datasets for machine learning as well as object recognition.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1986-4; POD:978-1-4799-1987-1","10.1109/CRV.2015.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158334","Machine Learning;Object Recognition;Random Forest;Splitting","Accuracy;Decision trees;Entropy;Reliability;Standards;Training;Vegetation","decision trees;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;probability","calibrated probabilities;calibration method;decision trees;learning method;machine learning;object recognition;quality estimation;random forest algorithm;random forest classifiers;splitting criterion;threshold selection","","0","","17","","","3-5 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clusters with common scene structure are computed offline. Then, a matching process is performed to select the cluster centroid which is the most similar to the query image. A prior depth map is computed fusing the depth maps of the images in this cluster.

They are very effective in generating meaningful recommendations to a group of users for products or items that might interest them. However, since Collaborative filtering techniques depend on outside sources of information they are susceptible to profile injection attacks popularly known as shilling attacks. Shilling is a process in which syndicating users can connive to promote or demote a certain item. These mischievous users can consciously inject shilling profiles in an effort to bias the recommender system to their advantage. In this paper we seek to understand the degree to which shilling attacks can harm recommender systems and how these attacks can be detected. Firstly, we evaluate the vulnerabilities of collaborative filtering techniques in providing reliable recommendations. We study various attack strategies that manipulators use to attack recommender systems. Secondly we investigate the most suitable features that can be used to adequately identify shilling attacks. We propose the combiner strategy that combines multiple classifiers in an effort to detect shilling attacks. The diversity measure is used to determine the most suitable combination of classifiers. In this paper, we made use k-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machines and Bayesian Networks as the initial base classifiers. The NaiÃàve Bayes was used as a Meta Classifier.

In this paper, through selected use cases, we demonstrate how statistical analyses, machine learning algorithms, optimization and text mining algorithms can be applied to extract meaningful insights from the data available through social media, online commerce, telecommunication industry, smart utility meters and used for variety of business benefits, including improving security. The nature of applied analytical techniques largely depends on the underlying nature of the problem so a one-size-fits-all solution hardly exists. Deriving information from Big Data is also subject to challenges associated with data security and privacy. These and other challenges are discussed in context of the selected problems to illustrate the potential of Big Data analytics.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8128-1; POD:978-1-4799-8129-8","10.1109/BigDataService.2015.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7184914","algorithms;big data;machine learning;review","Algorithm design and analysis;Big data;Companies;Machine learning algorithms;Security;Sentiment analysis","Big Data;business data processing;data integration;data mining;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;statistical analysis;text analysis","Big Data integration;Big Data streams;analytical skills;analytical techniques;business benehts;business teams;business value;computing paradigms;data privacy;data security;enterprise architectures;information extraction;large-data volumes;machine learning algorithm;maturity level;one-size-hts-all solution;online commerce;optimization algorithm;security improvement;smart utility meters;social media;statistical analysis;telecommunication industry;text mining algorithm","","1","","76","","","March 30 2015-April 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inspection methods are usually employed in HCI to assess usability of interactive systems. However, they do not consider the state of the operator while executing a task, the surrounding environment and the task demands. It is argued that assessing performance of operators is fundamental for designing optimal systems with which healthcare can be effectively delivered. The aim of our solution is to assess performance of operators employing the notion of Mental Workload (MWL) this being a construct believed to strongly correlate with performance. The proposal is to develop a model for MWL assessment using supervised machine learning. This model will be evaluated via user studies involving clinicians and operators interacting with a set of medical systems. Assessments of MWL will be compared and validated with objective indexes of performance such as error rate and task execution time.","1063-7125;10637125","Electronic:978-1-4673-6775-2; POD:978-1-4673-6776-9","10.1109/CBMS.2015.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7167521","Human Mental Workload;Human-Computer Interaction;Interactive Systems;Machine Learning;Medical applications","Context;Ergonomics;Human computer interaction;Inspection;Interactive systems;Performance evaluation;Usability","brain-computer interfaces;health care;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;neurophysiology","healthcare;human MWL assessment;human-computer system;inspection method;machine learning;medical error rate;medical interactive system;mental workload;patient care;task execution time","","2","","7","","","22-25 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately most existing infrastructure, such as loop-detectors and many video detectors, do not feasibly provide accurate vehicle counts. Consequently, a novel method is proposed which models vehicle motion using hidden Markov models (HMM). The proposed method represents a specified small region of the roadway as 'empty', 'vehicle entering', 'vehicle inside', and 'vehicle exiting', and then applies a modified Viterbi algorithm to the HMM sequential estimation framework to initialize and track vehicles. Vehicle observations are obtained using an Adaboost trained Haar-like feature detector. When tested on 88 hours of video, from three distinct locations, the proposed method proved to be robust to changes in lighting conditions, moving shadows, and camera motion, and consistently out-performed Multiple Target Tracking (MTT) and Virtual Detection Line(VDL) implementations. The median vehicle count error of the proposed method is lower than MTT and VDL by 28%, and 70% respectively. As future work, this algorithm will be implemented to provide the traffic industry with improved automated vehicle counting, with the intent to eventually provide real-time counts.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1986-4; POD:978-1-4799-1987-1","10.1109/CRV.2015.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7158929","Haar-like features;Intelligent Transportation Systems;hidden Markov models;machine learning;vehicle detection;vehicle tracking","Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Real-time systems;Target tracking;Vehicle detection;Vehicles","Haar transforms;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;image sensors;object detection;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","Adaboost trained Haar-like feature detector;HMM sequential estimation framework;MTT;VDL implementations;automated vehicle counting;camera motion;hidden Markov model;lighting conditions;median vehicle count error;moving shadows;multiple target tracking;roadway congestion;traffic metrics;traffic safety;vehicle counting;vehicle counts;vehicle detection;vehicle entering;vehicle exiting;vehicle inside;vehicle motion;vehicle tracking;vehicle travel;virtual detection line","","1","","16","","","3-5 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional signal processing methods such as the classic least square (LS) method rely on strong assumptions on signal models and accurate estimations of time delay of arrival (TDOA) . They only work well in relatively clean conditions, but suffer from noise and reverberation distortions. In this paper, we propose a learning-based approach that can learn from a large amount of simulated noisy and reverberant microphone array inputs for robust DOA estimation. Specifically, we extract features from the generalised cross correlation (GCC) vectors and use a multilayer perceptron neural network to learn the nonlinear mapping from such features to the DOA. One advantage of the learning based method is that as more and more training data becomes available, the DOA estimation will become more and more accurate. Experimental results on simulated data show that the proposed learning based method produces much better results than the state-of-the-art LS method. The testing results on real data recorded in meeting rooms show improved root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared to the LS method.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4673-6997-8; POD:978-1-4673-6998-5; USB:978-1-4673-6996-1","10.1109/ICASSP.2015.7178484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7178484","direction of arrival;least squares;machine learning;microphone arrays;neural networks","Arrays;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Robustness;Speech;Training;Training data","acoustic signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);microphone arrays;multilayer perceptrons;reverberation;vectors","GCC;direction of arrival estimation;feature extraction;generalised cross correlation vectors;learning-based approach;multilayer perceptron neural network;noisy environment;nonlinear mapping;reverberant environment;reverberant microphone array;robust DOA estimation","","4","","27","","","19-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed ultrasonographic activity index (UAI) relies on the plaque active profile, which is a combination of the most discriminate ultrasound parameter associated with symptoms. These features are extracted by the automatic algorithm and also by the physician from the ultrasound images and from some transformations on it, such as monogenic decomposition, which is a novelty in this clinical problem. This information is used to compute a risk score from the conditional probabilities of either symptomatic or asymptomatic groups. Symptom detection performance is evaluated on a transversal dataset of 146 plaques, where UAI obtained 83.5% accuracy, 84.1% sensitivity, and 83.7% specificity. Performance is also assessed on a longitudinal study of 112 plaques, where UAI shows a significant improvement over the gold standard degree of stenosis, demonstrating higher power at predicting which asymptomatic plaques developed symptoms in an average follow-up of ten months.

"Towards Making Systems Forget with Machine Unlearning","Y. Cao; J. Yang","","2015 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy","20150720","2015","","","463","480","Today's systems produce a rapidly exploding amount of data, and the data further derives more data, forming a complex data propagation network that we call the data's lineage. There are many reasons that users want systems to forget certain data including its lineage. From a privacy perspective, users who become concerned with new privacy risks of a system often want the system to forget their data and lineage. From a security perspective, if an attacker pollutes an anomaly detector by injecting manually crafted data into the training data set, the detector must forget the injected data to regain security. From a usability perspective, a user can remove noise and incorrect entries so that a recommendation engine gives useful recommendations. Therefore, we envision forgetting systems, capable of forgetting certain data and their lineages, completely and quickly. This paper focuses on making learning systems forget, the process of which we call machine unlearning, or simply unlearning. We present a general, efficient unlearning approach by transforming learning algorithms used by a system into a summation form. To forget a training data sample, our approach simply updates a small number of summations -- asymptotically faster than retraining from scratch. Our approach is general, because the summation form is from the statistical query learning in which many machine learning algorithms can be implemented. Our approach also applies to all stages of machine learning, including feature selection and modeling. Our evaluation, on four diverse learning systems and real-world workloads, shows that our approach is general, effective, fast, and easy to use.","1081-6011;10816011","Electronic:978-1-4673-6949-7; POD:978-1-4673-6950-3","10.1109/SP.2015.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163042","Adversarial Machine Learning;Forgetting System;Machine Unlearning","Computational modeling;Data models;Data privacy;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Training data","data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;security of data","complex data propagation network;data lineage;feature modeling;feature selection;forgetting systems;machine learning algorithms;machine unlearning;privacy risks;recommendation engine;security perspective;statistical query learning;summation form;usability perspective","","1","","80","","","17-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PUFs use the inherent physical differences of every chip to either securely authenticate the chip or generate cryptographic keys without the need of nonvolatile memory. However, PUFs have shown to be vulnerable to model building attacks if the attacker has access to challenge and response pairs. In these model building attacks, machine learning is used to determine the internal parameters of the PUF to build an accurate software model. Nevertheless, PUFs are still a promising building block and several protocols and designs have been proposed that are believed to be resistant against machine learning attacks. In this paper, we take a closer look at two such protocols, one based on reverse fuzzy extractors and one based on pattern matching. We show that it is possible to attack these protocols using machine learning despite the fact that an attacker does not have access to direct challenge and response pairs. The introduced attacks demonstrate that even highly obfuscated responses can be used to attack PUF protocols. Hence, this paper shows that even protocols in which it would be computationally infeasible to compute enough challenge and response pairs for a direct machine learning attack can be attacked using machine learning.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2427259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7096998","Evolution Strategies;Evolution strategies (ES);Machine Learning;Physical Unclonable Functions;Reverse Fuzzy Extractor;machine learning;physical unclonable functions (PUFs);reverse fuzzy extractor","Authentication;Buildings;Computational modeling;Delays;Error correction codes;Protocols","asynchronous circuits;cryptography;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;protocols;radiofrequency identification;random-access storage","PUF protocol;RFID token;arbiter-PUF;building block;chip authentication;cryptographic key;machine learning;model building attack;nonvolatile memory;pattern matching;physical unclonable function;radiofrequency identification;resource-constrained embedded device;response pair;reverse fuzzy extractor","","5","","21","","20150428","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using data derived from multiple executions, we create models to predict the execution time of communication-heavy parallel applications. This analysis also identifies the features and associated hardware components that have the most impact on network congestion and intern, on execution time.

The approach that we take is a mixture of investigating and evaluating the previous approaches and coming up with a novel algorithm that is able to detect and track objects in real-time that is not tightly bound to specific colours. In order to implement a dynamic algorithm, we look into various colour planes and then take in multiple dimensions from a given colour plane and use a combination of the results obtained from the individual dimensions to get a result that is capable of detecting various range of colours. After the objects are satisfactorily detected, we proceed to track them and implement gestures that allow the users to elect a single colour to be tracked without any direct interactions, using a novel algorithm that we developed over the course of the research. After the election, the algorithm is expanded further to be able to integrate the ability to detect various gestures and patterns. The system is also capable of basic intelligence and is able to modify its phases as necessary based on the user's interaction with the system.

We have come to the age of big data, where the amount of information exceeds the perceptive abilities of any human being. Frequently the massive data collections arrive over time, in the form of a data stream. Not only the volume and velocity of data poses a challenge for machine learning systems, but also its variability. Such an environment may have non-stationary properties, i.e. change its characteristic over time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift, and is considered as one of the main challenges for moder learning systems. In this paper, we propose to investigate different methods for handling concept drift with adaptive soft one-class classifiers. One-class classification is a promising direction in data stream analytics, as it allows for a novelty detection, data description and learning with limited access to class labels. We describe an adaptive model of Weighted One-Class Support Vector Machine, augmented with mechanisms for incremental learning and forgetting. These allow for our models to swiftly adapt to changes in data, without any need for a dedicated drift detector. We carry out an experimental analysis of the behavior of our method with different forgetting rates for various types of concept drift. Additionally, we compare our classifier with state-of-the-art one-class methods for streaming data. We observe, that our adaptive soft one-class model can efficiently handle different types of concept drifts, while delivering a highly satisfactory accuracy for streaming data.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8322-3; POD:978-1-4799-8323-0","10.1109/CYBConf.2015.7175902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7175902","big data;concept drift;data streams;forgetting;incremental learning;machine learning;one-class classification","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Benchmark testing;Data models;Memory management;Support vector machines;Training","Big Data;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","adaptive soft one-class classifiers;big data;concept drift;data stream analytics;incremental learning;incremental one-class classifiers;machine learning systems;weighted one-class support vector machine","","1","","12","","","24-26 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
