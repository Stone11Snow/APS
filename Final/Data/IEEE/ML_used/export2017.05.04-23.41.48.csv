Cotton seed is an important and critical link in the chain of agricultural activities extending farmer industry linkage. Cotton yield is associated with high quality seed as the seed contains in itself the blue print for the agrarian prosperity in incipient form. Transfer of technology to identify the quality of seeds is gaining importance. Hence this work employs machine learning approach to classify the quality of seeds based on the different growth stages of the cotton crop. Machine learning techniques – Naïve Bayes Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron were applied for training the model. Features are extracted from a set of 900 records of different categories to facilitate training and implementation. The performance of the model was evaluated using 10 -fold cross validation. The results obtained show that Decision Tree Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron provides the same accuracy in classifying the seed cotton yield. The time taken to build the model is higher in Multilayer Perceptron as compared to the Decision Tree Classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7155-3; POD:978-1-4244-7154-6","10.1109/ACE.2010.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5532816","Classification;Growth stages of Cotton;Machine Learning;Seed cotton yield","Classification tree analysis;Cotton;Couplings;Crops;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Gold;Machine learning;Multilayer perceptrons;Textile industry","","","","0","","5","","","20-21 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a way to constructing multivariate features and then classify the data into proper classes. The resulting small subset of features is nearly the best in the sense of Greenshtein's persistence; however, the estimated feature weights may be biased. We take a systematic approach for correcting the biases. We use conjugate gradient-based primal-dual interior-point techniques for large-scale problems.

The constant progress in technology gives the opportunity to obtain efficient, in terms of cost and accuracy, localization services, and likewise it increases the number of challenges to be considered. The main problems related to the localization of mobile devices concern with the heterogeneity of visited environments and interested hardware platforms, the energy and computational constraints imposed by the devices and the choice of appropriate tracking technologies. The most important goal in the localization research area is to provide a very accurate positioning service, regardless the surrounding environment. For my PhD research I propose an innovative system for ubiquitous localization which does not rely on backend servers (each node performs a self-localization) and whose reference platform is a new generation mobile phone. This system exploits the sensors embedded on such devices to perform positioning and it is further assisted by opportunistic exchange of information among neighboring nodes. By means of this system, a node is able to classify its movements by continuously refining a self-movement-model (machine learning techniques), thus assisting the localization procedure itself. The purpose of this document is to briefly describe the state of the art in localization, and to outline my planned PhD research.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7265-9; POD:978-1-4244-7264-2; USB:978-1-4244-7263-5","10.1109/WOWMOM.2010.5534969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5534969","","Global Positioning System;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Predictive models;Sensors","","","","0","","","","","14-17 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In previous work, we introduced a one-pass non-parametric classification technique called Voted Spheres, which carves up the input space into a series of overlapping hyperspheres. Training data seen within each hypersphere is used in a voting scheme during testing on unseen data. Secondly, we address the problem of distribution shift whereby the training and test data may be drawn from slightly different probability densities, while the conditional densities of class membership for a given datum remains the same. We adopt two recent techniques from the literature, density weighting and kernel mean matching, to enhance the Voted Spheres technique to deal with such distribution disparities.

The system is trained and tested on a corpus of oncology related PubMed/MEDLINE literatures hand-annotated with biomarker information. We investigate the effectiveness of different features for this task and examine the amount of training data needed to learn the biomarker relationship with the entities.

As problems become increasingly demanding, parallel implementations of ML algorithms become critical for developing hybrid intelligent real-world applications. The relative low cost of GPUs combined with the unprecedent computational power they offer, make them particularly well-positioned to automatically analyze and capture relevant information from large amounts of data. In this paper, we propose the creation of an open source GPU Machine Learning Library (GPUMLib) that aims to provide the building blocks for the scientific community to develop GPU ML algorithms.

We present a novel algorithm for the detection of individual heart beats in ballistocardiograms (BCGs). In a training step, unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify the shape of a single heart beat in the BCG. The learned parameters are combined with so-called “heart valve components” to detect the occurrence of individual heart beats in the signal. A refinement step improves the accuracy of the estimated beat-to-beat interval lengths. Compared to other algorithms this new approach offers heart rate estimates on a beat-to-beat basis and is designed to cope with arrhythmias. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated in laboratory and home settings for its agreement with an ECG reference. A beat-to-beat interval error of 14.16 ms with a coverage of 96.87% was achieved.

The learning of the HMM is done using historic data of normal measurements. The HMM can then be used to detect anomalies in blood glucose levels being measured, if the inferred likelihood of the observed data is low in the world described by the HMM.

For both tasks, we show in an empirical way, that taking into account the bipartite nature of the graph can enhance substantially the performances of prediction models we learn. This is achieved by introducing new variations of topological atttributes to measure the likelihood of two nodes to be connected. Our approach, for both tasks, consists in expressing the link prediction problem as a two class discrimination problem. Classical supervised machine learning approaches can then be applied in order to learn prediction models.

It is necessary to provide the player a game that provides: (1) satisfaction and (2) challenge. To enhance player experience, the game difficulty needs to be dynamically adjusted with respect to the player. Dynamic scripting is an important learning technique used for dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA), already implemented successfully in commercial games of different genres. However the DDA systems are not sufficiently consistent in creating equally competent agents and do not provide equal opportunity to human players of different capabilities. This paper focuses on solving these issues by introducing these concepts: (a) dynamic weight clipping, (b) differential learning and (c) adrenalin rush. Experimental results indicate that dynamic scripting, in combination with these features, can implement an ideal DDA system for creating a equally competent computer agent who can engage the human player in absorbing games.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9032-5; Electronic:978-1-4244-9034-9; POD:978-1-4244-9033-2","10.1109/ICCCT.2010.5640378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640378","Adaptive algorithm;Adrenalin rush;Differential learning;Dynamic difficulty adjustment","Aggregates;Artificial intelligence;Complexity theory;Equations;Games;Humans;Mathematical model","computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);software agents","adaptive agent generation;adrenalin rush concept;differential learning concept;dynamic difficulty adjustment;dynamic scripting technique;dynamic weight clipping concept;game player experience;machine learning","","1","","7","","","17-19 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data regarding reactive power reserves and voltage stability margin are stored for further MLRM development. Once properly designed and validated, the MLRMs are ready to be used in the online environment. As a few models are necessary to represent all contingencies in the list, an identification tool named MLRM-IDtool is necessary to identify what model to use based on current system conditions. Decision trees and neural networks are tested as classification tools to identify which multi-linear regression model to use.

For bulk transfers in heavy traffic using <i>oracular</i> measurements, TCP throughput is predicted within 10% of the actual value 87% of the time, representing nearly a threefold improvement in accuracy over prior history-based methods. For <i>practical</i> measurements of path properties, predictions can be made within 10% of the actual value nearly 50% of the time, approximately a 60% improvement over history-based methods, and with much lower measurement traffic overhead.

The bounded time window prevents the simulation from being too optimistic and from excessive rollbacks. We utilize a machine learning algorithm (Q-learning) to effect this combination. We introduce two dynamic load-balancing algorithms for balancing the communication and computational load and use two learning agents to combine these algorithms. One learning agent combines the two learning algorithms and learns their corresponding parameters, while the second optimizes the value of the time window. Experimental results show up to a 46% improvement in the simulation time using this combined algorithm for several open source circuits.

However, if the entities of interest are small companies, these approaches can lead to mismatches, particularly if a specified company lacks a home page. We address this problem using a supervised machine-learning approach in which we train a binary classification model. We classify potential website matches for each company name based on a set of explanatory features extracted from the content on each candidate website. Our approach is related to web-based business intelligence in two ways: (1) we build the training set for our learning algorithms through crowdsourcing tools and illustrate their potential for business research, and (2) the success of our model allows one to easily use corporate home pages as data inputs into other research projects. Through the successful use of crowdsourcing, our approach is able to identify a correct home page or recognize that a valid home page does not exist with an accuracy that is 57% better than simply taking the highest ranked search engine result as the correct match.","2150-4938;21504938","Electronic:978-1-4244-5553-9; POD:978-1-4244-5551-5","10.1109/DEST.2010.5610621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5610621","","Biological system modeling;Companies;Feature extraction;Logistics;Search engines;Training;Web pages","Web sites;business data processing;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;search engines","Internet search engines;Web site;Web-based business intelligence;binary classification model;business application;company home pages discovering;crowdsourcing tools;explanatory features extraction;learning algorithm;marketing application;supervised machine-learning approach","","0","","8","","","13-16 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is also tremendously useful in estimating projects, managing change in requirements, measuring efficiency and communicating functional requirements. International Standard bodies like International Function Point User Group (IFPUG) has been maintaining a repository of data based projects with measures like data functions, transactional functions, function size, work effort, delivery date, project duration, max team size, development technique and platform etc. This paper presents the results of analysis that were performed on IFPUG data using a Statistical Package. Modelling techniques like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MAR Splines), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Automated Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) were used to estimate the function points from the IFPUG data set repository The training and validation data was randomly selected from the data repository. The performance of the various models was analyzed by comparing the observed and predicted function points. The comparison of results on the validation data set of 100 projects indicate that MAR Splines gives the best predicted values for function points as it has the lowest Mean Relative Error (MRE) and highest correlation coefficient. SVM and ANN also gave good results as compared to kNN. MAR Splines is thus a competitive predictive model for estimating function points.

Some methods have focused on exploiting the samples with high uncertainty, but those methods fail in getting a representative set of the data samples. Other methods try to explore the representative samples by utilizing the prior distribution of the dataset. However, they are often computationally expensive and need a large amount of labeled data for initialization. In this paper we develop a hierarchical exploration based active learning algorithm that takes into account both the distribution of the dataset and the decision boundary of the current hypothesis. Our method uses the support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier. The hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to discover the dataset's structure step by step in a top-down manner. In each step of hierarchical structure discovery, the representative samples will be queried for labels to check the relative cluster's purity. The cluster with low purity will be divided further. After the draft SVM model is built with those representative samples, the uncertain samples near decision boundary will be further labeled if it can help reduce the entropy of the classifier. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, our proposed method is compared with five state-of-art algorithms on six datasets from UCI.

"On the Use of Machine Learning to Predict the Time and Resources Consumed by Applications","A. Matsunaga; J. A. B.

A useful piece of information for scheduling jobs, typically not available, is the extent to which applications will use available resources once they are executed. This paper comparatively assesses the suitability of several machine learning techniques for predicting spatio temporal utilization of resources by applications. Modern machine learning techniques able to handle large number of attributes are used, taking into account application- and system-specific attributes (e.g., CPU micro architecture, size and speed of memory and storage, input data characteristics and input parameters). The work also extends an existing classification tree algorithm, called Predicting Query Runtime (PQR), to the regression problem by allowing the leaves of the tree to select the best regression method for each collection of data on leaves. The new method (PQR2) yields the best average percentage error, predicting execution time, memory and disk consumption for two bioinformatics applications, BLAST and RAxML, deployed on scenarios that differ in system and usage. In specific scenarios where usage is a non-linear function of system and application attributes, certain configurations of two other machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machine and k-nearest neighbors, also yield competitive results. In addition, experiments show that the inclusion of system performance and application-specific attributes also improves the performance of machine learning algorithms investigated.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6988-8; POD:978-1-4244-6987-1","10.1109/CCGRID.2010.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5493447","application resource usage;classifier tree;machine learning;regression","Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Cloud computing;Grid computing;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mesh generation;Prediction algorithms;Processor scheduling;Regression tree analysis","","","","23","","24","","","17-20 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose the use of biased support vector machine active learner for conducting relevance feedback for 3D model retrieval. The algorithm selects the most informative 3D models to query a user and quickly learns a boundary that separates the 3D models that satisfy the user's query concept from the rest of the dataset.

Surface EMG provides a better insight into the strength of muscle contraction which can be used as control signal for different applications. Due to the various interference between different muscle activities, it is difficult to identify movements using sEMG during low-level flexions. A new set of fractal features - fractal dimension and Maximum fractal length of sEMG has been previously reported by the authors. These features measure the complexity and strength of the muscle contraction during the low-level finger flexions. In order to classify and identify the low-level finger flexions using these features based on the fractal properties, a recently developed machine learning based classifier, Twin Support vector machines (TSVM) has been proposed. TSVM works on basic learning methodology and solves the classification tasks as two SVMs for each classes.

One challenge to constructing accurate reservoir models is the time required to carry out a large number of computer simulations. To address this issue, we have constructed surrogate models (proxies) for the computer simulator to reduce the simulation time. The quality of the proxies, however, relies on the quality of the computer simulation data. Frequently, the majority of the simulation outputs match poorly to the production data collected from the field. In other words, most of the data describe the characteristics of what the reservoir is not (negative samples), rather than what the reservoir is (positive samples). Applying machine learning methods to train a simulator proxy based on these data faces the challenge of imbalanced training data. This work applies active learning support vector machines to incrementally select a subset of informative simulation data to train a classifier as the simulator proxy. We compare the results with the results produced by the standard support vector machines combined with other imbalanced training data handling techniques.

Meanwhile, cervical cancer could be largely preventable and curable with regular Pap tests. Nuclei changes in the cervix could be found by this test. Accurate nuclei detection is extremely critical as it is the previous step of analysing nuclei changes and diagnosis afterwards. Recently, computer-aided nuclei segmentation has increased dramatically. Although such algorithms could be utilised in the situation for sparse nuclei since they are intuitively detected, the segmentation for the complicated nuclei clusters is still challenging task. This paper presents a new methodology for the detection of cervical nuclei clusters. We first detect all the nuclei from the cervical microscopic image by an ellipse fitting algorithm. Second, we chose some high-relevant features from all the features we obtained in last step via F-score, which is based on to what extent one feature attributes to results. All the ellipses are then classified into single ones and cluster ones by C4.5 decision tree with selected features. We evaluated the performance of this method by the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and cluster predictive value. With the 9 selected features from the original 13 features, we came by the promising classification accuracy (97.8%).","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6843-0; POD:978-1-4244-6841-6","10.1109/ICCME.2010.5558874","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5558874","","Australia;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Image segmentation","biomedical optical imaging;cancer;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","C4.5 decision tree;F-score;cervical cancer;cervical microscopic image;cervical nuclei clusters;classification accuracy;classification sensitivity;cluster predictive value;clustering nuclei;ellipse fitting algorithm;machine learning techniques","","4","","16","","","13-15 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three-types of falling motions which cause a femoral neck fracture for elderly people are considered in the present paper. Five distinction procedures for detecting falling motions are proposed in the present paper. In the proposed procedures, one axis gyro sensor and two axis accelerometers are used. The detection performances of the five procedures are evaluated for the three-types of falling motions as well as the many kinds of daily motions. As the results, the procedure based on the neural network considering time series data of sensor signals provides 100% detection rates for the three-types of falling motions. In addition, robust performances of sensor installation errors of the position/angle are evaluated. We confirmed that the proposed method based on the neural network can ensure robust performances for sensor installation errors of the position/angle.","","DVD:978-4-907764-35-7; Electronic:978-4-907764-36-4; POD:978-1-4244-7642-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5602612","Accelerometer;Falling Distinction;Femoral Neck Fracture;Gyro Sensor;Hip Protector;Learning;Neural Network;Pattern Recognition;Support Vector Machine","Accelerometers;Artificial neural networks;Equations;Neck;Observers;Support vector machines","accelerometers;learning (artificial intelligence);motion estimation;neural nets;pattern recognition;prosthetics;sensors","accelerometers;airbag;femoral neck fracture prevention;gyro sensor;hip protector system;human falling motions;machine learning;online distinction methods","","2","","25","","","18-21 Aug. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, dimension reduction was always carried before supervised learning algorithms such as neural network. This two-stage framework is somewhat redundant in dimension reduction and network training. This paper proposes a novel one-stage learning algorithm for high-dimension small-sample data, called Projection Vector Machine (PVM), which combines dimension reduction with network training and removes the redundancy. Through dimension reduction operation such as singular vector decomposition (SVD), we not only reduce the dimension but also obtain the size of single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) and input weight values simultaneously. This size-fixed network will become linear programming system and thus the output weights can be determined by simple least square method. Unlike traditional backpropagation feedforward neural network (BP), parameters in PVM don't need iterative tuning and thus its training speed is much faster than BP. Unlike extreme learning machine (ELM) proposed by Huang [G.-B. Huang, Q.-Y. Zhu, C.-K. Siew, Extreme learning machine: theory and applications, Neurocomputing 70 (2006) 489-501] which assigns input weights randomly, PVM's input weights are ranked by singular values and select the optimal weights order by singular value. We give proof that PVM is a universal approximator for high-dimension small-sample data.

In this paper we address this problem by exploring the possibility of leveraging on machine learning techniques for building, in a fully decentralized fashion, performance models of TOB protocols. Based on an extensive experimental study considering heterogeneous workloads and multiple TOB protocols, we assess the accuracy and efficiency of alternative machine learning methods including neural networks, support vector machines, and decision tree-based regression models.

Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer programs is an important step to unveil proteins' three dimensional conformation and functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical influence over biological study. The explanation of how a decision is made during prediction is also important for improving protein structure prediction and guiding the ""wet experiments"".

It is serine or threonine specific, though any consensus sequence is still unknown. We have applied support vector machines (SVM) for the prediction of O-glycosylation sites from various kinds of protein information, aiming to investigate the condition for glycosylation and elucidate the mechanisms. In the present study, first we focus on the distribution of the glycosylation sites. It is observed that many O-glycosylated sites are in clusters of closely spaced glycosylated sites, whereas the other sites are found sparsely or isolated. These two types of crowded and isolated sites might have different glycosylation mechanisms. Therefore, we divide the whole O-glycosylation sites into the crowded and the isolated groups. For each group, SVM is trained to predict the O-glycosylation sites separately. The prediction results of two SVMs have different input information dependency. The results indicate that some motifs are expected for the isolated group, while the interaction between the glycosylated sites and the relative proportion of the surrounding amino acids affect the glycosylation for the crowded group. Then, we compare the statistics of amino acid sequences around the glycosylation sites of both groups. As the results, some amino acids (proline, valine, alanine etc.) have high existence probabilities at each specific position relative to a glycosylation site, especially for the isolated glycosylation. Moreover, independent component analysis for the amino acid sequences elucidates position specific existences of the above amino acids, including well known proline at -1 and +3, which are found as different independent components. Finally, we investigate the relation with O-glycosylation and the domain structure or the disordered region of the protein. It is clearly observed that O-glycosylation is more frequently observed in the disordered region and less in the domain. This could be the key feature to un- - derstand the non-conservation property, the role in functional diversity and structural stability of O-glycosylation.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-22-0; POD:978-1-4244-7324-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5542837","Bioinformatics;Intrinsically disordered;Protein glycosylation;Support vector machine","Amino acids;Bioinformatics;Educational institutions;Independent component analysis;Machine learning;Probability;Protein engineering;Protein sequence;Statistics;Support vector machines","bioinformatics;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);proteins;support vector machines","amino acid sequence elucidate position;bioinformatics;functional diversity;independent component analysis;machine learning;mammalian protein;protein O-glycosylation site prediction;statistical characters;structural stability;support vector machines","","1","","12","","","23-25 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We build off of the method of using factored higher-order Boltzmann machines to model such image transformations. Using this approach will potentially enable us to use the model as one component of a larger deep architecture. This will allow us to use the feature information in an ordinary deep network to perform better modeling of transformations, and to infer pose estimates from the hidden representation. We focus on applying these higher-order Boltzmann machines to the NORB 3D objects data set and the Labeled Faces in the Wild face data set. We first show two different approaches to using this method on these object classes, demonstrating that while some useful transformation information can be extracted, ultimately the simple direct application of these models to higher-resolution, complex object classes is insufficient to achieve improved visual verification performance. Instead, we believe that this method should be integrated into a larger deep architecture, and show initial results using the higher-order Boltzmann machine as the second layer of a deep architecture, above a first layer convolutional RBM.","2160-7508;21607508","Electronic:978-1-4244-7030-3; POD:978-1-4244-7029-7","10.1109/CVPRW.2010.5543185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5543185","","Airplanes;Bicycles;Data mining;Face detection;Face recognition;Filters;Head;Machine learning;Object recognition;Testing","Boltzmann machines;feature extraction;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","NORB 3D objects data set;class specific image transformations learning;factored higher order Boltzmann machines;first layer convolutional RBM;image representation;pose estimation;pose invariant visual verification;transformation information extraction;unconstrained face verification;visual verification performance;wild face data set","","3","","14","","","13-18 June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
