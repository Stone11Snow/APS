The experiment compares an evaluation of calls to a baseline system in a library domain with calls to an enhanced version of the system. The new system has a clarification module based on the wizard data that is a decision tree constructed from three machine-learned models.

The online opinion has become the object of studies in many research areas; especially that called “Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analysis”. Several interesting and advanced works were performed on few languages (in particular English). However, there were very few studies on some languages such as Arabic. This paper presents the study we have carried out to address the problem of unbalanced data sets in supervised sentiment classification in an Arabic context. We propose three different methods to under-sample the majority class documents. Our goal is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methods with the common random under-sampling. We also aim to evaluate the behavior of the classifier toward different under-sampling rates. We use two different common classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. The experiments are carried out on an Arabic data set that we have built from Aljazeera's web site and labeled manually. The results show that Naïve Bayes is sensitive to data set size, the more we reduce the data the more the results degrade. However, it is not sensitive to unbalanced data sets on the contrary of Support Vector Machines which is highly sensitive to unbalanced data sets. The results show also that we can rely on the proposed techniques and that they are typically competitive with random under-sampling.","2327-185X;2327185X","Electronic:978-1-4673-2725-1; POD:978-1-4673-2726-8; USB:978-1-4673-2724-4","10.1109/CIST.2012.6388061","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6388061","Arabic Language;Corpora;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Opinion Mining;Sentiment Analysis;Text Classification;Unbalanced Data sets","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Niobium;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Training","","","","2","","24","","","22-24 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linking MSDA to an appropriate Gaussian model allows the derivation of a new DA method under the expectation maximization (EM) framework (EM-MSDA), which simultaneously derives the discriminant subspace and the maximum likelihood estimates. The two other proposed methods generalize MSDA in order to solve problems inherited from conventional DA. FSMSDA solves the subclass separation problem, that is, the situation in which the dimensionality of the discriminant subspace is strictly smaller than the rank of the inter-between-subclass scatter matrix. This is done by an appropriate weighting scheme and the utilization of an iterative algorithm for preserving useful discriminant directions. On the other hand, KMSDA uses the kernel trick to separate data with nonlinearly separable subclass structure. Extensive experimentation shows that the proposed methods outperform conventional MSDA and other linear discriminant analysis variants.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2216545","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6360018","Classification;clustering;discriminant analysis;feature extraction;machine learning;mixture of gaussians;pattern recognition;probabilistic algorithms","Covariance matrix;Kernel;Maximum likelihood estimation;Nickel;Symmetric matrices;Vectors","Gaussian processes;expectation-maximisation algorithm;iterative methods;matrix algebra;maximum likelihood estimation","EM;MSDA;discriminant subspace;expectation maximization;iterative algorithm;maximum likelihood estimation;mixture subclass discriminant analysis link;other generalizations;restricted Gaussian model;subclass scatter matrix","","16","","58","","20121121","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We claim that the features leading to highest accuracy in translator attribution are translator-dependent features and that even though translator-effect-heavy features are present in translated text, we can still succeed in authorship attribution.

Avoiding an infection in the first place is a hard task, as computer systems are often vulnerable to a multitude of attacks. However, to explore and control an infected system, an attacker needs to establish a communication channel with the victim. While such a channel can be easily established to an unprotected end host in the Internet, infiltrating a closed network usually requires passing an application-level gateway -- in most cases a web proxy -- which constitutes an ideal spot for detecting and blocking unusual outbound communication. This papers introduces DUMONT, a system for detecting covert outbound HTTP communication passing through a web proxy. DUMONT learns profiles of normal HTTP requests for each user of the proxy and adapts to individual web surfing characteristics. The profiles are inferred from a diverse set of features, covering the structure and content of outbound data, and allowing for automatically identifying tunnels and covert channels as deviations from normality. While this approach does not generally rule out sophisticated covert communication, it significantly improves on state-of-the-art methods and hardens networks against malware proliferation. This capability is demonstrated in an evaluation with 90 days of web traffic, where DUMONT uncovers the communication of malware, tunnels and backdoors with few false alarms.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4762-6; POD:978-1-4673-2116-7","10.1109/EC2ND.2011.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6377758","Anomaly Detection;Covert Channels;Machine Learning;Malicious Software;Network Security","Detectors;Entropy;Feature extraction;Malware;Software;Support vector machines;Training","Web services;computer network security;internetworking;invasive software;telecommunication channels;transport protocols","DUMONT;HTTP request;Internet;Web proxy;Web surfing characteristics;adaptive covert communication detection;application level gateway;attack vulnerability;automatically tunnel identification;communication channel;computer security;computer system;covert channel;infected system;malicious software;malware;unusual outbound communication","","3","","29","","","6-7 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For automatic extraction of interaction information, the machine learning approach is useful. Generally, linguistic features obtained directly from the literature are used for learning, but a non-linguistic feature such as the atomic distance calculated from the protein structure data is often very effective for learning and classification. We call this type of feature a “key feature” in this study. In the machine learning approach, preparing enough training instances to train the classifier is important, but this often requires great cost. In such a situation, transfer learning is one of the better approaches. However, it is difficult to apply a simple transfer learning algorithm to a task in which the key feature cannot be prepared in the source domain. In this study, we propose a new transfer learning method called STEK (Selective Transfer learning based on Effectiveness of a Key feature). In this method, we focus on the effectiveness of the key feature, and divide a set of instances into two categories. One is a set of instances applying transfer learning and the other is a set of instances avoiding the use of transfer learning.

One of the most successful methodologies used for this purpose is a Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). In this paper, we propose an extension of GMR-based learning by demonstration models to incorporate concepts from the field of quantum mechanics. Indeed, conventional GMR models are formulated under the notion that all the observed data points can be assigned to a distinct number of model states (mixture components).

The so-obtained quantum statistics-inspired mixture regression algorithm is subsequently applied to obtain a novel robot learning by demonstration methodology, offering a significantly increased quality of regenerated trajectories for computational costs comparable with currently state-of-the-art trajectory-based robot learning by demonstration approaches.

In order to better address the problem, law enforcement specialists have developed new ideas and methods for retrieving evidence more effectively. In accordance with this trend, our research aims to add new pieces of information to the automated analysis of evidence according to Machine Learning-based “post mortem” triage. The scope consists of some copyright infringement court cases coming from the Italian Cybercrime Police Unit database. We draw our inspiration from this “low level” crime which is normally sat at the bottom of the forensic analyst's queue, behind higher priority cases and dealt with the lowest priority. The present work aims to bring order back in the analyst's queue by providing a method to rank each queued item, e.g. a seized device, before being analyzed in detail. The paper draws the guidelines for drive-under-triage classification (e.g. hard disk drive, thumb drive, solid state drive etc.), according to a list of crime-dependent features such as installed software, file statistics and browser history. The model, inspired by the theory of Data Mining and Machine Learning, is able to classify each exhibit by predicting the problem dependent variable (i.e. the class) according to the aforementioned crime-dependent features. In our research context the “class” variable identifies with the likelihood that a drive image may contain evidence concerning the crime and, thus, the associated item must receive an high (or low) ranking in the list.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-4577-2053-6; POD:978-1-4577-2052-9; USB:978-1-4577-2051-2","10.1109/ICC.2012.6364819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6364819","“post mortem” triage;automated analysis of evidence;computer forensics;data mining;machine learning","Computers;Data mining;Digital forensics;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Support vector machines","computer forensics;copyright;learning (artificial intelligence)","broadband network;copyright infringement;court case;crime-dependent feature;data mining;digital device;drive-under-triage classification;law enforcement;mchine learning-based post mortem triage;storage network;triage-based automated analysis","","2","","17","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, relations between objects like similarities and preferences are often expressed in a graded manner in real-world applications. A general kernel-based framework for learning relations from data is introduced here. It extends existing approaches because both crisp and graded relations are considered, and it unifies existing approaches because different types of graded relations can be modeled, including symmetric and reciprocal relations. This framework establishes important links between recent developments in fuzzy set theory and machine learning. Its usefulness is demonstrated through various experiments on synthetic and real-world data. The results indicate that incorporating domain knowledge about relations improves the predictive performance.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2194151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6179986","Fuzzy relations;graded relations;kernel methods;learning in graphs;machine learning;reciprocal relations;transitivity","Bioinformatics;Fuzzy set theory;Machine learning;Predictive models","data handling;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","bioinformatics;crisp relations;data objects;fuzzy set theory;graded relations learning;information retrieval;kernel-based framework;machine learning;reciprocal relations;social network analysis;symmetric relations","","5","","68","","20120409","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The availability of large datasets poses critical challenges for the selection of only relevant features to allow their timely use and interpretation. The recent years marked an increasing interest in algorithms inspired from biological human vision as an alternative source of ideas for the development of computational resources to deal with large datasets. In particular, computational models of visual attention have been shown to significantly improve the speed of scene understanding and object recognition by attending only the regions of interest and distributing the resources where they are required. This paper explores the use and gauges the performance of visual attention mechanisms for identifying an optimal feature set that ensures the identification and classification of objects in images, in two different scenarios. The first scenario addresses the issue of the identification of different categories of vehicles from multiple viewpoints in a controlled environment, with a relatively known background. The other scenario explores the capabilities of an improved visual attention model for the identification of buildings in satellite imaging, characterized by large variations in content and characteristics and by a cluttered background.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2706-0; POD:978-1-4673-2705-3","10.1109/ROSE.2012.6402636","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402636","feature extraction;machine learning;satellite images;vehicle classification;visual attention","Buildings;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Frequency modulation;Object recognition;Vehicles;Visualization","feature extraction;object detection;object recognition","cluttered background;evolving sensor environments;multiple viewpoints;objects classification;objects identification;optimal feature set;research community;satellite imaging;visual attention","","0","","34","","","16-18 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The approach is motivated by compositional models and Bayesian networks, and designed to adapt to small sample sizes. We start with a large, overlapping set of elementary statistical building blocks, or “primitives,” which are low-dimensional marginal distributions learned from data. Each variable may appear in many primitives. Subsets of primitives are combined in a Lego-like fashion to construct a probabilistic graphical model; only a small fraction of the primitives will participate in any valid construction. Since primitives can be precomputed, parameter estimation and structure search are separated. Model complexity is controlled by strong biases; we adapt the primitives to the amount of training data and impose rules which restrict the merging of them into allowable compositions. The likelihood of the data decomposes into a sum of local gains, one for each primitive in the final structure. We focus on a specific subclass of networks which are binary forests. Structure optimization corresponds to an integer linear program and the maximizing composition can be computed for reasonably large numbers of variables. Performance is evaluated using both synthetic data and real datasets from natural language processing and computational biology.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.96","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189356","Graphs and networks;linear programming;machine learning;statistical models","Assembly;Bayesian methods;Computational modeling;Connectors;Joints;Object oriented modeling;Probability distribution","belief networks;integer programming;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;statistical distributions","Bayesian networks;Lego-like fashion;competitive marginal assembly;computational biology;elementary statistical building blocks;estimated marginals;high-dimensional multivariate probability distribution learning;integer linear program;low-dimensional marginal distributions;maximizing composition;natural language processing;parameter estimation;probabilistic graphical model;structure search","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Decision Support Techniques;Models, Theoretical;Multivariate Analysis;Pattern Recognition, Automated","1","","53","","20120424","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We tested the performance using the Cohn-Kanade database and we compared the results with algorithms using geometric features and regular LBP patterns. Additionally, since the parameters have high linear and non-linear dependence they don't have an homogeneous statistic importance as descriptors, so we performed data mining processing.

Unreliable systems can lead to disruption of service, financial cost and even loss of human life. Typical cyber-physical systems are designed to process large amounts of data, employ software as a system component, run online continuously and retain an operator-in-the-loop because of human judgment and accountability requirements for safety-critical systems. This paper describes a data-centric runtime monitoring system named ARIS (Autonomic Reliability Improvement System) for improving the reliability of these types of cyber-physical systems. ARIS employs automated online evaluation, working in parallel with the cyber-physical system to continuously conduct automated evaluation at multiple stages in the system workflow and provide real-time feedback for reliability improvement. This approach enables effective evaluation of data from cyber-physical systems. For example, abnormal input and output data can be detected and flagged through data quality analysis. As a result, alerts can be sent to the operator-in-the-loop, who can then take actions and make changes to the system based on these alerts in order to achieve minimal system downtime and higher system reliability.

Here we explore the relationship between PR and RT mutational patterns and corresponding changes in susceptibility to each of their eight and 11 inhibitors, respectively, by developing drug-specific predictive models of resistance trained using previously assayed and publicly available in vitro mutant data. For each inhibitor, we present tenfold cross-validation performance measures of both classification as well as regression statistical learning algorithms. Two approaches are analyzed in each case, based on the use of either relative frequencies or counts of n-grams to represent mutant protein sequences as feature vectors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study on predictive models of HTV-1 PR and RT drug resistance developed by implementing n-grams to generate sequence attributes. Our technique is complementary to other sequence-based approaches and is competitive in performance. In a novel application, we classify every pair of RT inhibitors as either potentially effective as part of a larger drug cocktail or a combination that should not be concomitantly administered, with results that closely mirror available clinical and experimental data.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2560-8; POD:978-1-4673-2559-2","10.1109/BIBM.2012.6392665","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392665","HIV;antiviral therapy;genotype-phenotype correlation;machine learning;mutagenesis","Accuracy;Drugs;Immune system;Inhibitors;Predictive models;Proteins;Vectors","drugs;enzymes;microorganisms;regression analysis","HTV-1 infection;HTV-1 protease inhibitor;antiretroviral medication;cross validation performance;drug resistance;enzyme;human immunodeficiency virus type 1;n-grams approach;regression statistical learning algorithm;relative frequency;reverse transcriptase;target sequence mutational pattern","","2","","33","","","4-7 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The importance of NEs has been observed in intranet search engines, including university web sites. In this paper, a mechanism is built exclusively to recognize the three named entities, which are constantly referenced in the University of Essex domain: names, course codes, and room numbers. While a person name is considered a common named entity, course codes and room numbers are specific to the University domain. We developed a technique specifically to train three different classifiers on electronic corpora, consisting of 16,629 examples in total, which were collected and annotated manually from the University domain. The resulting models were then incorporated into the NER system that was built to use pre-trained classifiers in the detection process, mark these NEs, and cross-reference them to the related documents. The proposed method performed well on a test corpus, with the average precision reaching nearly 0.97. The recall varied, but was lower overall than precision with an average of 0.82.

However, to ensure diagnosis accuracy and effective board repair, a large number of syndromes must be used. Therefore, the diagnosis cost can be prohibitively high due to the increase in diagnosis time and the complexity of syndrome collection/analysis. We propose an adaptive diagnosis method based on decision trees (DTs). Faulty components are classified according to the discriminative ability of the syndromes in DT training. The diagnosis procedure is constructed as a binary tree, with the most discriminative syndrome as the root and final repair suggestions are available as the leaf nodes of the tree. The syndrome to be collected in the next step is determined based on the observations of syndromes collected thus far in the diagnosis procedure. The number of syndromes required for diagnosis can also be significantly reduced compared to the number of syndromes used for system training. Diagnosis results for two complex boards from industry, currently in volume production, and additional synthetic data highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1081-7735;10817735","Electronic:978-0-7695-4876-0; POD:978-1-4673-4555-2","10.1109/ATS.2012.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6394200","adaptive testing;board-level diagnosis;decision tree;functional failure;machine learning","Accuracy;Decision trees;Fault diagnosis;Indexes;Maintenance engineering;Manufacturing;Training","decision trees;fault diagnosis;fault trees","adaptive board level functional fault diagnosis;binary tree;board repair;decision trees;diagnosis accuracy;diagnosis cost;diagnosis procedure;diagnosis time;discriminative syndrome;faulty component;high volume production;product yield;syndrome analysis;syndrome collection","","17","","22","","","19-22 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often, the relevant features of a particular pattern analysis problem are easy to enumerate, as when statistical structures of the patterns are well understood from the knowledge of the domain. We study a problem from molecular image analysis, where such a domain-dependent understanding may be lacking to some degree and the features must be inferred via machine-learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a rigorous, fully automated technique for this problem. We are motivated by an application of atomic force microscopy (AFM) image processing needed to solve a central problem in molecular biology, aimed at obtaining the complete transcription profile of a single cell, a snapshot that shows which genes are being expressed and to what degree. Reed et al. (“Single molecule transcription profiling with AFM,” Nanotechnology, vol. 18, no. 4, 2007) showed that the transcription profiling problem reduces to making high-precision measurements of biomolecule backbone lengths, correct to within 20-25 bp (6-7.5 nm). Here, we present an image processing and length estimation pipeline using AFM that comes close to achieving these measurement tolerances. In particular, we develop a biased length estimator on trained coefficients of a simple linear regression model, biweighted by a Beaton-Tukey function, whose feature universe is constrained by James-Stein shrinkage to avoid overfitting. In terms of extensibility and addressing the model selection problem, this formulation subsumes the models we studied.","1089-7771;10897771","","10.1109/TITB.2012.2206819","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6228535","Atomic force microscopy (AFM);Beaton–Tukey;DNA;RNA;biased estimation;biomolecule;biweight;cDNA;digital contour;image processing;length estimation;linear regression;machine learning;single molecule;supervised learning","Atomic force microscopy;DNA;Image processing;Length measurement;Linear regression;Machine learning;RNA;Supervised learning","DNA;atomic force microscopy;biology computing;cellular biophysics;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations","AFM;Beaton-Tukey function;James-Stein shrinkage;atomic force microscopy;biased length estimator;biomolecule backbone length;biomolecule image analysis;biomolecule length estimation;domain-dependent understanding;fully automated technique;gene;high-precision measurement;image processing;length estimation pipeline;linear regression model;machine-learning techniques;model selection problem;molecular biology;molecular image analysis;single cell transcription profile","Artificial Intelligence;DNA;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Linear Models;Microscopy, Atomic Force;Pattern Recognition, Automated","4","","34","","20120629","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Given the rapid accumulation of genome-wide chromatin state data, there is a pressing need for computational methods to analyze these data. In this paper, we developed a Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) framework to predict transcriptional enhancers by integrating multiple types of chromatin state maps, including histone modifications, DNase I cleavage, and DNA methylation. Comparisons with previous work using known enhancers from three cell types suggest that our algorithm is more robust and has higher precision and sensitivity.

One assumption is that data points clustered together are likely to have the same class label. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, namely, cluster-based regularization (ClusterReg) for SSC, that takes the partition given by a clustering algorithm as a regularization term in the loss function of an SSC classifier. ClusterReg makes predictions according to the cluster structure together with limited labeled data. The experiments confirmed that ClusterReg has a good generalization ability for real-world problems. Its performance is excellent when data follows this cluster assumption.

Consequently, there is a need to design nursing robots with the capability to detect and respond to patient emotional states and to facilitate positive experiences in healthcare. The objective of this study was to develop a new computational algorithm for accurate patient emotional state classification in interaction with nursing robots during medical service. A simulated medicine delivery experiment was conducted at two nursing homes using a robot with different human-like features. Physiological signals, including heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR), as well as subjective ratings of valence (happy-unhappy) and arousal (excited-bored) were collected on elderly residents. A three-stage emotional state classification algorithm was applied to these data, including: (1) physiological feature extraction; (2) statistical-based feature selection; and (3) a machine-learning model of emotional states. A pre-processed HR signal was used. GSR signals were nonstationary and noisy and were further processed using wavelet analysis. A set of wavelet coefficients, representing GSR features, was used as a basis for current emotional state classification. Arousal and valence were significantly explained by statistical features of the HR signal and GSR wavelet features. Wavelet-based de-noising of GSR signals led to an increase in the percentage of correct classifications of emotional states and clearer relationships among the physiological response and arousal and valence. The new algorithm may serve as an effective method for future service robot real-time detection of patient emotional states and behavior adaptation to promote positive healthcare experiences.","2168-2291;21682291","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2210408","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301777","Emotions;machine learning;physiological variables;regression analysis;service robots;wavelet analysis","Biomedical monitoring;Heart rate;Humans;Medical services;Physiology;Service robots","age issues;control engineering computing;feature extraction;health care;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient care;regression analysis;service robots;signal classification;signal denoising;wavelet transforms","GSR feature representation;GSR wavelet features;US;arousal subjective rating;behavior adaptation;computational algorithm;elderly residents;excited-bored rating;galvanic skin response;happy-unhappy rating;healthcare service robots;heart rate signals;human-like features;machine learning model;medical service;noisy GSR signals;nonstationary GSR signals;nursing homes;nursing robot design;patient emotional state detection;patient-robot interaction;physiological feature extraction;physiological signals;preprocessed HR signal;real-time detection;regression analysis;simulated medicine delivery experiment;statistics-based feature selection;three-stage emotional state classification algorithm;valence subjective rating;wavelet analysis;wavelet coefficients;wavelet-based signal denoising","","22","1","50","","20120912","Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These methods label frames as {intestinal content - clear} without discriminating between types of content (with different physiological meaning) or the portion of image covered. In addition, since the presence of intestinal content has been identified as an indicator of intestinal motility, its accurate quantification can show a potential clinical relevance. In this paper, we present a method for the robust detection and segmentation of intestinal content in WCE images, together with its further discrimination between turbid liquid and bubbles. Our proposal is based on a twofold system. First, frames presenting intestinal content are detected by a support vector machine classifier using color and textural information. Second, intestinal content frames are segmented into {turbid, bubbles, and clear} regions. We show a detailed validation using a large dataset.

The application works by disseminating reports about vehicles that perform emergency deceleration in an effort to warn drivers about the need to perform emergency braking. Vehicles that receive such reports have to decide on whether the information contained in the report is relevant to the driver and warn the driver if that is the case. Common ways of determining relevance are based on the lane or direction information, but using only these attributes can lead to many false warnings, which can desensitize the driver. Desensitized drivers may ignore warnings or completely turn off the system, thus eliminating any safety benefits of the application. We show that the machine learning method, compared with the analytically derived formula, can significantly reduce the number of false warnings by learning from the actions that drivers take after receiving a report.

Aim: Prior work has reported that, given M estimation methods, no single method consistently outperforms all others. Perhaps rather than recommending one estimation method as best, it is wiser to generate estimates from ensembles of multiple estimation methods. Method: Nine learners were combined with 10 preprocessing options to generate 9 × 10 = 90 solo methods. These were applied to 20 datasets and evaluated using seven error measures. This identified the best n (in our case n = 13) solo methods that showed stable performance across multiple datasets and error measures. The top 2, 4, 8, and 13 solo methods were then combined to generate 12 multimethods, which were then compared to the solo methods. Results: 1) The top 10 (out of 12) multimethods significantly outperformed all 90 solo methods. 2) The error rates of the multimethods were significantly less than the solo methods. 3) The ranking of the best multimethod was remarkably stable.

Secondly, we provide the concept of one hybrid approach, namely the sequential processing of a knowledge-based approach and a selection of different machine learning methods. Thirdly, we present the evaluation of an implementation of the sequential extraction on a curriculum vitae corpus. Thus, we provide first results for filling the multi-dimensional space for hybrid information extraction.","1529-4188;15294188","Electronic:978-0-7695-4801-2; POD:978-1-4673-2621-6","10.1109/DEXA.2012.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327413","(Statistical) Machine Learning;Extraction Methodology;Hybrid Information Extraction","Data mining;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Training","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","IE performance;curriculum vitae corpus;extraction rules coding;hybrid information extraction system;knowledge-based approach sequential processing;machine learning approach;multidimensional space design;sequential extraction;trainable systems approach","","0","","17","","","3-7 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Baird","Lehigh University, Bethlehem","IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","20121018","2012","34","12","2467","2480","Whole-book recognition is a document image analysis strategy that operates on the complete set of a book's page images using automatic adaptation to improve accuracy. We describe an algorithm which expects to be initialized with approximate iconic and linguistic models-derived from (generally errorful) OCR results and (generally imperfect) dictionaries-and then, guided entirely by evidence internal to the test set, corrects the models which, in turn, yields higher recognition accuracy. The iconic model describes image formation and determines the behavior of a character-image classifier, and the linguistic model describes word-occurrence probabilities. Our algorithm detects “disagreements” between these two models by measuring cross entropy between 1) the posterior probability distribution of character classes (the recognition results resulting from image classification alone) and 2) the posterior probability distribution of word classes (the recognition results from image classification combined with linguistic constraints). We show how disagreements can identify candidates for model corrections at both the character and word levels. Some model corrections will reduce the error rate over the whole book, and these can be identified by comparing model disagreements, summed across the whole book, before and after the correction is applied. Experiments on passages up to 180 pages long show that when a candidate model adaptation reduces whole-book disagreement, it is also likely to correct recognition errors. Also, the longer the passage operated on by the algorithm, the more reliable this adaptation policy becomes, and the lower the error rate achieved. The best results occur when both the iconic and linguistic models mutually correct one another. We have observed recognition error rates driven down by nearly an order of magnitude fully automatically without supervision (or indeed without any user intervention or interaction). Improvement is nearly mo- otonic, and asymptotic accuracy is stable, even over long runs. If implemented naively, the algorithm runs in time quadratic in the length of the book, but random subsampling and caching techniques speed it up by two orders of magnitude with negligible loss of accuracy. Whole-book recognition has potential applications in digital libraries as a safe unsupervised anytime algorithm.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152127","Whole-book recognition;adaptive OCR;adaptive classification;adaptive machine learning;anytime algorithm;book recognition;cross entropy;document image recognition;isogeny;model adaptation;style consistency","Adaptation models;Character recognition;Computational modeling;Error analysis;Image recognition;Optical character recognition software;Pragmatics","cache storage;digital libraries;document image processing;image classification;image sampling;optical character recognition;probability","OCR results;adaptation policy;approximate iconic models;automatic adaptation;caching techniques;character-image classifier;digital libraries;document image analysis strategy;image formation;linguistic models;posterior probability distribution;random subsampling;recognition accuracy;unsupervised anytime algorithm;whole-book disagreement;whole-book recognition;word-occurrence probabilities","","9","","37","","20120214","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed approach combines game theory with machine learning to model adversary adaptation in the learner's feature space, thereby producing classes of predictive and “moving target” defenses which are scientifically-grounded and applicable to problems of real-world scale and complexity.

The auditing model has been specifically designed for decision support systems (DSSs) suited for clinical environments. Taking as starting point the proposed diagnosis supplied by the clinician, our method compares and evaluates the predictive skills of those models able to answer to that diagnosis. Our approach consists in calculating the posterior odds of a model through the composition of three different odds: prior, static and dynamic. To do so, our method estimates the posterior odds from the cases that the comparing models had in common during the design stage and from the cases already viewed by the DSS after deployment in the clinical site. In addition, if an ontology of the classes is available, our method can audit models answering related questions, which offers a reinforcement to the decisions the user already took and gives orientation on further diagnostic steps. The main technical novelty of this approach lies in the design of an audit model adapted to suit the decision workflow of a clinical environment. The audit model allows deciding which is the classifier that best suits each particular case under evaluation and allows the detection of possible misbehaviours due to population differences or systematic errors in the clinical site.

In these cases, the reliability of the labels is a crucial factor, because mislabeled items may propagate wrong labels to a large portion or even the entire data set. This paper aims to address this problem by presenting a graph-based (network-based) semi-supervised learning method, specifically designed to handle data sets with mislabeled samples. The method uses teams of walking particles, with competitive and cooperative behavior, for label propagation in the network constructed from the input data set. The proposed model is nature-inspired and it incorporates some features to make it robust to a considerable amount of mislabeled data items. Computer simulations show the performance of the method in the presence of different percentage of mislabeled data, in networks of different sizes and average node degree. Importantly, these simulations reveals the existence of the critical points of the mislabeled subset size, below which the network is free of wrong label contamination, but above which the mislabeled samples start to propagate their labels to the rest of the network. Moreover, numerical comparisons have been made among the proposed method and other representative graph-based semi-supervised learning methods using both artificial and real-world data sets. Interestingly, the proposed method has increasing better performance than the others as the percentage of mislabeled samples is getting larger.","1522-4899;15224899","Electronic:978-0-7695-4823-4; POD:978-1-4673-2641-4","10.1109/SBRN.2012.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6374828","Computational intelligence;Machine learning","Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Error analysis;Legged locomotion;Robustness;Semisupervised learning;Vectors","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","artificial data sets;classification problems;competitive andbehavior;cooperative behavior;error propagation prevention;graph-based semisupervised learning method;label contamination;label reliability;mislabeled data;network-based semisupervised learning method;particle competition;particle cooperation;real-world data sets;walking particles","","2","","17","","","20-25 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our goal is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed methods with the common random under-sampling. We also aim to evaluate the behavior of the classifiers toward different under-sampling rates. We use three different common classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines and k-Nearest Neighbors. The experiments are carried out on two Arabic data sets and an English data set. We show that the four under-sampling methods are typically competitive. Naïve Bayes is shown as insensitive to unbalanced data sets.

In this paper, we conducted two set of systematic investigations using publicly available project datasets over its multiple subsequent releases to performed our investigation and four machine learning techniques to validated our results. The first set of investigation consisted of applying the univariate logistic regression (ULR), Spearman's correlation and AUC (Area under ROC curve) analysis on four PROMISE datasets. This investigation evaluated the capability of each metric to predict fault proneness, when used in isolation. The second set of experiments consisted of applying the four machine learning techniques on the next two subsequent versions of the same project datasets to validate the effectiveness of the metrics. Based on the results of individual performance of metrics, we used only those metrics that are found significant, to build multivariate prediction models. Next, we evaluated the significant metrics related to design attributes both in isolation and in combination to validated their capability of predicting fault proneness.

The smoothness assumption becomes more important as sensor resolutions keep increasing, both because the radiometric variability within classes increases and because remote sensing is employed in more heterogeneous areas (e.g., cities), where shadow and shading effects, a multitude of materials, etc., degrade the measurement data, and prior knowledge plays a greater role. This paper gives a systematic overview of image classification methods, which impose a smoothness prior on the labels. Both local filtering-type approaches and global random field models developed in other fields of image processing are reviewed, and two new methods are proposed. Then follows a detailed experimental comparison and analysis of the presented methods, using two different aerial data sets from urban areas with known ground truth. A main message of the paper is that when classifying data of high spatial resolution, smoothness greatly improves the accuracy of the result-in our experiments up to 33%. A further finding is that global random field models outperform local filtering methods and should be more widely adopted for remote sensing. Finally, the evaluation confirms that all methods already oversmooth when most effective, pointing out that there is a need to include more and more complex prior information into the classification process.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2012.2192741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198886","Computer vision;image analysis;machine learning;remote sensing","Approximation algorithms;Computer vision;Image analysis;Labeling;Machine learning;Smoothing methods","geophysical image processing;image classification;vegetation mapping","aerial data sets;classification process;global random field models;heterogeneous areas;image classification methods;image processing;land-cover classification;local filtering methods;physical world images;radiometric variability;remote sensing;sensor resolutions;shading effect;shadow effect;smooth labeling methods;urban areas","","48","","47","","20120511","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This novel perimeter solution is designed to be sufficiently flexible for implementation at a wide range of facility types, from high security military or government installations to commercial power plants, to industrial facilities of various kinds. A prototype section of barrier has been produced and installed at the Sandia Exterior Intrusion Sensor Testing Facility in Albuquerque, NM.

Ensemble learning is an effective technique that has increasingly been adopted to combine multiple learning algorithms to improve overall prediction accuraciesand may outperform any single sophisticated classifiers. In this paper, an ensemble learner called a Direct Ensemble Classifier for Imbalanced Multiclass Learning (DECIML) that combines simple nearest neighbour and Naive Bayes algorithms is proposed.

The main concept behind the proposed algorithms is a modular approach that is used to divide the multiple objectives in modules, and making each one of these modules learn a different objective with different Action-Value and reinforcement functions. Besides the decomposition of objectives, both algorithms use a heuristic function to accelerate the learning process. The first algorithm learns one objective at a time, iterating along the objectives, while the second proposed algorithm also divides the problem in sub-problems but learns every objective simultaneously. The Predator-Prey problem was chosen to compare the performance of both proposed solutions with well known algorithms. In this problem, the learning agent plays the role of the prey and must learn to find food in a fixed position of a grid world while being pursued by the predator. The considered objectives are finding food and avoiding the predator. As the results shows, decomposing a multi-objective problem in sub-problems and using heuristics makes the learning process faster and easier to implement. We notice that the first algorithm introduced in this paper learns faster, but it is more difficult to implement in a real world environment.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4906-4; POD:978-1-4673-4650-4","10.1109/SBR-LARS.2012.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363312","Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Multiagent systems","Accelerated aging;Acceleration;Convergence;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Learning systems;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;predator-prey systems","action-value;heuristic function;modular approach;multi-agent multiobjective learning;multiple objectives;multiples agents;predator-prey problem;reinforcement learning","","1","","24","","","16-19 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The solution contour is found by solving an optimization problem where a cost functional is minimized. Gradient descent methods are often used to solve this optimization problem since they are very easy to implement and applicable to general nonconvex functionals. They are, however, sensitive to local minima and often display slow convergence. Traditionally, cost functionals have been modified to avoid these problems. In this paper, we instead propose using two modified gradient descent methods, one using a momentum term and one based on resilient propagation. These methods are commonly used in the machine learning community. In a series of 2-D/3-D-experiments using real and synthetic data with ground truth, the modifications are shown to reduce the sensitivity for local optima and to increase the convergence rate. The parameter sensitivity is also investigated. The proposed methods are very simple modifications of the basic method, and are directly compatible with any type of level set implementation.

In this vein, this paper focuses on the discrimination between subjects' electroencephalogram (EEG) responses to self-assessed liked or disliked music, acquired during an experimental procedure, by evaluating different feature extraction approaches and classifiers to this end. Feature extraction is based on time-frequency (TF) analysis by implementing three TF techniques, i.e., spectrogram, Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution and Hilbert-Huang spectrum (HHS). Feature estimation also accounts for physiological parameters that relate to EEG frequency bands, reference states, time intervals, and hemispheric asymmetries. Classification is performed by employing four classifiers, i.e., support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), quadratic and Mahalanobis distance-based discriminant analyses. According to the experimental results across nine subjects, best classification accuracy {86.52 (±0.76)%} was achieved using k-NN and HHS-based feature vectors ( FVs) representing a bilateral average activity, referred to a resting period, in β (13-30 Hz) and γ (30-49 Hz) bands. Activity in these bands may point to a connection between music preference and emotional arousal phenomena. Furthermore, HHS-based FVs were found to be robust against noise corruption. The outcomes of this study provide early evidence and pave the way for the development of a generalized brain computer interface for music preference recognition.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2012.2217495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6313893","Electroencephalogram (EEG);machine learning;music liking/disliking;time–frequency (TF) analysis","Brain models;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Time frequency analysis","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;music;neurophysiology;signal classification;support vector machines;time-frequency analysis","EEG frequency bands;EEG-based recognition;HHS-based feature vectors;Hilbert-Huang spectrum;Mahalanobis distance-based discriminant analysis;TF techniques;Zhao-Atlas-Marks distribution;bilateral average activity;brain activity;electroencephalogram responses;emotional arousal phenomena;feature estimation;feature extraction;frequency 13 Hz to 49 Hz;generalized brain computer interface;hemispheric asymmetries;k-NN-based feature vectors;k-nearest neighbors;music liking;music preference recognition;noise corruption;physiological parameters;quadratic distance-based discriminant analysis;spectrogram;support vector machines;time-frequency analysis","Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Brain Mapping;Electroencephalography;Female;Humans;Male;Music;Pleasure;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Young Adult","31","","43","","20120927","Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

After the previous studies which were concerned with the production of a learned multi-agent model based on Boltzmann Machine learning algorithm and also the evaluation of the learning of a learned system in sugarscape, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the learning done after adding the two parameters of communication and cooperation to the sugarscape learned model. Thus a cellular learned multi-agent model with use of Boltzmann Machine learning algorithm based on sugarscape model was considered. In this model, each agent has been allocated with a parameter that indicates the knowledge of the agent. Once all agents reach sugar peaks it means that all agents have become knowledgeable and the model has converged. After that the two parameters of communication and cooperation are added to the given model and for each one of the models the number of agents present in sugar peaks after the model had reached convergence per the specific number of agents has been measured. After analyzing the resulting diagram it was concluded that after the convergence of the model, the average number of knowledgeable agents in learned model with communication and cooperation is higher than the number of knowledgeable agents in learned model without use of communication and cooperation. Therefore communication and cooperation of the agents causes to increase the learning done in the environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1398-8; POD:978-1-4673-1397-1","10.1109/WCICA.2012.6357924","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6357924","Boltzmann Machine learning algorithm;communication;cooperation;multi-agent system;sugarscape","Convergence;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multiagent systems;Stochastic processes;Sugar","Boltzmann machines;cellular automata;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","Boltzmann machine learning algorithm;MAS;agent communication;agent cooperation;cellular learned multiagent model;knowledgeable agents;multiagent environment;sugarscape CA","","0","","40","","","6-8 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the intrinsic vagueness of speculative language, speculative requirements risk being misunderstood, and related uncertainty overlooked, and may benefit from careful treatment in the requirements engineering process. In this paper, we present a linguistically-oriented approach to automatic detection of uncertainty in natural language (NL) requirements. Our approach comprises two stages. First we identify speculative sentences by applying a machine learning algorithm called Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify uncertainty cues. The algorithm exploits a rich set of lexical and syntactic features extracted from requirements sentences. Second, we try to determine the scope of uncertainty. We use a rule-based approach that draws on a set of hand-crafted linguistic heuristics to determine the uncertainty scope with the help of dependency structures present in the sentence parse tree. We report on a series of experiments we conducted to evaluate the performance and usefulness of our system.","1090-705X;1090705X","Electronic:978-1-4673-2785-5; POD:978-1-4673-2783-1","10.1109/RE.2012.6345795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6345795","Uncertainty;machine learning;natural language requirements;rule-based approach;speculative requirements;uncertainty cues;uncertainty scopes","Context;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Natural languages;Pragmatics;Syntactics;Uncertainty","computational linguistics;feature extraction;formal specification;grammars;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;risk management;uncertainty handling","CRF;NL requirements;conditional random fields;dependency structures;hand-crafted linguistic heuristics;lexical feature extraction;linguistically-oriented approach;machine learning algorithm;natural language requirements;requirements engineering process;rule-based approach;sentence parse tree;speculative language;speculative requirement risk;speculative sentence identification;syntactic features extraction;uncertainty automatic detection","","6","","19","","","24-28 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes a study on the empirical comparison of classification techniques for predictive ranking of the 12 month risk of default in banks. This work compares the scoring capabilities of different predictive models. The models compared were induced from past levels of risk exposure observed in historic data. The ranking performance of the models is compared by assessing the highest risk cases, using the left-hand side of the model's ROC curves (i.e., curves representing true positive to false positive rates). Empirical comparisons were performed using FDIC call report data and a one-year-ahead ranking prediction schema. This comparison demonstrates that inductive machine learning techniques can be successfully applied for predictive ranking of default risk. Observed results indicate better performance by symbolic rule or decision tree based models than by traditional modeling techniques based on statistical algorithms.","2380-8454;23808454","Electronic:978-1-4673-1803-7; POD:978-1-4673-1802-0; USB:978-1-4673-1801-3","10.1109/CIFEr.2012.6327823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6327823","Machine learning;Predictive models;Risk analysis;Supervised learning","Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","banking;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;risk analysis;statistical analysis","FDIC call report data;ROC curves;banks;data classification methods;financial institution risk;inductive machine learning techniques;one-year-ahead ranking prediction schema;predictive ranking performance;risk exposure;scoring capabilities;statistical algorithms","","1","","26","","","29-30 March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have the, as yet unexploited, potential to give insight into biological features of the sequences. We introduce several innovations to the production and use of side effect machine sequence features. We compare the results of using consensus sequences and genomic sequences for training classifiers and find that more accurate results can be obtained using genomic sequences. Surprisingly, we were even able to build a classifier that distinguished consensus sequences from genomic sequences with high accuracy, suggesting that consensus sequences are not always representative of their genomic counterparts. We apply our techniques to the problem of distinguishing two types of transposable elements, solo LTRs and SINEs. Identifying these sequences is important because they affect gene expression, genome structure, and genetic diversity, and they serve as genetic markers. They are of similar length, neither codes for protein, and both have many nearly identical copies throughout the genome. Being able to efficiently and automatically distinguish them will aid efforts to improve annotations of genomes. Our approach reveals structural characteristics of the sequences of potential interest to biologists.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2012.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6275431","Endogenous retroviruses;LTR retrotransposons;SINE elements;evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms;feature evaluation and selection;machine learning;side effect machines","Bioinformatics;DNA;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Genomics;Machine learning","biology computing;feature extraction;genetic algorithms;genetics;genomics;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins","DNA sequences;SINE elements;biological features;biologists;classifier training;endogenous retroviral LTRs;evolved side effect machines;feature extraction;gene expression;genetic diversity;genetic markers;genome structure;genomic sequences;protein codes;structural characteristics;transposable elements","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Computational Biology;DNA Transposable Elements;Humans;Retroviridae;Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements;Terminal Repeat Sequences","7","","51","","20120820","Nov.-Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

After an initial learning phase, each player uses its previous experience during the simulation of the game to decide if it should dribble, pass or kick the ball to the adversary goal.
