"Protein secondary structure prediction through a novel framework of secondary structure transition sites and new encoding schemes","M. Zamani; S. C. Kremer","School of Computer Science, University of Guelph, Canada","2016 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB)","20170102","2016","","","1","7","In this paper, we propose an ab initio two-stage protein secondary structure (PSS) prediction model through a novel framework of PSS transition site prediction by using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Genetic Programming (GP). In the proposed classifier, protein sequences are encoded by new amino acid encoding schemes derived from genetic Codon mappings, Clustering and Information theory. In the first stage, sequence segments are mapped to regions in the Ramachandran map (2D-plot), and weight scores are computed by using statistical information derived from clusters. In addition, score vectors are constructed for the mapped regions using the weight scores and PSS transition sites. The score vectors have fewer dimensions compared to those of commonly used encoding schemes and protein profile. In the second stage, a two-tier classifier is employed based on an ANN and a GP method. The performance of the two-stage classifier is compared to the state-of-the-art cascaded Machine Learning methods which commonly employ ANNs. The prediction method is examined with the latest dataset of nonhomologous protein sequences, PISCES [1]. The experimental results and statistical analyses indicate a significantly higher distribution of Q<sub>3</sub> scores, approximately 7% with p-value <; 0.001, in comparison to that of cascaded ANN architectures. PSS transition sites are valuable information about the topological property of protein sequences and incorporating the information improves the overall performance of the PSS prediction model.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9472-7; POD:978-1-5090-0012-8","10.1109/CIBCB.2016.7758118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7758118","amino acids;genetic programming;information theory;machine learning;protein secondary structure","Predictive models;Proteins","biological techniques;biology computing;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);macromolecules;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;neural nets;proteins;statistical analysis","PSS transition site prediction;Ramachandran map;amino acid encoding schemes;artificial neural networks;clustering method;genetic codon mappings;genetic programming;information theory;protein profile;protein secondary structure prediction;protein sequences;secondary structure transition sites;state-of-the-art cascaded machine learning methods;statistical analyses;topological property;weight scores","","","","","","","5-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Will It Last? Learning Stable Features for Long-Term Visual Localization","M. Dymczyk; E. Stumm; J. Nieto; R. Siegwart; I. Gilitschenski","","2016 Fourth International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)","20161219","2016","","","572","581","An increasing number of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems are using appearance-based localization to improve the quality of pose estimates. However, with the growing time-spans and size of the areas we want to cover, appearance-based maps are often becoming too large to handle and are consisting of features that are not always reliable for localization purposes. This paper presents a method for selecting map features that are persistent over time and thus suited for long-term localization. Our methodology relies on a CNN classifier based on image patches and depth maps for recognizing which features are suitable for life-long matchability. Thus, the classifier not only considers the appearance of a feature but also takes into account its expected lifetime. As a result, our feature selection approach produces more compact maps with a high fraction of temporally-stable features compared to the current state-of-the-art, while rejecting unstable features that typically harm localization. Our approach is validated on indoor and outdoor datasets, that span over a period of several months.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5407-7; POD:978-1-5090-5408-4","10.1109/3DV.2016.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785133","CNN;SLAM;feature selection;localization;machine learning;mapping;place recognition","Buildings;Feature extraction;Reliability;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Visualization","SLAM (robots);feature selection;image classification;neural nets","CNN classifier;SLAM systems;convolutional neural network;depth maps;feature recognition;image patches;life-long matchability;long-term visual localization;map feature selection;simultaneous localization and mapping systems","","","","","","","25-28 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, several limiting factors potentially hamper the learning accuracy, including the nonlinearity and device variations in weight update, and the read noise, limited ON/OFF weight ratio and array parasitics in weighted sum. With unsupervised sparse coding as a case study algorithm, this paper employs device-algorithm co-design methodologies to quantify and mitigate the impact of these non-ideal properties on the accuracy. Our analysis shows that the realistic properties in weight update are tolerable, while those in weighted sum are detrimental to the accuracy. With calibration of realistic synaptic behaviors from experimental data, our study shows that the recognition accuracy of MNIST handwriting digits degrades from ∼96 to ∼30 percent. The strategies to mitigate this accuracy loss include 1) redundant cells to alleviate the impact of device variations; 2) a dummy column to eliminate the off-state current; and 3) selector and larger wire width to reduce IR drop along interconnects. The selector also reduces the leakage power in weight update. With improved properties by these strategies, the accuracy increases back to ∼95 percent, enabling reliable integration of realistic synaptic devices in neuromorphic systems.","","","10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2598742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7536617","Machine learning;cross-point array;neuro-inspired computing;resistive memory;selector;synaptic device","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer architecture;Encoding;Machine learning;Neuromorphics;Support vector machines;System-on-chip","","","","","","","","20160809","Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our CNN is trained end-to-end on MRI volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5407-7; POD:978-1-5090-5408-4","10.1109/3DV.2016.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785132","Deep learning;convolutional neural networks;machine learning;prostate;segmentation","Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neural networks;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;image segmentation;medical image processing;neural nets","3D image segmentation;CNN;Dice coefficient;MRI volumes;V-Net;background voxel;clinical practice;computer vision;foreground voxel;fully convolutional neural networks;histogram matching;magnetic resonance imaging;medical image analysis;random nonlinear transformations;volumetric medical image segmentation","","","","","","","25-28 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a method to collect a limited yet relevant amount of data in order to learn a class of complex models, finite state machines, in real-time.

These vertical search engines have to collect specific web pages in the web space, whereas search engines such as Google and Bing gather web pages from all over the world. The problem in focused crawling research is how to collect specific web pages with minimal computing resources. We previously addressed this problem by proposing a focused crawling strategy, which utilizes an ensemble machine learning classifier to find the group of relevant web pages, referred to as relevant website segment. In this paper, we enhance the proposed crawler as follows: 1) We increase the accuracy of predicting website segments, by preparing two predictors: a predictor learned by features extracted from relevant source website segments and another predictor learned by features from irrelevant ones. The idea is that there may exist different characteristics between these two types of source website segments. 2) We also propose a noisy data elimination method when updating the predictor incrementally during the crawling process. A preliminary experiment shows that our enhanced crawler outperforms a crawler that equips neither of these approaches by around 12%, at most.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0979-4; POD:978-1-5090-0980-0","10.1109/NBiS.2016.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789756","classifier ensemble;focused crawler;machine learning;noise reduction;topic specific web crawler;website segment crawler","Crawlers;Feature extraction;Knowledge engineering;Noise measurement;Search engines;Training;Web pages","Web sites;feature extraction;search engines","Web pages;Web site segment prediction accuracy;Web space;adaptive focused Web site segment crawler;feature extraction;noisy data elimination method;search service;vertical search engines","","","","","","","7-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One methodology for tumor discrimination based on dimensionality reduction and nonparametric estimation - in particular, Directional Kernel Density Estimation - is proposed and tested on spectral image data from breast samples. Once a hyperspectral image of the tumor has been captured, a surgeon assists by establishing Regions of Interest where tissues are qualitatively differentiable. After proper normalization, Directional KDE is used to estimate the likelihood of every pixel in the image belonging to each specified tissue class.

As a result of such a training protocol, fall detectors inevitably exhibit lower performance when used in real-life conditions, in which monitored subjects are older adults. In order to address the problem of fall detection under real-life conditions, this study investigates privacy-preserving unobtrusive sensing technologies together with an unsupervised methodology trained exclusively on daily activity (non-fall) data from the monitored elderly subject.

Most of traditional crowd estimation approaches rely on sophisticated computer vision algorithms to estimate crowd based on camera data, therefore suffering from privacy issues and high deployment and data processing cost. In this paper we present a sensor fusion based approach to real-time crowd estimation based on privacy-conscious and inexpensive sensors. The approach has been implemented and verified first by a small scale deployment at our lab, and then tested based on a 3-month trial at a shopping mall in Singapore. A deep analysis has been carried out based on the data sets collected from the trial, showing promising results: (1) the data from CO2, sound pressure and infrared sensors are influential in estimating crowd levels for indoor environments, (2) Random Forest and C4.5 are identified as the more suitable supervised learning models, (3) an accuracy of 95% can be achieved by our crowd estimation system in a real scenario. In contrast to the state of the art, our approach is privacy preserving and can provide comparable estimation accuracy with lower deployment and processing cost and better applicability for large scale setups. It can be used either as an alternative solution when user privacy must be enforced or as a complementary solution to camera-based crowd estimation when privacy is less concerned because of pubic safety.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2625-8; POD:978-1-5090-2626-5","10.1109/MobServ.2016.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7787060","crowd estimation;machine learning;privacy preserving;sensor fusion","Cameras;Data models;Estimation;Monitoring;Privacy;Real-time systems;Safety","computer vision;data privacy;estimation theory;mobile computing;sensor fusion","camera data;computer vision algorithms;data processing cost;pubic safety;real-time privacy preserving crowd estimation;sensor data","","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this problem, our LCS focuses on an extraction of only two different abstracted level rules, both the specific and general rules, to understand a tendency in a given problem.

With the recent increase in big data present in the healthcare domain, from medical organizations modernizing their operations through electronic health records (EHRs) and deploying new health information technology (HIT) systems, there exists an opportunity for applying predictive models on this vast amount of EHR data and developing a web service to increase the potential for preventive care to be applied. In this paper we present our web service that uses previous work on predicting psychological conditions in concussion patients to provide doctors and patients with the ability to identify the likelihood of said developing psychological conditions. The existing predictive work that we base our web service on utilizes a neural network model which is very slow and inefficient by nature. Due to the inherent costly computation associated with this neural network model we ensure that our web service is fast, efficient, and scalable to meet the demands of prospective users. We provide users with both an API and a frontend interface for predicting psychological conditions 60, 90, 180, 365, and 730 days post concussion, and we utilize various technologies including Hadoop, Pybrain, and Django to form the architecture of our fast, scalable, and efficient prediction web service.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2625-8; POD:978-1-5090-2626-5","10.1109/MobServ.2016.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7787069","Hadoop;concussion;machine learning;preventive healthcare;scalability;web service","Big data;Biological neural networks;Medical services;Predictive models;Psychology;Web services","Big Data;Web services;application program interfaces;electronic health records;health care;patient diagnosis;psychology;user interfaces","API;Big Data;EHR;HIT system;Web service;application program interface;concussion patient diagnosis;electronic health record;frontend interface;health care;health information technology;medical organization;psychological condition","","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper investigates the approach of passively monitoring and analyzing DNS traffic in a time efficient manner based on machine learning on a reduced and robust feature set. For the evaluation the full DNS data stream of a regional ISP is used. To enhance the amount of traffic that can be labeled for the training process and reduce the number of false negatives in the case study, this is combined with a semi-manual labeling approach which addresses domains created by Domain-Generation-Algorithms (DGAs). That allows also medium sized, regional service providers to train classifiers with typical DNS traffic and to deploy systems based on the approach proposed here, in the network of organizations as an alternative to cloud services. The evaluation shows that this approach is feasible and prototypes are already deployed.

The model automatically learns rules across all domains and uses them to improve the results of the current domain by purposefully grouping words into topics to better represent the underlying concept. The existing models apply thresholds on evaluation criteria to learn rules; however, being automatic it may learn wrong, irrelevant or inconsistent rules as well. In this research article the proposed model learns rules and monitors their contributions towards the quality of results.

Each year severe thunderstorms cause significant damage and loss of life, some of which could be avoided if better forecasts were available. We propose a computer algorithm that analyzes satellite images from historical archives to locate visual signatures of severe thunderstorms for short-term predictions. While computers are involved in weather forecasts to solve numerical models based on sensory data, they are less competent in forecasting based on visual patterns from both current and past satellite images. In our system, we extract and summarize important visual storm evidence from satellite image sequences in the way that meteorologists interpret the images. In particular, the algorithm extracts and fits local cloud motion from image sequences to model the storm-related cloud patches. Image data from the year 2008 have been adopted to train the model, and historical severe thunderstorm reports in continental U.S. from 2000 to 2013 have been used as the ground truth and priors in the modeling process.

The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated in several examples of two-layer networks. In the first layer, a specific linear/non-linear prediction model is used.

A key concept in SDN is the separation of the network control and data planes, together with an application plane that supports the programming of network applications in general-purpose languages such as Java and Python. These network applications can be developed by an enterprise, service provider or vendor, or purchased from third-parties through SDN application stores. While the programmability of SDN provides tremendous flexibility and adaptability to changing network conditions and demands, it also exposes networks to significant vulnerabilities through software faults in network applications, as well as in the control and data planes.

This feature makes them a prime candidate for residential demand response. However, the stochastic and nonlinear dynamics of electric water heaters, makes it challenging to harness their flexibility. Driven by this challenge, this paper formulates the underlying sequential decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and uses techniques from reinforcement learning. Specifically, we apply an auto-encoder network to find a compact feature representation of the sensor measurements, which helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. A wellknown batch reinforcement learning technique, fitted Q-iteration, is used to find a control policy, given this feature representation. In a simulation-based experiment using an electric water heater with 50 temperature sensors, the proposed method was able to achieve good policies much faster than when using the full state information. In a lab experiment, we apply fitted Q-iteration to an electric water heater with eight temperature sensors. Further reducing the state vector did not improve the results of fitted Q-iteration. The results of the lab experiment, spanning 40 days, indicate that compared to a thermostat controller, the presented approach was able to reduce the total cost of energy consumption of the electric water heater by 15%.","1949-3053;19493053","","10.1109/TSG.2016.2640184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7792709","Auto-encoder network;demand response;electric water heater;fitted Q-iteration;machine learning;reinforcement learning","Energy consumption;Learning (artificial intelligence);Load management;Resistance heating;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Water heating","","","","","","","","20161221","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, the focus relies on performing these tasks using only a single frame of each vehicle in the video. Therefore, such approaches might have their recognition rates reduced due to noise present in that particular frame. Instead of selecting a single frame to perform the recognition, we propose a novel real-time approach to automatically detect the vehicle and identify (locate/recognize) its license plate based on temporal redundancy information. To achieve further improvements, we also propose two post-processing techniques by querying a license plate database. The experimental results, performed in a dataset composed of 300 on-track vehicles acquired on an urban road, demonstrate that it is possible to improve the vehicle recognition rate in 15:3 percentage points using our proposal temporal redundancy approach. Additional 7:8 percentage points are achieved by querying registered license plates on a database by the vehicle appearance, leading to a final recognition rate of 89:6%.

To identifying the defects before the arrival of item or aimed the software improvement, to make software dependable, defect prediction model is utilized. It is always desirable to predict the defects at early stages of life cycle. Hence to predict the defects before testing the SDP is done at end of each phase of SDLC. It helps to reduce the cost as well as time. To produce high quality software, the artificial neural network approach is applied to predict the defect. Nine metrics are applied to the multiple phases of SDLC and twenty genuine software projects are used. The software project data were collected from a team of organization and their responses were recorded in linguistic terms.

Their main advantage is better power delivery without loss of axial resolution. Their drawback, however, is that the biological tissue distorts the ultrasound echo of a chirp, thus the shape of the received ultrasound pulse is unknown. This degrades the quality of the reconstructed ultrasound image when a matched filter is used. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a method for ultrasound pulse estimation by analyzing the received echo. A modification of blind homomorphic deconvolution is proposed using multi-resolution sparse representations and machine learning. This method creates multi-resolution dictionaries using training sets. The proposed system is trained on chirp signals, resulting in high precision pulse estimates. Our simulation results show that the proposed method, which can be used also for additional types of pulses, facilitates the use of chirp signals in medical ultrasound imaging and contributes to enhanced imaging results.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2152-9; POD:978-1-5090-2153-6","10.1109/ICSEE.2016.7806106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806106","Machine Learning;Medical Imaging;Resolution","Chirp;Estimation;Radio frequency;Signal resolution;Training;Transducers;Ultrasonic imaging","biomedical ultrasonics;image representation;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);matched filters;medical image processing","axial resolution;biological tissue;blind homomorphic deconvolution;chirp coded signals;machine learning;matched filter;multiresolution sparse representations;on chirp compression;on chirp excitation;received ultrasound pulse;ultrasound imaging;ultrasound medical imaging;ultrasound pulse estimation","","","","","","","16-18 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we show that: (1) Traffic counts are a function of dependant spatial, temporal and neighbourhood variables, (2) Large open-source data, such as school location and public transport hubs can, with appropriate GIS and machine learning, assist the prediction of traffic counts, (3) Real-time simulation can be scaled-up to large networks with the aid of machine learning and, (4) Such techniques can be employed in real-world tools.

These models normally train various forms of neural networks on top of pretrained word embeddings using a task-specific corpus. However, most of these works neglect the multisense nature of words in the pretrained word embeddings. In this paper we introduce topic models to enrich the word embeddings for multisenses of words. The integration of the topic model with various semantic compositional processes leads to topic-aware convolutional neural network and topic-aware long short term memory networks. Different from previous multisense word embeddings models that assign multiple independent and sense-specific embeddings to each word, our proposed models are lightweight and have flexible frameworks that regard word sense as the composition of two parts: a general sense derived from a large corpus and a topic-specific sense derived from a task-specific corpus. In addition, our proposed models focus on semantic composition instead of word understanding. With the help of topic models, we can integrate the topic-specific sense at word-level before the composition and sentence-level after the composition. Comprehensive experiments on five public sentence classification datasets are conducted and the results show that our proposed topic-aware deep compositional models produce competitive or better performance than other text representation learning methods.","2329-9290;23299290","","10.1109/TASLP.2016.2632521","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755816","Machine learning;natural language processing;sentence classification;text representation learning","Computational modeling;Context;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Neural networks;Numerical models;Semantics","convolution;natural language processing;neural nets;pattern classification;text analysis","computational linguistic;multisense word embeddings;natural language processing;representation learning;semantic compositional processes;sense-specific embeddings;sentence classification;sentence-level;task-specific corpus;topic-aware convolutional neural network;topic-aware deep compositional models;topic-aware long short term memory networks;topic-specific sense;word sense;word-level","","","","","","20161123","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In today's world, we have come to depend upon highly sophisticated and tightly interwoven electronic systems that facilitate sensing, communication and computing tasks. However, as we move forward, many grand challenges exist in raising the performance of such systems to the next level. For instance, the energy consumption of most sensors and data transceivers is still far too high to operate autonomously and for extended periods of time. On the other end of the spectrum, the power levels required to run sophisticated machine learning algorithms still appears too large for exponential growth and/or massive deployment. In the past, the desired progress was often fueled by engineering better components and by leveraging the immense improvements delivered by CMOS feature size scaling. For example, mixed-signal designers have invested an immense amount of time to port and optimize data converters from node-to-node and have thereby enabled wider bandwidths at steadily lower conversion energies [1], Similarly, RF designers have leveraged the high transit frequencies of modern devices to enable low-noise RF signal processing up to mm-wave frequencies. As we enter the next stage of innovation, it is becoming increasingly clear that future progress will come from a “top-down,” system-driven approach. The sheer complexity of today's systems provides us with a new degree of freedom wherein the system architecture and their underlying components (and possibly transistors) can be co-designed, thus providing larger gains than those enabled within the usual scaling and porting framework. This talk will provide an overview of my group's research on system-driven mixed-signal design, which is guided by the parallel consideration of theory, systems, algorithms and circuits. For instance, we are researching a number of sensing approaches aimed at “fooling Nyquist” and extracting de- ired analog-domain information using low-rate and low-bandwidth observations. In a second line of work, we investigate the application of mixed-signal co-processors in machine learning algorithms [2], tailored for example toward low-power image classification.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1830-7; POD:978-1-5090-1831-4","10.1109/EDSSC.2016.7785197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785197","CMOS;analog circuits;low-power;machine learning;mixed-signal circuits;technology scaling","Decision support systems","CMOS integrated circuits;coprocessors;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits","CMOS feature size scaling;RF designers;analog-domain information;data converters;low-bandwidth observations;low-noise RF signal processing;low-power image classification;low-rate observations;machine learning algorithms;mixed-signal circuits;mixed-signal coprocessor;node-to-node converters;system-driven mixed-signal design","","","","","","","3-5 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Once an intrusion is detected, it is also capable of blocking the intruder in accessing the victim device on the fly. The modular design of IoT-IDM gives its users the flexibility to employ customized machine learning techniques for detection based on learned signature patterns of known attacks.

From the color-classified regions, non-temporal texture features are extracted and used as an input to a trained Random Forests classifier. Using standardized metrics and a large dataset we compare our solution to other state of the art systems, showing that it outperforms the prior approaches in both frame by frame classification and fire region location.

Once this huge amount of data are analyzed, it can be used to develop policies for siting wind-power facilities, designing smart charging algorithms, or evaluating the capacity of electrical distribution systems to meet the actual requirement of power load. Our work started with collecting related climate data for building data model to perform analytics work and experiments using Support Vector Regression (SVR) method.

Sentiment analysis is one method of aggregating overall polarity (positive or negative) towards a topic. However, most sentiment analysis methods rely on text processing, thus ignoring the large amount of image data present in popular social networks. The primary aim of this study is to exploit image data in conjunction with text and to evaluate this integrated approach for sentiment analysis for transportation. This study used image, captions, and comments data from the Instagram social network that were marked as being relevant to California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and attempted to predict the expressed sentiment towards this agency. A set of high-level features were extracted from images using the web-based Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs. These features included the detection of faces and 86 categories which describe the images. Text features included the set of individual words and structural features. The experiment results of different machine learning techniques show a gain in precision when images and texts are combined compared to text-only approaches, thus confirming the relevance of visual content usage. The precision reaches a performance close to human classification agreement (typically approximately 80%). However, the results do not indicate that visual features are more informative than text features.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1889-5; POD:978-1-5090-1890-1; USB:978-1-5090-1888-8","10.1109/ITSC.2016.7795898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795898","classification;machine learning;natural language processing;public transportation;sentiment analysis","Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Sentiment analysis;Transportation;Twitter;Visualization","application program interfaces;face recognition;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);transportation","California department of transportation;Caltrans;Instagram social network;Web-based Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs;customer feedback;face detection;feature extraction;human classification agreement;image data;individual words;machine learning;polarity aggregation;sentiment prediction;service provider;social media platforms;structural features;text processing;textual features;transportation agencies;two-way communication;visual content;visual features","","","","","","","1-4 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These traits are important for biometric recognition, specifically from the feature extraction module. Traditional texture based feature extraction techniques extract features from an entire biometric image. However, a genetic and evolutionary extraction technique has been created that optimizes the location and dimensions of extraction on biometric images. Optimization occurs on a training set of biometric images that are separated akin to a biometric identification system. Images are placed in a probe set or gallery set and the probe set images are compared to the gallery set images. In this work, a novel variation of the genetic based extraction technique is introduced. The main component of this variation is that the training set is not represented as a traditional identification system, but rather every image in the set is compared with every other set. The results show a superior performance of the variation for periocular identification and verification compared to the traditional genetic approach.","","CD:978-1-5090-3493-2; Electronic:978-1-5090-3495-6; POD:978-1-5090-3496-3","10.1109/INFOCOMAN.2016.7784263","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7784263","evolutionary computation;feature extraction;genetic algorithm;machine learning;periocular recognition","Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Genetics;Iron;Probes;Smart phones;Sociology","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence)","biometric identification system;biometric images;biometric recognition;evolutionary extraction technique;feature extraction module;gallery set;genetic based extraction method;periocular biometric;periocular recognition;texture based feature extraction techniques;training set","","","","","","","29-31 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With this in mind, a test framework is proposed, comprising of distortion profiles which define a comprehensive test suite. The unique contribution of this paper is the definition of a test framework that measures a more complete profile of a transfer learning algorithm's capability, facilitating the identification of relative poor and good performance areas.

In addition, a new sparsity-based optimization approach for transmittance image super-resolution/restoration is proposed, which makes a solid assumption that most outdoor object surfaces are piece-wise linear and thus the corresponding depth image is sparse in Laplacian space.

Advances in noninvasive neuroimaging target two capabilities: 1) increased spatial and temporal resolution of measured neural activity; and 2) innovative methodologies to extract brain-behavior relationships from evolving neuroimaging technology. We target the second. Our novel methodology integrated three neuroimaging methodologies and elucidated expertise-dependent differences in functional (fused EEG-fMRI) and structural (dMRI) brain networks for a perception-action coupling task. A set of baseball players and controls performed a Go/No-Go task designed to mimic the situation of hitting a baseball. In the functional analysis, our novel fusion methodology identifies 50-ms windows with predictive EEG neural correlates of expertise and fuses these temporal windows with fMRI activity in a whole-brain 2-mm voxel analysis, revealing time-localized correlations of expertise at a spatial scale of millimeters. The spatiotemporal cascade of brain activity reflecting expertise differences begins as early as 200 ms after the pitch starts and lasts up to 700 ms afterwards. Network differences are spatially localized to include motor and visual processing areas, providing evidence for differences in perception-action coupling between the groups. Furthermore, an analysis of structural connectivity reveals that the players have significantly more connections between cerebellar and left frontal/motor regions, and many of the functional activation differences between the groups are located within structurally defined network modules that differentiate expertise. In short, our novel method illustrates how multimodal neuroimaging can provide specific macroscale insights into the functional and structural correlates of expertise development.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2016.2574702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7514245","Diffusion tensor imaging;encephalography;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging;sensor fusion","Brain models;Couplings;Electroencephalography;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neuroimaging;Spatial resolution;Sports equipment","biomedical MRI;electroencephalography;medical image processing;neurophysiology;psychology;sensor fusion","EEG neural correlates;Go/No-Go task;baseball;brain activity;brain-behavior relationships;cerebellar region;cognition;expertise-dependent differences;functional analysis;fused EEG-fMRI;fusion methodology;group differences;left frontal/motor region;macroscale brain dynamics;multimodal neuroimaging;multiple neuroimaging modalities;neural activity;neuroimaging technology;noninvasive neuroimaging;perception-action coupling task;spatial resolution;structural brain networks;structural connectivity;temporal resolution;time-localized correlations;visual processing areas","","","","","","20160715","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Finally, it performs short text clustering using Spectral Clustering. We compare our method with conventional Spectral Clustering method which runs directly on the original short text dataset.

One simple example could be how people today buy a mobile phone. If in the past, shopping involved moving from one store to the other, these days one cares more about the opinions expressed by people in product reviews rather. There is an increasing tendency to leave one's opinion(s) on a product, service or any entity on the web thus opening doors for an interesting yet challenging field of Sentiment Analysis. Much work has been done in the last decade on Sentiment Analysis not surprisingly for English because of the availability of a large number of resources but other languages are also gradually taking pace, some of them already in advanced stages and already developing competing resources and applications compared to English. Nepali opinionated content is also increasing rapidly in the last few years. Nepal fares as one of the countries with the highest number of Facebook subscribers. Online presence and voicing one's opinion in the Internet through different social media platforms has become a norm both for individuals or businesses. Nepali is a morphologically rich, under-resourced and a free word order language. Although some works related to the language and technology have been done in the past by institutions like Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya<sup>1</sup> and Language Technology Kendra<sup>2</sup>, Nepali still remains an under-resourced language as it has very few tools and annotated corpus available for the language. This makes it challenging and difficult to do any linguistic computational works in the language including Sentiment Analysis. In this work, we look into applying three Machine Learning classifiers, namely Support Vector Machine, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for developing a model to classify book and movie reviews written in Nepali into “Positive” and “Negative”. We evaluate and validate our model using 5-fold cross-validation techniques. Experimental results show that the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier performs with a higher accuracy than the other two classifiers.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3429-1; POD:978-1-5090-3430-7","10.1109/IISA.2016.7785374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785374","Logistic Regression;Machine Learning;Morphology;Multinomial Naive Bayes;Support Vector Machine;cross-validation","Book reviews;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Motion pictures;Sentiment analysis;Support vector machines;Text analysis","Bayes methods;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;regression analysis;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);support vector machines","Facebook subscribers;Internet;Language Technology Kendra;Madan Puraskar Pustakalaya;Nepali subjective texts;Twitter;blogs;linguistic computational works;logistic regression classifier;machine learning classifiers;mobile phone;multinomial Naive Bayes regression classifier;online social media;people opinion;product reviews;sentiment analysis;sentiment classification;support vector machine","","","","","","","13-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, although some modern appliances can respond to price signals from the utility companies, there is a vast stock of older appliances that cannot. For such appliances, utilities must infer what appliances are operating in a home, given only the power signals on the main feeder to the home (i.e., the home's power consumption must be disaggregated into individual appliances). We report on an in-depth investigation of multi-label classification algorithms for disaggregating appliances in a power signal. A systematic review of this research topic shows that this class of algorithms has received little attention in the literature, even though it is arguably a more natural fit to the disaggregation problem than the traditional single-label classifiers used to date. We examine a multi-label meta-classification framework (RAkEL), and a bespoke multi-label classification algorithm (MLkNN), employing both time-domain and wavelet-domain feature sets. We test these classifiers on two real houses from the Reference Energy Disaggregation Dataset.

Experiments have been carried out over records including simulated or induced emotions, even if recently more research has been carried out on spontaneous emotions. However, it is well known that emotion expression depends not only on cultural factors but also on the individual and also on the specific situation. In this work we deal with the tracking of annoyance shifts during real phone-calls to complaint services. The audio files analyzed show different ways to express annoyance, as, for example, disappointment, impotence or anger. However variations of parameters derived from intensity combined with some spectral information and suprasegmental features have shown to be very robust for each speaker and annoyance rate. The work also discussed the annotation problem and proposed an extended rating scale in order to include annotators disagreements. Our frame classification results validated the annotation procedure.

This domain-specific clinical text has opened a stage for temporal information extraction (TIE) due to its significance of exploitation in medical care and richness of temporality. Processing temporal information in clinical text is much more difficult in comparison to newswire text due to implicit expression of temporal information, domain-specific nature, lack of structure and writing quality. Despite of these limitations, the existing works established various methods to extract temporal information with the help of annotated corpora. But it is costly and time consuming to prepare the annotated corpora and thus their small size inevitably affect the processing quality. Motivated by this fact, in this work we propose a novel two-stage semi-supervised framework to exploit the abundant unannotated clinical text to automatically detect the temporal information and gradually increase the size of annotated corpora and then subsequently improve the temporal information extraction accuracy. In our pilot study of the proposed framework stage-one, we developed a conditional random fields (CRFs) model for the temporal event and expression extractions on the annotated data with the various features sets at phrase level. At first, we generated the possible features from the annotated corpora and significant features are selected. Finally we trained and evaluated our model with the selected features.

It remains a challenging task to accurately distinguish foreign fibers from cotton. This paper proposes an efficient recognition system to accurately recognize foreign fibers mixed in cotton. The core component of the proposed system is an efficient classifier based on the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM). A two-step grid search strategy, which integrates a coarse search with a fine search, is adopted to train an optimal KELM recognition model. The resultant model is compared with the support vector machine and extreme learning machine on a real data set using tenfold cross-validation analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed recognition system can achieve classification accuracy as high as 93.57%, which is superior to the other two state-of-the-art systems.

Moreover, it can be used to gain insight and understanding of views held by many people. Sentiment classification is not limited to human interaction, as text can also convey the sentiment of the author. Opinion mining in text is a long studied field in machine learning. This study focuses on two of the many text domains used in the field of sentiment analysis: reviews and tweets. In this study, we aim to determine the the effect of performing cross-domain sentiment classification using either reviews or tweets as training data. We conduct an empirical investigation using two tweet datasets and one review dataset, and three classifiers. We conduct 18 experiments, varying the training dataset, the classifier used to build the model, and the dataset used to evaluate the model built. Our results show that training with tweets, for both datasets, yields an effective classifier for reviews. However, the converse, using reviews to classify sentiment in tweets, has the worst performance of all models, producing AUC values ranging from 0.59 to 0.65. Our best model is generated using tweets to train a Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier, and using reviews to evaluate. Multinomial Naïve Bayes was the best performing learner, producing the highest AUC in 5 out of the 6 combinations of training/test datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the effects of cross-domain sentiment classification using tweets and reviews.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3207-5; POD:978-1-5090-3208-2","10.1109/IRI.2016.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785737","Sentiment analysis;cross-domain;machine learning;reviews;tweet","Data mining;Data models;Motion pictures;Sentiment analysis;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","Bayes methods;data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);sentiment analysis","AUC values;cross-domain sentiment analysis;human interaction;machine learning;multinomial Naive Bayes classifier;opinion mining;review dataset;social interaction;training dataset;tweet datasets","","1","","","","","28-30 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Users play games, read emails, watch videos, chat and access web pages using their PC, which in turn downloads tens or hundreds of URLs to fetch all the objects needed to display the requested content. As result, billions of URLs are observed in the network. When monitoring the traffic, thus, it is becoming more and more important to have methodologies and tools that allow one to dig into this data and extract useful information. In this paper, we present CLUE, Clustering for URL Exploration, a methodology that leverages clustering algorithms, i.e., unsupervised techniques developed in the data mining field to extract knowledge from passive observation of URLs carried by the network. This is a challenging problem given the unstructured format of URLs, which, being strings, call for specialized approaches. Inspired by text-mining algorithms, we introduce the concept of URL-distance and use it to compose clusters of URLs using the well-known DBSCAN algorithm. Experiments on actual datasets show encouraging results. Well-separated and consistent clusters emerge and allow us to identify, e.g., malicious traffic, advertising services, and thirdparty tracking systems. In a nutshell, our clustering algorithm offers the means to get insights on the data carried by the network, with applications in the security or privacy protection fields.","","Electronic:978-0-9883-0451-2; POD:978-1-5090-1304-3","10.1109/ITC-28.2016.146","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809663","Clustering;Data Mining;Security;URL Analysis;Unsupervised Machine Learning;Web traffic analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Security;Servers;Uniform resource locators;Web pages","","","","","","","","","12-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It permits the exploitation of structure within unlabeled samples during the learning task. Like many other applications, remote sensing images suffer from the limited number of ground-truth samples and therefore semisupervised techniques may be used to overcome this limitation. In this paper, a semisupervised framework is proposed for classification of hyperspectral images with scarce labeled samples. Our method, which we call SSL-CC, utilizes fuzzy spectral clustering to label spatially neighboring samples. SSL-CC is implemented and tested on two benchmark hyperspectral datasets. Fuzzy clustering is compared to traditional crisp clustering (k-means) and the obtained results indicate that fuzzy clustering can significantly improve classification accuracy. SSL-CC achieves on average 60% improvement over a baseline SVM classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4774-1; POD:978-1-5090-4775-8","10.1109/STRATUS.2016.7811138","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811138","Hyperspectral imaging;classification;clustering;machine learning;semisupervised learning;spatial correlation","Benchmark testing;Clustering algorithms;Hyperspectral imaging;Support vector machines;Training","fuzzy systems;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image sampling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;remote sensing","SSL-CC;baseline SVM classifier;crisp clustering;fuzzy spectral clustering;ground-truth sample;hyperspectral dataset;hyperspectral image classification;k-means algorithm;remote sensing;scarce labeled sample;semisupervised learning framework","","","","","","","28-28 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Projecting ""Better Than Randomly"": How to Reduce the Dimensionality of Very Large Datasets in a Way That Outperforms Random Projections","M. Wojnowicz; D. Zhang; G. Chisholm; X. Zhao; M. Wolff","Dept. of Res. & Intell., Cylance, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA","2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics (DSAA)","20161226","2016","","","184","193","For very large datasets, random projections (RP) have become the tool of choice for dimensionality reduction. This is due to the computational complexity of principal component analysis. However, the recent development of randomized principal component analysis (RPCA) has opened up the possibility of obtaining approximate principal components on very large datasets. In this paper, we compare the performance of RPCA and RP in dimensionality reduction for supervised learning. In Experiment 1, study a malware classification task on a dataset with over 10 million samples, almost 100,000 features, and over 25 billion non-zero values, with the goal of reducing the dimensionality to a compressed representation of 5,000 features. In order to apply RPCA to this dataset, we develop a new algorithm called large sample RPCA (LS-RPCA), which extends the RPCA algorithm to work on datasets with arbitrarily many samples. We find that classification performance is much higher when using LS-RPCA for dimensionality reduction than when using random projections. In particular, across a range of target dimensionalities, we find that using LS-RPCA reduces classification error by between 37% and 54%. Experiment 2 generalizes the phenomenon to multiple datasets, feature representations, and classifiers. These findings have implications for a large number of research projects in which random projections were used as a preprocessing step for dimensionality reduction. As long as accuracy is at a premium and the target dimensionality is sufficiently less than the numeric rank of the dataset, randomized PCA may be a superior choice. Moreover, if the dataset has a large number of samples, then LS-RPCA will provide a method for obtaining the approximate principal components.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5206-6; POD:978-1-5090-5207-3","10.1109/DSAA.2016.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796904","Machine learning;Predictive models;Projection algorithms","Approximation algorithms;Computational complexity;Matrix decomposition;Prediction algorithms;Principal component analysis;Standards;Supervised learning","computational complexity;data compression;data reduction;feature extraction;invasive software;pattern classification;principal component analysis;random processes;very large databases","LS-RPCA;compressed feature representation;computational complexity;large sample RPCA;malware classification task;random projections;randomized PCA;randomized principal component analysis;supervised learning;very large dataset dimensionality reduction","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the risk of adverse side effects, certain adjuvant treatments can be given to patients that are at high risk of recurrence. The challenge, however, is in finding the best tradeoff between these two extremes. Patients that are given more potent treatments, such as chemotherapy, radiation, or systemic treatment, can suffer unnecessary consequences, especially if the cancer does not return. Predictive modeling of recurrence can help inform patients and practitioners on a case-by-case basis, personalized for each patient. For large-scale predictive models to be built, structured data must be captured for a wide range of diverse patients.

Specifically, we apply our algorithm to quantitative emphysema measurements obtained from chest CT scans in the COPDGene Study and show several distinct progression patterns. As emphysema is one of the major components of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the third leading cause of death in the United States [1], an improved definition of emphysema and COPD subtypes is of great interest. We investigate several models with our algorithm, and show that one with $age$ , $pack~years$ (a measure of cigarette exposure), and $smoking~status$ as predictors gives the best compromise between estimated predictive performance and model complexity. This model identified nine subtypes which showed significant associations to seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) known to associate with COPD. Additionally, this model gives better predictive accuracy than multiple, multivariate ordinary least squares regression as demonstrated in a five-fold cross validation analysis. We view our subtyping algorithm as a contribution that can be applied to bridge the gap between CT-level assessment of tissue composition to population-level analysis of compositional trends that vary between disease subtypes.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2608782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7565617","Bayes methods;computed tomography;knowledge discovery;machine learning;pattern analysis;prediction methods","Bayes methods;Computed tomography;Data models;Diseases;Histograms;Lungs;Trajectory","Bayes methods;biological tissues;computerised tomography;data mining;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical diagnostic computing;regression analysis","Bayesian nonparametric model;COPD subtype;COPDGene Study;CT-level assessment;SNP;chest CT scans;chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;compositional data;disease subtype identification;disease trajectory;emphysema phenotypes;estimated predictive performance;five-fold cross validation analysis;medical images;model complexity;multivariate ordinary least squares regression;population subgroup;population-level analysis;progression patterns;quantitative emphysema measurement;single nucleotide polymorphisms;smoking-status;tissue composition;tissue patterns","","","","","","20160913","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, building a specific limited scope detection system will not provide complete protection from the wide phishing attack vectors. This paper develops detection system with a wide protection scope using URL features only which is relying on the fact that users directly deal with URLs to surf the internet and provides a good approach to detect malicious URLs as proved by previous studies. Additionally, Anti-phishing solutions can be positioned at different levels of attack flow where most researchers are focusing on client side solutions which turn to add more processing overhead at the client side and lead to losing the trust and satisfaction of the users.

Several groups of classification rules have been proposed with respect to the difference between the sentences in the text pair. The set of Wikipedia redirected titles became an important resource of synonyms. A SVM classifier was also constructed based on several groups of features. The experimental results showed that a hybrid system achieved the best performance with a macro-averaged F1-measure of 48.50% and an accuracy of 49.33% which outperformed the best systems in the NTCIR-11 RITE-VAL System Validation Chinese subtasks.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3207-5; POD:978-1-5090-3208-2","10.1109/IRI.2016.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7785784","Classification rule;Machine learning;System validation;Textual entailment","Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Pragmatics;System validation;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis","Chinese RITE dataset;SVM classifier;Wikipedia redirected titles;classification rules;dataset focusing;hybrid system;linguistic phenomena;text pair;textual entailment classification learning","","","","","","","28-30 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it is already very common in endurance sports, in weight training the tracking is still done mainly manually, which is a tedious task. This work aims at exploring the problem of automated tracking and analysing of weight training exercises by the use of low-power smart fitness devices based on inertial measurement units (IMUs), sensors containing accelerometers and gyroscopes. Therefore, basic state-of-the-art signal and data processing approaches, including various filtering techniques, sensor fusion, time series segmentation and classification methods like hidden Markov models (HMMs), support vector machines (SVMs) and nearest neighbours classifiers, are studied and applied to the specific problem domain. A proof-of-concept approach of the proposed methods is implemented on a purpose-built constrained embedded system. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation based on dumbbell exercises is done. The developed prototype achieves a segmentation misdetection rate of 1.5 %, a classification accuracy of 99.7 % and an average response time of about 300 ms. In conclusion, the results show that the initially specified requirements are met and that an accurate and fast tracking of selected weight training exercises is possible.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3474-1; POD:978-1-5090-3475-8","10.1109/IECON.2016.7793510","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7793510","Smart fitness devices;data mining;dynamic time warping (DTW);inertial measurement units (IMUs);sensor fusion;supervised machine learning;support vector machines (SVMs);time series classification","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Hidden Markov models;Sensor fusion;Time series analysis;Training","accelerometers;embedded systems;filtering theory;gyroscopes;hidden Markov models;inertial systems;pattern classification;sensor fusion;sport;support vector machines;time series","IMU-based smart fitness devices;accelerometers;data processing;dumbbell exercises;endurance sports;filtering techniques;gyroscopes;hidden Markov models;inertial measurement units;low-power smart fitness devices;nearest neighbours classifiers;purpose-built constrained embedded system;sensor fusion;signal processing;sport activities automated tracking;support vector machines;time series classification;time series segmentation;weight training exercises","","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a method using artificial neural networks trained with data from singleton pregnancy cases, while undergoing first trimester screening. Three different datasets1 with a total of 122362 euploid and 967 aneuploid cases were used in this study. The data for each case contained markers collected from the mother and the fetus. This study, unlike previous studies published by the authors for a similar problem differs in three basic principles being, a) the training of the artificial neural networks is done using the markers’ values in their raw form (unprocessed), b) a balanced training dataset is created and used by selecting only a representative number of euploids for the training phase, and c) emphasis is given to the financials and suggest hierarchy and necessity of the available tests. The proposed artificial neural networks models were optimized in the sense of reaching a minimum false positive rate and at the same time securing a 100% detection rate for Trisomy 21. These systems correctly identify other aneuploidies (Trisomies 13&18, Turner, and Triploid syndromes) at a detection rate >80%. In conclusion, we demonstrate that artificial neural network systems can contribute in providing non-invasive, effective early screening for fetal aneuploidies with results that compare favorably to other existing methods.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2608859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795231","Bioinformatics;chromosomal abnormalities;computational intelligence;data normalization;fetal aneuploidies;imbalanced data;machine learning;non-invasive prenatal diagnosis","Amniocentesis;Biomedical measurement;DNA;Informatics;Neural networks;Pregnancy;Training","","","","","","","","20161222","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In particular, RCAs jeopardize public safety in the already crowded airspace surrounding many large airports. An approach for protection from illegally operated RCAs is to utilize smart jamming methodologies against the frequency hopping radios commonly used in these applications. However, the abundance of radio manufacturers, along with their often closed or proprietary physical layer protocols, challenges existing smart jamming schemes. In this paper we propose a method to automatically synchronize in time and frequency with a frequency hopping radio at the physical layer by modelling the radio as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Our approach automates the determination of hop rates, hop frequencies, and timing of the target radio. We present multiple algorithms for identifying key HMM parameters and compare these algorithms using simulated data. We present the results of our HMM approach as we vary simulated noisy channel characteristics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3781-0; POD:978-1-5090-3782-7","10.1109/MILCOM.2016.7795437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7795437","Automatic Protocol Reverse Engineering;Frequency Hopping Communication Systems;Machine Learning","","frequency hop communication;hidden Markov models;jamming;protocols;synchronisation","HMM;RCA;automatic closed protocol hop synchronization;frequency hopping radios;frequency synchronization;hidden Markov model approach;hop frequency;hop rate determination;noisy channel characteristics;proprietary physical layer protocols;public safety;remote control aircraft;smart jamming methodology;target radio timing;time synchronization","","","","","","","1-3 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Novel Grading Biomarker for the Prediction of Conversion From Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's Disease","T. Tong; Q. Gao; R. Guerrero; C. Ledig; L. Chen; D. Rueckert; A. D. N. Initiative","Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Department of Computing, Imperial College London","IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","20161220","2017","64","1","155","165","Objective: Identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects who will progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not only crucial in clinical practice, but also has a significant potential to enrich clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to develop an effective biomarker for an accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion from magnetic resonance images. Methods: We propose a novel grading biomarker for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. First, we comprehensively study the effects of several important factors on the performance in the prediction task including registration accuracy, age correction, feature selection, and the selection of training data. Based on the studies of these factors, a grading biomarker is then calculated for each MCI subject using sparse representation techniques. Finally, the grading biomarker is combined with age and cognitive measures to provide a more accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion. Results: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the proposed global grading biomarker achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the range of 79-81% for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion within three years in tenfold cross validations. The classification AUC further increases to 84-92% when age and cognitive measures are combined with the proposed grading biomarker. Conclusion: The obtained accuracy of the proposed biomarker benefits from the contributions of different factors: a tradeoff registration level to align images to the template space, the removal of the normal aging effect, selection of discriminative voxels, the calculation of the grading biomarker using AD and normal control groups, and the integration of sparse representation technique and the combination of cognitive measures. Significance: The evaluation on the ADNI dataset shows the efficacy of the proposed biomarker and demonstrates a significant contribution in accurate prediction of MCI-to-AD con- ersion.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2549363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7445862","Alzheimer's disease (AD);biomarker;machine learning;prediction of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion;structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging","Aging;Alzheimer's disease;Biomedical imaging;Biomedical measurement;Magnetic resonance imaging;Pathology","biomedical MRI;diseases;feature selection;image registration;medical image processing","ADNI dataset;Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative;age correction;feature selection;grading biomarker;image registration accuracy;magnetic resonance images;mild cognitive impairment;sparse representation technique","","2","","","","20160401","Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
