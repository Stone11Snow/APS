In LP analysis, the generation of speech is modeled with an autoregressive (AR) random process. In fact, speech from vocal cord goes through vocal tract first, and then goes through channel. However, general LP analysis does not consider the effect of channel and the LPCCs show little robustness in speech recognition under channel distortion. In this paper, distorted speech is modeled by two different AR models which denote vocal tract and channel, respectively. After the poles are computed, K-means is used to cluster all poles and a new method is proposed to choose Channel poles. For each frame of test utterances, instead of designing a filter using channel poles, robust LPCCs are computed directly by removing channel poles from all poles. Experiment shows that this approach can obtain a better performance than general methods.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212203","Channel distortion;Feature extraction;Linear prediction;Speech recognition;Tracking","Cepstral analysis;Cybernetics;Machine learning;Nonlinear distortion;Predictive models;Robustness;Speech analysis;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Testing","autoregressive processes;filtering theory;speech recognition","K-means method;autoregressive random process;channel distortion environments;channel poles;filter design;linear prediction analysis;linear prediction cepstral Coefficients;speech processing;speech recognition","","0","","11","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this method, we make use of the classification of paraphrases and adopt different approaches to recognize paraphrases according to the types they belong to. And the key point is how to use a variety of strategies to get the semantic similarity of two sentences. As the system is mainly for question answering (QA), evaluations are conducted on a corpus of sentence pairs mainly collected from a QA system, Baidu zhidao.

Improving search result for queries of this kind is expected to make a beneficial effect on overall performance of a search engine. According to this problem we proposed a search framework composed of online and offline two cooperative parts. Offline processor is an offline ranker used to automatically extract definitive <query, page>pairs which will be seen as descriptions for corresponding pages and then given higher weights in online process to insure a better search result. <anchor text, destination page> pairs are used as candidate definitive pairs, because anchor texts can be seen as latent queries and can reply future issued queries. Above all, this framework moves the key point to offline part so it can be solved without critical limits on time and space and can meet online users' requirements. Experiment results showed that definitive results got by offline ranker can obtain 0.8647 on precision@top1 for 1400 queries on 100M URL corpus.

In order to prevent the companies run into bankruptcy, financial distress prediction has been a useful tool for distinguishing companies in financial distress from those healthy. Statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques have been widely used to deal with this issue. Many studies indicated that artificial neural networks outperform many statistical methods. However, artificial neural networks have the drawback of failing to interpret the classification results. This paper uses an artificial intelligence technique-group method of data handling technique to overcome this drawback. The sample data are collected from Taiwan listed companies in the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation. The result illustrates that the accuracy rates of classification of group method of data handling models are larger than 90% and the models of the group method of data handling obtain better accuracy than the models of discriminant analysis and logistic regression.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212590","Artificial neural network;Financial distress prediction;Group method of data handling","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Companies;Data handling;Investments;Logistics;Machine learning;Neural networks;Predictive models;Statistical analysis","data handling;financial data processing;investment;neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;stock markets","Taiwan stock exchange corporation;artificial intelligence technique;artificial neural network;creditor;data classification;data handling technique;financial distress prediction model;group method;investor;statistical method","","0","","33","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because of the complexity and uncertainty of fault and symptom, it's difficult to accurately model the relationship of them in probabilistic fault localization. Fault localization algorithm depends on the prior specified model, and the parameter and structure of model is approximate correct and often differ from the real situation. So we propose DMCA+ algorithm which has 3 features: reduce the requirement for accuracy of initial conditions; statistically learn to automatically adapt the probability distribution of fault occurrence while localizing fault; generalize the MCA+ algorithm of no feedback. The feedback learning is similar with proportional adjusting of PID control, but increment is sensitive to detection rate because little increment adjusts output too slowly and big will result in a large number of error hypotheses.

In VMI, the supplier takes the responsibility for replenishing his customers' inventories based on their consumption data, with the aim of optimizing the overall distribution and inventory costs throughout the supply chain. The objective of this IRP problem is to determine a distribution plan that minimizes average distribution and inventory costs without causing any stockout at the customers. Deterministic constant customer demand rates are assumed and therefore, a long-term cyclical approach is adopted, integrating fleet sizing, vehicle routing, and inventory management. Further, realistic side-constraints such as limited storage capacities, driving time restrictions and constant replenishment intervals are taken into account. A heuristic solution approach is proposed, analyzed and evaluated against a comparable heuristic. The heuristic solution approach is well capable of finding the appropriate cost trade-off under varying circumstances.

It will take more time to make learning convergent. In order to improve the efficiency of the convergence, we propose an algorithm to find shortcuts from episode in multi-agent reinforcement learning to speed up convergence. The loops that indicate the ineffective paths in the episode are removed, but all the shortest state paths from each other state to the goal state within the original episode are kept, that means no loss of state space knowledge when remove these loops. So the length of episode is shortened to speed up the convergence. Since a large mount of episodes are included in learning process, the overall improvement accumulated from every episode's improvement will be considerable. The episode of multi-agent pursuit problem is used to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.

Nowadays modules are often configured with bypass diodes to provide energy releasing route. Furthermore, blocking diode is connected in series before parallel connection in order to prevent inverse power injection. Based on such configurations, this paper was mainly devoted to present a simplified method for characterizing hybrid photovoltaic performance. Newton-Raphson method was adopted for numerical simulations. It was proven to be suitable and effective in model validation coinciding with manufacturer specification. Furthermore, MPP peak positions were reviewed roundly via simulations of the total characteristic curves, especially the operation mismatches caused by random shadows. Different abilities under diverse series/parallel patterns were also investigated for comparison. Researches indicate that: firstly, traditional monotone algorithms of MPPT could be invalid for detecting false maximum only; secondly, the ldquodoorsill effectrdquo of local irradiation intensities, namely that global power output might not be influenced by changes of local shadows; finally, suggestions are put forward that parallel connection should be ranked prior consideration with whole array design, to boost power output relatively.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212745","Intelligent;Mismatching loss;Numerical simulation;Performance evaluation;Photovoltaic module","Aging;Cybernetics;Diodes;Machine learning;Numerical simulation;Performance analysis;Photovoltaic cells;Photovoltaic systems;Power generation;Solar power generation","Newton-Raphson method;photovoltaic cells","Newton-Raphson method;bypass diodes;doorsill effect;hybrid behaviors analysis;inverse power injection;photovoltaic array performance;photovoltaic cells;solar irradiation","","5","","13","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In real color document images, the gray level of the background is lower than the foreground. Furthermore, some color document images, the backgrounds are in the middle of the gray level. Third, most of them do not consider the spatial characteristics. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient and effective background determination method for color document images to solve aforementioned problems. The proposal method includes following steps: First, RGB color space is transformed to gray level. Second, the boundary between the background and the foreground is determined by scan line differentiation algorithm. Third, the background and the foreground distributions in the ambit are analyzed to determine the background ranges. Finally, the document image is converted into binary image by the background ranges. This novel method is very efficient because it only analysis the border pixels in the color document image.

In this paper, incremental tensor data by facial synthesis estimating is proposed for face recognition. To make full use of the information of new input person in the tensor framework, facial expression synthesis method is used to estimate the missing tensor data. Then the new tensor is constructed, and the subspace of the new person could be constructed based on the new tensor. Thus, the tensor framework can be used to carry on face analysis of the new person, including face recognition.

The most critical operation process is sewing, as it generally involves a great number of operations. The aim of assembly line balancing planning in sewing lines is to assign task to the workstation in order that the machines of the workstation can perform the assigned tasks with a balanced loading. Assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) is known as an NP-hard problem. Thus, the heuristic methodology could be a better way to plan the sewing lines in a reasonable time. This paper presents a grouping genetic algorithm (GGA) for assembly line balancing problem of sewing lines in garment industry. GGA was first developed by Falkenauer in 1992 as a type of GA which exploits the special structure of grouping problem, and overcomes the drawbacks of GA. GGA allocates workload among machines as evenly as possible, so the minimum mean absolute deviations (MAD) can be minimized. The performance is verified through solving two real problems in garment industry. The computational results reveal that GGA outperforms GA in both simple and complex problems by 13.81% and 8.81%, respectively. This shows GGA's effectiveness in solving ALBP.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212600","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212600","Assembly Line Balancing Problem;Garment Industry;Grouping Genetic Algorithm","Assembly;Biological cells;Clothing industry;Cybernetics;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Manufacturing industries;Production;Textile industry;Workstations","assembly planning;clothing industry;genetic algorithms;sewing machines","assembly line balancing planning;garment industry;grouping genetic algorithm;minimum mean absolute deviations;sewing lines;workstation machines","","0","","10","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Dynamic Backtracking algorithm proposed by Ginsberg in 1993 is an efficient algorithm which uses backtracking integrates with constraint propagation. Now, according to the basic idea of dynamic backtracking, we put forward four implementary strategies and demonstrate that the efficiency and backtracking times of these four strategies are different. The most efficient strategy of these four strategies is the Strategy2.1, it can significantly improve the efficiency and reduce the backtracking times. Anatomizing the results of experiments, we find the differences between these four strategies, then we propose an heuristic rules to improve dynamic backtracking algorithm on selecting a variable that has not been instantiated --- Successful Assignment Principle. According to the Failure First Principle, we propose an optimization strategy that combine the Successful Assignment Principle with the Failure First Principle --- Strategy 2.4.What is more, the final test results show that efficiency of Strategy 2.4 is 1.595 ~ 2.227 times more than the that of Strategy 2.1.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212518","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212518","Constraint satisfaction problem;Dynamic backtracking","Artificial intelligence;Computer science education;Constraint optimization;Costs;Cybernetics;Heuristic algorithms;Knowledge engineering;Laboratories;Machine learning;Testing","artificial intelligence;backtracking;constraint handling;constraint theory;optimisation","artificial intelligence;constraint propagation;constraint satisfaction problem;dynamic backtracking;failure first principle;optimization strategy;searching algorithm;successful assignment principle","","2","","10","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
