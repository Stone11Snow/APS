In this paper, a keyphrase extraction approach based on the naive Bayesian classifier is proposed. To determine whether a phrase is a keyphrase, the following features of a phrase in a given document are adopted: its term frequency, whether to appear in the title, abstract and headings (subheadings), and its frequency appearing in the paragraphs of the given document. The approach is evaluated by the standard information retrieval metrics of precision and recall. Experiment results show that this approach is very practical: it can achieve high precision and recall; especially the recall it can achieve is over 80 percent","","CD-ROM:1-4244-0605-6; POD:1-4244-0604-8","10.1109/ICCIAS.2006.294249","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4072202","","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computer science;Data mining;Frequency;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Natural language processing;Text mining","Bayes methods;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","information retrieval metrics;keyphrases extraction;machine learning;naive Bayesian classifier","","0","","8","","","Nov. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally, the choice of a segmentation algorithm, or parameterization of a given algorithm, is selected at the application level and fixed for all images within that application. Our goal is to create a stand-alone method to evaluate segmentation quality. Stand-alone methods have the advantage that they do not require a manually-segmented reference image for comparison, and can therefore be used for real-time evaluation. Current stand-alone evaluation methods often work well for some types of images, but poorly for others. We propose a meta-evaluation method in which any set of base evaluation methods are combined by a machine learning algorithm that coalesces their evaluations based on a learned weighting function, which depends upon the image to be segmented. The training data used by the machine learning algorithm can be labeled by a human, based on similarity to a human-generated reference segmentation, or based upon system-level performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than the existing stand-alone segmentation evaluation methods.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-2597-0","10.1109/CVPR.2006.185","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640878","","Application software;Computer science;Computer vision;Drives;Humans;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematics;Training data","","","","3","","27","","","17-22 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents. Precision and recall for title extraction from Word is 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint is 0.875 and 0.895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language.

Power electronics inverter can be considered to be the weakest link in such a system from hardware failure point of view; hence, this work is focused on detecting faults and finding which switches in the inverter cause the faults. A simulation model has been developed based on the theoretical foundations of electric drives to simulate the normal condition, all single-switch and post-short-circuit faults. A machine learning algorithm has been developed to automatically select a set of representative operating points in the (torque, speed) domain, which in turn is sent to the simulated electric drive model to generate signals for the training of a diagnostic neural network, fault diagnostic neural network (FDNN). We validated the capability of the FDNN on data generated by an experimental bench setup.

In this paper, we introduce the gradient descent method into the learning of kernel functions. Using the gradient descent method, we can conduct learning rules of the parameters which indicate the shape and distribution of the kernel functions.

In locating process, we locate the boundaries by using the trained AdaBoosted histogram classifiers. The novelty of our approach is that we use AdaBoost in the training process to learn diverse intensity distributions of the tumor regions, and utilize the trained results successfully in locating process. Experimental results show our approach locates the boundaries successfully, despite the diverse intensity distributions of the tumor regions, marker location variability and tumor region shape variability.

Classification is understood as the act of placing an object into a set of categories, based on the object's properties; classification algorithms are designed to learn a function which maps a vector of object features into one of several classes. This is done by analyzing a set of input-output examples (""training samples"") of the function. Here we present a method based on the theory of genetic algorithms and genetic programming that interprets classification problems as optimization problems: Each presented instance of the classification problem is interpreted as an instance of an optimization problem, and a solution is found by a heuristic optimization algorithm. The major new aspects presented in this paper are suitable genetic operators for this problem class (mainly the creation of new hypotheses by merging already existing ones and their detailed evaluation) we have designed and implemented.

On the one hand, perceptual learning is more and more studied in neurobiology and is now considered as an essential part of any living system. In fact, perceptual learning and cognitive learning are both necessary for learning and often depend on each other. On the other hand, many works in machine learning are concerned with ""abstraction"" in order to reduce the amount of complexity related to some learning tasks. In the abstraction framework, perceptual learning can be seen as a specific process that learns how to transform the data before the traditional learning task itself takes place. In this paper, we argue that biologically inspired perceptual learning mechanisms could be used to build efficient low-level abstraction operators that deal with real-world data. To illustrate this, we present an application where perceptual-learning-inspired metaoperators are used to perform an abstraction on an autonomous robot visual perception. The goal of this work is to enable the robot to learn how to identify objects it encounters in its environment.","1094-6977;10946977","","10.1109/TSMCC.2006.871139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1624543","Abstraction;feature selection;machine learning;perceptual learning;real-world data","Animals;Artificial intelligence;Computers;Humans;Information processing;Intelligent robots;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Visual perception","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;visual perception","abstraction operator;artificial intelligence;autonomous robot;cognitive learning;machine learning;neurobiology;object identification;perceptual learning;visual perception","","5","","35","","","March 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The simple approach to generating the uniform data suffers from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we (1) describe the reduction of MV-set estimation to NP classification, (2) devise improved methods for generating artificial uniform data for the two-class approach, (3) advocate a new performance measure for systematic comparison of MV-set algorithms, and (4) establish a set of benchmark experiments to serve as a point of reference for future MV-set algorithms.

However, for some images with difficult environmental conditions like a foggy or cloudy sky these image processing methods are inherently inaccurate in identifying the correct horizon. This paper investigates how to detect the horizon line in a set of images using a machine learning approach.

Thus, we propose a new multi-class classification method based on support vector domain description (SVDD) that can learn incrementally by using just one class data for training a added person. The proposed method can reduce training time and computational load by avoiding the repeated use of data. To verify the performance of the proposed method, experiments are carried out in comparison with three other methods: one-against-all, one-against-all and neural network.

The threshold width of the activation function is automatically determined from the image characteristics. The approach promotes log-domain computation to eliminate all multiplications and divisions, utilizing approximation techniques for efficient estimation of the log2 and inverse-log2. The design incorporates the dynamic thresholds of the activation functions and update rate. The improved quadrant symmetric architecture is also presented to provide very high throughput rate for homomorphic filters which is part of the pixel intensity enhancement across RGB components in the system. The pipelined design of the filter features the flexibility in reloading a wide range of kernels for different frequency responses. A new approach for the design of the uniform filters is also presented to reduce the processing element arrays (PEAs) from W PEAs to 2 PEAs for W times W window. This new concept is applied to assist in training the synaptic weights of the neural network for color balancing to restore the intensity enhanced image to its natural color existed in the original image. The concept of uniform filter is further extended to design max/min filters. It is observed that the performance of the system with parallel and pipelined architectures is able to achieve 139.3 million outputs per second (MOPS), or equivalently 54.7 billion operations per second on Xilinx's Virtex II XC2V2000-4ff896 FPGA at a clock frequency of 139.3 MHz.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9490-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716067","","Color;Computer architecture;Filters;Frequency;Hardware;Kernel;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Throughput","approximation theory;filtering theory;frequency response;image colour analysis;image enhancement;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","FPGA;RGB components;Virtex XC2V2000-4ff896;activation function;adaptive parameterization;approximation techniques;clock frequency;color balancing;color image enhancement;frequency responses;hardware architecture;homomorphic filters;log-domain computation;machine learning approach;pixel intensity enhancement;processing element arrays;quadrant symmetric architecture;ratio rule","","2","1","12","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These values are compared with the circuit outputs in the fault free case. Each sequence of values is a clue to the existence of a specific fault in the circuit. However, many faults can be detected just by applying some subset of the test vectors. Adaptive experiments apply a test vector based on the results of applying the previous test vectors. Thus, they are more efficient. But, creation of adaptive experiments is done manually, and has not been automated so far. Thus, the process is time consuming, difficult, and error-prone.

Such translations are important because they afford learners and educators with the opportunity to a survey a wide selection of learning and teaching material. For instance, university instructors are sometimes required to assess curriculum from courses delivered from other programs or universities, even internationally. Often, the only learning object available to do so is the course outline made available in HTML format on a Web page. Generally there is an abundance of metadata available from such learning objects and this information can be used to generate useful components of the ontology. Other useful information can be derived from first establishing the domain of the object, electricity and computing for instance, or possibly history. Once extracted, the information representing learning objects can be stored as elements in an XML template. The purpose of this work was to develop and implement a machine learning strategy for classifying course outlines into pre-defined domains and sub-domains in order to provide this information to an ontology repository designed to aid in the translation of such objects. First some typical domains were identified. Then, 20-30 course outlines were chosen to represent each sub-domain. Next, frequency tables of words common to the course outlines for a given sub-domain were generated in order to compile an ordered list of synonyms used to represent the sub-domains.

In effect, a machine becomes smarter after gaining added knowledge from training. Our paper details the design of an incremental ML component of a ubiquitous multimodal multimedia computing system. Our system chooses the media and modalities that are appropriate for the user situation; the situation itself is based upon user's context, user's profile and the user's environment and hardware profile. The user context itself is dependent on the user's location, the noise level in the workplace and the presence or absence of other people in the vicinity, and the user's computing device. If applicable, the user's special need (i.e. handicap) is also taken into consideration in the media and modality selection.

Clinicians routinely rely on the results from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to discriminate bacterial from viral meningitis. Tests such as the CSF Gram stain performed prior to broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment yield sensitivities between 60 and 92%. Sensitivity can be increased by performing additional laboratory testing, but the results are never completely accurate and are not cost effective in many cases. In this study, we wished to determine if a machine learning approach, based on rough sets and a probabilistic neural network could be used to differentiate between viral and bacterial meningitis. We analysed a clinical dataset containing records for 581 cases of acute bacterial or viral meningitis. The rough sets approach was used to perform dimensionality reduction in addition to classification. The results were validated using a probabilistic neural network.

While the test error probability of these methods is rather low, it is still considered prohibitive for accurate production testing. In this paper, we demonstrate how to minimize this test error probability and, thus, how to bridge the accuracy of functional and machine-learning-based test methods. The underlying idea is to measure the confidence of the machine-learning-based test decision and retest the small fraction of circuits for which this confidence is low via standard functional test. Through this approach, the majority of circuits are tested using fast machine-learning-based tests, which, nevertheless, are equivalent to the standard functional ones with regards to test error probability.

To assure that the specified polices reflect the expected ones, recent research has developed policy verification tools; however, their applications in practice are still limited, being constrained by the limited set of supported policy language features and the unavailability of policy properties. This paper presents a data-mining approach to the problem of verifying that expressed access-control policies reflect the true desires of the policy author. We developed a tool to investigate this approach by automatically generating requests, evaluating those requests to get responses, and applying machine learning on the request-response pairs to infer policy properties. These inferred properties facilitate the inspection of the policy behavior. We applied our tool on an access-control policy of a central grades repository system for a university.

The learning module also monitors the present operating condition and, in response to abrupt changes, restores past coefficients that were successful under similar conditions. Successful coefficient settings are stored in a list that is indexed using a multi-dimensional attribute vector derived from the measured operating condition.

These errors commonly arise from an inability to sequence through peak height variations in DNA sequencing traces from the Sanger sequencing method. Recent efforts toward improving basecalling accuracy have taken the form of more sophisticated digital filters and feature detectors. We demonstrate that the variation in peak heights itself encodes novel information which can be used for basecalling. To isolate this information for a clear demonstration, we perform a peculiar blind basecalling experiment using ABI processed output. Using classifiers responding to measurements in the context of the basecalling position, we call bases without reference to the peak heights at the basecalling position itself. Tree classifiers indicate which features are pertinent, and the application of neural nets to these features results in a startlingly high initial success rate of 78%.

This technique has been applied on two real pattern recognition problems: (1) breast cancer data set to classify tumors as benign or malignant; (2) wine data set to classify wines in one of the three different cultivators from which they could be derived.

To solve this optimization problem, this study along investigating utilization of support vector machines (SVM) for fixture optimization, presents a hybrid method that uses finite element analysis (FEA) with a supportive combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). A frictional model of workpiece-fixture system under cutting and clamping forces is solved through FEA. The results of this analysis are used for training and querying SVM and ANN where they are required to recognize a pattern between the clamping forces and state of contact in the workpiece-fixture system and workpiece maximum elastic deformation. Using the identified pattern a GA based program determines the optimum values for clamping forces that do not cause excessive deformation or stress in the component.

Second, a newly designed sliding mode voltage model flux observer (SMVMFO) is incorporated in the drive system to estimate the flux. The proposed SMVMFO is not sensitive to the stator resistance variation which has been a long standing problem in the area of motor drives. Also, it does not require the voltage signal information thus eliminating the need for a voltage sensor. The proposed drive system exhibits better performance because the FMRLC achieves adequate control performance with high-band width speed control and the flux observer guarantees the machines' field orientation thus overcoming the problems of any alteration in the transformation.

The precision and speed of the classification are important research issues in fault pattern recognition for this kind of intelligent fault diagnosis. Although many improved ANN (artificial neural net) methods have been proposed for this purpose, most approaches focus only on the classification precision, instead of the computing speed. In this paper, a SVM model for fault diagnosis is introduced and analyzed about its limitation from sensibility to noisy data. To address this problem, we introduce the PCA (principal component analysis) method to reduce the dimension of the sample set and de-noise data sampled from the machine. Furthermore, for the whole real-time data processing and fault pattern recognition, a kind of wavelet packet analysis is applied to translate the field sensor signal in time-spectrum into the energy value in frequency-spectrum corresponding frequency segments real-timely. Therefore we present a new machine learning method: PSVM (primary component analysis support vector machine) method based on wavelet packet analysis in the fault diagnosis field. And this improved method particularly betters the precision and computing speed of the classification then other typical networks. And also the whole processing workflow is illustrated in details.

In this context, the data associated with one class are far fewer than those associated with the other class. Traditional machine learning methods seeking classification accuracy over a full range of instances are not suitable to deal with this problem, since they tend to classify all the data into a majority class, usually the less important class. In this correspondence, the authors describe a new approach named the biased minimax probability machine (BMPM) to deal with the problem of imbalanced learning. This BMPM model is demonstrated to provide an elegant and systematic way for imbalanced learning. More specifically, by controlling the accuracy of the majority class under all possible choices of class-conditional densities with a given mean and covariance matrix, this model can quantitatively and systematically incorporate a bias for the minority class. By establishing an explicit connection between the classification accuracy and the bias, this approach distinguishes itself from the many current imbalanced-learning methods; these methods often impose a certain bias on the minority data by adapting intermediate factors via the trial-and-error procedure. The authors detail the theoretical foundation, prove its solvability, propose an efficient optimization algorithm, and perform a series of experiments to evaluate the novel model.

To improve the generalization ability and efficiency of the classification, from the extracted regional features, a hybrid feature selection method is utilized to select the most discriminative features, which are used to train a SVM classifier for decoding brain states from fMRI images. The performance of this method is validated in a deception fMRI study. The proposed method yielded better results compared to other commonly used fMRI image classification methods.","2160-7508;21607508","POD:0-7695-2646-2","10.1109/CVPRW.2006.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640530","","Data mining;Decoding;Feature extraction;Image classification;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Training data","","","","7","2","26","","","17-22 June 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning is done by an analysis of certain static and dynamic attributes of the processes while they are being run. Our objective was to discover the most important static and dynamic attributes of the processes that can help best in prediction of CPU burst times which minimize the process TaT (Turn-around-Time). In our experimentation we modify the Linux Kernel scheduler (version 2.4.20-8) to allow scheduling with customized time slices. The ""Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis"" (Weka), an open source machine-learning tool is used to find the most suitable ML method to characterize our programs. We experimentally find that the C'4.5 Decision Tree algorithm most effectively solved the problem. We find that predictive scheduling could reduce TaT in the range of 1.4% to 5.8%. This was due to a reduction in the number of context switches needed to complete the process execution. We find our result interesting in the context that generally operating systems presently never make use of a program's previous execution history in their scheduling behavior.","2159-3442;21593442","CD-ROM:0-7803-9312-0; POD:0-7803-9311-2","10.1109/TENCON.2005.300837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4085157","","Decision trees;Genetic algorithms;History;Kernel;Linux;Machine learning;Operating systems;Processor scheduling;Space exploration;Switches","Linux;learning (artificial intelligence)","CPU time-slice utilization behaviour;Linux kernel scheduler;Linux process scheduling;TaT;machine learning techniques;operating systems;turn-around-time","","1","5","16","","","21-24 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results are very promising. Compared with Polygraph, the state of the art in polymorphic worm fingerprinting, several machine learning algorithms are able to generate more accurate signatures, tolerate more noise in the training data and require much shorter training time.

Furthermore, PROFILASE implements additional scoring considerations, more biological in nature, thus further exploits domain expertise. We tested our system against a standard bottom-up algorithm by reconstruction of time series sparsely sampled with noise from simulated profiles.

In our genetic rule selection scheme, first a large number of promising fuzzy rules are extracted from numerical data in a heuristic manner as candidate rules. Then a genetic algorithm is used to select a small number of fuzzy rules. A rule set is represented by a binary string whose length is equal to the number of candidate rules. On the other hand, a fuzzy rule is denoted by its antecedent fuzzy sets as an integer substring in our GBML scheme. A rule set is represented by a concatenated integer string. In this paper, we compare these two schemes in terms of their search ability to efficiently find compact fuzzy rule-based classification systems with high accuracy. The main difference between these two schemes is that GBML has a huge search space consisting of all combinations of possible fuzzy rules while genetic rule selection has a much smaller search space with only candidate rules","","CD-ROM:0-7803-9719-3; POD:0-7803-9718-5","10.1109/ISEFS.2006.251148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4016712","","Algorithm design and analysis;Concatenated codes;Data mining;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Knowledge based systems;Machine learning;System testing","fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;search problems","binary string;fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;fuzzy rule extraction;fuzzy rule-based classification system design;fuzzy sets;genetic algorithm;genetic fuzzy rule selection;integer substring;rule set;search ability","","0","","31","","","Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Organization of images in such a database (DB) is well defined with predefined semantic categories; hence, it can be useful for category-specific searching. The proposed framework consists of machine learning methods for image prefiltering, similarity matching using statistical distance measures, and a relevance feedback (RF) scheme. To narrow down the semantic gap and increase the retrieval efficiency, we investigate both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to associate low-level global image features (e.g., color, texture, and edge) in the projected PCA-based eigenspace with their high-level semantic and visual categories. Specially, we explore the use of a probabilistic multiclass support vector machine (SVM) and fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering for categorization and prefiltering of images to reduce the search space. A category-specific statistical similarity matching is proposed in a finer level on the prefiltered images. To incorporate a better perception subjectivity, an RF mechanism is also added to update the query parameters dynamically and adjust the proposed matching functions. Experiments are based on a ground-truth DB consisting of 5000 diverse medical images of 20 predefined categories. Analysis of results based on cross-validation (CV) accuracy and precision-recall for image categorization and retrieval is reported.

Contrary to such approaches, we advocate proactively detecting and identifying botnets prior to their being used as part of a cyber-attack (Strayer et al., 2006). In this paper, we present our work on using machine learning-based classification techniques to identify the command and control (C2) traffic of IRC-based botnets - compromised hosts that are collectively commanded using Internet relay chat (IRC). We split this task into two stages: (I) distinguishing between IRC and non-IRC traffic, and (II) distinguishing between botnet and real IRC traffic. For stage I, we compare the performance of J48, naive Bayes, and Bayesian network classifiers, identify the features that achieve good overall classification accuracy, and determine the classification sensitivity to the training set size. While sensitive to the training data and the attributes used to characterize communication flows, machine learning-based classifiers show promise in identifying IRC traffic. Using classification in stage II is trickier, since accurately labeling IRC traffic as botnet and non-botnet is challenging.

Business applications and problems of medical diagnosis are prominent examples and pattern recognitions techniques are routinely used to support decision making within these fields. In particular, support vector machines (SVMs) have been successfully applied, e.g. to evaluate customer credit worthiness in credit scoring or detect tumorous cells in bio-molecular data analysis. However, ordinary SVMs minimize a continuous approximation for the classification error giving similar importance to each error type. While several modifications have been proposed to make SVMs cost-sensitive the impact of the approximate error measurement is normally not considered. Recently, Orsenigo and Vercellis introduced a discrete SVM (DSVM) formulation [1] that minimize mis-classification errors directly and overcomes possible limitations of an error proxy. For example, DSVM facilitates explicit cost minimization so that this technique is a promising candidate for cost-sensitive learning. Consequently, we compare DSVM with a standard procedure for cost-sensitive SVMs and investigate to what extent improvements in terms of mis-classification costs are achievable. While the standard SVM performs remarkably well DSVM is found to give yet superior results.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9490-9","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716113","","Bioinformatics;Biomedical imaging;Costs;Decision making;Machine learning;Medical diagnosis;Medical diagnostic imaging;Pattern recognition;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM;classification analysis;cost-sensitive learning;discrete support vector machine","","1","","43","","","0-0 0","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
