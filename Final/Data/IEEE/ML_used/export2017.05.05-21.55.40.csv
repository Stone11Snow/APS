Educational data mining has been a fertile subject of research in recent times; further, the use of educational data mining has become popular among both researchers and practitioners. Log files generated by computer-based learning environments like Intelligent Tutoring Systems contain a wealth of information about learner behaviors that characterize academic success. There is growing interest in mining these data sources for knowledge-based discovery to reveal relevant, meaningful, and useful educational information to illuminate our understanding of learners' behaviors and outcomes. All too often however, extracting the pertinent information from the data to leverage the data mining techniques can be a major roadblock; for example, the asynchronous nature of the data logged in computer-based learning environments and data mining tools pose several challenges for mining data. We sought to mitigate this by developing a parser for the BioWorld System. In this paper, we explore the viability of a hand-coded parser by presenting BioWorldParser (a suite of scripts), which was developed to parse and retrieve data from raw log files generated by the BioWorld system, to help leverage educational data mining techniques in the context of an Intelligent Tutoring System for the medical domain.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6876-3; POD:978-1-4799-6877-0","10.1109/MITE.2014.7020236","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020236","clinical reasoning;computer-based learning environments;data mining;intelligent tutoring systems;machine learning;medical education;parsers","Artificial intelligence;Cognition;Context;Data mining;Educational institutions;Medical diagnostic imaging","data mining;database management systems;grammars;intelligent tutoring systems","BioWorldParser;computer-based learning environment;educational data mining technique;educational information;educational mining technique;hand-coded parser;intelligent tutoring system;knowledge-based discovery;large-scale educational database;pertinent information","","2","","11","","","19-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we are principally concerned with adaptive systems that operate in environments where data arrives sequentially and is multivariate in nature, for example, sensory streams in robotic systems. We contribute two reservoir inspired methods: 1) the online echostate Gaussian process (OESGP) and 2) its infinite variant, the online infinite echostate Gaussian process (OIESGP) Both algorithms are iterative fixed-budget methods that learn from noisy time series. In particular, the OESGP combines the echo-state network with Bayesian online learning for Gaussian processes. Extending this to infinite reservoirs yields the OIESGP, which uses a novel recursive kernel with automatic relevance determination that enables spatial and temporal feature weighting. When fused with stochastic natural gradient descent, the kernel hyperparameters are iteratively adapted to better model the target system. Furthermore, insights into the underlying system can be gleamed from inspection of the resulting hyperparameters. Experiments on noisy benchmark problems (one-step prediction and system identification) demonstrate that our methods yield high accuracies relative to state-of-the-art methods, and standard kernels with sliding windows, particularly on problems with irrelevant dimensions. In addition, we describe two case studies in robotic learning-by-demonstration involving the Nao humanoid robot and the Assistive Robot Transport for Youngsters (ARTY) smart wheelchair.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2316291","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6832616","Gaussian processes (GPs);machine learning;recurrent neural networks (RNNs);time-series analysis;time-series analysis.","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;Kernel;Reservoirs;Robots;Standards;Training","Gaussian processes;belief networks;control engineering computing;gradient methods;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;recurrent neural nets;time series","ARTY smart wheelchair;Bayesian online learning;Nao humanoid robot;OIESGP;adaptive systems;assistive robot transport for youngsters smart wheelchair;automatic relevance determination;biological systems;echo-state network;infinite reservoirs;infinite variant;iterative fixed-budget methods;kernel hyperparameters;noisy benchmark problems;noisy time series;one-step prediction;online infinite echostate Gaussian process;recursive kernel;reservoir inspired methods;robotic learning-by-demonstration;robotic systems;sensory streams;sliding windows;spatial feature weighting;spatio-temporal learning;standard kernels;stochastic natural gradient descent;system identification;temporal feature weighting","0","5","","50","","20140612","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The novelties of the paper are: the extension of an already developed method to coarse resolution data (150 m) in mountain environment with high land heterogeneity, with only VV polarization and the proper selection of input features. During the result analysis, several algorithm characteristics were clearly identified: 1) the performances showed to be strongly related to input features such as topography and vegetation indices; 2) the algorithm needs a training phase; 3) the averaging window needs to be proper selected to take into account both the speckle noise and the characteristics of the area under investigation; and 4) the algorithm, being data driven, can be considered as site dependent. The experimental analysis is carried out on images acquired over the Südtirol/Alto Adige Province in Italy during 2010-2011 from the RADARSAT2 and Envisat ASAR in Wide Swath mode. SMC maps were compared with spatially distributed ground measurements, resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) value ranging from 0.045 to 0.07 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>. Concerning the multiscale analysis, the results indicated that RADARSAT2 maps are able to detect the spatial heterogeneity and soil moisture dynamics at local scale, while ASAR WS SMC maps are able to identify mainly the two main classes of pasture and meadows. When these estimates are compared with SMC values from meteorological stations a RMSE value of 0.10 m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> for both satellites indicated a reduced capability to follow the temporal dynamics.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2378795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005430","Machine learning;SAR images;Terms¿¿¿Machine learning;soil moisture","Remote sensing;Satellites;Sensors;Soil measurements;Soil moisture;Synthetic aperture radar","hydrological techniques;moisture;moisture measurement;regression analysis;remote sensing by radar;soil;support vector machines;synthetic aperture radar;vegetation mapping","AD 2010 to 2011;ASAR WS SMC maps;C-band;Envisat ASAR;Italy;RADARSAT2 maps;SVR technique;Wide Swath mode;mountain areas;multiscale active radar images;root mean squared error value;soil moisture estimation;vegetation indices","","5","","62","","20150109","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With our solution we want to go a step further to the existing GPS navigation systems by designing a mechanism that is capable to learn driver's routes. We could offer in the future a point-to-point concept for an environmentally friendly routing mechanism anywhere within a selected road network based on our HMM-method and a training process. Our study is based on real data collected from various local drivers and can be easily applied in modern intelligent traffic systems. The system comes with a user interface that displays the GPS routes on the map for a specific driver. These routes can be analyzed using parameters like time, distance, height and speed.

Link quality estimation is critical for many WSN applications because it drastically influences the success of transmissions. In this paper we resort to machine learning methods to predict the short term evolution of link quality, in order to switch the data transmission on a better quality link. The problem is modeled as a game of prediction based on experts advice, using the Link-Quality Indicator (LQI) metric. A decision maker, called forecaster, advised by several experts, predicts the LQI values. The forecaster is able to learn how to adapt its strategy to predict values as close as possible to real LQI values. The proposed learning and prediction model presents a great flexibility: it is a general model that can be easily adapted to different link-quality metrics or prediction methods.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3512-3; POD:978-1-4799-3513-0; USB:978-1-4799-3511-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036979","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036979","LQI;WSN;expert;exponential weighted average;forecaster;link quality;machine learning;prediction","Adaptation models;Games;Measurement;Predictive models;Reliability;Wireless sensor networks","data communication;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;wireless sensor networks","LQI;data transmission;decision maker forecaster;link quality estimation;link quality indicator;link quality prediction;machine learning;on-line learning;short term evolution;wireless sensor networks","","1","","12","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For computing the crowd SCD variation effectively, we then design a robust multi-object tracker to associate the targets in different frames, which employs the incremental analytical ability of the 3-D discrete cosine transform (DCT). By online spatial-temporal analyzing the SCD variation of the crowd, the abnormality is finally localized. Our contribution mainly lies on three aspects: 1) the new exploration of abnormal detection from structure modeling where the motion difference between individuals is computed by a novel selective histogram of optical flow that makes the proposed method can deal with more kinds of anomalies; 2) the SCD description that can effectively represent the relationship among the individuals; and 3) the 3-D DCT multi-object tracker that can robustly associate the limited number of (instead of all) targets which makes the tracking analysis in high density crowd situation feasible.

One of the effective approaches for saving energy in a cluster environment is workload consolidation. However, it is challenging to address this schedule problem as it requires the understanding of various cost factors. One of the important factors is the estimation of power consumption. Power models used in most of workload schedule solutions are a linear function of resource features, but we analysed the measurement data from our cluster and found the resource loads, in particular I/O load, had no convincing linear-correlation with power consumption. Based on measurement data sets from our cluster, we propose multiple non-linear machine learning approaches to estimate power consumption of an entire node using OS-reported resource features. We evaluate the accuracy, portability and usability of the linear and non-linear approaches. Our work shows the multiple-variable linear regression approach is more precise than the CPU only linear approach. The neural network approaches have a slight advantage - its mean root mean square error is at most 15% less than that of the multiple-variable linear approach. But the neural network models have worse portability when the models generated on a node are applied on its homogeneous nodes. Gaussian Mixture Model has the highest accuracy on Hadoop nodes but requires the longest training time.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6177-1; POD:978-1-4799-6178-8","10.1109/IGCC.2014.7039145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7039145","Energy Monitoring;Machine learning;Power Model;Workload Characterization","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Estimation;Google;Neurons;Power demand;Training","Gaussian processes;computer centres;input-output programs;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;mixture models;neural nets;power aware computing;regression analysis;scheduling;software portability","Gaussian mixture Model;Hadoop nodes;I/O load;OS-reported resource features;accuracy evaluation;carbon dioxide emissions;cloud applications;computing cluster;cooling;cost factors;data centers;energy cost;energy saving;grid applications;mean root mean square error;measurement data sets;multiple nonlinear machine learning approaches;multiple-variable linear regression approach;neural network approaches;portability evaluation;power consumption estimation;power distribution;power estimation approaches;power models;source loads;training time;usability evaluation;workload consolidation;workload schedule","","0","","29","","","3-5 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our novel DSLR system comprises two main subsystems: an image processing (IP) module and a stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG) module. Our IP module enables us to recognize the individual words of the sign language (i.e., a single gesture). In this module, we used the bag-of-features (BOFs) and a local part model approach for bare hand dynamic gesture recognition from a video. We used dense sampling to extract local 3-D multiscale whole-part features. We adopted 3-D histograms of a gradient orientation descriptor to represent features. The k-means++ method was applied to cluster the visual words. Dynamic hand gesture classification was conducted using the BOFs and nonlinear support vector machine methods. We used a multiscale local part model to preserve temporal context. The SLFG module analyzes the sentences of the sign language (i.e., sequences of gestures) and determines whether or not they are syntactically valid. Therefore, the DSLR system is not only able to rule out ungrammatical sentences, but it can also make predictions about missing gestures, which, in turn, increases the accuracy of our recognition task. Our IP module alone seals the accuracy of 97% and outperforms any existing bare hand dynamic gesture recognition system. However, by exploiting syntactic pattern recognition, the SLFG module raises this accuracy by 1.65%. This makes the aggregate performance of the DSLR system as accurate as 98.65%.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2014.2351331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894169","Dynamic hand gesture;dynamic sign language;formal languages;image processing (IP);local part model;machine learning;stochastic linear formal grammar (SLFG);syntactic pattern recognition","Accuracy;Assistive technology;Feature extraction;Gesture recognition;Grammar;IP networks;Testing","feature extraction;grammars;home automation;human computer interaction;image classification;image sampling;interactive systems;sign language recognition;support vector machines","3D histograms;BOF;DSLR system;IP module;SLFG module;bag-of-features;bare hand dynamic gesture recognition;dense sampling;dynamic hand gesture classification;dynamic sign language recognition system;feature representation;gradient orientation descriptor;image processing module;k-means++ method;local 3D multiscale whole-part feature extraction;local part model approach;multiscale local part model;nonlinear support vector machine methods;sign language individual words recognition;smart home interactive applications;stochastic linear formal grammar module;syntactic pattern recognition;temporal context preservation;visual word clustering","","7","","35","","20140908","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Having information about network traffic has many benefits in network design, security, management, and accounting. The classification of network traffic is most easily achieved by Machine Learning algorithms, which can automatically build a model from training data, without much input from humans. Artificial Immune System classification algorithms have been used previously to classify network connections in network security systems [1]. They have proven to be very versatile, as well as having low sensitivity to input parameters. Because of this we are encouraged to explore the value of AIS algorithms to the Internet traffic classification problem. In this research, we propose an AIS-inspired algorithm for flow-based traffic classification, where each network flow is classified into an application class. We measure the algorithm's performance with and without the use of kernel functions, using a publicly available data set. We also compare the algorithm's performance with SVM and Naive Bayes classifiers. The algorithm generalizes well and gives high accuracy even with a small training set when compared to other algorithms, although the training and classification times were higher. The algorithm is also insensitive to the use of kernels, which makes it attractive for embedded and IoT applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4093-6; POD:978-1-4799-4092-9; USB:978-1-4799-4094-3","10.1109/CloudCom.2014.108","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037733","artificial immune systems;internet traffic classification;machine learning;multi-class classification","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Immune system;Kernel;Sociology;Statistics;Training","Bayes methods;Internet;artificial immune systems;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Naive Bayes classifiers;SVM;artificial immune system inspired algorithm;business world;flow based Internet traffic classification;kernel functions;machine learning algorithms;network security systems;support vector machines","","2","","17","","","15-18 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is well-known that there is a negative correlation between a hunger degree and a blood glucose level. However, it is hard to measure a person's blood glucose level anytime and anywhere, because it relies usually on an invasive method (e.g., blood sampling). This paper proposes a method for estimating a person's hunger degree in a non-invasive way. Our proposed method is composed of (1) a blood glucose level estimation model based on logs of meals and exercises, and (2) a hunger degree estimation model based on the estimated glucose level. The former model is constructed by correlating an actual blood glucose level and logs of meals and exercises with a machine learning technique. Here, the actual blood glucose level is measured by a commercial blood glucose meter invasively. The latter model is constructed by associating the measured blood glucose level with a subjective hunger degree. We also design and develop a mobile application for facilitating a user to easily record meals and exercises information. Through an experiment with a subject, we confirmed that our system can estimate a blood glucose level within about 14% mean percentage error and finally estimate hunger degree within about 1.3 levels mean error among 10 levels.","","Electronic:978-1-63190-014-3; POD:978-1-4799-5024-9; USB:978-1-63190-013-6","10.1109/MOBIHEALTH.2014.7015896","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015896","blood glucose level estimation;hunger degree estimation;machine learning;meal and exercise information;mobile application;non-invasive method","Blood;Correlation;Estimation;Mathematical model;Mobile communication;Obesity;Sugar","biomedical measurement;blood;learning (artificial intelligence);sugar","actual blood glucose level;blood glucose level estimation model;blood glucose meter;exercise logs;hunger degree estimation method;machine learning technique;meal logs","","0","","10","","","3-5 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent years, more and more studies have devoted to find effective machine learning models to identify traffics with the few packets at the early stage. In this paper, we design a Hierarchical Radial Basis Function network (HRBF) model based on our previous works, and then we apply the HRBF model for early stage traffic identification. Three network traffic data sets including two open data sets are used for the study, and six widely used classifiers are employed as the comparing methods in the identification experiments. Accuracy and area under curve (AUC) are applied to evaluate the performances of compared methods. HRBF outperforms the other methods for most cases in the identification experiments, and it behaves very well for both of accuracy and AUC. Thus, HRBF is effective for early stage traffic identification.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7981-3; POD:978-1-4799-7982-0","10.1109/CSE.2014.231","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023741","Early stage traffic identification;Hierarchical RBF neural networks;Machine learning","Feature extraction;Internet;Ports (Computers);Radial basis function networks;Sociology;Statistics;Vectors","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;telecommunication traffic","area under curve;early stage Internet traffic identification;hierarchical RBF neural network;machine learning;network management;network security;network traffic;radial basis function network","","0","","33","","","19-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When providing an LBS for the latter, motion models and the information provided from motion sensors are commonly used to reduce the error in the localization, but this information is not always available. In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate the position of a moving device using a topological radio-map designed for static WiFi localization in a previous work. This approach uses a Bayes filter that continuously estimates the most likely position of the device. This filter will have to deal with the low working frequency of the device and the uncertainty of the observation to provide an accurate and fast estimation.

We believe this problem is because those frequently used traditional machine learning techniques exploit shallow architectures, which only contain one single layer of nonlinear feature transformation, and thus cannot highly mimic the mechanism of human visual perception to image quality. The recent advance of deep neural network (DNN) can help to solve this problem, since the DNN is found to better capture the essential attributes of images. We in this paper therefore introduce a new Deep learning based Image Quality Index (DIQI) for blind quality assessment.

The transcoder is built around an established two-stage transcoding. In the first stage, called the training stage, full re-encoding is performed while the H.264/AVC and the HEVC information are gathered. This information is then used to build both the CU classification model and the early termination sieves, that are used in the second stage (called the transcoding stage). The solution is tested with well-known video sequences and evaluated in terms of RD and complexity. The proposed method is 3.83 times faster, on average, than the trivial transcoder, and 1.8 times faster than a previous transcoding solution, while yielding a RD loss of 4% compared to this solution.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-5751-4; POD:978-1-4799-5752-1","10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7025512","HEVC;Transcoding;early termination;machine learning","Bit rate;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Training;Transcoding;Video coding","learning (artificial intelligence);transcoding;video coding","HEVC bitstreams;coding unit classification module;content modeling;early termination;fast HEVC transcoder;machine learning technique;two-stage transcoding;video sequences","","4","","25","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These defective modules in the software pose considerable risk by increasing the developing cost and decreasing the customer satisfaction. Hence in a software development life cycle it is very important to predict the faulty modules in the software product. Prediction of the defective modules should be done as early as possible so as to improve software developers' ability to identify the defect-prone modules and focus quality assurance activities such as testing and inspections on those defective modules. For quality assurance activity, it is important to concentrate on the software metrics. Software metrics play a vital role in measuring the quality of software. Many researchers focused on classification algorithm for predicting the software defect. On the other hand, classifiers ensemble can effectively improve classification performance when compared with a single classifier. This paper mainly addresses using ensemble approach of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for fault prediction. Ensemble classifier was examined for Eclipse Package level dataset and NASA KC1 dataset.

In this paper, we present a fully dynamic multi-learners approach for automated and online QoS modeling in the cloud. We contribute to a hybrid learners solution, which improves accuracy while keeping model complexity adequate. To determine the inputs of QoS model at runtime, we partition the inputs space into two sub-spaces, each of which applies different symmetric uncertainty based selection techniques, and we then combine the sub-spaces results. The learners are also adaptive, they simultaneously allow several machine learning algorithms to model QoS function and dynamically select the best model for prediction on the fly.

In this paper we will present an overall explanation of the recommendation system and compare the features of different types of recommendation systems and try to figure out that which type of recommendation technique gives optimum results in library and information services.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5531-2; Electronic:978-1-4799-5532-9; POD:978-1-4799-5533-6","10.1109/ETTLIS.2015.7048218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048218","Artificial Intelligence;E-Commerce;Information Filtering;Information Retrieval;Library and Information Science;Machine Learning;Recommendation System","Accuracy;Collaboration;Libraries;Recommender systems;Vectors","Web sites;consumer behaviour;electronic commerce;libraries;mouse controllers (computers);recommender systems","Website;comparative analysis;e-commerce industry;information services;library;mouse;recommendation system;user buying behavior","","0","","21","","","6-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Toward an Ultralow-Power Onboard Processor for Tongue Drive System","S. Viseh; M. Ghovanloo; T. Mohsenin","Univ. of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA","IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","20150209","2015","62","2","174","178","The Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a new unobtrusive, wireless, and wearable assistive device that allows for real-time tracking of the voluntary tongue motion in the oral space for communication, control, and navigation applications. The latest TDS prototype appears as a wireless headphone and has been tested in human subject trials. However, the robustness of the external TDS (eTDS) in real-life outdoor conditions may not meet safety regulations because of the limited mechanical stability of the headset. The intraoral TDS (iTDS), which is in the shape of a dental retainer, firmly clasps to the upper teeth and resists sensor misplacement. However, the iTDS has more restrictions on its dimensions, limiting the battery size and consequently requiring a considerable reduction in its power consumption to operate over an extended period of two days on a single charge. In this brief, we propose an ultralow-power local processor for the TDS that performs all signal processing on the transmitter side, following the sensors. Assuming the TDS user on average issuing one command/s, implementing the computational engine reduces the data volume that needs to be wirelessly transmitted to a PC or smartphone by a factor of 1500×, from 12 kb/s to ~8 b/s. The proposed design is implemented on an ultralow-power IGLOO nano field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and is tested on AGLN250 prototype board. According to our post-place-and-route results, implementing the engine on the FPGA significantly drops the required data transmission, while an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation in a 65-nm CMOS results in a 15× power saving compared to the FPGA solution and occupies a 0.02-mm<sup>2</sup> footprint. As a result, the power consumption and size of the iTDS will be significantly reduced through the use of a much smaller rechargeable battery. Moreover, the system can operate longer following every recharge, improving the iTDS usability.","1549-7747;15497747","","10.1109/TCSII.2014.2387683","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001588","Application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC);field-programmable gate array (FPGA);low power;machine learning;onboard processor;personalized assistive device;wearable biomedical device","Accuracy;Application specific integrated circuits;Field programmable gate arrays;Power demand;Tongue;Training;Wireless communication","CMOS logic circuits;application specific integrated circuits;field programmable gate arrays;interactive devices;low-power electronics;nanoelectronics;object tracking;signal processing;wearable computers","AGLN250 prototype board;ASIC;CMOS process;FPGA;TDS prototype;application-specific integrated circuit;battery size;data transmission;dental retainer;eTDS;external TDS;iTDS;intraoral TDS;mechanical stability;post-place-and-route;power consumption;power saving;real-life outdoor conditions;real-time tracking;rechargeable battery;sensors;signal processing;size 65 nm;tongue drive system;transmitter side;ultralow-power IGLOO nanofield-programmable gate array;ultralow-power onboard processor;unobtrusive wireless-wearable assistive device;voluntary tongue motion;wireless headphone","","6","","16","","20150106","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These systems need to integrate the human's natural expertise in analyzing multimedia with the machine's ability to process large-scale data. The paper starts off with a comprehensive overview of representation, learning, and interaction techniques from both the human's and the machine's point of view. To this end, hundreds of references from the related disciplines (visual analytics, information visualization, computer vision, multimedia information retrieval) have been surveyed. Based on the survey, a novel general multimedia analytics model is synthesized. In the model, the need for semantic navigation of the collection is emphasized and multimedia analytics tasks are placed on the exploration-search axis. The axis is composed of both exploration and search in a certain proportion which changes as the analyst progresses towards insight. Categorization is proposed as a suitable umbrella task realizing the exploration-search axis in the model. Finally, the pragmatic gap, defined as the difference between the tight machine categorization model and the flexible human categorization model is identified as a crucial multimedia analytics topic.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6227-3; POD:978-1-4799-6186-3","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042476","Multimedia (image/video/music) visualization;machine learning","Browsers;Data visualization;Feature extraction;Multimedia communication;Semantics;Streaming media;Visualization","data visualisation;multimedia systems;search problems","exploration-search axis;flexible human categorization model;integrated multimedia analytics;intelligent multimedia analytics;interactive multimedia analytics;pragmatic gap;tight machine categorization model;visual multimedia","","3","","100","","","25-31 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

That is why currently the most popular infection vectors used by cyber criminals are either web pages or commonly used documents (such as pdf files). In both of these cases, the malicious actions performed are written in Java Script. Because of this, Java Script has become the preferred language for spreading malware. In order to be able to stop malicious content from executing, detection of its infection vector is crucial. In this paper we propose various methods for detecting Java Script-based attack vectors. For achieving our goal we first need to fight metamorphism techniques usually used in Java Script malicious code, which are by no means trivial: garbage instruction insertion, variable renaming, equivalent instruction substitution, function permutation, instruction reordering, and so on. Our approach to deal with metamorphism starts with splitting the Java Script content in components and filtering the insignificant ones. We then use a data set, consisting in over one million Java Script files in order to test several machine learning algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models, linear classifiers and hybrid approaches for malware detection. Finally, we analyze these detection methods from a practical point of view, emphasizing the need for a very low false positive rate and the ability to be trained on large datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8448-0; POD:978-1-4799-8449-7","10.1109/SYNASC.2014.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034689","Hidden Markov Model;Java Script;Linear Classifier;Machine Learning;PDF;detection;infection vector;malware;metamorphism","Feature extraction;HTML;Hidden Markov models;Malware;Portable document format;Reactive power;Vectors","Java;Web sites;hidden Markov models;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;vectors","JavaScript content;JavaScript files;JavaScript malicious code;JavaScript-Based malware detection;JavaScript-based attack vector detection;Web pages;World Wide Web;cybercriminals;equivalent instruction substitution;function permutation;garbage instruction insertion;hidden Markov models;infection vectors;instruction reordering;linear classifiers;machine learning algorithms;metamorphism techniques;variable renaming","","1","","24","","","22-25 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, selecting a movie from a large database of movies from on-line or selecting a song of his/her own kind from a large number of songs available in the internet and much more. In order to generate recommendations for the users the system has to first learn the user preferences from the user's past behaviours so that it can predict new items/things that are suitable for the respective user. These systems generally learn user's preferences from user's past experiences, using any machine learning algorithm and predict new items/things for the user using the learned preferences. In this paper we introduce a different approach to recommender system which will learn rules for user preferences using classification based on Decision Lists. We have followed two Decision List based classification algorithms like Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error Reduction and Predictive Rule Mining, for learning rules for users past behaviours. We also list out our proposed recommendation algorithm and discuss the advantages as well as disadvantages of our approach to recommender system with the traditional approaches.

It is possible to use sophisticated test methods to identify the best-performing systems but this would result in unacceptable yields and correspondingly high costs. The system personality is further shaped by its environment (e.g., temperature, noise and supply voltage) and usage (i.e., the frequency and type of applications executed), and since both can fluctuate over time, so can the system's personality. Systems also “grow old” and degrade due to various wear-out mechanisms (e.g., negative-bias temperature instability), and unexpectedly due to various early-life failure sources. These “nature and nurture” influences make it extremely difficult to design a system that will operate optimally for all possible personalities. To address this challenge, we propose to develop statistical learning in-chip (SLIC). SLIC is a holistic approach to integrated system design based on continuously learning key personality traits on-line, for self-evolving a system to a state that optimizes performance hierarchically across the circuit, platform, and application levels. SLIC will not only optimize integrated-system performance but also reduce costs through yield enhancement since systems that would have before been deemed to have weak personalities (unreliable, faulty, etc.) can now be recovered through the use of SLIC.","2325-0631;23250631","Electronic:978-1-4799-4833-8; POD:978-1-4799-4832-1; USB:978-1-4799-4834-5","10.1109/ISICIR.2014.7029574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029574","Integrated system design;low-power design;statistical and machine learning","Aging;Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Integrated circuit modeling;Statistical learning;System-on-chip;Uncertainty","integrated circuit design;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics","SLIC;integrated system design;low-power design;statistical learning in-chip","","1","","20","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Disciplines that have traditionally employed neural networks are experimenting with novel deep learning techniques in attempts to stimulate progress. Since neural networks have historically played an important role in SS prediction, we wanted to determine whether deep learning could contribute to the advancement of this field as well. We developed an SS predictor that makes use of the position-specific scoring matrix generated by PSI-BLAST and deep learning network architectures, which we call DNSS. Graphical processing units and CUDA software optimize the deep network architecture and efficiently train the deep networks. Optimal parameters for the training process were determined, and a workflow comprising three separately trained deep networks was constructed in order to make refined predictions. This deep learning network approach was used to predict SS for a fully independent test dataset of 198 proteins, achieving a Q<sub>3</sub> accuracy of 80.7 percent and a Sov accuracy of 74.2 percent.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2014.2343960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6872810","Machine learning;deep learning;neural nets;protein structure prediction","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Computational biology;Neural networks;Proteins;Testing;Training","ab initio calculations;biology computing;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;neural nets;parallel architectures;proteins","CUDA software;DNSS;PSI-BLAST;SS prediction;ab initio protein secondary structure prediction;deep learning network approach;graphical processing units;neural networks;position-specific scoring matrix;tertiary structure","0","16","","52","","20140807","Jan.-Feb. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To exploit frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, the access point should measure the channel quality and coordinate the channel contention for all the stations. However, there is a tradeoff between achieving the frequency diversity gain and sustaining protocol efficiency because the channel estimation and coordination consume time and frequency resource that ideally should be used for data transfer. In this paper, we present Diversity-aware Wi-Fi (D-Fi), a novel PHY/MAC protocol, that efficiently exploits frequency diversity. In particular, D-Fi leverages an OFDM-based Bloom filter that synergistically integrates two operations: (i) the channel quality estimation and (ii) the contention based channel allocation. D-Fi also employs a machine learning (ML) method to resolve the false-positive ambiguity caused by the Bloom filter. Furthermore, we develop a decentralized algorithm, called Kε-greedy, based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework, so that it achieves sub-optimal performance by studying the gain for exploring new channel quality information. We implement the prototype of D-Fi on the USRP/GNURadio to validate the feasibility of our work. The experiments and trace-driven simulations show that D-Fi provides up to 3 x throughput improvement compared to the existing solutions.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2326602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819850","Bloom filter;Diversity;PHY/MAC protocols;Wi-Fi;machine learning;multi-armed bandit problem","Channel estimation;Frequency diversity;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Media Access Protocol;Mobile computing;OFDM","OFDM modulation;access protocols;channel allocation;channel estimation;data structures;optimisation;wireless LAN","D-Fi leverages;Kε-greedy;OFDM-based Bloom filters;PHY-MAC protocol;USRP-GNURadio;access point;channel allocation;channel contention;channel estimation;channel quality estimation;false-positive ambiguity;frequency diversity gain;frequency diversity-aware Wi-Fi;frequency resource;machine learning;multiarmed bandit framework;throughput optimization;trace-driven simulations","","0","","38","","20140522","March 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Applying probabilistic statistical classification model, such as logistic regression, for stock analysis is promising. Logistic regression is an efficient classifier for predicting the outcome of a categorical dependent variable (class label) based on some predictor variables (features). Also, there has been a growing interest in the study of sparse representation of data. Using an over-complete dictionary that contains prototype bases, data are described by sparse linear combinations of these bases. Such a representation has biological interpretation and is very reasonable. Motivated by these reasons, in this paper, we propose a framework that combines sparse representation and logistic regression for stock classification. We use K-SVD algorithm to unsupervised learn sparse representation for the training data. The classifier is trained on these new representations of the data.

Switched reluctance machine (SRM) is known to be fault tolerant, however, is not fault free, and questions emerge as to powerful diagnostic methods. This paper takes an in-depth look at winding open-circuits `the worst case' in this particular machine. Various cases are considered, falling in two distinct categories: (i) when an entire phase is opened; (ii) when only part of a winding is opened. Therefore, application of classification method is very necessary to get the exact information to classify and to obtain a more complete labeling, and so, a more powerful diagnosis. An appropriate features extraction and features selection techniques should be incorporated. In this proposed method, smoothing Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) from a time-frequency ambiguity plane is used to extract features from torque time signals. In order to reduce the number of the features, a GA is suggested to select optimal ones. The new features provide more sensitive information for a classifier.

Assigning the correct severity level to the defects encountered in large and complex software, would help the software practitioners to allocate their resources and plan for subsequent defect fixing activities. In order to accomplish this, we have developed a model based on text mining techniques that will be used to assign the severity level to each defect report based on the classification of existing reports done using the machine learning method namely, Radial Basis Function of neural network. The proposed model is validated using an open source NASA dataset available in the PITS database. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis is done to interpret the results obtained from model prediction by using the value of Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity and a suitable threshold criterion known as the cut-off point. It is evident from the results that the model has performed very well in predicting high severity defects than in predicting the defects of the other severity levels.

A service provider registers a service in the universal repository i.e. UDDI so that the service consumers can search and discover the required service that meets the user functional requirements from thousands of registered services. Matching the user request with all services in a particular category of the repository is a cumbersome task. Semantic approaches are required to further assist the user in discovering relevant services. In this paper, we have proposed a semantic approach that gives ranked list of services based on the web based relatedness score and helps the users in the selection of potentially relevant and semantically similar services within a category. The proposed approach has been implemented on 80 OWLS services and the results have shown that the approach gives ranked list of services with ease of the selection process for the user.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7935-6; POD:978-1-4799-7936-3; USB:978-1-4799-7934-9","10.1109/ICOSC.2015.7050859","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050859","Machine learning;Normalized Google Distance;OWLS;Semantic Web Service Discovery;Text Mining","Automobiles;Information filters;Kernel;MATLAB;Semantics","Web services;knowledge representation languages;semantic Web","Google based hybrid approach;OWLS services;UDDI;WSDL;Web based relatedness score;Web services;service discovery","","2","","19","","","7-9 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We have developed new automated learning-based process-execution time-prediction and process status-prediction methods that can be embedded into an EIS. Process-execution time prediction is a regression problem and state-of-the-art (baseline) time-prediction methods use a machine-learning regression model. Process status prediction is a binary classification problem in which a class labeled “completed” or “in-progress” is assigned to a process with respect to an arbitrary predictive horizon (i.e., the future time given by the method user). The methods proposed in this paper integrate statistical methods with support-vector regression. Comparison results obtained from the real data of a digital-print enterprise show that the proposed time-prediction method reduces both the relative mean error and the root-mean-squared error of the regression model. Furthermore, the proposed status-prediction method not only achieves higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, it also estimates the probability of the predicted status. In addition, algorithm development and training phases of the proposed methods do not rely on any arbitrary predictive horizon. Therefore, a single time-prediction model as proposed is sufficient for status prediction as opposed to a baseline status-prediction method that requires classification models for all potential predictive horizons.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2014.2387831","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7001605","Classification;Enterprise information system (EIS);classification;enterprise information system (EIS);machine learning;regression;statistical analysis;support vector regression (SVR)","Data models;Histograms;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Testing;Vectors","information systems;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;regression analysis;support vector machines","EIS;intelligent enterprise information system;machine learning regression;process status;process-execution time;relative mean error;root-mean-squared error;statistical methods;support vector regression","","0","","51","","20150106","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The classification models were evaluated on EEG epochs from 11 subjects in an inter-subject cross-validation setting and the best among them achieved classification accuracies of 86% (Bayesian Network), 83% (Random Committee) and 74% (Random Forest).","","Electronic:978-1-63190-014-3; POD:978-1-4799-5024-9; USB:978-1-63190-013-6","10.1109/MOBIHEALTH.2014.7015916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015916","PNES;classification;epileptic seizures;machine learning;vasovagal syncope","Accuracy;Brain models;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Monitoring","belief networks;electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal processing;random processes;signal classification","Bayesian network;multichannel EEG data;nonepileptic EEG event classification;paroxysmal episodes;psychogenic nonepileptic seizure;random committee;random forest;vasovagal syncope","","0","","25","","","3-5 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an approach to still benefit from the assets of the ICF while considerably extending the angular robustness during the detection. The main contributions of this work are: a new framework based on the Cluster Boosting Tree and the ICF detector for viewpoint robust human detection; a new training dataset for taking into account the human shape modifications occuring when the pitch angle of the camera changes.

The acoustic echo path is modeled by a nonlinear-linear cascade of a memoryless preprocessor (to model the loudspeaker nonlinearities) preceding a linear finite impulse response filter (estimated by the normalized least mean square algorithm). For identifying the loudspeaker signal distortions, we follow the concept of significance-aware filtering by modeling the time-variant coefficients of the memoryless preprocessor and the direct-path part of the room impulse response vector as one state vector with non-Gaussian probability distribution. Due to the nonlinear relation between the state vector and the observation, we propose a computationally-efficient realization of the recently published elitist particle filter based on evolutionary strategies (EPFES), which evaluates realizations of the state vector based on long-term fitness measures. The experimental validation comprises predefined loudspeaker signal distortions as well as real recordings stemming from a commercial smartphone. In comparison to the well-known Hammerstein group model for NL-AEC, the computational complexity is reduced and the achievable system identification is improved for both scenarios.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7088-9; POD:978-1-4799-7089-6; USB:978-1-4799-7087-2","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032179","EPFES;machine learning for signal processing;memoryless preprocessor;nonlinear AEC;particle filtering","Adaptation models;Echo cancellers;Nonlinear acoustics;Speech;Speech processing;Vectors","FIR filters;acoustic distortion;acoustic signal processing;echo suppression;evolutionary computation;least mean squares methods;loudspeakers;memoryless systems;nonlinear acoustics;particle filtering (numerical methods);statistical distributions","NL-AEC;acoustic echo path modelling;coefficient estimation;computational complexity reduction;direct-path part;elitist particle filter based-on-evolutionary strategies;linear finite impulse response filter;long-term fitness measures;loudspeaker nonlinearities;loudspeaker signal distortion identification;memoryless preprocessor estimation;nonGaussian probability distribution;nonlinear acoustic echo cancellation;nonlinear relation;nonlinear-linear cascade;normalized least mean square algorithm;particle filtering;room impulse response vector;significance-aware EPFES;significance-aware filtering;state vector;system identification improvement;time-variant coefficient modeling","","1","","32","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many supervised learning algorithms have been invented in this domain to accomplish the task, and these algorithms require a large number of labeled training data. However, data labeling is a labor intensive task and requires in-depth domain knowledge. Thus, only a very small proportion of the data can be labeled in practice. This bottleneck greatly degrades the effectiveness of supervised email classification systems. In order to address this problem, in this work, we first identify some critical issues regarding supervised machine learning-based email classification. Then we propose an effective classification model based on multi-view disagreement-based semi-supervised learning. The motivation behind the attempt of using multi-view and semi-supervised learning is that multi-view can provide richer information for classification, which is often ignored by literature, and semi-supervised learning supplies with the capability of coping with labeled and unlabeled data. In the evaluation, we demonstrate that the multi-view data can improve the email classification than using a single view data, and that the proposed model working with our algorithm can achieve better performance as compared to the existing similar algorithms.","2324-898X;2324898X","Electronic:978-1-4799-6513-7; POD:978-1-4799-6514-4","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011248","Email Classification;Machine Learning Applications;Multi-View;Network Security;Semi-Supervised Learning","Data models;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Semisupervised learning;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;unsolicited e-mail","classification model;email classification system;labeled data;multiview data;multiview disagreement-based semisupervised learning;single view data;spam;unlabeled data","","2","","43","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data mining techniques can be used to understand the pitfalls arising in the teaching-learning professions.

This paper proposes a framework for identify the most contributed attributes towards academia, for the performance of second year students of computer science and application course. An appropriate supervised machine learning model is applied upon our set of inherent attributes in order to arrive (NBC) at predictive scenarios for given pattern of external attributes. Thus, the model is able to extract the fitness procedure sequences of external effort put up by each student who is predicted in 'at-risk' category.

In general, clustering algorithms allow a limited usage of domain knowledge about the cluster formation process. In this study, we propose both a design technique and a new partitioning-based clustering algorithm which can be used to assist the data analyst while looking for a set of meaningful clusters, i.e., clusters that actually correspond to the underlying data structure. Following an observer metaphor according to which the perception of a group of objects depends on the observer position-the closer an observer is from an image more details (s)he perceives-we resort to shrinkage to incorporate a regularization term, accounting for the observation point, within the objective function of an otherwise unbiased clustering algorithm. This technique allows our resulting biased algorithm to generate a set of reasonable partitions, i.e., partitions validated by a given cluster validity index, corresponding to views of data with different levels of granularity (levels of detail) in different regions of the data space. For the illustration of the design technique, we adopted the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm as the unbiased clustering algorithm and include a convergence theorem assuring that changing the point of observation in the corresponding biased algorithm FCM with focal point (FCMFP) does not jeopardize its convergence. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real data are included to illustrate the usefulness of the approach. In addition, and as a convenient side effect of using shrinkage, the experimental results suggest that our biased algorithm (FCMFP) not only seems to scale better than the successive runs of the unbiased one (FCM) but on the average, seems to produce clusters exhibiting higher validity index values as well. In addition, less sensitivity to initialization was observed for- the biased algorithm when compared with the unbiased one.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2306434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740819","Clustering algorithms;fuzzy c-means (FCM);fuzzy clustering;machine learning;pattern recognition;shrinkage","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Convergence;Indexes;Observers;Partitioning algorithms;Prototypes","data structures;fuzzy set theory;pattern clustering","FCM algorithm;FCMFP;biased algorithm;cluster validity index;data structure;design technique;fuzzy c-means algorithm;observer-biased fuzzy clustering;partitioning-based clustering algorithm","","8","","46","","20140214","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The anomalies detected may be due to sudden sentiment changes hidden in large amounts of text. If these anomalies are undetected or poorly managed, the consequences may be severe, e.g. A business whose customers reveal negative sentiments and will no longer support the establishment. Social media platforms, such as Twitter, provide a vast source of information, which includes user feedback, opinion and information on most issues. Many organizations also leverage social media platforms to publish information about events, products, services, policies and other topics frequently. Thus, analyzing social media data to identify abnormal events in a timely manner is a beneficial topic. It will enable the businesses and government organizations to intervene early or adopt proper strategies if needed. However, it is also a challenge due to the diversity and size of social media data. In this study, we survey existing anomaly analysis as well as sentiment analysis methods and analyze their limitations and challenges. To tackle the challenges, an enhanced sentiment classification method is proposed and discussed. We study the possibility of employing the proposed method to perform anomaly detection through sentiment analysis on social media data.

Many, when applied to a generic search environment, may not scale computationally due to either a very large tracking area, very fine granularity in the database, or both. Here, a novel framework for fingerprinting that utilizes a k-generation structure is proposed. This significantly reduces the required number of computations while maintaining comparable accuracy to the traditionally used single-generation approach. This is the key enabler that allows generalization of our framework to any search space. We validate this approach through simulation and show that the a multigeneration approach indeed provides computational gains while simultaneously maintaining accuracy. Second, we show how a natural grouping of constituent members can improve accuracy. We use graph spectral partitioning to demonstrate this effect. The end result is a framework that can be generalized to any size search space with an arbitrary level of granularity.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5255-7; POD:978-1-4799-5256-4; USB:978-1-4799-5254-0","10.1109/ICSPCS.2014.7021134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021134","WiMAX;cell-ID;computational complexity;database correlation;fingerprinting;geolocation;graph theory;machine learning;positioning","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Correlation;Databases;Fingerprint recognition;Shadow mapping;Vectors","graph theory;radionavigation;search problems","arbitrary level;computational gains;graph spectral partitioning;k-generation structure;multigeneration approach;pattern based positioning;position estimation;search space;single generation approach;wireless fingerprinting","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a framework by which data mining techniques could be used to extract patterns from an individual's work flow data to exploit a type of architecture known as a Knowledge Advantage Machine (KAM). KAM is a type of semantic desktop and semantic web application that would assist people in constructing their own personal knowledge networks, as well as sharing that information in an efficient manner with colleagues using the same system. A KAM would be capable of automatically discovering new knowledge that is relevant to the user's personal ontology. Through experimentation, it is empirically demonstrated that a user's file usage patterns can be utilized by a software to automatically and seamlessly learn what is ""important"" as defined by the user. Further research is necessary to apply this principle to a more realizable KAM so that decisions can be fueled by work patterns as well as semantic or contextual information.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6719-3; POD:978-1-4799-6720-9","10.1109/BDCloud.2014.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034808","Workflow patterns;file usage;machine learning;semantic desktop","Classification algorithms;Context;Data mining;Filtering;Knowledge engineering;Semantics;Training","data mining;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web;workflow management software","KAM;automatic knowledge discovery;contextual information;data mining techniques;empirical workflow pattern analysis;individual work flow data;knowledge advantage machine;knowledge advantage machines;pattern extraction;personal knowledge networks;semantic Web application;semantic desktop;semantic information;user file usage patterns;user personal ontology","","0","","23","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While some points arise as centers of influence and dominate most k-nearest neighbor sets, other points occur very rarely and barely affect the inferred models. Hubness has been shown to be highly detrimental to many learning tasks and several hubness-aware learning methods have recently been proposed. This paper extends the existing fuzzy neighbor occurrence models in order to enable cost-sensitive learning. We evaluate the extended implementations within the context of multi-class boosting, which is used to learn the appropriate neighbor votes during the re-weighting iterations. The proposed approach is evaluated on a series of high-dimensional datasets from various domains. The results demonstrate promising improvements of the proposed approach over the baselines.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-4274-9; POD:978-1-4799-4273-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2014.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7022661","boosting;high-dimensional data;hubness;hubness-aware classification;k-nearest neighbor;machine learning","Boosting;Computational modeling;Data models;Equations;Mathematical model;Standards;Training data","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","cost-sensitive learning;fuzzy neighbor occurrence models;high-dimensional datasets;high-dimensional kNN classification;hubness-aware learning methods;k-nearest neighbor occurrence frequency distribution;multiclass boosting;vote learning","","0","","54","","","14-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complete identification cycle involves the use of: (a) recording devices to acquire the songs, (b) audio processing techniques to remove the noise and to select the most representative elements of the signal, (c) feature extraction procedures to obtain relevant characteristics, and (d) decision procedures to make the identification. The decision procedures can be obtained by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, considering the problem in a standard classification scenario. One key element is this cycle is the selection of the most relevant segments of the audio for identification purposes. In this paper we show that the use of short audio segments with high amplitude - called pulses in our work - outperforms the use of the complete audio records in the species identification task. We also show how these pulses can be automatically obtained, based on measurements performed directly on the audio signal. The employed classifiers are trained using a previously labeled database of bird songs. We use a database that contains bird song recordings from 75 species which appear in the Southern Atlantic Coast of South America. Obtained results show that the use of automatically obtained pulses and a SVM classifier produce the best results, all the necessary procedures can be installed in a dedicated hardware, allowing the construction of a specific bird identification device.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4312-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-4311-1; POD:978-1-4799-4310-4","10.1109/ISM.2014.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033024","Bird Species Identification;Machine Learning;Pattern Recognition;Signal Processing","Accuracy;Birds;Databases;Feature extraction;Manuals;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machines","audio databases;audio signal processing;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;signal classification;support vector machines","ML algorithms;SVM classifier;South America;Southern Atlantic Coast;airports;audio recorded songs;automatic audio signal segmentation;bird species identification;bird-plane collisions prevent;decision procedures;feature extraction procedures;labeled bird song database;machine learning algorithms;noise removal;standard classification scenario","","3","","37","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The experimental results show that the opcode behaviors extracted by this method can fully represent the behavior characteristics of an executable.

Cloud computing is used as a platform where large amount of data or information can be stored (as it has more storage options) easily as a pay per use model. Hence the storage will not deal only with structured document; possibility of unstructured document storage will also be there. In order to compensate that there is a need to move on to unstructured database system which is mongodb. MongoDB (from ""humongous"") is an open source, scalable, high-performance, schema-free, document-oriented database. Technologies like cloud computing and SaaS(Software as a Service) in cloud are growing rapidly which replaces the exisiting traditional applications. The disadvantage in maintaining, integrating and acquiring traditional softwares are overcome by cloud applications. In this paper initially a static application is deployed into the private cloud environment as an image and its performance is evaluated. In the proposed system a weblog will be created with the features of locating exact source which is retrieved dynamically from web. The dynamic software application is bundled in to image and then deployed in the private cloud environment. In existing system the search was done only based on annotated word but in proposed system the search will be done concept wise meaningfully using Machine Learning techniques. The dynamic retrieval will be done using meta heuristic techniques and performance will be evaluated under private cloud environment. Then comparison will be done between static and dynamic application as the future work.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3834-6; POD:978-1-4799-3698-4","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033788","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033788","Automatic Metadata Extraction;Content Search;Locate Source Content;Machine Learning Algorithm;Metaheuristic Technique","Cloud computing;Educational institutions;Electronic publishing;Information services;Semantic Web;Semantics","Web sites;cloud computing;data privacy;database management systems;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","MongoDB;SaaS;Weblog;World Wide Web;cloud computing;database system;document-oriented database;dynamic retrieval;dynamic tracking;machine learning;metaheuristic technique;open source database;private cloud;schema-free database;software as a service;static images","","0","","12","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
