To learn and to evaluate the performance of our distance, we use the simple k-nearest-neighbors (k-NN) classifier. Although this classifier exhibits low performance relative to state-of-the-art phoneme classifiers, it can be used to determine a distance metric that is applicable to many other better-performing machine learning methods. We devise a novel optimization method that minimizes the error function of the k-NN classifier with respect to the covariance matrix of the Mahalanobis distance, based on finite-difference stochastic approximation (FDSA) gradient estimates combined with a random perturbation term to avoid local minima. We apply our method to the problem of phoneme classification with the k-NN classifier and show that our learned distance provides performance improvement of up to 8:19% over the standard k-NN classifier, and additionally outperforms other state-of-the-art distance learning methods by approximately 4 percentage points. We also find that the computational complexity of our method, while not optimal, is better than other distance learning methods. The performance improvements for individual phoneme classes are given. The distances learned are applicable to other scale-variant machine learning methods, such as support vector machines, multidimensional scaling, and maximum variance unfolding, as well as others.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064601","Mahalanobis distance;distance learning;k-nearest-neighbors;phoneme classification","Accuracy;Computer aided instruction;Learning systems;Machine learning;Measurement;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Optimization","computational complexity;distance learning;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","FDSA;MFCC features;Mahalanobis distance;computational complexity;distance learning methods;distance metric;finite difference stochastic approximation;gradient estimation;k-NN;k-nearest-neighbors;learning distances;machine learning methods;optimization method;phoneme classification;support vector machines","","0","","15","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While it is estimated that insects pollinate at least two-thirds of the all food consumed by humans, malaria, a disease transmitted by the female mosquito of the Anopheles genus, kills approximately one million people per year. Due to the importance of insects to humans, researchers have developed an arsenal of mechanical, chemical, biological and educational tools to help mitigate insects' harmful effects, and to enhance their beneficial effects. However, the efficiency of such tools depends on knowing the time and location of migrations/infestations/population as early as possible. Insect detection and counting is typically performed by means of traps, usually ""sticky traps"", which are regularly collected and manually analyzed. The main problem is that this procedure is expensive in terms of materials and human time, and creates a lag between the time the trap is placed and inspected. This lag may only be a week, but in the case of say, mosquitoes or sand flies, this can be more than half their adult life span. We are developing an inexpensive optical sensor that uses a laser beam to detect, count and ultimately classify flying insects from distance. Our objective is to use classification techniques to provide accurate real-time counts of disease vectors down to the species/sex level. This information can be used by public health workers, government and non-government organizations to plan the optimal intervention strategies in the face of limited resources. In this work, we present some preliminary results of our research, conducted with three insect species. We show that using our simple sensor we can accurately classify these species using their wing-beat frequency as feature. We further discuss how we can augment the sensor with other sources of information in order to scale our ideas to classify a larger number of species.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146999","Mosquito classification;inexpensive optical sensors;time series data","Detectors;Diseases;Humans;Insects;Time frequency analysis","classification;diseases;health care;public administration","Anopheles genus;automatic classification;beneficial effects;flying insects;human life;inexpensive sensors;malaria;nongovernment organizations;pollination;public health workers;sticky traps","","8","","10","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For some records pieces of information may be unavailable because an experiment has not yet been done, or certain type of inferences may not be applicable, such as when a gene does not have a homologue in some species.

Inspired by human psychology and learning experience, in this paper we propose a semi-supervised learning method that can classify multi-labeled data into a hierarchy based on the label's specificity level such that the separability between each class and its siblings is greater than the separability between each class and its parents. To build the hierarchy we show that a minimum spanning tree minimizes an upper bound on the pairwise Kullback-Liebler divergence between the true and approximated distributions. We show the effectiveness of our method using three types of data sets and draw a comparison between our learned hierarchy and one learned by human subjects using the same data set.

Based on prior physical knowledge about the target, the factors can be modeled as parametric functions, and their parameter values benefit further analyses. In this paper, we present a novel factorization method for the composite signals in terms of parametric factor functions. The method optimizes both the factor weights and the parameter values in the factor functions. While the parameter values are simply optimized by gradient descent, we propose L<sub>0</sub>-regularized non-negative least squares (L<sub>0</sub>-NNLS) for optimizing the factor weights. In L<sub>0</sub>-NNLS, both L<sub>0</sub> regularization and non-negativity constraint are imposed on the weights in the least squares to enhance the sparsity as much as possible. Since so regularized least squares is NPhard, we propose a stepwise forward/backward optimization to efficiently solve it in an approximated manner. Due to the sparsity by the L<sub>0</sub>-NNLS, the proposed factorization method can automatically discover the inherent number of factor functions as well as the parametric functions themselves by estimating their parameter values. In the experiments on factorization of simulated signals and practical biological signals, the proposed method exhibits favorable performances.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.84","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146962","L0 regularization;Least squares;factorization;non-negativity;parametric function;sparsity","Accuracy;Correlation;Least squares approximation;Optimization;Proteins;Vectors","biology computing;computational complexity;gradient methods;least squares approximations;matrix decomposition;optimisation;parameter estimation;signal processing","L<sub>0</sub>-NNLS;L<sub>0</sub>-regularized parametric nonnegative least square method;NP-hard problem;composite signal;factor function;factor weight;factorization method;gradient descent;nonnegativity constraint;parameter estimation;parameter values;parametric function;stepwise forward-backward optimization","","0","","23","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When a shortage occurs an onboard knowledge-based agent re-plans the AUV survey mission using on-line learning with a genetic algorithm given the energy budget, mission duration, and the remaining survey area dimensions. The validated agent is especially effective in the case studied for an energy shortfall resulting from increasing the surveyed area by a factor of 2, for a factor of 2 drop in energy.

While doing the segmentation of slap fingerprints, some of the fingerprint images are improperly segmented because of the noise present in the data.

In general, the exact conditional marginal distributions of the labels can be computed only after the complete sequence of observations has been obtained, which forbids the prediction of labels in an online fashion. This paper considers approximations of the marginal distributions which only take into account past observations and a small number of observations in the future. Based on these approximations, labels can be predicted close to real-time. We establish rigorous bounds for the marginal distributions which can be used to assess the approximation error at runtime. We apply the results to an L-CRF which recognizes the activity of rolling walker users from a stream of sensor data. It turns out that if we allow for a prediction delay of half of a second, the online predictions achieve almost the same accuracy as the offline predictions based on the complete observation sequences.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147039","Activity Recognition;Conditional Random Fields;Online Predictions","Accuracy;Delay;Legged locomotion;Upper bound;Vectors;Wheels;Yttrium","handicapped aids;random processes;wheelchairs","L-CRF;activity recognition;conditional marginal distribution;error bound;linear-chain conditional random field;online prediction;rolling walker","","0","","9","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two sensor types have been used to determine the point cloud fed to the system: a 3D laser scanner and a stereo camera pair. The results from both sensor systems show that the estimated maps follow the terrain shape, while protrusions are identified and may be isolated as potential obstacles.

"A Kernel Method for Real-Time Respiratory Tumor Motion Estimation Using External Surrogates","R. Li; L. Xing","Dept. of Radiat. Oncology, Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA, USA","2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","20120209","2011","2","","206","209","Respiratory tumor motion is a major challenge in radiation therapy. Real-time tumor tracking aims to dynamically target the tumor with the radiation beam, allowing a reduction in the volume of healthy tissue exposed to a high dose. Fluoroscopic tracking with implanted fiducial markers is not widely accepted due to its invasiveness and, to a lesser extent, additional imaging dose. Using external respiratory surrogates is an attractive approach to localizing tumors affected by respiratory motion. In this paper, we present a kernel regression approach to the respiratory tumor motion problem. Due to the local nature of the kernel functions, it is inherently robust to outliers in the training data. In addition, both training and adapting to new data is highly efficient and almost free under the kernel regression model. We evaluated the method on respiratory motion data from six patients (three lung and three pancreas patients). It was found that the average 3D error is <; 1 mm; the 95th percentile error is <; 3 mm (1.2 mm on average). These errors are well below the peak-to-peak amplitude (10 mm on average) for all six patients and within clinically acceptable ranges. Overall, the method is able to capture highly nonlinear and complex relations between the internal tumor motion and external surrogates in an accurate and efficient (~1 ms per prediction) way. These nice properties make it a suitable candidate for accurate and robust tumor tracking using external respiratory surrogates.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147674","kernel methods;radiation therapy;respiratory;surrogates;tumor motion","Data models;Kernel;Lungs;Pancreas;Three dimensional displays;Training data;Tumors","medical image processing;motion estimation;radiation therapy;tumours","external respiratory surrogates;external surrogates;fluoroscopic tracking;healthy tissue;implanted fiducial markers;kernel method;kernel regression approach;radiation therapy;real-time respiratory tumor motion estimation;real-time tumor tracking;respiratory tumor motion problem;robust tumor tracking","","1","","6","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One common technique used to alleviate high dimensionality is feature selection, the process of selecting the most relevant attributes and removing irrelevant and redundant ones. Much research has been done towards evaluating the performance of classifiers before and after feature selection, but little work has been done examining how sensitive the selected feature subsets are to changes (additions/deletions) in the dataset. In this study we evaluate the robustness of six commonly used feature selection techniques, investigating the impact of data sampling and class noise on the stability of feature selection. All experiments are carried out with six commonly used feature rankers on four groups of datasets from the biology domain. We employ three sampling techniques, and generate artificial class noise to better simulate real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that although no ranker consistently outperforms the others, Gain Ratio shows the least stability on average. Additional tests using our feature rankers for building classification models also show that a feature ranker's stability is not an indicator of its performance in classification.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146964","bioinformatics;class imbalance;classification;feature selection;noise injection;stability","Gene expression;Niobium;Noise;Noise measurement;Radio frequency;Stability criteria","data mining;noise;pattern classification;sampling methods;stability","artificial class noise;biology dataset;classification model;data mining;data sampling technique;feature ranker;feature selection stability;feature selection technique;gain ratio;high dimensionality problem","","2","","17","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present new ways of extracting features from a colorimetric sensor and determine the quality and robustness of these features using machine learning classifiers. Sensors, and in particular explosive sensors, must not only be able to classify explosives, they must also be able to measure the certainty of the classifier regarding the decision it has made. This means there is a need for classifiers that not only give a decision, but also give a posterior probability about the decision.

Based on such simulations we expect that under strong top-down attention pattern recognition is improved as the model can compensate for noise and confounders. We next investigate the role of temporal and spectral overlaps and speech intelligibility in humans, and how the presence of a task influences their relation. For this purpose, we perform behavioral experiments inspired by Cherry's classic experiments carried out almost sixty years ago. We make participants listen to a mono signal consisting of two different narratives pronounced by a speech synthesizer under two different conditions. In the first case, participants listen with no specific task, while in the second one they are asked to follow one of the stories. Participants report the words they heard by choosing from a list which also includes terms not present in any of the narratives. We define temporal and spectral overlaps using the ideal binary mask (IBMs) as a gauge. We analyze the correlation between overlaps and the amount of reported words. We observe a significant negative correlation when there is no task, while no correlation is detected when a task is involved. Hence, results that are well aligned with the simulation results in our computational top-down attention model.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146966","cocktail party;speech;top-down attention","Correlation;Humans;Interference;Mathematical model;Noise;Speech;Time frequency analysis","pattern recognition;speech synthesis","cocktail party problem;computational model;computational top-down attention model;ideal binary mask;pattern recognition;speech intelligibility;speech synthesizer;top-down task drive attention","","0","","26","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The huge size of a continuously flowing data has put forward a number of challenges in data stream analysis. Exploration of the structure of streamed data represented a major challenge that resulted in introducing various clustering algorithms. However, current clustering algorithms still lack the ability to efficiently discover clusters of arbitrary densities in data streams. In this paper, a new grid-based and density-based algorithm is proposed for clustering streaming data. It addresses drawbacks of recent algorithms in discovering clusters of arbitrary densities. The algorithm uses an online component to map the input data to grid cells. An offline component is then used to cluster the grid cells based on density information. Relative density relatedness measures and a dynamic range neighborhood are proposed to differentiate clusters of arbitrary densities. The experimental evaluation shows considerable improvements upon the state-of-the-art algorithms in both clustering quality and scalability. In addition, the output quality of the proposed algorithm is less sensitive to parameter selection errors.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.56","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146984","Data streams mining;density-based clustering","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Density measurement;Heuristic algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Scalability;Shape","data analysis;pattern clustering","arbitrary densities;arbitrary shapes;clustering algorithm;data stream analysis;data streams;density-based algorithm;dynamic range neighborhood;grid cells;grid-based algorithm;relative density relatedness measures;streaming data analysis","","2","","14","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The important feature of our motion compensated X-ray CT algorithm is that the target object is assumed to move or deform along the time. Then the projections of the deforming target object are described by a state-space model. The deformation is described by motion vectors each attached to each pixel. To reduce the ill-posed ness we incorporate into the prior distribution our a priori knowledge that the target object is composed of a restricted number of materials whose X-ray absorption coefficients are roughly known. To perform Bayesian inference based on our statistical model, the posterior distribution is approximated by a computationally tractable distribution such to minimize Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the posterior and the tractable distributions.

For each class and each candidate kernel parameter, we generate the subspace by KPCA, and obtain the projection length of an input vector onto each subspace. Then, for each class, we define the discriminant function by the sum of the weighted lengths. These weights in the discriminant function are optimized by subspace-based support vector machines (SS-SVMs) so that the margin between classes is maximized while minimizing the classification error. Thus, we can weight the subspaces for each class from the standpoint of class separability. Then, the computational cost of the model selection of MNSMs is lower than that of SS-SVMs because for SS-SVMs two hyper-parameters, which are the kernel parameter and the margin parameter, must be chosen before training.

An important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational bottleneck-instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric representation of instance weights which allows us to find the breakpoints in high-dimensional space easily. Despite its simplicity, our parametrization covers various important machine learning tasks and it widens the applicability of the solution-path algorithm.

LO-net is a neural network architecture that can infer both the existence and values of hidden variables in streaming multivariate time series. The core idea is to initially make predictions with one network (the observable or O-net) based on a time delay embedding, following this with a gradual reduction in the temporal scope of the embedding that forces a second network (the latent or L-net) to learn to approximate the value of a single hidden variable, which is then input to the O-net based on the original time delay embedding. The latent network sometimes learns to approximate the predicted target output from the original network in the LO-net architecture. To prevent this situation, a penalty term is introduced that is added to the error for the latent network. The penalty term is formulated to penalize the latent network when it learns the target output of the original network. A distance penalty term has been shown to improve the prediction performance over the unregularized network. This paper introduces a new penalty, called the decor relation penalty, which proves to be better for domains with periodic data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147013","","Decorrelation;History;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Robot kinematics;Training;Vectors","neural nets;time series","LO-net;decor relation penalty;distance penalty term;hidden variable discovery;latent network;multivariate time series;regularized neural network architecture;time delay embedding","","0","","13","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a complex biological system with limited observations, one of the daunting tasks is the large number of unknown parameters in the mathematical modeling whose values directly determine the performance of computational modeling. To tackle this problem, we have developed a data-driven global optimization method, nonlinear RANSAC, based on Random Sample Consensus (a.k.a. RANSAC) method, for parameter estimation of nonlinear system models. Conventional RANSAC method is sound and simple, but it is oriented for linear system models. We not only adopt the strengths of RANSAC, but also extend the method for nonlinear systems with outstanding performance. As a specific application example, we have targeted understanding phagocyte transmigration which is involved in the fibrosis process for biomedical device implantation. With well-defined mathematical nonlinear equations of the system, nonlinear RANSAC is performed for the parameter estimation. Moreover, simulations of the system for propagation prediction over the time are conducted under both normal conditions and knock-out conditions. In order to evaluate the general performance of the method, we also applied the method to signalling pathways where mathematical equations which are representing interaction of proteins are generated using ordinary differential equations as a general format, and public data sets for nonlinear regression evaluation are used to assess its performance.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147027","RANSAC algorithm;optimization;parameter estimation;phagocyte transmigration","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Implants;Least squares approximation;Mathematical model;Parameter estimation","biology;mathematical programming;nonlinear differential equations;nonlinear systems;parameter estimation;sampling methods","biological properties;biomedical device implantation;complex biological system;computational modeling;data-driven global optimization method;fibrosis process;mathematical modeling;mathematical nonlinear equations;nonlinear RANSAC optimization;ordinary differential equations;parameter estimation;phagocyte transmigration;random sample consensus method;reliable system models;vigorous mathematical equations","","0","","8","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The common task in text clustering is to handle text in a multi-dimensional space, and to partition documents into groups, where each group contains documents that are similar to each other. However, this strategy lacks a comprehensive view for humans since it cannot explain the subject of each cluster. Utilizing semantic information such as an ontology can solve this problem, but it needs a well-defined database or pre-labeled gold standard set. In this paper, we present a theme-based clustering algorithm for text documents. Given text, subject terms are extracted and used for clustering documents in a probabilistic framework. An EM approach is used to ensure documents are assigned to correct themes, hence it converges to an optimal solution. The proposed method is distinctive because its results are sufficiently explanatory for human understanding as well as efficient for usual clustering performance. The experimental results show that the proposed method provides competitive performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

Traditional techniques for identifying markers that cannot be placed consistently are based on resampling, which requires an already computationally expensive process to be done for a large ensemble of resampled populations.

In the paper, there will also be presented a method to construct a flexible distributions well suited for covering the effect of the non-linear ties. The method can also be used to improve other parametric methods around regions with strong non-linear ties by including them inside the network.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146989","Artificial Neural Networks;Filter Enhancement;Non-Linear State Estimation;Stochastic Training","Approximation methods;Biological neural networks;Kalman filters;Neurons;Training;Vectors","neural nets;state estimation;statistical distributions","Monte Carlo sampling;non-Gaussian distribution;nonlinear state estimation;offline training;parametric distribution;pretrained neural networks;state transformation","","0","","11","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this phenomenon, the accuracy of a pattern classifier peaks as the features increase under a fixed size of training samples. Instead of estimating the distribution of class objects, the system generates a region on the feature space, in which a certain rate of class objects is included. The pattern classifier identifies the class if the object belongs to only one class of the coverage region, but answers ""unable to detect"" if the object belongs to the coverage region of more than one class or belongs to none. Here, the coverage region is simply produced from the coverage regions of each feature and then extended if necessary. Unlike the Naive-Bayes classifier, the independence of each feature is not assumed. In tests of the system on the classification of characters, the performance does not significantly decrease as the features increase unless apparently useless features are added.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147005","Naive Bayes classifier;error rate;feature extraction;peaking phenomenon;supervised learning","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Indexes;Optimization;Sorting;Training;Vectors","Bayes methods;pattern classification;statistical analysis","feature independence;naive Bayes classifier;object coverage regions;pattern classifier;statistical pattern classifying system","","1","","9","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

More precisely, the best separating hyper plane is chosen to be the one that is orthogonal to the line segment connecting the closest points on the hyper disks and at the same time bisects the line. The method is extended to the nonlinear case by using the kernel trick, and the multi-class classification problems are dealt with constructing and combining several binary classifiers as in Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.

This paper presents a systematic investigation of the problem, algorithmic solutions and an evaluation methodology. Our focus is on performance comparison of statistical classifiers (e.g. SVM and kNN) and knowledge-based approaches, especially COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) solutions which currently dominate FTI applications. We analyze the robustness of different methods in handling damaged files and file segments. We propose two alternative criteria in measuring performance: 1) treating file-name extensions as the true labels, and 2) treating the predictions by knowledge based approaches on intact files, these rely on signature bytes as the true labels (and removing these signature bytes before testing each method). In our experiments with simulated damages in files, SVM and kNN substantially outperform all the COTS solutions we tested, improving classification accuracy very substantially -- some COTS methods cannot identify damaged files at all.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.135","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146945","Classification;Comparative Evaluation;Digital Forensics;File-type Identification","Accuracy;Forensics;Software;Support vector machines;Testing;Text categorization;Training","computer forensics;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","SVM;algorithmic solutions;commercial off-the-shelf solutions;digital forensics;evaluation methodology;file type identification;intrusion detection;kNN;knowledge based approaches;state-of-the-art classification techniques;statistical classifiers;statistical learning","","4","","30","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to the vagueness in class definitions, expression recognition is often conceived as a fuzzy label problem. Annotating a data point in such a problem involves significant manual effort. Active learning techniques are effective in reducing human labeling effort to induce a classification model as they automatically select the salient and exemplar instances from vast amounts of unlabeled data. Further, to address the high redundancy in data such as image or video sequences as well as to account for the presence of multiple labeling agents, there have been recent attempts towards a batch mode form of active learning where a batch of data points is selected simultaneously from an unlabeled set. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based batch mode active learning technique for fuzzy label classification problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to develop such a scheme primarily intended for the fuzzy label context. The proposed algorithm is computationally simple, easy to implement and has provable performance bounds. Our results on facial expression datasets corroborate the efficacy of the framework in reducing human annotation effort in real world recognition applications involving fuzzy labels.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146977","","Accuracy;Entropy;Face recognition;Humans;Streaming media;Training;Uncertainty","computer vision;face recognition;fuzzy set theory;image classification;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence)","active batch selection;automated recognition;computer vision applications;expression recognition;facial expression recognition;fuzzy classification;fuzzy label classification problems;human annotation effort;image sequences;optimization-based batch mode active learning technique;video sequences","","1","","34","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The existing approaches for active learning have been mostly applicable to the traditional binary or multi-class classification problems. However, in many real-world situations, we encounter problems in which we have access only to samples of one class. These problems are known as one-class learning or outlier detection problems and the User relevance feedback in image retrieval systems is an example of such problems. In this paper, we propose an active learning method which uses only samples of one class.

Real-time tracking of the intra-fraction prostate motion during radiation therapy is necessary to truly benefit from the highly conformal dose distribution. With the widespread use of kV on-board imaging devices, it is desirable to estimate the 3D tumor position from a single x-ray imager during treatment delivery. In this work, we will present an improved real-time 3D Bayesian tracking algorithm with an online update scheme. By incorporating all previously acquired images during dose delivery and updating the motion probability density function in an online fashion, the algorithm is able to track large and abrupt changes that are typical of prostate motion. The flexible Bayesian formulation allows one to easily incorporate this information and obtain the 3D motion with minimal computational cost. The new tracking algorithm has been tested on actual prostate trajectories recorded with implanted electromagnetic transponders for a total of 10 patients. The new algorithm outperformed a previous one with a fixed prior built from the original setup images (Li et al. 2011). It was found that with the new algorithm, the mean 3D tracking error is about 0.15 mm and the 95th percentile error is about 0.45 mm on average for all the patients. The proposed 3D tracking algorithm is useful for real-time image guidance in prostate radiation therapy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147675","Bayesian tracking;image guidance;prostate cancer;radiation therapy;real-time","Bayesian methods;Imaging;Real time systems;Three dimensional displays;Tracking;Tumors;X-ray imaging","Bayes methods;cancer;electromagnetic devices;image motion analysis;image sensors;medical image processing;object tracking;radiation therapy;real-time systems;tumours","3D tumor position estimation;conformal dose distribution;electromagnetic transponders;intrafraction internal anatomy motion;motion probability density function;on-board imaging devices;prostate radiation therapy;real-time 3D Bayesian tracking algorithm;real-time image guidance;treatment delivery;x-ray imager","","0","","18","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New criteria when clusters should be merged are based on a touching and on a homogeneity condition between two ellipsoidal clusters, the merging itself is conducted by using weighted averaging of cluster centers and a convex combination of cluster spreads based on the recursive variance update concept. The splitting criterion for an updated cluster employs a 2-means algorithm on its sub-samples and compares the quality of the split cluster with the original cluster by using Bayesian information criterion, the cluster partition with the better quality remains for the next incremental update cycle. The results on 2-dimensional as well high-dimensional streaming clustering data sets show that the new split-and-merge concept is able to produce more reliable cluster partitions than conventional evolving clustering.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147042","Baysian information criterion;dynamic split-and-merge;evolving cluster models;incremental learning;touching and homogeneity conditions","Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Data models;Ellipsoids;Heuristic algorithms;Merging;Partitioning algorithms","Bayes methods;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","2-means algorithm;Bayesian information criterion;dynamic evolving prototype-based cluster models;ellipsoidal clusters;extended on-the-fly cluster partitions;high dimensional streaming clustering;homogeneity condition;incremental learning;online split-and-merge operations;recursive variance update concept;splitting criterion","","4","","22","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When implemented hierarchically, it allows for efficient processing of high-dimensional data, such as images. Expansion plays a crucial role in the implementation of non-linear SFA. In this paper, a fast heuristic method for the evaluation of expansions is proposed, consisting of tests on seven problems and two metrics. Several expansions with different complexities are evaluated. It is shown that the method allows predictions of the performance of SFA on a concrete data set, and the use of normalized expansions is justified. The proposed method is useful for the design of powerful expansions that allow the extraction of complex high-level features and provide better generalization.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146957","Slow Feature Analysis;expansions;feature extraction;non-linear dimensionality reduction","Algorithm design and analysis;Feature extraction;Function approximation;Noise measurement;Training;Vectors","feature extraction;unsupervised learning","complex high-level feature;expansion heuristic evaluation;feature extraction;high-dimensional data;nonlinear SFA;nonlinear hierarchical slow feature analysis;slowness principle;unsupervised learning","","1","","12","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although human feedback can help an agent learn a rich representation of the task and domain, humans may not have the expertise or time to provide elaborate and accurate feedback in complex domains. Widespread deployment of intelligent agents hence requires that the agents operate autonomously using sensory inputs and limited high-level feedback from non-expert human participants. Towards this objective, this paper describes an augmented reinforcement learning framework that combines bootstrap learning and reinforcement learning principles. In the absence of human feedback, the agent learns by interacting with the environment. When high-level human feedback is available, the agent robustly merges it with environmental feedback by incrementally revising the relative contributions of the feedback mechanisms to the action choice policy. The framework is evaluated in two simulated domains: Tetris and Keep away soccer.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147010","Bootstrap learning;Multiagent game domains;Reinforcement learning","Annealing;Equations;Humans;Learning;Probability density function;Robot sensing systems","computer games;human computer interaction;human-robot interaction;intelligent robots;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","Keep away soccer;Tetris;action choice policy;agent domains;application domains;augmented reinforcement learning framework;bootstrap learning principle;environmental feedback;human feedback;intelligent agents;intelligent robots;nondeterministic action outcomes;nonexpert humans","","2","","25","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such systems, attackers intentionally insert attack profiles to change the systems output to their advantage. This paper presents the idea of utilizing a set of genre attributes in order to discriminate between attack and genuine profiles in a movie recommender system. Since attackers typically assign random ratings to the movies in attack profiles, the genre interest of attackers and genuine users who rate movies based on their preferences are different. Based on this idea, we build a system using genre attributes as inputs to a feed forward neural network in order to detect attackers.

These social networks are rich in information about entities like hobbies, demographic information, friendship, and other attributes. This information can be used extensively for network analysis. One of the most important problems in social network analysis is community detection. The community detection problem is closely related to graph clustering. Most of the existing graph clustering algorithms employ only the structure of a graph to find highly connected components. These algorithms ignore nodes' attributes that can help in improving the quality of the clustering. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm which clusters a graph by incorporating both the topological structure of the graph as well as attribute information. The aim is to find clusters such that the nodes in each cluster are similar in the attribute space. In terms of social networks, we are looking to find communities where the members of the same community have similar profiles. The method was evaluated using real and synthetic graph datasets.

As a branch of recommender systems, collaborative filtering (CF) systems take its roots from sharing opinions with others and have been shown to be very effective for generating high quality recommendations. However, CF often confronts a problem of sparsity which is caused by relevantly less number of ratings against the unknowns that need to be predicted. In this paper, we consider a hybrid approach which combines the content-based approach with collaborative filtering under a unified model called Co-Clustering with Augmented data Matrix (CCAM). CCAM is based on information-theoretic co-clustering but further considers augmented data matrix like user profile and item description. By presenting results on a better error of prediction, we show that our algorithm is more effective in addressing sparsity through optimizing the co-cluster in mutual information loss between multiple tabular data than algorithm with single data and algorithms do not consider mutual information loss or co-clustering in our prediction framework.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147682","Co-clustering;Collaborative Filtering;Recommendation System","Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Copper;Joints;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Probability distribution","collaborative filtering;content-based retrieval;matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering;recommender systems","CCAM;co-clustering with augmented data matrix;collaborative filtering;content-based approach;hybrid approach;information theory co-clustering;optimization;recommender system;unified model","","0","","10","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most common assumption made when solving such MAB problems is that the unknown reward probability θ<sup>k</sup> of each bandit arm k is fixed. However, this assumption rarely holds in practice simply because real-life problems often involve underlying processes that are dynamically evolving. In this paper, we model problems where reward probabilities θ<sup>k</sup> are drifting, and introduce a new method called Dynamic Thompson Sampling (DTS) that facilitates Order Statistics based Thompson Sampling for these dynamically evolving MABs. The DTS algorithm adapts its success probability estimates, hat θ<sup>k</sup>, faster than traditional Thompson Sampling schemes and thus leads to improved performance in terms of lower regret. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTS outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, namely pure Thompson Sampling, UCB-Normal and UCB<sub>f</sub>, for the case of dynamic reward probabilities.

Our project is a part of developing an integrated machine vision sorting and inspecting system for mixed dish pieces and silverware exiting a flight-type commercial dishwashing machine, coupled with automatic loading and unloading. We propose two new methods for automatically inspecting dish cleanliness, namely adaptive thresholding and maximum saliency map. On the first method, a new technique using partitioning and adaptive thresholding, combined with global thresholding are introduced. On the second method, we propose a new normalization technique. Both algorithms are fast, simple, and produce results invariant with lighting conditions and dish rotation about the camera-dish axis.

The next relies on look-up functions across multiple databases to determine the probable semantic layer of each tag. Examples of the semantic layers with prevalence rates are given based on application of the scheme to a subset of the Million Song Dataset.

Similar to related approaches that are mostly based on kernel methods, unsupervised K-nearest neighbor (UNN) regression optimizes latent variables w.r.t. the data space reconstruction error employing the K-nearest neighbor heuristic. The problem of optimizing latent neighborhoods is difficult to solve, but the UNN formulation allows the design of efficient strategies that iteratively embed latent points to fixed neighborhood topologies.

Based on this observation, we propose to focus on the active population and explore the influence of member activities. We present a model that can incorporate various activity features and predict the evolution of the social activity. At the same time, an algorithm is adopted to select the most influential activity features.

The model was validated by comparing various dose profiles on 6 and 10 MV FFF beam from a True Beam STx linear accelerator. Planar dose distributions for clinically used radiation fields were also calculated and compared with measured data. All calculated dose profiles were agreed with the measured data within 1.5% for 6 MV FFF beam, and within 1% for 10 MV FFF beam. The calculated planar doses showed good passing rates (>; 94%) at 3%/3 mm of gamma indexing criteria.

This requirement raises problems for large or continuous state spaces. Particularly, in continuous state spaces a discretization sufficiently fine to cover all relevant information usually results in an extremely large state space. In order to speed up and improve learning it is highly beneficial to add generalization to Q-Learning and thus being able to exploit experiences gained earlier. To achieve this, we compute a state space abstraction with a combination of growing neural gas and Q-Learning. This abstraction respects similarity in the state and action space and is constructed based on information achieved from interaction with the environment during learning.

Profit Sharing learns rational policy that is easy to be learned and results in good behavior in POMDP. However, the policy becomes worse in the dynamic and huge environment that changes frequently and require the lots of actions to achieve the goal.

In this paper, we propose a new margin-based feature selection metric that defines the quality of a set of features by considering the maximized AUC margin it induces during the process of learning with boosting. Our algorithm measures the cumulative effect each feature has on the margin distribution associated with the weighted linear combination that boosting produces over the positive and the negative examples.

This method consists of two steps: 1) discovering domain-specific terms from document collections of multiple domains, and 2) learning hierarchical relations between the associated terms of each domain. The novelty of step 1 lies in the utilization of LDA in selecting terms with high predictive probability of a specific domain via latent topics, which overcomes the drawbacks of unigram model. Meanwhile, the hierarchical relations among domain terms are exploited by a novel approach based on word association analysis in step 2. The proposed method is tested on two datasets in different languages. The experimental results show that the terms obtained by this method are intuitively relevant to the reference domain and many term pairs with hierarchical relations are discovered. And the relations reflect the structure of the domain rather well.

Many algorithms employ Mahalanobis distance, since Mahalanobis distance better follows the data distribution, however it is assumed, that the data points have a normal distribution. Recently proposed Polynomial Mahalanobis Distance (PMD) represents more discriminative metric, which provides superior results in an unstructured terrain, especially, if the road is barely visible even for humans.

There, the inverse Hessian matrix must be calculated in each iteration step. Thus, a computational cost in the optimization of LR significantly increases as input data becomes large. To reduce the computational cost, we propose a novel optimization method of LR by directly using the non-linear conjugate gradient (CG) method. The proposed method iteratively minimizes the objective function of LR without calculation of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, to reduce the number of iteration efficiently, the step size in the non-linear CG iteration is optimized avoiding ad hock line search, and initial values are set by ordinary linear regression analysis. In the experimental results, our method performs about 200 times faster than the other methods for a large scale dataset.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147026","Conjugate gradient method;Logistic regression;Optimization scheme","Computational efficiency;Logistics;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition;Optimization methods;Vectors","Hessian matrices;Newton-Raphson method;conjugate gradient methods;least squares approximations;matrix inversion;optimisation;pattern classification;probability;regression analysis","Newton-Raphson method;ad hock line search avoidance;classification problems;inverse Hessian matrix;iteration step;iterative reweighted least squares;logistic regression optimization;nonlinear CG iteration;nonlinear conjugate gradient method;objective function;objective function minimization;ordinary linear regression analysis;posterior probability estimation","","0","","14","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Stability and Classification Performance of Feature Selection Techniques","H. Wang; T. M. Khoshgoftaaar; Q. Liang","","2011 10th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications and Workshops","20120209","2011","1","","151","156","Feature selection techniques can be evaluated based on either model performance or the stability (robustness) of the technique. The ideal situation is to choose a feature selection technique that is robust to change, while also ensuring that models built with the selected features perform well. One domain where feature selection is especially important is software defect prediction, where large numbers of metrics collected from previous software projects are used to help engineers focus their efforts on the most faulty modules. This study presents a comprehensive empirical examination of seven filter-based feature ranking techniques (rankers) applied to nine real-world software measurement datasets of different sizes. Experimental results demonstrate that signal-to-noise ranker performed moderately in terms of robustness and was the best ranker in terms of model performance. The study also shows that although Relief was the most stable feature selection technique, it performed significantly worse than other rankers in terms of model performance.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146960","classification;feature ranking;stability","Analysis of variance;Indexes;Radio frequency;Robustness;Software;Stability criteria","software fault tolerance;software metrics","classification performance;feature selection technique;filter-based feature ranking technique;software defect prediction;software measurement datasets;stability","","0","","19","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We recently proposed a new metaheuristics method inspired from spiral phenomena in nature which is called spiral optimization. However, the spiral optimization was restricted to 2-dimensional continuous optimization problems. In this paper, we develop a spiral optimization method for n-dimensional continuous optimization problems by constructing an n-dimensional spiral model. The n-dimensional spiral model is designed using rotation matrices in n-dimensional space. Simulation results for different benchmark problems show the effectiveness of our proposal compared to PSO and DE.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147022","evolutionary computation;global optimization;metaheuristics;multipoint search;spiral phenomena","Benchmark testing;Convergence;Optimization;Proposals;Search problems;Spirals;Trajectory","matrix algebra;optimisation;search problems","DE;PSO;global optimization problems;n-dimensional continuous optimization problems;rotation matrices;spiral multipoint search;spiral optimization method","","2","","9","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
