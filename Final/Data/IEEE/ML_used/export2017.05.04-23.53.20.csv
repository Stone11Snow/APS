Due to this, popular classifiers misclassify data instances of minority class into majority class. Initially, Extreme learning machine was proposed with the prime objective of handling real valued datasets. Though, it a fast learning technique, it suffers from the drawback of misclassification of imbalanced dataset which leads to the class imbalance problem. So, a new variant of ELM called Weighted Extreme Learning Machine was developed. This technique aimed at handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. The limitation of this technique lied in that it generates weight according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data. This leads to the lack of finding optimal weight at which good generalization performance could be achieved. This work uses Genetic Algorithm to find optimal weight which is given to minority and majority class instances.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7171-8; POD:978-1-4799-7172-5","10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7100711","Extreme Learning Machine;Genetic Algorithm;Learning","Accuracy;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Testing;Training;Training data","data handling;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","ELM;binary imbalance learning;class imbalance problem;data instance classifiers;genetic algorithm based weighted extreme learning machine;training data class distribution;weighted extreme learning machine","","0","","21","","","3-4 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CLDA methods use batches of data to refit the decoder parameters in closed-loop operation. Recently, dynamic state-space algorithms have also been designed to fit the parameters of a point process decoder (PPF). A main design parameter that needs to be selected in any CLDA algorithm is the learning rate, i.e., how fast should the decoder parameters be updated on the basis of new neural observations. So far, the learning rate of CLDA algorithms has been selected empirically using ad-hoc methods. Here we develop a principled framework to calibrate the learning rate in adaptive state-space algorithms. The learning rate introduces a trade-off between the convergence rate and the steady-state error covariance of the estimated decoder parameters. Hence our algorithm first finds an analytical upper-bound on the steady-state error covariance as a function of the learning rate. It then finds the inverse mapping to select the optimal learning rate based on the maximum allowable steady-state error. Using numerical BMI experiments, we show that the calibration algorithm selects the optimal learning rate that meets the requirement on steady-state error level while achieving the fastest convergence rate possible corresponding to this steady-state level.","1094-687X;1094687X","DVD:978-1-4244-9270-1; Electronic:978-1-4244-9271-8; POD:978-1-4244-9269-5","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7318696","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7318696","","Algorithm design and analysis;Calibration;Convergence;Decoding;Heuristic algorithms;Steady-state;Training","brain-computer interfaces;closed loop systems;neurophysiology","BMI performance;CLDA method;ad-hoc method;adaptive state-space algorithm;brain-machine interface;closed-loop adaptive BMI;closed-loop decoder adaptation;closed-loop operation;convergence rate;decoder parameters;dynamic state-space algorithm;learning rate;neural observation;numerical BMI experiment;point process decoder;steady-state error level","","1","","7","","","25-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a stacked ELMs (S-ELMs) that is specially designed for solving large and complex data problems. The S-ELMs divides a single large ELM network into multiple stacked small ELMs which are serially connected. The S-ELMs can approximate a very large ELM network with small memory requirement. To further improve the testing accuracy on big data problems, the ELM autoencoder can be implemented during each iteration of the S-ELMs algorithm. The simulation results show that the S-ELMs even with random hidden nodes can achieve similar testing accuracy to support vector machine (SVM) while having low memory requirements.

The recent great improvements on benchmark data sets, which are achieved by increasingly complex unsupervised learning methods and deep learning models with lots of parameters, usually require many tedious tricks and much expertise to tune. However, filters learned by these complex architectures are quite similar to standard hand-crafted features visually, and training the deep models costs quite long time to fine-tune their weights. In this paper, Extreme Learning Machine-Autoencoder (ELM-AE) is employed as the learning unit to learn local receptive fields at each layer, and the lower layer responses are transferred to the last layer (trans-layer) to form a more complete representation to retain more information. In addition, some beneficial methods in deep learning architectures such as local contrast normalization and whitening are added to the proposed hierarchical Extreme Learning Machine networks to further boost the performance. The obtained trans-layer representations are followed by block histograms with binary hashing to learn translation and rotation invariant representations, which are utilized to do high-level tasks such as recognition and detection. Compared to traditional deep learning methods, the proposed trans-layer representation method with ELM-AE based learning of local receptive filters has much faster learning speed and is validated in several typical experiments, such as digit recognition on MNIST and MNIST variations, object recognition on Caltech 101. State-of-the-art performances are achieved on both Caltech 101 15 samples per class task and 4 of 6 MNIST variations data sets, and highly impressive results are obtained on MNIST data set and other tasks.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4799-1960-4; POD:978-1-4799-1961-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280669","","Niobium;Training","unsupervised learning","Caltech 101;ELM-AE based learning;binary hashing;block histograms;deep learning architectures;digit recognition;extreme learning machine-autoencoder;hierarchical extreme learning machine networks;high-level tasks;learning speed;learning unit;local contrast normalization;local receptive filters;massive unlabeled data;object recognition;rotation invariant representations;trans-layer representations;translation invariant representations;unsupervised representation learning;whitening","","2","","36","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from the common understanding and tenet that hidden neurons of neural networks need to be iteratively adjusted during training stage, ELM theories show that hidden neurons are important but need not be iteratively tuned. In fact, all the parameters of hidden nodes can be independent of training samples and randomly generated according to any continuous probability distribution. And the obtained ELM networks satisfy universal approximation and classification capability. The fully connected ELM architecture has been extensively studied. However, ELM with local connections has not attracted much research attention yet. This paper studies the general architecture of locally connected ELM, showing that: 1) ELM theories are naturally valid for local connections, thus introducing local receptive fields to the input layer; 2) each hidden node in ELM can be a combination of several hidden nodes (a subnetwork), which is also consistent with ELM theories. ELM theories may shed a light on the research of different local receptive fields including true biological receptive fields of which the exact shapes and formula may be unknown to human beings. As a specific example of such general architectures, random convolutional nodes and a pooling structure are implemented in this paper. Experimental results on the NORB dataset, a benchmark for object recognition, show that compared with conventional deep learning solutions, the proposed local receptive fields based ELM (ELM-LRF) reduces the error rate from 6.5% to 2.7% and increases the learning speed up to 200 times.","1556-603X;1556603X","","10.1109/MCI.2015.2405316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083684","","Approximation methods;Feature extraction;Feedforward neural networks;Iterative methods;Learning systems;Network architecture;Neural networks;Probability distribution;Regression analysis;Training","approximation theory;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","ELM networks;ELM-LRF;NORB dataset;SLFN;continuous probability distribution;feature clustering;feature learning;generalized single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks;local receptive field based extreme learning machine;object recognition;unified learning solutions;universal approximation;universal classification capability","","41","","66","","","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Soil moisture is affected not only by previous time sequence of soil moisture, but also by weather factors. In this paper, a novel method, which integrates weather factors with time series of soil moisture, to predict soil moisture is proposed. In order to improve the prediction accuracy and effectiveness, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which is a simple, reliable, efficient single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks with fast learning speed and good generalization ability, is employed to simulate the relationship between future soil moisture and the above mentioned impact factors. Based on large-scale datasets obtained from the Dookie apple orchard in Victoria, Australia, the results show that the model can accurately predict the future trends of soil moisture and this can be a useful decision support for future irrigation scheduling. In contrast to Support Vector Machine (SVM) which is the conventional method of soil moisture forecasting, ELM has higher prediction accuracy and greater forecast range with fast learning speed.","2376-5933;23765933","Electronic:978-1-4799-4719-5; POD:978-1-4673-6954-1","10.1109/CCIS.2014.7175768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7175768","extreme learning machine (ELM);soil moisture prediction;support vector machine (SVM)","Artificial neural networks;Meteorology;Moisture;Monitoring;Predictive models;Soil moisture;Support vector machines","agricultural products;feedforward neural nets;food products;learning (artificial intelligence);moisture measurement","Dookie apple orchard;ELM;extreme learning machine;single-hidden layer feed-forward neural networks;soil moisture prediction;support vector machine","","0","","11","","","27-29 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research suggested the use of L2-norm regularization to enhance the sparsity of the output layer. This paper proposes the use of the L1-norm LASSO formulation, since the L1-norm promotes sparsity in the solution of the output layer weights and it has been shown to produce the sparsest solutions in many applications.

OL-ELM-RPLS is an improvement to the online sequential extreme learning machine based on recursive least-squares (OS-ELM-RLS) introduced in [1]. Like in the batch extreme learning machine (ELM), in OS-ELM-RLS the input weights of a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN) are randomly generated, however the output weights are obtained by a recursive least-squares (RLS) solution. However, due to multicollinearities in the columns of the hidden-layer output matrix caused by the presence of redundant input variables or by a large number of hidden-layer neurons, the problem of estimation the output weights can become ill-conditioned. In order to circumvent or mitigate such ill-conditioning problem, it is proposed to replace the RLS method by the recursive partial least-squares (RPLS) method. The identification methodology is proposed for two application problems: (1) construction of a inferential model, and (2) the learning of a model for the Generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm. The integration of the proposed adaptive identification method with the GPC results in an adaptive predictive control methodology. To validate and demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methodologies, they are applied on modeling of two public regression data sets and on control of the flow through a simulated valve.","1553-572X;1553572X","Electronic:978-1-4799-4032-5; POD:978-1-4799-4031-8; USB:978-1-4799-4033-2","10.1109/IECON.2014.7048477","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7048477","","Adaptation models;Input variables;Neurons;Predictive control;Predictive models;Tin;Vectors","adaptive control;feedforward neural nets;identification;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;least squares approximations;neurocontrollers;predictive control;regression analysis","GPC algorithm;OS-ELM-RPLS;SLFN;adaptive identification;adaptive predictive control methodology;batch extreme learning machine;generalized predictive control;hidden-layer neurons;hidden-layer output matrix;identification methodology;ill-conditioning problem;inferential model;multicollinearities;online sequential extreme learning machine;output weights;recursive partial least-squares method;redundant input variables;regression data sets;single-hidden layer feedforward neural network","","0","","19","","","Oct. 29 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, RP may not yield highly discriminative low-dimensional space to produce best pattern classification performance since the random transformation matrix of RP is independent of data. In this paper, we propose a Semi-Random Projection (SRP) framework, which takes the merit of random feature sampling of RP, but employs learning mechanism in the determination of the transformation matrix. One advantage of SRP is that it achieves a good balance between computational complexity and classification accuracy. Another advantage of SRP is that multiple SRP modules can be stacked to form a deep learning architecture for compact and robust feature learning. In addition, based on the insight on the relationship between RP and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), the SRP is applied to ELM to derive Partially Connected ELM (PC-ELM). The hidden nodes of PC-ELM are more discriminative and hence a smaller number of nodes are needed. Experiments on two real-world text corpus, i.e., 20 Newsgroups and Farms Ads., verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed SRP. Experimental results also show that PC-ELM outperforms ELM for high-dimensional data.","1556-603X;1556603X","","10.1109/MCI.2015.2437316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7160856","","Computational efficiency;Computer architecture;Data mining;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;sampling methods","PC-ELM;classification accuracy;computational complexity;deep learning architecture;dimensionality reduction;extreme learning machine;farms ads;high-dimensional space;multiple SRP modules;news-groups;partially connected ELM;pattern classification performance;random feature sampling;random transformation matrix;real-world text corpus;robust feature learning;semirandom projection","","1","","23","","","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The classical ELM model consists of a linear combination of a fixed number of nonlinear expansions of the input vector. Learning in ELM is hence equivalent to finding the optimal weights that minimize the error on a dataset. The update works in batch mode, either with explicit feature mappings or with implicit mappings defined by kernels. Although an online version has been proposed for the former, no work has been done up to this point for the latter, and whether an efficient learning algorithm for online kernel-based ELM exists remains an open problem. By explicating some connections between nonlinear adaptive filtering and ELM theory, in this brief, we present an algorithm for this task. In particular, we propose a straightforward extension of the well-known kernel recursive least-squares, belonging to the kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) family, to the ELM framework. We call the resulting algorithm the kernel online sequential ELM (KOS-ELM). Moreover, we consider two different criteria used in the KAF field to obtain sparse filters and extend them to our context. We show that KOS-ELM, with their integration, can result in a highly efficient algorithm, both in terms of obtained generalization error and training time.

Water level of UTSG systems is predicted in a one-step-ahead fashion using nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) topology. Modeling data are generated using a well-known and widely accepted dynamic model reported in the literature. Model performances are analyzed with different number of neurons for the neural network and with different number of rules for the fuzzy system. UTSG models are built at different reactor power levels as well as full range that corresponds to all reactor operating powers.

The salient feature of ELM is that the input parameters can be randomly generated instead of being exhaustively tuned, and thus saving a great deal of computational expenses. However, the architecture of ELM has a great impact on its generalization performance and is traditionally determined by a trial and error manner. Therefore selecting an appropriate ELM architecture becomes the crucial problem in the successful application of ELM. In this paper, we propose a Robust Incremental ELM (RI-ELM), a constructive method where the hidden nodes are added one by one. We consider RI-ELM as a robust algorithm, because the suitable architecture is selected based on the Leave-One-Out (LOO) Cross-Validation procedure, a nearly unbiased and reliable criterion, but with notorious slow implementation speed. To tackle this speed issue, we propose an efficient formula that can incrementally update the LOO error with every new hidden node recruited, thus RI-ELM can secure the speed advantage of ELM and achieve good and robust performance. Furthermore, RI-ELM requires nearly zero user intervention since the architecture is automatically determined.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5199-4; POD:978-1-4799-5200-7; USB:978-1-4799-5198-7","10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064373","","Artificial neural networks;Computer architecture;Presses;Robustness;Testing;Training","feedforward neural nets;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence)","ELM architecture;LOO error;RI-ELM algorithm;constructive method;generalization performance;hidden node;leave-one-out cross-validation procedure;randomly generated parameter;robust incremental extreme learning machine;single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks","","0","","23","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They have been widely used to represent various network systems, such as social networks, biological networks and etc. Knowledge discovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the major challenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract useful information from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topic either use selected topological statistics to represent network structures, or linearly map node attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space. However, while approaches based on statistics may miss critical patterns in network structure, approaches based on linear mappings may not be sufficient to capture the non-linear characteristics of nodes and links. To handle the challenge, we propose, to our knowledge, the first deep learning method to learn from linked data. A restricted Boltzmann machine model named LRBM is developed for representation learning on linked data. In LRBM, we aim to extract the latent feature representation of each node from both node attributes and network structures, non-linearly map each pair of nodes to the links, and use hidden units to control the mapping. The details of how to adapt LRBM for link prediction and node classification on linked data have also been presented. In the experiments, we test the performance of LRBM as well as other baselines on link prediction and node classification. Overall, the extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed LRBM model in mining linked data.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-1-4799-4302-9; POD:978-1-4799-4301-2","10.1109/ICDM.2014.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023347","Deep Learning;Linked Data;Representation Learning;Restricted Boltzmann Machine","Data mining;Data models;Feature extraction;Probability distribution;Receivers;Social network services;Tensile stress","Boltzmann machines;data mining;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","LRBM;Linked Data mining;deep learning method;knowledge discovery;latent feature representation;representation learning;restricted Boltzmann machine model","","0","","35","","","14-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MMKL-RVM achieves sparsity without the constraint of having a binary class problem and provides probabilistic outputs for class membership instead of the hard binary decisions given by the traditional SVM. Most importantly, MMKL-RVM enables informative integration of possibly heterogeneous informative data or feature spaces in a multitude of ways, from the simple summation of feature expansions to weighted product of kernels. Additionally, Genetic Algorithm (GA) combined with K-fold Cross Validation (K-CV) method is adopted to optimize the kernels parameters in order to enhance the performance of the MMKL-RVM.

In these approaches, tracking problem is treated as an online classification problem, where the object classifier model is updated in the current frame to be used for classification process in the next frame. One of the approaches is based on Tracking-Learning-Detection (TLD) framework, where a combination of generative tracker and discriminative detector models are used for tracking process. In TLD, a cascaded detector with three stages is used to localize the tracked object in the current frame and correct the tracker if necessary. The second stage of the cascaded classifier uses a randomized ensembles classifier. This classifier relies on simple pixel comparison that may not offer a good feature value to well generalize for the new appearances of the object in the detection process. In this paper, we introduce online sequential - extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) to obtain a more generalized detector in TLD framework. In our approach, the ensemble classifier in TLD framework is replaced with OS - ELM based on pixel feature values. OS-ELM provides good generalization performance with the ability to detect and track a target object in sequential frames besides the ability to learn online data arriving sequentially with different sizes. A series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach to compare with the existing TLD with ensemble classifier. The results show that the proposed approach is able to offer better performance in six videos out of nine videos with better generalization.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7862-5; POD:978-1-4799-7863-2","10.1109/ASCC.2015.7244867","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7244867","OS-ELM;TLD;Tracking systems;generalization;object detection","Computer vision;Conferences;Detectors;Tracking;Training;Videos;Visualization","computer vision;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object tracking;target tracking","OS-ELM;TLD framework;adaptive tracking-by-detection approaches;cascaded detector;computer vision;discriminative detector models;generative tracker model;object classifier model;online classification problem;online sequential-extreme learning machine based detector;pixel feature values;randomized ensemble classifier;target object detection;target object tracking;training-learning-detection framework","","0","","27","","","May 31 2015-June 3 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, a popular approach requires the learned function to be smooth on the underlying data manifold. By approximating this manifold as a weighted graph, such graph-based techniques can often achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, their high time and space complexities make them less attractive on large data sets. In this paper, we propose to scale up graph-based semisupervised learning using a set of sparse prototypes derived from the data. These prototypes serve as a small set of data representatives, which can be used to approximate the graph-based regularizer and to control model complexity. Consequently, both training and testing become much more efficient. Moreover, when the Gaussian kernel is used to define the graph affinity, a simple and principled method to select the prototypes can be obtained. Experiments on a number of real-world data sets demonstrate encouraging performance and scaling properties of the proposed approach. It also compares favorably with models learned via ℓ<sub>1</sub>-regularization at the same level of model sparsity.

The adaptation is done according to the user's need by employing an online sequential extreme learning (OS-ELM) to learn the training data chunk by chunk. OS-ELM enables the myoelectric system to learn from a small number of data to avoid cumbersome training process. The day-to-day experiment shows that the proposed system can maintain its performance on average accuracy around 85% whereas the non-adaptive system could not.","1094-687X;1094687X","DVD:978-1-4244-9270-1; Electronic:978-1-4244-9271-8; POD:978-1-4244-9269-5","10.1109/EMBC.2015.7320069","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320069","","Electrodes;Electromyography;Pattern recognition;Robustness;Thumb;Training data","biomedical electrodes;electromyography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern recognition;signal classification","OS-ELM;cumbersome training process;electrode shift;finger movement classification;nonadaptive system;online sequential extreme learning machine;robust myoelectric pattern-recognition-system;training data chunk","","2","","10","","","25-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two levels of fusion (i.e., feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion) are applied to the extracted LBP features along with global Gabor features and original spectral features, where feature-level fusion involves concatenation of multiple features before the pattern classification process while decision-level fusion performs on probability outputs of each individual classification pipeline and soft-decision fusion rule is adopted to merge results from the classifier ensemble.

Due to they importance, several researchers have investigated how to predict future market movements by using both statistical and soft computing methods based on historical time series data. However, as a typical data stream, financial time series frequently present concept drift, which is a change in the relationship between input data and the target variable over time. The concept drift phenomenon affects negatively the forecasting accuracy since the learned model becomes outdated after a change in the current concept. In this paper we investigate how to handle concept drift in financial time series prediction in order to improve the forecasting accuracy. Two explicit drift detector mechanisms, namely the Drift Detection Mechanism (DDM) and the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average for Concept Drift Detection Mechanism (ECDD), were investigated. The main contribution of this work is an approach that combines Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELM) with explicit drift detection, in which the OS-ELM updates the decision model just in the presence of concept drift in data. Experimental results showed that the use of drift detection was able to speed up the prediction time of OS-ELM maintaining equivalent accuracy.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4799-1960-4; POD:978-1-4799-1961-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280721","","Computational modeling;Data models;Predictive models","data handling;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);moving average processes;stock markets;time series","ECDD;OS-ELM;concept drift handling;exponentially weighted moving average for concept drift detection mechanism;financial market;financial time series prediction;online sequential extreme learning machine","","1","","28","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several elegant learning methods/models related to Class RBM have been proposed. This paper proposes and analyzes a Rényi divergence based generalization for discriminative learning objective of Class RBM. Specifically, we extend the Conditional Log Likelihood (CLL) objective to a general learning criterion. We prove that, some existing popular training methods can be derived from this generalization, via adjusting the parameters to specific values. Intuitively, the regularization with different settings of parameters constrain the learned RBM distribution in different ways, and the parameter setting that provide a suitable distribution constraints for a particular sample set leads to the optimal performance. Moreover, we show that this generalized criterion actually extends the CLL objective with a Rényi divergence-based regularization. The uniform distribution used in this divergence-based regularization can be replaced by some sample-based distribution. This modification is applicable to any specific case of the general objective, and we call the appended loss as general margin. The proposed generalization enables an effective model selection procedure and experiments on human face recognition and document classification achieved significant performance improvement over the existing learning methods. It is also shown empirically that general margin loss is able to stabilize the parameter sensitivity and further improve the performance of the classifiers.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-4274-9; POD:978-1-4799-4273-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7022663","Classification RBM;Discriminative Learning;Rényi Divergence","Databases;Educational institutions;Error analysis;Face recognition;Learning systems;Linear programming;Training","Boltzmann machines;document handling;face recognition;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical distributions","CLL objective;Class RBM;Rényi divergence based generalization;Rényi divergence-based regularization;classification RBM;classification restricted Boltzmann machines;conditional log likelihood objective;discriminative learning objective;distribution constraint;document classification;general learning criterion;human face recognition;learning method;learning model;parameter sensitivity;probabilistic interpretation;sample-based distribution;training method","","1","","14","","","14-14 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous studies exploited Q-learning techniques to discriminate neural states into simple directional actions providing the trial initial timing. However, the movements in BMI applications can be quite complicated, and the action timing explicitly shows the intention when to move. The rich actions and the corresponding neural states form a large state-action space, imposing generalization difficulty on Q-learning. In this paper, we propose to adopt attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL) as a new learning scheme for BMIs to adaptively decode high-dimensional neural activities into seven distinct movements (directional moves, holdings and resting) due to the efficient weight-updating. We apply AGREL on neural data recorded from M1 of a monkey to directly predict a seven-action set in a time sequence to reconstruct the trajectory of a center-out task. Compared to Q-learning techniques, AGREL could improve the target acquisition rate to 90.16% in average with faster convergence and more stability to follow neural activity over multiple days, indicating the potential to achieve better online decoding performance for more complicated BMI tasks.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2341275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863657","Attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL);brain-machine interfaces (BMIs);neural control;trajectory tracking","Biomedical engineering;Decoding;Educational institutions;Firing;Learning (artificial intelligence);Timing;Trajectory","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;trajectory control","BMI applications;Q-learning techniques;attention-gated reinforcement learning;attention-gated reinforcement learning-based brain machine interfaces;center-out task;clinical applications;directional moves;high-dimensional neural activities;holdings;neural control;neural data recording;neural states;resting;simple directional actions;state-action space;target acquisition rate;tracking task;trial initial timing","0","3","","46","","20140724","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper proposes a novel dimensionality reduction constituted from the integration of extreme learning machine (ELM) and spectral regression (SR). The ELM in the proposed method is built on the structure of the unsupervised ELM. The hidden layer weights are determined randomly while the output weight is calculated using the spectral regression. The flexibility of the SR that can take labels into consideration leads a new supervised dimensionality reduction called SRELM. Generally speaking, SRELM is an unsupervised system in term of ELM yet it is a supervised system in term of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, SRELM is implemented in the finger movement classification based on electromyography signals from two channels. The experimental results show that the SRELM can enhance the performance of its predecessor, spectral regression linear discriminant analysis (SRDA) because it has better class separability than SRDA. In addition, its performance is better than principal component analysis (PCA) and comparable to uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis (ULDA).","1948-3546;19483546","Electronic:978-1-4673-6389-1; POD:978-1-4673-6387-7","10.1109/NER.2015.7146750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7146750","","Accuracy;Electromyography;Feature extraction;Linear discriminant analysis;Principal component analysis;Thumb","biomechanics;electromyography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;principal component analysis;regression analysis;signal classification","PCA;dimensionality reduction;electromyography signals;extreme learning machine;finger movement classification;hidden layer weights;high-dimensional feature;low-dimensional feature;predecessor;principal component analysis;sEMG;spectral regression linear discriminant analysis;supervised dimensionality reduction;uncorrelated linear discriminant analysis","","2","","18","","","22-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it is hard to apply a deep learning method to medical images because the deep learning method needs a large number of training data to train the deep neural network. Medical image datasets such as X-ray CT image datasets do not have enough training data because of privacy. In this article, we propose a method that re-uses the network trained on non-medical images (source domain) to improve performance even if we have a small number of medical images (target domain). Our proposed method firstly trains the deep neural network for solving the source task using the MPDBM. Secondly, we evaluate the relation between the source domain and the target domain. To evaluate the relation, we input the target domain into the deep neural network trained on the source domain. Then, we compute the histograms based on the response of the output layer. After computing the histograms, we select the variables of the output layer corresponding to the target domain. Then, we tune the parameters in such a way that the selected variables respond as the outputs of the target domain. In this article, we use the MNIST dataset as the source domain and the lung dataset of the X-ray CT images as the target domain.

Enhancing the accuracy of UXO detection has multiple benefits, especially in the areas of cost savings and safety.

Libraries of total field magnetic (TFM) responses were calculated using finite element modeling for three UXO types found at a Montana National Guard training site. UXO model parameters were varied over ranges of azimuth, declination, and depth resulting in approximately 600 models per UXO type. The modeled responses of finite-element model (FEM) and actual TFM field data were then used as training data in discrimination and classification approaches comparing neural networks (NN), random forests (RF), and support vector machines (SVMs). The prediction targets in the training process comprised three classes: 1) binary [UXO or noninteresting object (NIO)]; 2) multiclass (UXO round type and NIO); and 3) classes derived from multiclass self-organizing feature map (SOFM) analysis.

McFELM has two components: the cognitive component and the meta-cognitive component. The cognitive component is a fuzzy extreme learning machine which learn sequential data in a one-by-one mode or a chunk-by-chunk mode with fixed or varying chunk size, while the meta-cognitive component controls the learning process of the cognitive component using a self-regulating mechanism to decide what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn. Unlike the OS-Fuzzy-ELM algorithm which uses all arriving samples to update the output weight matrix, the proposed algorithm employs different strategies namely sample deletion, sample reserve and sample learning strategy to decide whether the data will be deleted directly, reserved for later use or used immediately. Instantaneous error is used to select the best learning strategy. The evaluation of McFELM is presented doing simulations on a nonlinear system identification problem and a set of benchmark regression problems from UCI machine leaning repository.

On the other hand, the previously commonly used hand-crafted features also encodes the prior knowledge about the data. By realizing that the hand-crafted features and machine learnt features actually characterize the different aspects of image data, rather than only using one type of feature, we propose to jointly use the machine learnt features and hand-crafted features for RGB-D object recognition. Specifically, we use the Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract the machine learnt representation, and use Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC) based spatial pyramid matching for hand-crafted features.

In fact, for some large real problems, it is accepted that after tremendous learning time (within finite epochs), the network output error of SLFN will stop or reduce increasingly slowly. This report offers an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based learning method, referred to as the parent-offspring progressive learning method. The proposed method works by separating the data points into various parts, and then multiple ELMs learn and identify the clustered parts separately. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms as compared to the traditional supervised methods are twofold. First, it extends the ELM learning method from a single neural network to a multinetwork learning system, as the proposed multiELM method can approximate any target continuous function and classify disjointed regions. Second, the proposed method tends to deliver a similar or much better generalization performance than other learning methods. All the methods proposed in this paper are tested on both artificial and real datasets.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2352594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6894163","Data partition learning;extreme learning machine (ELM);learning accuracy;universal approximation","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Learning systems;Partitioning algorithms;Testing;Training;Training data","feedforward neural nets;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","ELM-based learning method;SLFN;data partition learning;extreme learning machines;generalization performance;learning time;multinetwork learning system;parent-offspring progressive learning method;single-layer-feedforward-network","","6","","40","","20140908","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, the progressive learning machine-a new learning algorithm based on multi-NNs-is proposed for general hybrid nonlinear/linear system approximation.

Routine inspection and maintenance of wind turbines has become a challenge in order to improve reliability and reduce the energy of cost; thus adopting an efficient condition monitoring approach of wind turbines is desirable. This paper adopts extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithms to achieve condition monitoring of wind turbines based on a model-based condition monitoring approach. Compared with the traditional gradient-based training algorithm widely used in the single-hidden layer feed forward neural network, ELM can randomly choose the input weights and hidden biases and need not be tuned in the training process. Therefore, ELM algorithm can dramatically reduce learning time. Models are identified using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data acquired from an operational wind farm, which contains data of the temperature of gearbox oil sump, gearbox oil exchange and generator winding. The results show that the proposed method can efficiently identify faults of wind turbines.","","Electronic:978-0-9926-8011-4; POD:978-1-4799-8656-9","10.1109/IConAC.2015.7313974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7313974","SCADA data;Wind turbines;artificial neural network;condition monitoring;extreme learning machine;model-based approach","Condition monitoring;Data models;Generators;Predictive models;Temperature distribution;Wind turbines;Windings","SCADA systems;condition monitoring;electric generators;gears;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;wind turbines","ELM;SCADA data;energy cost reduction;extreme learning machine;fault identification;gearbox oil exchange;gearbox oil sump;generator winding;model-based condition monitoring approach;operational wind farm;routine inspection;supervisory control and data acquisition data;wind turbine maintenance","","","","12","","","11-12 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The extreme learning machine (ELM) is embedded in the process of linear PLS modeling. Thus the linear PLS modeling is transformed into the nonlinear frame which can deal with nonlinear data. The multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear modeling task is decomposed into two parts: the external linear modeling and inner univariate nonlinear modeling problems. The linear PLS method is used to establish the external model, while the extreme learning machine is used to capture the inner nonlinear model. Compared to the standard PLS method, the method in this paper has the potential of modeling any continuous nonlinear relationship and has better robust properties. And it is less time-consuming than other neural networks PLS (NNPLS) methods. Because extreme learning machine can capture the inner nonlinearity of data, the proposed method has better prediction performance than linear PLS regression method. Simulation verifies the better prediction performance and the validity of the proposed method.","","Electronic:978-9-8815-6389-7; POD:978-1-4673-7443-9","10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7260180","Linear PLS model;NNPLS;extreme learning machine;nonlinear PLS","Artificial neural networks;Data models;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Training","MIMO systems;learning systems;least squares approximations;nonlinear control systems;robust control","ELM;MIMO nonlinear modeling task;NNPLS methods;continuous nonlinear relationship;data nonlinearity;external linear modeling;extreme learning machine;inner univariate nonlinear modeling problems;linear PLS regression method;multiinput-multioutput nonlinear modeling task;neural networks PLS;nonlinear PLS modeling method;partial least squares;prediction performance;robust properties","","","","13","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for solar radiation estimation has become a significant feature in the design of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Recently, the most popular method used to estimate solar radiation is artificial neural network (ANN). However, a new approach, called the extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is a new learning method of feed forward neural network with one hidden layer or known as Single Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network (SLFN). In this research, ELM and a multilayer feed-forward network with back propagation are implemented to estimate hourly solar radiation on horizontal surface in Surabaya. In contrast to previous researches, this study has emphasized the use of meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and direction of speed as inputs for ANN and ELM model in estimating solar radiation. The MSE and learning rate has been used to measure the performance of two methods. The simulation results showed that the ELM model built had best performance for 400 nodes in which MSE and learning rate achieved were 5,88e-14 and 0,0156 second, respectively. The values were much smaller compared with the results of ANN. Overall, the ELM provided a better performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6432-1; POD:978-1-4799-6433-8","10.1109/ICITACEE.2014.7065774","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065774","Photovoltaic;artificial neural network;extreme learning machine;radiation estimation","Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Equations;Mathematical model;Testing;Wind speed","backpropagation;feedforward neural nets;mean square error methods;photovoltaic power systems;power engineering computing;solar power","ANN;ELM algorithm;ELM model;Java;SLFN;Surabaya;artificial neural network;extreme learning machine algorithm;extreme learning machine approach;generating energy;hourly solar radiation estimation;multilayer feed-forward network;photovoltaic performance;single hidden layer feed forward neural network","","0","","11","","","8-8 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
