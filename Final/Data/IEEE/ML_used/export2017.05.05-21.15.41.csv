This paper introduces a new feedback network model to investigate the phase transitions other than the cellular automata model used in the past. The experiments show that the resource competition and delay feedback in traffic flow control play important roles on the emergence of phase transitions. The transition points are also proved to be in sensitive to network sizes in the simulation. The criterion of the phase transition points and the boundaries of the link's bandwidth utilization near these points are also studied. The packet's increasing rate, decreasing rate and the switching probability between these two policies are three key factors affecting network behaviors. The network can be adjusted to just below the critical point by these three factors to get better performance and resource utilization while still keeping it stable.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378516","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378516","","Analytical models;Automatic control;Communication system traffic control;Computational modeling;Computer network management;Computer networks;Computer simulation;Feedback;Robust control;Traffic control","computer network management;packet switching;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic","computer networks;congestion control;delay feedback;feedback network model;packet switching probability;phase transition;robust control;traffic flow control;traffic management","","0","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A simple and straight multivariate statistical model based on double moving window mechanism is used for online monitoring the progress of sequencing batch reactor for wastewater treatment. It replaces an invariant fixed-model monitoring approach with adaptive updating model data within batch-to-batch, which overcomes the problem of changing operation condition and slow time-varying-behavior of industrial processes. It replaces an whole static model with multiple local models along time axis, which copies seamlessly with variable run length and need not estimate any deviations of the ongoing batch from the average trajectories.

HMMs are applied to model the normal program behaviors using traces of system calls issued by processes. The output probability of a sequence of system calls is calculated by the normal model built. If the probability of a sequence in a trace is below a certain threshold, the sequence is flagged as a mismatch. If the ratio between the mismatches and all the sequences in a trace exceeds another threshold, the trace is then considered as a possible intrusion.

Analysis results reveal that CPU-times of the three modified heuristics can be saved by about 33.3%, 50% and 50% of those of FL, WY and RZ respectively, which is valuable for practical flow shops with large sizes.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382324","","Application software;Automation;Computer science;Fluid flow measurement;Iterative algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Manufacturing systems;Polynomials;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm","flow shop scheduling;job production systems;minimisation;production engineering computing","CPU-time;fast flowtime-computing procedure;flow shops;flowtime minimization;manufacturing system","","0","","15","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FEA can generate massive data, in which large amounts of usefully implicit knowledge is hidden. Thus, knowledge acquisition from them is prospective to ease the above difficulties by applying knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) technology. In this study, the characteristics of the FEA data are discussed firstly. Then a framework of knowledge discovery from FEA data is proposed. Correspondingly, a data-mining algorithm named fuzzy-rough algorithm is developed to deal with the FEA simulation data. Finally, the stamping process of a square-cup part was studied as an example.

Task decomposition and task allocation cannot be done in a sequential order but should be interleaved. The dependencies among the tasks and, hence, between the agents that collaborate is extracted from the task decomposition and converted into rules. A team space, based on a blackboard-like architecture manages dependencies through these rules represented in the rule base.

AFS theory can be used to study the natural language and the law of human thinking and also can be easily operated by computers. In AFS theory, the mathematical structures of fuzzy concepts have been studied by the EI algebra, a molecular lattice defined by Wang Guojun (1992), and AFS structures which are super-graph. It is proved that any fuzzy concept on the finite universe of discourse is the EI representations of some simple concepts. In this paper, the authors define the base of the EI algebra and EI independence and apply them to study the algebraic structures of the EI algebra. The authors also give some propositions about the base for some EI algebra. All these can be applied in structure analysis of concepts. The base of sub algebra of EI algebra can simplify the EI algebra representations of human concepts and improve the intelligent capability of computer.

Based on system division, the criticality of equipment in same level is evaluated and maintenance strategies of equipment are decided based on the criticality index. To the equipment using condition based maintenance strategy, the condition is evaluated and predicted by fully using the operating parameters, condition monitoring parameters and the residual life is estimated.

First the MAKLINK graph is built to describe the working space of the mobile robot; then the Dijkstra algorithm is used to obtain the shortest path from the start point to the goal point in the graph, finally the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted to get the optimal path. Aiming at the shortcoming of the PSO algorithm, that is, easily plunging into the local minimum, this paper puts forward an advanced PSO algorithm with the mutation operator. By adding a mutation operator to the algorithm, it can not only escape the attraction of the local minimum in the later convergence phase, but also maintain the characteristic of fast speed in the early phase.

First it is demonstrated that the assumption that the component in ICA should be random variable can be relaxed to stochastic process as in TICA, and the classical ICA methods can also be available to TICA. Secondly, the influence of innovation process on the two crucial requirements, i.e., statistical independency and nongaussianity, is discussed. The analyses show that it has little impact on the former but can increase the nongaussianity of latent component, which leads to much faster convergence in optimal algorithms.

However, RAID cannot work well when two more disks fail and the distance it can reach is very limited. This paper presents a novel distributed cooperative fault-tolerance storage mechanism: co-store. Co-store consolidates disk space of individual node into a single storage spool and implements file-sharing and fault-tolerance through the cooperation of the nodes, in which a node provides as well as shares service. In co-store, file is stored in form of original file fragments and their XOR verification fragments are among the nodes of the network. File is available even when a part of nodes fail.

Attributes only in the cover-base set can be rejected from IS immediately while computation of DS is accomplished and the remained reduction is only processed in no-base set. The reducing process is based on the implicated knowledge in DS and SS: which attribute can be rejected or not, is determined by DS (every element in DS should not be empty) and which attribute to reject is more reasonable (optimal) is determined by SS (the corresponding overlapness should be the minimum one). Being a heuristic search algorithm in reducing knowledge, it takes not only the difference but also the similitude in IS into account.

The effectiveness of the algorithms is demonstrated by some typical examples.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382165","","Automation;Banking;Cybernetics;Equations;Information systems;Knowledge representation;Machine learning;NP-complete problem;Partitioning algorithms;Set theory","computational complexity;decision tables;rough set theory","NP-complete problem;decision table;knowledge reduction;rough set theory","","4","","7","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since Pawlak's upper and lower approximate operator can be interpreted as the closure and interior operator of a special topological space, the counterparts of quasi-discrete closure space play similar roles in the context of the generalized rough set theory based on relation. We also discuss some relevant properties of these two spaces.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382166","","Artificial intelligence;Cybernetics;Intelligent systems;Knowledge representation;Machine learning;Set theory;Topology","approximation theory;rough set theory;topology","binary relation;generalized rough approximate space;quasidiscrete closure space;rough set theory","","0","","11","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work presents a new mechanism aimed at solving the problem of intrusion detection information, which uses a pattern with transformation rules describing request for information. Patterns describe the events that the requesting ID components are interested in and transformation rules describe the requested information from events. This mechanism not only improves the efficiency of information communication, but also saves network bandwidth and processing time.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380752","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380752","","Bandwidth;Boolean functions;Cybernetics;Data mining;History;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Radar","information management;security of data","information communication;intrusion detection information;intrusion detection information sharing;network bandwidth","","0","","5","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Effective algorithm of mining frequent itemsets for association rules","Pei-Qi Liu; Zeng-Zhi Li; Yin-Liang Zhao","Inst. of Comput. Archit. & Network, Xi'an Jiaotong Univ., China","Proceedings of 2004 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (IEEE Cat. No.04EX826)","20050124","2004","3","","1447","1451 vol.3","The efficiency of mining association rules is an important field of KDD. The algorithm Apriori is a classical algorithm in mining association rules. It is a breadth first search on the lattice space of itemsets. Though it makes use of anti-monotone of itemsets to reduce searching breadth, the algorithmic complexity of time is still the exponential quantity. In this article, the concepts of the generation and the ordinal itemsets tree are introduced. The ordinal itemsets tree is the dynamic description of mining relation of itemsets, and the vegetal ability of the ordinal itemsets tree is described by the generation. Through the study of the association rules, the conclusion that all frequent itemsets are not all vegetal itemsets and all vegetal itemsets are all frequent itemsets is discovered. With this conclusion, the number of the candidate itemsets can be reduced further to improve the efficiency of mining association rules and reduce the searching breadth. According to the generation, the AprioriFREQ algorithm, which is the improvement algorithm of Apriori, is designed in this article. By testing, the efficiency of the AprioriFREQ algorithm is obviously higher than the Apriori's.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382001","","Algorithm design and analysis;Association rules;Computer architecture;Data mining;Electronic mail;Itemsets;Machine learning algorithms;Mice;Testing;Transaction databases","computational complexity;data mining;tree searching","AprioriFREQ algorithm;KDD;algorithmic time complexity;breadth first search;candidate itemsets;frequent itemsets;lattice space;mining association rules;ordinal itemsets tree;searching breadth reduction;vegetal itemsets","","1","","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
