We present two new approaches consisting of machine learning algorithms based on artificial neural networks (NET) and the classification and regression tree classifiers (CART), and compare their performance with earlier work that employs multi-Stage feature vector testing (FVT) approach. A combined total of over 100,000 noise and NRW up-call events were used in the study. Calls were primarily recorded from two areas, Cape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Of the three classifiers, the CART had the highest assignment rates, overall 86.45% with highest false positive rates (<;100 per hour). The FVT Method had exceptionally low false positive rates, with <;50 per hour. However, it had an overall assignment rate less than the NET. The CART had statistically the same false positive rate as the NET with the highest assignment rates, 2.2% higher than the NET and 11.75% greater than the FVT Method. Details of the results are shown and extensions to the research are discussed.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5550-8; POD:978-1-4244-5548-5","10.1109/LISAT.2010.5478268","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5478268","Acoustic Monitoring;Artifical Neural Network;Automated Detection;Classfication Regression Tree;Right Whale","Acoustic noise;Acoustic signal detection;Acoustic signal processing;Classification tree analysis;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Noise level;Signal processing algorithms;Whales","acoustic signal processing;aquaculture;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Eubalaena glacialis;acoustic signal processing;artificial neural networks;classification tree classifiers;machine learning;marine mammals;north atlantic right whale;passive acoustic monitoring","","10","","19","","","7-7 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an auxiliary tool, multimedia learning machine (MLM) is welcomed by foreign language learners. So, it is very necessary to design a powerful MLM efficiently. How to deal with the state transition of MLM's different states is a key issue. In this paper, we describe a solution to design a MLM based on non-deterministic finite automaton (MLM-NFA) and present in detail the state transition model, state transition diagram and the core algorithm. The finite automaton helps us distinguish clearly the relation of state transitions of MLM and the mapping between MLM states and buttons in MLM user interfaces. The MLM-NFA has many advanced functions, such as point-to-read, A-B repeating and role playing. At the end of the paper, we implement an MLM-NFA which proves that the model based on non-deterministic finite automaton principle is quite efficient in practice and makes it very simple and flexible in development.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6349-7; POD:978-1-4244-6347-3","10.1109/ICCET.2010.5485754","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5485754","AB-repeating;FA;Multimedia learning machine;point-to-read;role-playing","Algorithm design and analysis;Education;Educational institutions;Learning automata;Machine learning;Microcomputers;Natural languages;Power engineering and energy;User interfaces;Writing","computer aided instruction;finite automata;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing","A-B repeating;core algorithm;foreign language learners;international communications;multimedia learning machine;nondeterministic finite automaton;point-to-read;role playing;state transition diagram;state transition model","","0","","5","","","16-18 April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In being able to predict the types of traffic that nodes might generate, preference can be given to high priority, latency sensitive traffic. Traditionally, a home had a single computer utilizing a link to the Internet. In recent years this single computer was replaced by a multitude of smart devices with the same ultimate goal: embedding the user into the social fabric of the Internet. With the home still connected via a single link, these nodes are all contending for bandwidth and a novel QoS scheme is needed. In this paper, various models characterizing packet flow on a network will be developed. These are subsequently used to predict as accurately as possible, the immediate future traffic classes to be expected from nodes. This will eventually be used as a dynamic QoS criteria for pre-emptively assigning transmission slots to specific hosts. A number of techniques to accomplish this important task of node traffic pattern prediction, are presented.

A grasp of emotions in songs might be a great help for us to effectively discover music. In this paper, we aimed at automatically classifying moods of songs based on lyrics and metadata, and proposed several methods for supervised learning of classifiers. In future, we plan to use automatically identified moods of songs as metadata in our music search engine. Mood categories in a famous contest about Audio Music Mood Classification (MIREX 2007) are applied for our system. The training data is collected from a LiveJournal blog site in which each blog entry is tagged with a mood and a song. Then three kinds of machine learning algorithms are applied for training classifiers: SVM, Naive Bayes and Graph-based methods. The experiments showed that artist, sentiment words, putting more weight for words in chorus and title parts are effective for mood classification. Graph-based method promises a good improvement if we have rich relationship information among songs.","","POD:978-1-4244-5086-2","10.1109/KSE.2009.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5361715","machine learning;mood classification;music information retrieval;text categorization","Humans;Information services;Internet;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mood;Search engines;Supervised learning;Training data;Web sites","Bayes methods;Web sites;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;music;pattern classification;search engines;support vector machines","LiveJournal blog site;SVM;audio music mood classification;graph-based methods;machine learning approaches;metadata;mood categories;mood classification;music search engine;naive Bayes methods;song lyrics;supervised learning","","3","","13","","","13-17 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the underlying microarchitecture changes from one generation to the next, the compiler must be retuned to optimise specifically for that new system. It may take several releases of the compiler to effectively exploit a processor's performance potential, by which time a new generation has appeared and the process starts again. We address this challenge by developing a portable optimising compiler. Our approach employs machine learning to automatically learn the best optimisations to apply for any new program on a new microarchitectural configuration. It achieves this by learning a model off-line which maps a microarchitecture description plus the hardware counters from a single run of the program to the best compiler optimisation passes. Our compiler gains 67% of the maximum speedup obtainable by an iterative compiler search using 1000 evaluations. We obtain, on average, a 1.16x speedup over the highest default optimisation level across an entire microarchitecture configuration space, achieving a 4.3x speedup in the best case. We demonstrate the robustness of this technique by applying it to an extended microarchitectural space where we achieve comparable performance.","1072-4451;10724451","POD:978-1-60558-798-1","10.1145/1669112.1669124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5375327","architecture/compiler co-design;design-space exploration;machine learning","Computer interfaces;Informatics;Machine learning;Microarchitecture;Microprocessors;Optimization methods;Optimizing compilers;Permission;Portable computers;Program processors","embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimising compilers","embedded program;iterative compiler search;machine learning;microarchitectural configuration;microarchitecture configuration space;microprocessor;portable compiler optimisation;portable optimising compiler","","3","","42","","","12-16 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Porter","Lizzi Center for Biomedical Engineering, Riverside Research Institute, New York, USA","2009 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","20100401","2009","","","527","529","Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a major health concern in many countries. However, it cannot be imaged reliably by any commonly used imaging modality. Therefore, needle biopsies and treatments cannot be targeted to suspicious regions. Our objective is to develop and test an ultrasonic method based on spectrum analysis of radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound echo signals and on classification using current machine-learning tools for reliably imaging PCa and thereby guiding biopsies, targeting therapy, and eventually, monitoring treatment of PCa. RF data were acquired in the biopsy plane of 617 prostate biopsy cores obtained from 64 suspected prostate-cancer (PCa) patients. For each patient, clinical data such as PSA level also were recorded. A level of suspicion (LOS) was assigned based on the conventional image. Spectral computations were performed on acquired RF data in a region of interest that spatially matched the tissue-sampling location. Four non-linear classifiers were trained from these data using biopsy results as the gold standard: multi-layer-perceptron artificial neural networks (ANNs), logitboost algorithms (LBAs), support-vector machines (SVMs), and stacked, restricted Boltzmann machines (S-RBMs). Cross-validation methods were employed to obtain tissue-category scores. Areas under ROC curves (AUCs) were used to assess classifier performance in comparison with LOS-based performance. AUCs for the ANN, LBA, SVM, and RBM respectively were 0.84 ? 0.02, 0.87 ? 0.04, 0.89 ? 0.04, and 0.91 ? 0.04. In comparison, the LOS-based AUC was 0.64 ? 0.03. Tissue-type images (TTIs) based on these methods revealed cancerous foci that subsequently were identified histologically, but were undetected prior to prostatectomy pathology. The ultrasonic imaging methods described here show significant potential for achieving needed reliability.

The difficulty with the conventional unsupervised segmentation lies in finding appropriate features that discriminate a meaningful region from the others. In this paper, the appropriate features are automatically learnt by machine learning with boosting scheme. At the initial step, the image is split into many small regions (blocks at first) and strong classifiers for every region, which discriminate the region from the others, are found by AdaBoosting. Each strong classifier so obtained is the weighted sum of several popular weak classifiers (features), which best describes the coherence of the region and thus well discriminates the region from the others. The output of this classifier is used in designing the energy function for the labeling, in the form of conditional random fields (CRFs). Minimization of the energy function produces the labeling result which reflects the property learnt by the classifier. For the labeling result, the machine learning is again performed and the process iterates until some conditions are met. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides competitive result compared to the conventional feature based methods.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4244-5654-3; POD:978-1-4244-5653-6","10.1109/ICIP.2009.5413758","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5413758","AdaBoost;EM-like minimization;machine learning;unsupervised image segmentation","Boosting;Clustering algorithms;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Labeling;Layout;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Spatial coherence","image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;random processes","AdaBoosting scheme;conditional random fields;machine learning;unsupervised image segmentation algorithm","","1","","10","","","7-10 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Methods and Materials: A large number of plans were generated by varying the DV constraints (input features) on the OARs (multi-plan framework), and the OAR complications in the plans (plan properties) were modeled as a function of the imposed DV constraint settings, which were used as input to machine learning (ML) algorithms. These ML approaches were used to model two OAR complications following head-and-neck and whole pelvis/prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy, xerostomia and grade 2 rectal bleeding. Two-fold cross-validation was used for model verification and mean errors were reported. Results: In the head and neck case, the mean absolute prediction error of the saliva flow rate normalized to the pre-treatment saliva flow rate was 0.42% with a 95% confidence interval of [0.41%, 0.43%]. In the whole pelvis/prostate case, an average prediction accuracy of 97.04% with a 95% confidence interval of [96.67%, 97.41%] was achieved for grade 2 rectal bleeding complications. Conclusion: ML can be used for predicting OAR complications during treatment planning allowing for alternative DV constraint settings to be assessed within the planning framework.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381470","","Biomedical applications of radiation;Hemorrhaging;Intensity modulation;Machine learning;Neck;Neoplasms;Pelvis;Predictive models;Process planning;Surface treatment","dosimetry;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;radiation therapy","after radiation therapy;dose-related organ-at-risk complication modeling;dose-volume constraint settings;grade 2 rectal bleeding;head-and-neck intensity-modulated radiation therapy;machine learning;mean absolute prediction error;model verification;multiplan intensity modulated radiation therapy framework;prostate intensity-modulated radiation therapy;saliva flow rate;treatment planning;two-fold cross-validation;whole pelvis intensity-modulated radiation therapy;xerostomia","","0","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The fundamental limitations in pain assessment in neonates stem from subjective assessment criteria, rather than quantifiable and measurable data. This often results in poor quality and inconsistent treatment of patient pain management. Recent advancements in pattern recognition techniques using relevance vector machine (RVM) learning techniques can assist medical staff in assessing pain by constantly monitoring the patient and providing the clinician with quantifiable data for pain management. The RVM classification technique is a Bayesian extension of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, which achieves comparable performance to SVM while providing posterior probabilities for class memberships and a sparser model. If classes represent “pure” facial expressions (i.e., extreme expressions that an observer can identify with a high degree of confidence), then the posterior probability of the membership of some intermediate facial expression to a class can provide an estimate of the intensity of such an expression. In this paper, we use the RVM classification technique to distinguish pain from nonpain in neonates as well as assess their pain intensity levels. We also correlate our results with the pain intensity assessed by expert and nonexpert human examiners.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2009.2039214","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5415598","Digital imaging;facial expression recognition;neonates;pain assessment;relevance vector machine (RVM);support vector machine (SVM)","","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;paediatrics;patient care;support vector machines","Bayesian extension;RVM classification;SVM;digital imaging;neonate pain intensity assessment;pattern recognition;posterior probability;relevance vector machine;relevance vector machine learning;support vector machine","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Infant, Newborn;Pain;Pain Measurement;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Whole Body Imaging","16","","33","","20100217","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Finding effective classifier is important because it will help people make an objective decision instead of them having to rely merely on intuitive experience. This study proposes two well-known classifiers, namely, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), which will be used to find the highest accuracy rate classifier without features selection. Two credit data sets from University of California, Irvine (UCI) are chosen to evaluate the accuracy of various classifiers. The results are compared and the nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed to show if there is any significant difference between these classifiers. Performance of the KNN classifier is better in only one data set but not significant, whereas SVM classifier is significant superior to Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier in the German data set. The result of this study suggests that the primitive classifiers did not achieve satisfactory classification results.

The basic idea of ELM algorithm is to randomly choose the parameters of hidden nodes and then use simple generalized inverse operation to solve for the output weights of the network. Such a procedure faces two problems. First, ELM tends to require more random hidden nodes than conventional tuning-based algorithms. Second, subjectivity is involved in choosing appropriate number of random hidden nodes. In this paper, we propose an enhanced-ELM(en-ELM) algorithm by applying the modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) method to select hidden nodes in random hidden nodes pool. Furthermore, enhanced-ELM uses the Akaike's final prediction error (FPE) criterion to automatically determine the number of random hidden nodes. In comparison with conventional ELM learning method on several commonly used regressor benchmark problems, enhanced-ELM algorithm can achieve compact network with much faster response and satisfactory accuracy.","","POD:978-0-7695-3865-5","10.1109/ISCID.2009.275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368803","extreme learning machine (ELM);feedforward neural networks;modified Gram-Schmidt (MGS) algorithm;random hidden nodes","Computational intelligence;Machine learning","generalisation (artificial intelligence);inverse problems;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","Akaike final prediction error criterion;Gram-Schmidt algorithm;extreme learning machine;generalization performance;generalized inverse operation;regressor benchmark problem;subjectivity;tuning-based algorithm","","1","","8","","","12-14 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Convergence properties of continuous- and discrete-time variants of the proposed parallel update schemes are studied. A sufficient condition is derived under which synchronous and asynchronous gradient algorithms converge to the approximate solution. Subsequently, a class of stochastic update algorithms, which may arise due to distortions in the information flow between units, is shown to be globally stable under similar sufficient conditions.

Though there are many alternatives to passwords for access control, password is the more compellingly authenticating the identity in many applications. They provide a simple, direct means of protecting a system and they represent the identity of an individual for a system. The big vulnerability of passwords lies in their nature. Users are consistently told that a strong password is essential these days to protect private data as there are so many ways for an unauthorized person with little technical knowledge or skill to learn the passwords of legitimate users. Thus it is important for organizations to recognize the vulnerabilities to which passwords are subjected, and develop strong policies governing the creation and use of passwords to ensure that those vulnerabilities are not exploited. In this work password strength prediction is modeled as classification task and supervised machine learning techniques were employed. Widely used supervised machine learning techniques namely C 4.5 decision tree classifier, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes classifier and support vector machine were used for learning the model. The results of the models were compared and observed that SVM performs well. The results of the models were also compared with the existing password strength checking tools.

Landslide activity is quite notorious in this region, especially along the Danube's right river bank, and recently intensified seismicity coupled with atmospheric precipitation might be critical for triggering new landslide occurrences. Hence, it is not a moment too soon for serious landslide susceptibility assessment in this region. State-of-the-art approaches had been taken into consideration, cutting down to the support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithms, trained upon expert based model of landslide susceptibility (a multi-criteria analysis). The latter involved Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weighting influences of different input parameters. These included elevation, slope angle, aspect, distance from flows, vegetation cover, lithology, and rainfall, to represent the natural factors of the slope stability. Processed in a GIS environment (as discrete or float raster layers) trough AHP, those parameters yielded susceptibility pattern, classified by the entropy model into four classes. Subsequently the susceptibility pattern has been featured as training set in SVM and k-NN algorithms. Detailed fitting involved several cases, among which SVM with Gaussian kernel over geo-dataset (coordinates and input parameters) reached the highest accuracy (88%)outperforming other considered cases by far.","","POD:978-1-4244-5165-4","10.1109/INCOS.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5368960","AHP;Landslide susceptibility;SVM;k-NN","Algorithm design and analysis;Atmospheric modeling;Geographic Information Systems;Machine learning algorithms;Rivers;Stability;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Terrain factors;Vegetation","geographic information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Danube right river bank;GIS environment;Gaussian kernel;SVM;atmospheric precipitation;expert based model;float raster layers;k-nearest neighbor algorithms;landslide susceptibility assessment;machine learning algorithms;multicriteria analysis;support vector machine","","5","","21","","","4-6 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our results demonstrate that we can acquire, with quantitative confidence, concise rules that are difficult to obtain in handcrafted rules.

We present study using one-class machine learning for miRNA target discovery and compare one-class to two-class approaches using a zero-norm for feature selection. The usage of this simple feature selection cause an improving of the one-class results, where in some cases reaches the performance of the two-class approach. Of all the one-class methods tested based on the all features, we found that most of them gave similar accuracy that range from 0.81 to 0.89 while the two-class gave 0.93-0.99 accuracy. Interestingly, using zero-norm feature selection improves the results to reach accuracy of about 0.96. One and two class methods can both give useful classification accuracies. The advantage of one class methods is that they don't require any additional effort for choosing the best way of generating the negative class.

In this paper, we focus on addressing the routing issue in UWSNs. We propose an adaptive, energy-efficient, and lifetime-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning, QELAR. Our protocol assumes generic MAC protocols and aims at prolonging the lifetime of networks by making residual energy of sensor nodes more evenly distributed. The residual energy of each node as well as the energy distribution among a group of nodes is factored in throughout the routing process to calculate the reward function, which aids in selecting the adequate forwarders for packets. We have performed extensive simulations of the proposed protocol on the Aqua-sim platform and compared with one existing routing protocol (VBF) in terms of packet delivery rate, energy efficiency, latency, and lifetime. The results show that QELAR yields 20 percent longer lifetime on average than VBF.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2010.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5408367","Routing protocols;distributed networks;mobile communication systems.;wireless communication","","access protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile communication;routing protocols;telecommunication computing;underwater acoustic communication;wireless sensor networks","MAC protocols;QELAR;energy consumption;machine-learning-based adaptive routing protocol;underwater sensor networks;underwater sensor nodes mobility;wireless communication","","47","","29","","20100208","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The current technological challenge is to conserve the compression capacity and quality that H.264 offers but reduce the encoding time and, therefore, the processing complexity. This paper applies machine learning technique for video encoding mode decisions and investigates ways to improve the process of generating more general low complexity H.264/AVC video encoders. The proposed H.264 encoding method decreases the complexity in the mode decision inside the Inter frames.

These N-best lists are concise statistical representations of the handwritten words. These statistical representations enable the retrieval methods to be robust when there are machine transcription errors, allowing retrieval of documents that would be missed by a traditional transcription-based retrieval system. Our experimental results demonstrate that significant improvements in retrieval performance can be achieved compared to standard keyword text searching of machine-transcribed documents.

It does not require adjusting the input weights and hidden layer biases during the implementation of the algorithm, and it produces only one optimal solution. Therefore, ELM has the advantages of fast learning speed and good generalization performance. In this paper, ELM is introduced in predicting reservoir permeability.

However, one of the difficulties radiation oncologists face is targeting moving tumors, such as those in the lung, which can change position during normal respiration. Tumor motion can be determined by directly monitoring tumor position using continuous xray imaging or electromagnetic transponders placed in the tumor that emit a signal. These approaches require potentially unnecessary radiation to the patient or acquisition of expensive technology. Alternatively, one can image the patient intermittently to determine tumor location and external markers placed on the patient's torso. The external surrogates can then be used to determine an inferential model that would determine the tumor position as a function of external surrogates. These external surrogates can be monitored continuously in order to determine the real-time position of the tumor.

The quality of features directly affects the performance of classification. Many feature selection methods introduced to remove redundant and irrelevant features, because raw features may reduce accuracy or robustness of classification.

However, when it comes to imbalanced datasets, SVMs produce suboptimal classification models. On the other hand, the SVM algorithm is sensitive to outliers and noise present in the datasets. Therefore, although the existing class imbalance learning (CIL) methods can make SVMs less sensitive to class imbalance, they can still suffer from the problem of outliers and noise. Fuzzy SVMs (FSVMs) is a variant of the SVM algorithm, which has been proposed to handle the problem of outliers and noise. In FSVMs, training examples are assigned different fuzzy-membership values based on their importance, and these membership values are incorporated into the SVM learning algorithm to make it less sensitive to outliers and noise. However, like the normal SVM algorithm, FSVMs can also suffer from the problem of class imbalance. In this paper, we present a method to improve FSVMs for CIL (called FSVM-CIL), which can be used to handle the class imbalance problem in the presence of outliers and noise. We thoroughly evaluated the proposed FSVM-CIL method on ten real-world imbalanced datasets and compared its performance with five existing CIL methods, which are available for normal SVM training. Based on the overall results, we can conclude that the proposed FSVM-CIL method is a very effective method for CIL, especially in the presence of outliers and noise in datasets.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2042721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5409611","Class imbalance learning (CIL);fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs);outliers;support vector machines (SVMs)","","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","class imbalance learning;fuzzy support vector machines;machine learning technique;suboptimal classification models","","86","","60","","20100208","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For a complete molecular understanding of transcriptional regulation, researchers must first associate each TF with the set of genes that it regulates. Here we present a summary of completed work on the ability to associate 104 TFs with their binding sites using support vector machines (SVMs), which are classification algorithms based in statistical learning theory. We use several types of genomic datasets to train classifiers in order to predict TF binding in the yeast genome. We consider motif matches, subsequence counts, motif conservation, functional annotation, and expression profiles. A simple weighting scheme varies the contribution of each type of genomic data when building a final SVM classifier, which we evaluate using known binding sites published in the literature and in online databases. The SVM algorithm works best when all datasets are combined, producing 73% coverage of known interactions, with a prediction accuracy of almost 0.9.

The natural way for an intelligent learner to counter this problem and successfully generalize is to exploit prior information that may be available about the domain or that can be learned from prototypical examples. We discuss the notion of using prior knowledge by creating <I>virtual examples</I> and thereby expanding the effective training set size. We show that in some contexts, this idea is mathematically equivalent to incorporating the prior knowledge as a regularizer, suggesting that the strategy is well-motivated. The process of creating virtual examples in real world pattern recognition tasks is highly non-trivial.

Although the use of such models has lead to significant improvements of edit distance-based classification tasks, a new challenge has appeared on the horizon: How integrating background knowledge during the learning process? This is the subject matter of this paper in the case of (input,output) pairs of strings.

In order to encode feature vectors for each interaction, trigram frequencies of primary sequences of PDZ domains and corresponding peptides are calculated.

At first, case histories of rockburst occurrence with the real records of rockburst intensity and influence factors of rockburst are collected and are taken as prior knowledge to be learned by GP binary classification machine learning tech, where, maximum tangential stress in surround rockmass, uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength of rock, and rockburst tendency index of rock, which can reflect the internal and exterior conditions of rockburst occurrence nicely are suggested to be main influential factors of rockburst. Then, the nonlinear mapping relationship between rockburst intensity and its influence factors can be established easily by GP model. Finally, prediction for the novel conditions in deep mines can be obtained using the model.

The keystream produced by a cipher must be unpredictable. Attacks on stream ciphers typically exploit some underlying patterns existing in the keystream. The objective of this paper is to develop such an attack with the help of machine learning algorithms. The Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) has been solved for several test cases using machine learning algorithms. We also study some variants of LFSR and Geffe Generator and propose a model for predicting the future bits of a keystream generator. The results for Geffe Generator using this model have been presented.

The EMG recordings were collected from the lower limbs of patients with arthritis and compared with those of healthy subjects (CO) with no musculoskeletal disorder. The study involved subjects suffering from two forms of arthritis, viz, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and hip osteoarthritis (OA). The analysis of the data was plagued by two problems which frequently render the analysis of this type of data extremely difficult. One was the small number of human subjects that could be included in the investigation based on the terms specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. The other was the high intra- and inter-subject variability present in EMG data. We identified some of the muscles differently employed by the arthritic patients by using machine learning techniques to classify the two groups and then identified the muscles that were critical for the classification. For the classification we employed least-squares kernel (LSK) algorithms, neural network algorithms like the Kohonen self organizing map, learning vector quantification and the multilayer perceptron. Finally we also tested the more classical technique of linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The performance of the different algorithms was compared. The LSK algorithm showed the highest capacity for classification. Our study demonstrates that the newly developed LSK algorithm is adept for the treatment of biological data. The muscles that were most important for distinguishing the RA from the CO subjects were the soleus and biceps femoris. For separating the OA and CO subjects however, it was the gluteus medialis muscle. Our study demonstrates how classification with EMG data can be used in the clinical setting. While such procedures are unnecessary for the diagnosis of the type of arthritis pre- - sent, an understanding of the muscles which are responsible for the classification can help to better identify targets for rehabilitative measures.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2009.2032638","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5256260","Electromyographic (EMG);gait data;kernel methods;neural networks;osteoarthritis;rheumatoid arthritis;three-dimensional (3-D) locomotion analysis","","electromyography;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical disorders;medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification","EMG;Kohonen self-organizing map;arthritic patients;biceps femoris;electromyographic pattern analysis;inter-subject variability;intra-subject variability;learning vector quantification;least-squares kernel algorithms;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning algorithms;multilayer perceptron;musculoskeletal disorder;neural network algorithms;rheumatoid arthritis;soleus femoris","Algorithms;Arthritis;Artificial Intelligence;Biomechanics;Data Collection;Electromyography;Gait;Humans;ROC Curve;Reproducibility of Results;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","10","","46","","20090922","April 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While simple fuzzy systems with high interpretability are usually not accurate, complicated fuzzy systems with high accuracy are usually not interpretable. Recently evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been used to search for simple and accurate fuzzy systems. The main advantage of EMO-based approaches over single-objective techniques is that a number of alternative fuzzy systems with different accuracy-complexity tradeoffs can be obtained by their single run. We have already proposed a multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (GBML) algorithm for pattern classification problems. In our GBML algorithm, multiple fuzzy partitions with different granularities are simultaneously used. This is because we usually do not know an appropriate fuzzy partition for each input variable. However, the use of multiple fuzzy partitions significantly increases the size of the search space. In this paper, we examine the effect of the use of multiple fuzzy partitions on the search ability of our multiobjective fuzzy GBML algorithms through computational experiments.","","POD:978-1-4244-5330-6","10.1109/SoCPaR.2009.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5370991","Evolutionary multiobjective optimization;Fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;Fuzzy partitions;Fuzzy rules;Pattern classification problems","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Input variables;Knowledge based systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern classification","evolutionary computation;fuzzy systems;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);logic programming;pattern classification","evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms;fuzzy rule-based systems design;multiobjective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning search ability;multiple fuzzy partitions;pattern classification problems;single-objective techniques","","0","","17","","","4-7 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When an electrical feeder is shut down, all network protector switches connected to the feeder should open to isolate the feeder. When a switch malfunctions and does not open, electrical current flows into the feeder, which remains energized. This causes the feeder to be ""alive"" on back-feed current, and maintenance cannot proceed. Our goal is to provide a ranking of network protector switches according to their susceptibility to such malfunction. Such a ranking can assist prioritization of which switches to repair when an ABF event occurs.

Since the DFA obtained in this way may be an over-approximation and, thus, admit traces that were not admitted on the original model, this abstraction is refined using counter-examples made of unfeasible traces.

However, like most machine learning algorithms, SVMs is a supervised learning which is based on the assumption that it is straightforward to obtain labeled data, but in reality labeled data can be scarce or expensive to obtain. Active learning (AL) is a way to deal with the above problem by asking for the labels of the most Â¿informativeÂ¿ data points. To reduce the amount of human labeling effort while maintaining the SVMs performance, in this work we propose an uncertainty sampling-based active learning approach for SVMs to annotate the most uncertain unlabeled instances, i.e., an algorithm to select the most informative instances for SVMs learning process. During the SVMs active learning process, to reduce annotation effort while maintaining the SVMs classification performance, we firstly employ the decision margin of SVMs output as the initial uncertainty measure to select the most uncertain instances, to further reduce the number of unlabeled instances to be annotated, we employ the ratio of center-distance to select the boundary vectors of SVMs. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm. To verify the effectiveness and efficiency, we have applied the proposed method on several standard UCI datasets. The experimental results show that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce learning cost while achieving the desired performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-3836-5; POD:978-1-4244-3835-8","10.1109/AICI.2009.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5376609","","Humans;Labeling;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Military computing;Missiles;Sampling methods;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Uncertainty","learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","UCI datasets;active learning process;learning cost reduction;machine learning algorithms;ratio of center-distance;supervised learning;support vector machines;uncertainty sampling-based active learning approach","","0","","18","","","7-8 Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
