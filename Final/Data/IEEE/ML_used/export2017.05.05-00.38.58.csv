Therefore, some small video production units are thinking a dynamic, reasonable price with good quality DSLRs -Nikon D90 and Canon 5D Mark II with built in video chip, in stead of current expensive video systems since the winter of 2008. The photography world is beginning to adapt to a new phase in the marriage of cameras and computing technology: the arrival of SLRs that can shoot not just still images, but video too. The change began with the arrival of image sensors, the light-sensitive microchips that replaced film. Now, two new DSLRs are taking another step away from the film paradigm, following in the footsteps of point-and-shoot cameras by recording continuous video and not just still images. Doubtless video will gradually spread to other DSLR models and makers, which would create more impacts not only the consumer and professional market of photography but video market.

Chinese NER is usually formalized as a chunking task. However, most formulations do not distinguish named entities from common words. This makes it difficult to explore lexical cues for NER. In this paper we propose a two-level IOB2 representation to merge lexical chunks and entity chunks, and develop a morpheme-based chunking system for Chinese NER. It works in three main steps: Given a plain Chinese sentence, a morpheme segmenter first segments it into a sequence of morphemes, then a lexical chunker is applied to tag each segmented morpheme with a proper lexical chunk tag indicating its position pattern in forming a word of a special type, and finally an entity chunker continues to label each morpheme with a hybrid chunk tag, containing the related entity boundary and category information if any. Our experiments on the IEER-99 and MET2 data demonstrate a significant enhancement of NER performance after using entity-internal part-of-speech information. We also show that lexical chunking quality is of importance for NER results.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212793","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212793","Entity chunking;Information extraction;Named entity recognition;lexical chunking","Application software;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Testing;Text mining;Text recognition;White spaces","natural language processing;text analysis","Chinese named entity recognition;entity chunks;lexical chunks;lexical information;morpheme-based chunking system;natural language processing","","1","","14","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this is often impossible in real applications since preparing good initial training samples is difficult and time-consuming. It is ideal and appealing for a topical crawler if it can learn knowledge concerning the target topics from the ever-changing environment and adapt itself to these changes during successive crawling process. In this paper, we present a semi-supervised clustering method for building a learnable topical crawler. Our approach employs a constrained k-means clustering algorithm to detect new samples from crawled pages, which is fed to page classifier and link predictor for updating the learned models. This approach enables topical crawling systems with incremental learning capability and in turn improves crawling performance.

In the second part, the induced membership functions are then fed as the input into the TS fuzzy model to obtain a new rule set. The rule set is then fed into the first part to repeat the same learning process. The process is thus executed iteratively until the terminal criterion is satisfied.

In order to identify which regions that gotten through the coarse step should be merged or segmented again, a threshold is usually adopted. In this paper, a fuzzy threshold method is presented to adapt for the variety of unconstrained writing styles. First, the coarse segmentation region's distribution is gotten by taking statistics with its width and height.

The traditional remote repair method needs the software providers to supply fault information with corresponding repair strategy. It is inconvenient for users when the sold mobile devices have software faults. However, it is impossible for the manufacturers to supply all the fault information and repair-strategy before selling them. So far, no method has been given to collect repair-strategy from the sold mobile device and optimize the self-repair strategy. In this paper, we propose a self-optimization method to learn the software repair strategy from the sold mobile devices and to optimize self-repair strategy based on the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) Device Management (DM) standard.

Unlike traditional genetic algorithm (GA)-based approaches that optimize the whole cutting plan at a time, the greedy algorithm is applied and GA is used for getting one cutting pattern at each step. And the obtained optimal cutting pattern is reused as many times as possible. HMH achieves a good balance between result quality and optimization efficiency. HMH is tested on real life large scale applications. The final high utilization ratio of more than 97% validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we focus our attention on genetic algorithm based feature selection for ensemble learning. We use an improved GA algorithm (IGA) to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, and then evaluate using bagging and Ada-Boost constructed by the reduced features. Experimental results on several UCI datasets demonstrate that the improved GA-based feature selection algorithm (IGAFS) is often able to obtain a better feature subset when compared with the standard GA-based feature selection algorithm (SGAFS). Our experiments also indicate that ensemble learning using IGAFS is more accuracy than employing SGAFS and the whole feature space in general conditions.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212542","Ada-Boost;Bagging;Ensemble learning;Feature Selection;Genetic algorithms","Bagging;Boosting;Computational complexity;Computer science;Cybernetics;Filters;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Oceans;Pattern recognition","genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Ada-Boost;GA-based feature selection;bagging;ensemble learning;genetic algorithm based feature selection;high-dimensional datasets","","1","","19","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing studies on periodic patterns mining mainly consider discovering full periodic patterns from an entire time series. However, partial periodic patterns are more useful in practice since only some of the time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. This paper aims to discover the partial periodic pattern in locality of the time series data. The notion of character locality is introduced to divide the time series into variable-length segments. We propose a novel algorithm, called LFPMiner, to find the local frequent periodic patterns in time series data.

For convenience in this paper we named the network access connection attempt without leading DNS resolution operation as Suspicious Network Access (SNA). A network scanning detection approach is proposed in this paper by the analysis of SNAs' response ratio and the randomness of their target IP addresses for each host in LAN. Since the proposed approach only takes the SNAs into account and the interference from normal network access can be decreased effectively, it can detect network scanning attacks with high accuracy and efficiency. The experiment results in simulation network scenario showed that the proposed approach support the detection of TCP-SYN and ICMP type network scanning attacks and also support the detection of stealth network scanning attacks as well.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212650","Network security;intrusion detection;network monitoring;network scanning","Cybernetics;Event detection;Local area networks;Machine learning","local area networks;security of data","LAN;detect network scanning event;intrusion detection;network monitoring;network security;suspicious network access","","0","","9","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
