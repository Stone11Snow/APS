"An empirical investigation of evolutionary algorithm for software maintainability prediction","A. Jain; S. Tarwani; A.

It starts immediately after the software product is delivered to the customer and ends when the product is no longer in use. There are various activities carried out during software maintenance phase such as the addition of new features, deletion of obsolete features, correction of errors, adaption to new environment etc. Software maintainability is the quality attribute of the software product which determines the ease with which these modifications can be performed. If we can predict the maintainability accurately, cost and time associated with the maintenance activity can be highly reduced. The main aim of this study is to propose the use of evolutionary technique particularly genetic algorithm for the software maintainability prediction and compare its performance with various machine leaning techniques such as Decision Table, Radial Basis Function Neural Network, Bayes Net and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). In order to carry out this empirical investigation, datasets from four open source software systems are collected. The maintenance effort is calculated by counting the number of changes in terms of line of code from one version of the software to another. Based on the experiments conducted, we conclude that the evolutionary algorithm outperformed all the other classifiers, thus, very useful for the concise prediction of software maintainability. Results of this would be helpful to practitioners as they can use the maintainability prediction in order to achieve precise planning of resource allocation.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7918-2; POD:978-1-4673-7919-9","10.1109/SCEECS.2016.7509314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7509314","Evolutionary Algorithm;Machine learning classifiers;Prediction accuracy measures;Software Maintainability;Software Metrics","Couplings;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Measurement;Predictive models;Software maintenance","genetic algorithms;public domain software;resource allocation;software maintenance;software metrics;software reliability","evolutionary technique;genetic algorithm;open source software systems;precise planning;resource allocation;software development life cycle;software maintainability prediction;software maintenance activity;software maintenance phase;software metrics;software product","","","","","","","5-6 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In elastic platforms, the forecasting component can be considered by far the most important element and the differentiating factor when comparing such systems, being workload forecasting one of the problems to solve if we want to achieve a truly elastic system. When properly addressed the cloud workload forecasting problem becomes a really interesting case study. As there is no general methodology in the literature that addresses this problem analytically and from a time series forecasting perspective (even less in the cloud field), we propose a combination of these tools based on a stateof- the-art forecasting methodology which we have enhanced with some elements, such as: a specific cost function, statistical tests, visual analysis, etc. The insights obtained from this analysis are used to detect the asymmetrical nature of the forecasting problem and to find the best forecasting from the viewpoint of the current state of the art in time series forecasting. From an operational point of view the most interesting forecast is a short-time horizon, so we focus on this. To show the feasibility of this methodology, we apply it to several realistic workload datasets from different datacenters. The results show that the analyzed series are non-linear in nature, and that no seasonal patterns can be found. Moreover, on the analyzed datasets, the penalty cost as usually included in the SLA can be reduced down to a 30% on average.","2168-7161;21687161","","10.1109/TCC.2016.2586064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501816","Cloud Computing;elasticity;machine learning;time series forecasting;workload forecasting","Business;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Elasticity;Forecasting;Predictive models;Time series analysis","","","","","","","","20160629","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Cyber physical social systems (CPSSs) are another upcoming paradigm that encompasses the ever-growing interaction between the physical, social, and cyber worlds. As communication networks form the basis of these interactions, a cognitive evaluation of networks is called for. This CPSS driven network evolution was a direction motivating this paper. With the implementation of the next generation networks, traffic from real-time interactive services, such as video conferencing, is surpassing those of conventional transactional services. As such multimedia data transportation over IP networks has stringent quality constraints in terms of required bandwidth, latency, and jitter, legacy networks with no quality of service face challenges in terms of performance. We attempt to perform a multivariate analysis of video call record data collected from a wide area organizational network over a period of time. Learning-based prediction is attempted by training four classifiers: naïve Bayes, $k$ -nearest neighbor, decision tree, and support vector machine. Two independent set of experiments were conducted with oversights of bandwidth and destination prediction. Both the discrete and continuous valued predictors were involved in the training. Performance evaluation of the generated hypothesis in both the cases was conducted using tenfold cross validation. Combined analysis using the assorted combinations of attributes was conducted, and thereafter, the effect of each feature was evaluated through singular attribute portioning. This paper presents observations, which exhibit deviations from the conventional machine learning paradigms. An attempt to increase the prediction accuracy of the classifiers was made through the boosting ensemble methodology. However, miniscule addition in performance was achieved. A maximum prediction accuracy of 81% for b- ndwidth and 60% for destination was obtained. Reasons of low accuracy of conventionally better performing algorithm were reasoned with a mathematical comprehension. Divergence of the obtained results from the accepted patterns poses an open research problem, particularly with respect to the nature and peculiarities of the data set. The proposed learning technique can have potential applications in social, tactical, and strategic spheres.","2329-924X;2329924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2016.2561200","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7476853","$k$ -nearest neighbor ( $k$ -NN);Classifier;cyber physical social system (CPSS);data fusion;decision tree;k-nearest neighbor (k-NN);machine learning;naïve Bayes;naïve Bayes;service distribution;stylometrics;support vector machine (SVM);video conferencing;video conferencing.","Bandwidth;Computational modeling;Multimedia communication;Quality of service;Streaming media;Support vector machines;Training","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;video signal processing","CPSS;boosting ensemble methodology;cyber physical social systems;decision tree;k-nearest neighbor;learning-based prediction;multivariate data fusion-based learning;naïve Bayes;next generation networks;real-time interactive services;support vector machine;tenfold cross validation;video call record data;wide area organizational network","","","","55","","20160523","March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Graphics Processing Unit is increasingly being used for computationally intensive tasks because of the inexpensive, high-performance raw processing power it has to offer. In this paper, we implement, test, and compare various topic modeling algorithms in a Graphics Processing Unit to achieve faster computing time compared to traditional implementations in a Central Processing Unit. The goal is to execute parallel Graphics Processing Unit versions of algorithms, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Latent Semantic Analysis, and quantitatively assess the performance of each algorithm in comparison with serial or multi-core versions of the same topic modeling algorithms. The study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of a spectrum of Topic Model algorithms, the merits of such models in the Graphics Processing Unit, and the magnitude of efficiency improvement that can be achieved.

The reason of that repetition answers the purpose of finding the best performance(s) - therefore called optimum solution(s) - of the hymns. The process starts by extracting time series vectors from recorded wav files. After the extraction a statistical method for cross validation, called Jackknife, is applied in order to find the optimum solution(s) which will be used to train the system. Once the optimum solution(s) is(are) found, the system is ready to be trained. The training and recognition procedures takes place in real time via intelligent techniques which are a combination of Hidden Markov Models(HMM) and Dynamic Time Wrapping(DTW) algorithms.

Over the past few years powerful security features have been added to mobile platforms. However, for legal and organisational reasons it is difficult to pervasively enforce using these features in consumer applications or Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) scenarios. Thus application developers need to integrate custom implementations of security features such as encryption in security-critical applications. Our manual analysis of container applications and password managers has shown that custom implementations of cryptographic functionality often suffer from critical mistakes. During manual analysis, finding the custom cryptographic code was especially time consuming. Therefore, we present the Semdroid framework for simplifying application analysis of Android applications. Here, we use Semdroid to apply machine-learning techniques for detecting non-standard symmetric and asymmetric cryptography implementations. The identified code fragments can be used as starting points for subsequent manual analysis. Thus manual analysis time is greatly reduced.

Though EPs are a natural method for humans to acquire object information, evidence also exists for meaningful tactile property inference from brief, non-exploratory motions (a ‘haptic glance’). In this work, we implement tactile object identification and feature extraction techniques on data acquired during a single, unplanned grasp with a simple, underactuated robot hand equipped with inexpensive barometric pressure sensors. Our methodology utilizes two cooperating schemes based on an advanced machine learning technique (random forests) and parametric methods that estimate object properties. The available data is limited to actuator positions (one per two link finger) and force sensors values (eight per finger). The schemes are able to work both independently and collaboratively, depending on the task scenario. When collaborating, the results of each method contribute to the other, improving the overall result in a synergistic fashion. Unlike prior work, the proposed approach does not require object exploration, re-grasping, grasp-release, or force modulation and works for arbitrary object start positions and orientations. Due to these factors, the technique may be integrated into practical robotic grasping scenarios without adding time or manipulation overheads.","1939-1412;19391412","","10.1109/TOH.2016.2521378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390277","Adaptive Grasping;Haptics Applications;Machine Learning;Object Classification;Object Feature Extraction;Robotics;Tactile Sensing;Tactile sensing;Underactuated Robot Hands;adaptive grasping;haptics applications;machine learning;object classification;object feature extraction;robotics;underactuated robot hands","Feature extraction;Grasping;Robot sensing systems;Thumb","","","","1","","43","","20160125","April-June 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To filter out unrelated information and to increase the accuracy of classification, a spam filter and a preprocessing procedure have been developed. Validation experiments were performed using a manually labeled data set based on streamed tweets collected continuously on Twitter in real-time for 48 hours, and exploiting six different supervised machine-learning classifiers. Results have shown that these classifiers have achieved up to 77% accuracy in identifying drugs' cause-effect relations on Twitter data.

While much literature is devoted to developing VM models, maintaining them (e.g., so they can be used for months in production) presents a different set of challenges. Behavior of equipment can change over time, causing degradation of VM models. Maintenance events can abruptly reset sensors and process conditions, invalidating VM models. In addition, sensor noise, sensor imperfection and aging parts can disturb performance of VM models. While some of these issues can be addressed during modeling by incorporating certain variables that capture the dynamics associated with these issues, others are harder to foresee. Resolving these issues may require tuning the models as they age or manually rebuilding the models after they become ineffective. To mitigate these problems, techniques including monitoring residual error and tool degradation, compensating for sensor reset and residual error, and auto-retraining models can significantly help VM models maintain their performance during deployment.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0270-2; POD:978-1-5090-0271-9","10.1109/ASMC.2016.7491083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7491083","Auto Retraining;Automatic Virtual Metrology;Controller;Machine Learning;Model Adaptation;Prediction;Residual Error Compensation;State Space;Virtual Metrology;Virtual Metrology System","Data models;Error compensation;Hidden Markov models;Indexes;Maintenance engineering;Semiconductor device modeling;Sensors","","","","1","","12","","","16-19 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They are characterized by a complex structure and their variety is considerably high. Several solutions have been academically developed to mitigate such attacks. However, they leveraged on information that were extracted from either only the structure or the content of the PDF file. This creates problems when trying to detect non-Javascript or targeted attacks. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning system for the automatic detection of malicious PDF documents. It extracts information from both the structure and the content of the PDF file, and it features an advanced parsing mechanism. In this way, it is possible to detect a wide variety of attacks, including non-Javascript and parsing-based ones.

To demonstrate the performance of proposed security framework, we implement a bio-medical seizure detection application as a case study.

New approaches based on machine learning techniques for nonlinear systems have been proposed to increase MEMS inertial sensors' precision. However, many MEMS inertial sensors can be considered almost linear according to the information provided by their manufacturers. In this work, a time-delayed multiple linear regression (TD-MLR) model is proposed to correct the non-deterministic sources of error of a MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU). TD-MLR unknown coefficients are found by training a TD-MLR model with navigation-grade IMU observations. It is the authors' believe that this is a novel approach in applying machine learning techniques for improving the precision of MEMS inertial sensors. The generation and evaluation of TD-MLR models are achieved by using field data from a real trajectory. It is observed that, on average, the output of inertial sensors of different qualities is improved about 77% for accelerometers and 87% for gyroscopes by implementing the proposed machine learning procedure.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2042-3; POD:978-1-5090-2043-0","10.1109/PLANS.2016.7479677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7479677","Inertial sensors;Linear regression;MEMS;Machine learning;Navigation system","Accelerometers;Data models;Gyroscopes;Linear regression;Micromechanical devices;Navigation;Predictive models","accelerometers;gyroscopes;learning (artificial intelligence);microsensors;regression analysis","MEMS inertial sensor;accelerometers;gyroscopes;machine learning techniques;navigation-grade IMU;time-delayed multiple linear regression","","","","14","","","11-14 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

NVPs hide data backup and restoration from the executing software to provide an execution mode that will always eventually complete the current task. NVPs are emerging as a promising solution for energy-harvesting scenarios, in which the available power supply is unstable and intermittent, because of their ability to ensure that even short periods of sufficient power, on the order of tens of instructions, will result in net forward progress. This article explores the design space for an NVP across different architectures, input power sources, and policies for maximizing forward progress in a framework calibrated using measured results from a fabricated NVP.

Although many crowdsensing platforms have been built for various applications, the general issue of how to manage such systems intelligently remains largely open. While recent investigations mostly focus on incentivizing crowdsensing, the robustness of crowdsensing toward uncontrollable sensing quality, another important issue, has been widely neglected. Due to the non-professional personnel and devices, the quality of crowdsensing data cannot be fully guaranteed, hence the revenue gained from mobile crowdsensing is generally uncertain. Moreover, the need for compensating the sensing costs under a limited budget has exacerbated the situation: one does not enjoy an infinite horizon to learn the sensing ability of the crowd and hence to make decisions based on sufficient statistics. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Budget LImited robuSt crowdSensing (BLISS), to handle this problem through an online learning approach. Our approach aims to minimize the difference on average sense (a.k.a. regret) between the achieved total sensing revenue and the (unknown) optimal one, and we show that our BLISS sensing policies achieve logarithmic regret bounds and Hannan-consistency. Finally, we use extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of BLISS.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2418191","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7093207","Crowdsourcing;machine learning algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;IEEE transactions;Mobile communication;Robustness;Sensors;Uncertainty","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","BLISS framework;BLISS sensing policies;Hannan consistency;budget limited robust crowdsensing framework;crowdsensing incentives;crowdsensing robustness;logarithmic regret bounds;mobile crowdsensing;online learning approach","","0","","36","","20150423","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, live monitoring of functional state using physiological and behavioral data still faces several challenges before achieving the level of precision required in many operational contexts. One open question is the level of granularity of the models. Is a general model sufficient or should subject-specific models be trained to ensure high accuracy? Another challenge concerns the formalization of a valid ground truth for training classifiers. This is critical in order to train models that are operationally relevant. This paper introduces the Decontextualized Dynamic Performance (DDP) metric which allows models to be trained simultaneously on different tasks using machine learning algorithms. This paper reports the performance of various classification algorithms at different levels of granularity. We compare a general model, task-specific models, and subject-specific models. Results show that the classification methods do not lead to statistically different performance, and that the predictive accuracy of subject-specific and task-specific models was actually comparable to a general model. We also compared various time-window sizes for the new DDP metric and found that results were degrading with a larger time window size.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0632-8; POD:978-1-5090-0633-5","10.1109/COGSIMA.2016.7497792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7497792","Behavioral Sensors;Cognitive States;Machine-learning;Physiological Sensors","Brain models;Data models;Measurement;Sensors;Shape;Training","behavioural sciences computing;biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence)","behavioral data;classification algorithm;decontextualized dynamic performance;human psychophysiological condition;machine learning;multidimensional pattern;operator functional state;physiological data;subject-specific model;task-specific model;time-window sizes","","","","32","","","21-25 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new design methodology for implementing a cognitive network-on-chip that has the ability to recognize changes in the environment and to learn new ways to adapt to the changes. This learning capability provides a way for the network to manage itself. Individual network nodes work autonomously to achieve global system goals, e.g., low network latency, higher reliability, power efficiency, adaptability, etc. We use fault-tolerant routing as a case study.

The efficacy of radiation treatment highly depends on segmentation accuracy. However, accurate segmentation of male pelvic organs is challenging due to low tissue contrast of CT images, as well as large variations of shape and appearance of the pelvic organs. Among existing segmentation methods, deformable models are the most popular, as shape prior can be easily incorporated to regularize the segmentation. Nonetheless, the sensitivity to initialization often limits their performance, especially for segmenting organs with large shape variations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to guide deformable models, thus making them robust against arbitrary initializations. Specifically, we learn a displacement regressor, which predicts 3D displacement from any image voxel to the target organ boundary based on the local patch appearance. This regressor provides a non-local external force for each vertex of deformable model, thus overcoming the initialization problem suffered by the traditional deformable models. To learn a reliable displacement regressor, two strategies are particularly proposed. 1) A multi-task random forest is proposed to learn the displacement regressor jointly with the organ classifier; 2) an auto-context model is used to iteratively enforce structural information during voxel-wise prediction. Extensive experiments on 313 planning CT scans of 313 patients show that our method achieves better results than alternative classification or regression based methods, and also several other existing methods in CT pelvic organ segmentation.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2016.2519264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384757","Image segmentation;computed tomography;deformable model;machine learning;pelvic organs;prostate cancer;random forest","Bladder;Computed tomography;Deformable models;Image segmentation;Planning;Shape","biological tissues;computerised tomography;image classification;image segmentation;iterative methods;medical image processing;regression analysis","3D displacement;CT image tissue contrast;CT male pelvic organs;CT pelvic organ segmentation;CT scans;autocontext model;classification-based method;deformable models;displacement regressor;image voxel;local patch appearance;multitask random forests;nonlocal external force;organ classifier;prostate cancer radiotherapy;regression-based deformable models;regression-based method;segmentation methods;voxel-wise prediction","","2","","37","","20160118","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus, anomaly detection at user end has to be non-intrusive and hence difficult, particularly during DevOps operations because the impacts from both anomalies and these operations are often indistinguishable, and hence, it is hard to detect the anomalies. In this paper, our work is specific to a successful public cloud, Amazon Web Service, and a representative DevOps operation, rolling upgrade, on which we report our anomaly detection that can effectively detect anomalies. Our anomaly detection requires only metrics data and logs supplied by most public clouds officially. We use support vector machine to train multiple classifiers from monitored data for different system environments, on which the log information can indicate the best suitable classifier. Moreover, our detection aims at finding anomalies over every time interval, called window, such that the features include not only some indicative performance metrics but also the entropy and the moving average of metrics data in each window.

The purpose of feature selection is dimension reduction in a large multi-dimensional data set and it can be the key step of successful knowledge discovery in those problems where the number of features is large. This research area has huge practical significance because it accelerates decisions and improves performance. The requirements of specific applications in different kinds of research areas have led to the development of new feature selection techniques with different properties. In the last few decades, several feature selection algorithms have been proposed with their particular advantages and disadvantages. Despite of the intensive research and the large amount of works, the different kinds of feature selection algorithms have not been tested yet in the human activity recognition problem. It was the main motivation of our work and this paper tries to fill this gap.

With the exponential growth in data logging in modern industries, such time series are increasingly available for statistical modeling in soft sensing applications. In order to exploit time-series data for predictive modeling, it is necessary to summarize the information they contain as a set of features to use as model regressors. Typically this is done in an unsupervised fashion using simple techniques such as computing statistical moments, principal components or wavelet decompositions, often leading to significant information loss, and hence suboptimal predictive models. In this paper, a functional learning paradigm is exploited in a supervised fashion to derive continuous smooth estimates of time-series data (yielding aggregated local information), while simultaneously estimating a continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions. The proposed supervised aggregative feature extraction (SAFE) methodology can be extended to support nonlinear predictive models by embedding the functional learning framework in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) setting. SAFE has a number of attractive features including closed-form solution and the ability to explicitly incorporate first- and second-order derivative information. Using simulation studies and a practical semiconductor manufacturing case study, we highlight the strengths of the new methodology with respect to standard unsupervised feature extraction approaches.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2015.2496231","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312962","Big Data;Big data;Feature Extraction;Machine Learning;Regularization Methods;Semiconductor Manufacturing;Soft Sensor;Statistical Modeling;Time Series Learning;feature extraction;machine learning;regularization methods;semiconductor manufacturing;soft sensor;statistical modeling;time-series learning","Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Informatics;Optimization;Shape;Time series analysis","Big Data;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;time series","Big Data time series regression;RKHS;SAFE;continuous shape function yielding optimal predictions;data logging;first-order derivative information;functional learning framework;functional learning paradigm;nonlinear predictive models;principal components;reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces;second-order derivative information;soft sensing applications;statistical modeling;suboptimal predictive models;supervised aggregative feature extraction;time-series data;wavelet decompositions","","3","","30","","20151030","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different actions may correspond to different intentions, and the activation of the MNS in the human brain may also be slightly different. The present study distinguishes these differences according to functional brain imaging signals analyzed with machine learning. Brain signals were detected when the participants observed two types of actions: (1) grasping a cup for drinking, and (2) no meaningful contact. A synchronous measurement method for EEG and NIRS was adopted to increase the information contained in the brain signals. In order to obtain better classification accuracies, the method of functional brain networks was used. This method can be used to examine the relationship between brain regions. First, phase synchronization and Pearson correlation were used to calculate correlations for EEG channels and NIRS channels, respectively. Next, correlation matrices were converted into binary matrices, and the local properties of the networks were obtained. Finally, the feature vectors for the classifier were selected by analysis of their significance.

Unpredictability and reliability are the core requirements of PUFs: unpredictability implies that an adversary cannot sufficiently predict future responses from previous observations. Reliability is important as it increases the reproducibility of PUF responses and hence allows validation of expected responses. However, advanced machine-learning algorithms have been shown to be a significant threat to the practical validity of PUFs, as they are able to accurately model PUF behavior. The most effective technique was shown to be the XOR-based combination of multiple PUFs, but as this approach drastically reduces reliability, it does not scale well against software-based machine-learning attacks. In this paper, we analyze threats to PUF security and propose PolyPUF, a scalable and secure architecture to introduce polymorphic PUF behavior. This architecture significantly increases model-building resistivity while maintaining reliability. An extensive experimental evaluation and comparison demonstrate that the PolyPUF architecture can secure various PUF configurations and is the only evaluated approach to withstand highly complex neural network machine-learning attacks.

Websites like the Twitter<sup>1</sup> reflect the public views through its millions of messages posted by its users world wide, whenever a controversial issue arises in the society. It is during this time that we observe significant amount of malicious, violent contents going viral over the internet. In this paper we propose a technique that applies sentiment analysis on data from Twitter and measures the sentiments of posts in order to identify the origin of malicious contents.

A critical aspect, which decides the sustainability of plant growth is the quality of soil. All other things being fixed, the quality of soil greatly impacts the plant stress, which in turn impacts overall health. Although plant stress manifests in many ways, one of the clearest indicators are colors of the leaves. In this paper, we conducted an experimental study in a greenhouse for detecting plant stress caused by nutrient deficiencies in soil using smart-phone cameras, coupled with image processing and machine learning algorithms. The greenhouse experiment was conducted by growing two plant species; willows (Salix Pentandra) and poplars (Populus deltoides x nigra, DN34), in two treatments. These treatments included: unamended tailings (collected from a lead mine tailings pond and characterized by nutrient deficiency), and biosolids amended tailings. Biosolids are very rich in nutrients and were added to the tailings in one of the two treatments to supply plants with nutrients. Subsequently, we captured various images of plant leaves grown in both soils. Each image taken was pre-processed via filtration to remove associated noise, and was segmented into pixels to facilitate scalability of analysis. Subsequently, we designed random forests based algorithms to detect the stress of leaves as indicated by their coloring. In a dataset consisting of 34 leaves, our technique yields classifications with a high degree of prediction, recall and F1 score. Our work in this paper, while restricted to two types of plants and soils, can be generalized. We see applications in the emerging area of urban farming in terms of empowering citizens with tools and technologies for enhancing quality of farming practices.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1743-0; POD:978-1-5090-1744-7","10.1109/MoWNet.2016.7496612","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7496612","Image processing;Machine learning algorithms;Participatory sensing;Plant stress;Smart-phones","Algorithm design and analysis;Cameras;Green products;Image color analysis;Soil;Stress;Training","cameras;crops;farming;greenhouses;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);smart phones;soil","Populus deltoides x nigra;Salix Pentandra;biosolids amended tailings;filtration;greenhouse experiment;image processing;image segmentation;lead mine tailings pond;machine learning;nutrient deficiency;plant leaves;plant stress detection;poplars;random forests;smart phone cameras;soil treatment;unamended tailings;urban farming;willows;yields classifications","","","","24","","","11-13 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a dynamic prefetching tuning scheme in this paper, named prefetch automatic tuner (PATer). PATer uses a prediction model based on machine learning to dynamically tune the prefetch configuration based on the values of hardware performance monitoring counters (PMCs). By developing a two-phase prefetching selection algorithm and a prediction accuracy optimization algorithm in this tool, we identify a set of selected key hardware prefetch configurations that matter mostly to performance as well as a set of PMCs that maximize the machine learning prediction accuracy.

In this context predicting the traffic flow is useful for managers to optimize the configuration of the road network towards reducing the congestions and ultimately, the pollution. With the explosion of the so-called Big Data concept and its application to traffic data, a wide range of traffic flow prediction methods has been reported in the related literature. However, most of the efforts in this field have been hitherto focused on short-term prediction models. This paper analyzes how to properly characterize traffic flow in urban road scenarios with an emphasis on the long term. To this end a clustering stage is utilized to discover typicalities or patterns within the traffic flow data registered by each road sensor, which permits building prediction models for each of such discovered patterns. These individual prediction models are intended to become part of the MoveUs platform, which will provide the technical means 1) for traffic managers to analyze in depth the status of the road network, and 2) for road users to better plan their trips.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0223-8; POD:978-1-5090-0224-5","10.1109/NOMS.2016.7502980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7502980","Long-term traffic flow prediction;machine learning;mobility patterns","Biological system modeling;Conferences;Data models;Predictive models;Roads;Urban areas","Big Data;intelligent transportation systems;road traffic","Big Data concept;European Commission;MoveUs project;clustering stage;daily mobility patterns;road sensor;sustainable eco-friendly mobility habits;traffic data;traffic flow analytics;traffic flow prediction methods;traffic managers;urban road networks","","","","","","","25-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been realized that most of the times, all parameters (called features precisely here) are not required to decide the outcome (or decision) of an instance. Therefore feature selection is an important step in data processing. In this paper, a novel method is presented to select features. In the method, cosine similarity of individual feature of the database with the respective class is computed and kept in an array in descending order. The first feature of this array is combined with rest of the features sequentially one by one. If the classification accuracy of the combination of features increases then the combination is accepted otherwise the responsible features are eliminated from the combination. In this manner all features are tested and a final subset of features is obtained. The results obtained after rigorous experiments on the proposed method on high dimensional databases and comparing with other methods reported so far are encouraging. It is therefore recommended that the proposed method can be applied for high dimensional data processing.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6829-2; POD:978-1-4673-6830-8","10.1109/NATSYS.2015.7489113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489113","Dimensionality Reduction;Feature selection;Machine Learning;Similarity Measure","Brain models;Classification algorithms;Databases;Feature extraction;Robustness;Testing","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classification accuracy;feature testing;high dimensional databases;high-dimensional data processing;high-dimensional datasets;information processing;sequential cosine similarity based feature selection technique","","1","","25","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our overall performance evaluation shows that RNTN outperforms the lexicon-based by 9.88% accuracy on variable length positive, negative, and neutral comments.

In MCI due to SVD, the most prominent feature of cognitive impairment lies in degradation of executive functions, i.e., of processes that supervise the organization and execution of complex behavior. The trail making test is a widely employed test sensitive to cognitive processing speed and executive functioning. MCI due to SVD has been hypothesized to be the effect of WM damage, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established technique for in vivo characterization of WM. We propose a machine learning scheme tailored to 1) predicting the impairment in executive functions in patients with MCI and SVD, and 2) examining the brain substrates of this impairment. We employed data from 40 MCI patients with SVD and created feature vectors by averaging mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy maps within 50 WM regions of interest. We trained support vector machines (SVMs) with polynomial as well as radial basis function kernels using different DTI-derived features while simultaneously optimizing parameters in leave-one-out nested cross validation. The best performance was obtained using MD features only and linear kernel SVMs, which were able to distinguish an impaired performance with high sensitivity (72.7%-89.5%), specificity (71.4%-83.3%), and accuracy (77.5%-80.0%). While brain substrates of executive functions are still debated, feature ranking confirm that MD in several WM regions, not limited to the frontal lobes, are truly predictive of executive functions.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2537808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7425158","Diffusion tensor imaging;executive functions;machine learning;mild cognitive impairment;neuroimaging","Biomedical imaging;Diffusion tensor imaging;Diseases;Education;Substrates;Tensile stress","biodiffusion;biomedical MRI;blood vessels;brain;diseases;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;optimisation;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","DTI;DTI data;MCI patients;SVD;SVM;T2-weighted magnetic resonance images;brain substrates;cerebral small vessel disease;cerebral white matter;cognitive processing speed;diffuse hyperintensities;diffusion tensor imaging;feature ranking;fractional anisotropy;frontal lobes;impaired performance;machine learning scheme;mean diffusivity;mild cognitive impairment;parameter optimization;polynomial;radial basis function kernels;support vector machines;trail making test","","2","","57","","20160303","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In behavioral approach, these detection systems work on the entire network to detect anomalies after establishing the network's normal profile involving all users. In this article we present a new method for intrusion detection based on behavioral approach where we show that IDSs could also be host-based so that the behavior of an individual user could be profiled using characteristics extracted from system log data. A new user behavior is considered abnormal when it deviates from its profile. When detected, this anomaly can prove to be an intrusion.

Clinical diagnostic employing machine learning systems is a complicated process as it requires high accuracy and speed. Although, several researchers have tackled this problem, big data poses some difficulties on achieving the desire accuracy and speed. This challenge increases substantially as the multidimensional datasets loaded several hurdles on the current computational model. We suggest using a hash coding method to tackle this problem. In this work, an innovated supervised method that reverses the error-correction Golay Code to classify large scale datasets and predict individual patient outcomes or risks based on a chosen number of features (i.e. medical finding) is presented. While some classifiers are very flexible, with many user-adjustable parameters, the proposed algorithm is almost automatic. Its cost to classify unseen pattern is on average O(1). To support our theoretical arguments, empirical evidence is considered. Different classification algorithms are also discussed and reviewed for their similarity.

First we apply segmentation to the face and hand region by using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering (FCM) and Thresholding. FCM is a clustering technique which employs fuzzy partitioning, in an iterative algorithm. After the face and hands are segmented, the feature vectors are extracted. The feature vectors are chosen among the low level features such as the bounding ellipse, bounding box, and center of mass coordinates, since they are known to be more robust to segmentation errors due to low resolution images. In total there are 23 features for each hand. After the feature vectors are extracted, they are used for recognition with discrete Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Recognition stage is composed of two stages, namely training and classification. The Baum Welch algorithm is used for HMM training. In classification part the likelihood of each HMM is calculated and the HMM with the highest likelihood is chosen. In order to measure the success rate of the system, the eNTERFACE dataset is used.

The benefit of our project is that the Virginia DMV can make some adjustments accordingly and reduce the number of crashes that are fatal and have high damage cost. The data we used is between 2010 and 2014 for both fatality analysis and damage cost analysis. Data of 2015 was used for fatality analysis only. In the first part of this paper, we will introduce how we find factors that caused fatal car crashes. Since the data are unbalanced, we first subsampled the non-fatal crashes and applied a higher weight for fatal crashes. When building the model, we used logistic regression model to predict whether an accident is fatal or not. To select features that are more important, we used factors that are all numeric and with correlation value more than 0.1. We obtained a recall of 40% in the prediction from the logistic regression. We also adopted Decision Tree in fatality analysis and built two models for 2010-2014 data as well as 2015 data. In the second part of this paper, we will discuss how we find factors that caused damage cost. Since values of damage cost variable are unbalanced, we proposed a two-state method to find critical factors of the damage cost. First, we used K nearest neighborhood (KNN) to predict whether the damage cost is 0 or not. Second, we built Lasso Regression on the data where the damage cost were not zero and discovered the factors that lead to the damage cost.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0970-1; POD:978-1-5090-0971-8","10.1109/SIEDS.2016.7489281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7489281","decision analysis;machine learning;statistical modeling","Accidents;Computer crashes;Decision trees;Injuries;Logistics;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;road accidents;traffic information systems","DMV crash data;K nearest neighborhood;KNN;Lasso regression;Virginia DMV;damage cost analysis;decision tree;fatal car crashes;fatality analysis;logistic regression model;recall;statistical analysis;statistical methods;statistical models;two-state method","","","","7","","","29-29 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the INS's modules have a cascading nature, it is important that these false movements are identified beforehand.

The optic disc is also the entry point for the major blood vessels that supply the retina. The detection and localization of optic disc from ophthalmic fundus images is very vital for the diagnosis of various diseases in ophthalmology. These diseases are varying from Glaucoma to Diabetic Retinopathy and many more. Image processing is widely used for the purpose of diagnosing and detection of different retinal diseases however, the results generated by these algorithms can only be tested by domain experts. This research aims at an image processing method for detecting optic disc. An algorithm is developed and generated results are verified by image processing algorithm for detection of optic disc using machine learning through Support Vector Machine (SVM). The algorithm is first trained on a set of images as marked by the domain expert (Ophthalmologist) and SVM training results are stored in a database. Image processing technique is used for the testing of unknown fundus image and its outcome is verified through SVM. Depending on SVM outcome, desired optic disc is marked on the image. The proposed framework uses image processing algorithm and then verify those results using SVM.

Mining influence relationships from graphs has gained increasing interests in recent years because providing information on how graph objects influence each other can facilitate graph exploration, graph search, and connection recommendations. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting influence aspects, on which objects are connected, and influence degree (or influence strength), with which one graph node influences another graph node on a given aspect. Existing techniques focus on inferring either the overall influence degrees or the influence types from graphs. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to extract influence aspects and learn aspect-level influence strength. In particular, we first present a novel instance-merging based method to extract influence aspects from the context of object connections. We then introduce two generative models, Observed Aspect Influence Model (OAIM) and Latent Aspect Influence Model (LAIM), to model the topological structure of graphs, the text content associated with graph objects, and the context in which the objects are connected. To learn OAIM and LAIM, we design both non-parallel and parallel Gibbs sampling algorithms. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real data sets to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods. The experimental results show that our models can discover more effective results than existing approaches.

With the increased usage of the internet and smart-based applications, image classification has become more important in various social, financial, and domestic spheres. Deep learning algorithms have proven useful and powerful, having successfully classified many types of images, objects, etc. This paper uses a type of deep neural network, stacked denoising autoencoders (SDA), to classify the handwritten digits in the MNIST database. The method proposed transforms the images into the wavelet domain, for faster, more efficient processing, as compared to the spatial domain. Furthermore, the low frequency and high frequency components separately provide pertinent feature details learned by the SDA to correctly classify each digit. The fusion of the learned low and high frequency features, and processing the combined feature mapping results in an increased detection accuracy. Compared to traditional (spatial) SDA and other classification algorithms, experimental results of this method show an increase in speed, efficiency, and accuracy in image classification and object recognition.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2246-5; POD:978-1-5090-2247-2","10.1109/SECON.2016.7506768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7506768","Classification;Deep Learning;Digits;Fusion;Machine Learning;Neural Network;Object Recognition;SDA;Wavelet","Classification algorithms;Image classification;Machine learning;Neural networks;Noise reduction;Training;Wavelet domain","feature extraction;handwritten character recognition;image classification;image denoising;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object recognition","MNIST database;SDA-based neural network approach;deep neural network;feature fusion;feature mapping;handwritten digit classification;image classification;machine learning;object recognition;spatial domain;stacked denoising autoencoders","","","","","","","March 30 2016-April 3 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We derived a pictorial structures model to mimic their behavior; candidate anatomical landmarks were identified by an integral channel features based sliding window detector trained on 1000 2D fetal ultrasound images, and their optimal configuration determined using a probabilistic model trained on the relative positions of anatomical landmarks in the same 1000 images. When tested on a further 80 3D fetal ultrasound volumes, our algorithm performed better than state-of-the-art methods which did not use knowledge of eye movements, achieving a standardised plane extraction accuracy of 92.5% and demonstrating, for the first time, that eye-tracking is a powerful tool for informing the design of computer vision algorithms for 3D ultrasound image analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2349-6; POD:978-1-4799-2351-9","10.1109/ISBI.2016.7493454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7493454","Eye Tracking;Fetal Ultrasound;Machine Learning;Pictorial Structures","Abdomen;Detectors;Navigation;Stomach;Three-dimensional displays;Ultrasonic imaging;Veins","biomechanics;biomedical ultrasonics;computer vision;eye;feature extraction;medical image processing;obstetrics;probability;ultrasonic imaging","2D fetal ultrasound images;3D fetal abdominal ultrasound volumes;3D ultrasound image analysis;anatomical landmarks;automatic extraction;computer vision algorithms;eye movements;eye-tracking inspired method;integral channel features based sliding window detector;optimal configuration;pictorial structures model;probabilistic model;standardised image planes;standardised plane extraction;standardised plane extraction accuracy","","1","","7","","","13-16 April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, we experimentally demonstrate the need for mobile specific techniques and then identify a range of new static features that highly correlate with mobile malicious webpages.We then apply kAYO to a dataset of over 350,000 known benign and malicious mobile webpages and demonstrate 90% accuracy in classification. Moreover, we discover, characterize and report a number of webpages missed by Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal, but detected by kAYO.

Assuming that the moving trajectories of users are available, it is shown how side information can be incorporated in the algorithms to improve their convergence performance and the quality of the estimation. The complexity is significantly reduced by imposing sparsity awareness in the sense that the algorithms exploit the compressibility of the measurement data to reduce the amount of data that is saved and processed. Finally, we present extensive simulations based on realistic data to show that our algorithms provide fast and robust estimates of coverage maps in real-world scenarios. Envisioned applications include path-loss prediction along trajectories of mobile users as a building block for anticipatory buffering or traffic offloading.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2453391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152980","Adaptive filters;Kernel-based filtering, machine learning;coverage estimation;mobile communications","Dictionaries;Estimation;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Reliability;Tin","adaptive filters;cellular radio;gradient methods","APSM;adaptive filters;adaptive projected subgradient method;cellular networks;coverage maps;iterative methods;kernel-based adaptive online reconstruction;path-loss measurements;sparsity awareness","","2","","34","","20150708","July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

At the same time, it also has the disadvantages such as large storage space, long training time and repeated training. In order to overcome these drawbacks, we propose an alternative approach based on K-means. The new method is to change the view of the ensemble learning about the integration of all sub algorithms. It is based on the k-means method to select the representative algorithms for algorithms library, so that the redundant or duplicate sub algorithms can be filtered out. In the experimental part, our approach is compared with seven classic methods, including BP neural network, Decision tree, Random forest andfour kinds of integration method. From the comparison of the results, the new algorithm can reduce the complexity of the computation, and also has obvious advantages in the accuracy.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-8172-7; Electronic:978-1-4673-8173-4; POD:978-1-4673-8174-1","10.1109/ICCSNT.2015.7490832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7490832","Decision-Tree;K-means;ensemble learning;machine learning;neural network","Algorithm design and analysis;Bagging;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Diabetes;Machine learning algorithms;Training","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","algorithms library;computation complexity reduction;ensemble learning;k-means method;multiple weak machine learning methods;representative algorithms;selective ensemble method","","1","","15","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is in part due to the fact that the working capacity and the performance of an individual, either physical or mental, generally decrease as the day progresses, although factors like motivation also play a significant role. These negative effects are especially significant when carrying out long or demanding tasks, as often happens in an educational context. In order to avoid these effects, initiatives to promote a good management of the time and effort invested in each task are mandatory. Such initiatives, when effective, can have a wide range of positive effects, including on the performance, productivity, attention and even mental health. Seeking to find a viable and realistic approach to address this problem, this paper presents a non-invasive and non-intrusive way to measure mental workload, one of the aspects that affects mental fatigue the most. Specifically, we target scenarios of e-learning, in which the professor may not be present to assess the student's state. The aim is to create a tool that enables an actual management of fatigue in such environments and thus allows for the implementation of more efficient learning processes, adapted to the abilities and state of each student.","","Electronic:978-989-758-137-3; POD:978-1-4673-8406-3","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7483728","Fatigue Management;Human Performance;Machine Learning;Mental Fatigue;Mental Workload;e-Learning","Computers;Context;Electronic learning;Fatigue;Keyboards;Mice;Monitoring","","","","","","13","","","11-13 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

EEG recording is effectively used for detection and prediction of electrophysiological abnormalities due to epilepsy. Epileptic seizure is a brain disorder which affects the patients acutely. Seizures are controllable with medication in 70% of the cases, however the rest may continue to have recurring epileptic seizures despite medications. Since seizures are unpredictable clinically, these patients will also live with perpetual anxiety about the onset of seizure, apart from being affected by the seizure consequences such as drowsiness, headache, vomiting, etc. The seizures can cause injury to the patients, and in some cases may even result in death. Seizure prediction can aid patients with disabling seizure by detecting the seizure precursors in advance and alerting the patients or their caregivers. If the seizure is predicted in advance it can be aborted by fast acting Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) or other treatment procedures. This will also aid pre-surgical video EEG monitoring wherein prediction of the ictal onset zone is paramount and machine alarms can be devised. In this paper, we are comparing the results of our research work related to the seizure prediction models. First model, as in usual practice, differentiates between preictal and interictal data segments only. The other seizure prediction model uses Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs), Electrographic Seizures (ES) and ictal data segments in addition to the first model. We found that the latter one provided better results and improved the seizure prediction performance.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-6669-4; Electronic:978-1-4673-6670-0; POD:978-1-4673-6671-7","10.1109/RAICS.2015.7488419","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7488419","EEG;Electrographic Seizure (ES);Extracranial;Ictal;Interictal;Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs);Intracranial;Machine learning;Seizure","Brain models;Data mining;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Training","electroencephalography;medical disorders;medical signal processing","antiepileptic drugs;brain activity;brain disorder;electroencephalography;electrographic seizures;electrophysiological abnormalities;epileptic seizure;ictal data segments;ictal onset zone;interictal epileptiform discharges;machine alarms;perpetual anxiety;presurgical video EEG monitoring;seizure prediction;treatment procedures","","","","30","","","10-12 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
