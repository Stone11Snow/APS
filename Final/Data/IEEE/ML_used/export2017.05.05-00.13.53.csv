This new Artificial Immune System, named AIS-CS, can attain higher than 90% intrusion detection with a false negative percentage below 10% and a fairly low false positive rate on a network composed of 50 regular nodes and 50 intruders. The experiments appear to suggest that the best performance can be found by setting the tolerization and the simulation parameters differently.

In this challenging setting the conventional methods, such as k-centers family, hierarchical clustering or those based on model fitting, are inefficient and typically converge far from the globally optimal solution. As an alternative, we propose a novel unsupervised learning approach which is based on the compressive sensing paradigm. The key idea underlying our algorithm is to monitor the distance between the test sample and its principal projection in each cluster, and continue re-assigning it to the cluster yielding the smallest residual. As a result, we obtain an iterative procedure which, under the compressive assumptions, minimizes the total reconstruction error of all samples from their nearest clusters. To evaluate the proposed approach, we have conducted a series of experiments involving various image collections where the task was to automatically group similar objects. Comparison of the obtained results with those yielded by the state-of-the-art clustering methods provides evidence for high discriminative power of our algorithm.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406692","compressive clustering;coordinate descent;nearest subspace;residual minimization","Clustering algorithms;Face;Image coding;Minimization;Partitioning algorithms;Transform coding;Vectors","compressed sensing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","compressive clustering;compressive sensing paradigm;high-dimensional data;k-centers family;model fitting;multimodal distribution;unsupervised learning approach","","1","","21","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The prognosis architecture we propose makes use of a dynamical clustering algorithm to model the data in a feature space. This algorithm uses a sliding window scheme on which the model is iteratively updated. Metrics applied on the parameters of this model are used to compute a drift severity indicator, which is also an indicator of the health of the system. The architecture for prognosis is applied on a benchmark of wind turbine. The used benchmark has been constructed to serve as a realistic wind turbine model.

Effectively encouraging diversity remains a key element in yielding improved performance from such ensembles. Negatively correlated learning (NCL) has emerged as a promising framework for concurrently training an ensemble of learners while emphasizing the cooperation among them. The NCL methodology relies on negatively correlating the errors of the learners as means of diversifying their outputs. In this paper, we extend this framework by employing the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) - an information-theoretic measure of similarity between probability distributions - as a richer measure of diversity between learners. It is argued that for classification problems, utilizing the JSD is more appropriate than negatively correlating the errors. We analyze the new formulation and derive an upper bound on the parameter that balances accuracy and diversity among the learners. Simulation results applied to standardized benchmarks clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406795","classification;diversity;ensembles;jensen shannon;neural network","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Cost function;Diversity reception;Neural networks;Probability distribution;Training","information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;statistical distributions","JSD;Jensen-Shannon divergence;NCL;classification problems;concurrently training;concurrently-trained neural networks;ensembles;information-theoretic measure;negatively correlated learning;probability distributions","","0","","14","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Of their different characteristics and challenges, network lifetime and efficiency are the most considered issues in WSN-based systems. The scarcest WSN's resource is energy, and one of the most energy-expensive operations is route discovery and data transmission. This paper presents a novel design of a cooperative nodes learning scheme for cooperative energy-efficient routing (CEERA) in wireless sensor networks. In CEERA, nodes perform a cooperative learning in delivering data to the base station. The retransmission of packets is controlled through an address-based timer. CEERA achieves overhead reduction and energy conservation by controlling various parameters that affect the overall network efficiency. Performance results are evaluated using NS2 simulator and our own implemented event-driven simulation.

The problem becomes more difficult as the number of classes increases. Decomposing the problem into a set of binary problems can be a good solution in some cases.

This paper proposes a new greedy technique for building a hierarchical binary classifier to solve multiclass problem. We use neural networks to build all possible binary classifiers and use this greedy strategy to build the hierarchical tree. This technique is evaluated and compared with two popular standard approaches One-Versus-All, One-Versus-One and a multi-class single neural network based classifier.

Steganalysis is a set of techniques to reveal secrets in audio, video or other file formats. Image based stego analysis is fairly simple because hiding methods such as LSB cause RGB inequalities. On the other hand, audio files contain time domain frequencies to create sound waves. The tracks contain wavelength, noise, direction, channels etc. For that reason, it is hard to investigate an audio file containing steganographic information in it or not.

We conducted extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets and compared the segmentation results with current proposed systems. The experimental results show that the performance of our system is comparable to, or even outperforms, those state-of-the-art algorithms. This is a promising approach as in this empirical study we used only texture-layout filter responses as feature and a basic setting of genetic algorithm. The framework is simple and can be extended and improved for many learning problems.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406719","Semantic image segmentation;boosting learning;genetic algorithm;object recognition;texton feature","Accuracy;Boosting;Feature extraction;Genetic algorithms;Image segmentation;Joints;Semantics","feature extraction;filtering theory;genetic algorithms;image classification;image segmentation;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence)","boosting learning;genetic algorithm;image datasets;image texture encoding;learning parameters;object layout encoding;performance improvement;robust classifier learning;semantic digital image segmentation;texton feature;texture-layout filter responses;weak classifiers","","1","1","36","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to Gestalt research, limiting tree map visualisation to rectangles blocks the utilisation of human capability on object recognition, due to the same fixed size (90 degrees) of all the angles of the shapes in the tree visualisation. However, this assertion was only supported by theory and not rooted in empirical perception data. We conducted a series of controlled experiments to investigate the effect of shape variation of data elements and container in visual data analysis process. We first studied how shape variation affects user's perception in the visual data analysis process. We compared combined treemap with traditional rectangular treemaps, slice & dice treemaps and squarifed treemaps.

Therefore, it is necessary to predict how the soil is at points that have not been sampled. This study proposes a system for predicting soil property values, based on Generalized Regression Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms. The Generalized Regression Neural Network is particularly useful when the amount of data is small, as is common in soil inventories. The proposed system calculates the mean square error, mean absolute error and the coefficient of determination as indicators of the prediction error. It also calculates the proportion of points which are generated unpredictably in a resulting map. This information helps the user to select the best combination of input variables and system parameters, according to their needs. The system allowed generating maps of calcium and magnesium concentrations in the soil, from a digital elevation model, satellite image and the values measured in a limited number of sampling points in a cross section of the Caramacate river basin (Aragua state, Venezuela). The selection of input variables to the network and the value of the smoothing parameter which is generated using a Genetic Algorithm, allowed to minimize the prediction error and the percentage of points rated. The results revealed that the selection of input variables to the network is crucial for the success of the prediction.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406644","Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN);soil variability;soil-landscape relation","Calcium;Genetic algorithms;Magnesium;Neural networks;Soil properties;Vectors","cartography;digital elevation models;feedforward neural nets;genetic algorithms;geophysical image processing;image sampling;mean square error methods;regression analysis;rivers;soil","Aragua state;Caramacate river basin;Venezuela;calcium content prediction;determination coefficient;digital elevation model;generalized regression neural networks;generating maps;genetic algorithms;magnesium content prediction;mean absolute;mean square error;prediction error minimization;probabilistic neural networks;sampling points;satellite image;soil characteristics;soil inventories;soil property value prediction","","1","","17","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SMOTE is beneficial for k-NN classifiers based on the Euclidean distance if the number of variables is reduced performing some type of variable selection and the benefit is larger if more neighbors are used.

However, in order to allow the engineer to thoroughly explore the design space and fine-tune parameters, many -- usually very time-consuming -- simulation runs are necessary. Additionally, this results in a huge amount of data that cannot be analyzed in an efficient way without the support of appropriate tools. In this paper, we address the two-fold problem: First, instantly provide simulation results if the parameter configuration is changed, and, second, identify specific areas of the design space with concentrated change and thus importance. We propose the use of a hierarchical approach based on sparse grid interpolation or regression which acts as an efficient and cheap substitute for the simulation. Furthermore, we develop new visual representations based on the derivative information contained inherently in the hierarchical basis. They intuitively let a user identify interesting parameter regions even in higher-dimensional settings. This workflow is combined in an interactive visualization and exploration framework. We discuss examples from different fields of computational science and engineering and show how our sparse-grid-based techniques make parameter dependencies apparent and how they can be used to fine-tune parameter configurations.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.189","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406761","feature identification;sparse grids;surrogate modeling;visual analytics","Accuracy;Acoustics;Computational modeling;Data models;Interpolation;Sparse matrices;Vectors","data mining;hierarchical systems;interpolation;product design;product development","data mining;design decisions;design space;fine-tune parameters;hierarchical approach;high-dimensional parametrized simulation data;industrial product development;numerical simulation;sparse grid interpolation","","3","","9","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The decision process uses statistical tests and information about the current model performance. The incremental learning scheme simultaneously selects the input variables and updates the neural network weights. The weights are adjusted using a gradient-based scheme with optimal learning rate. The performance of the models obtained with the neural fuzzy modeling approach is evaluated considering weather temperature forecasting problems.

In spite of successful research in author attribution, no work has been carried out to find out whether publication venues are similarly distinguishable by their writing styles. Our work takes the first step into exploring this problem. By approaching the problem using a traditional classification method, we extract three types of writing style-based features and carry out detailed experiments in examining the different impacts among features, and classification techniques, as well as the influence of venue content, topics and genres.

Experiments were conducted using three public face databases and two synthetic data sets. It is demonstrated that stable learners can be used in our ensemble method. In the multi-class problems, the ensemble overcomes the early termination even when stable learner is employed.

Here we extend the approach to a series of images that are correlated in time using the physics-based constraints that are often available with scientific imaging. The constraints are implemented through a representational bias in the model and, owing to the smooth nature of the physics evolution in the specified model, provide an effective temporal regularization. Unlike more general temporal regularization techniques, this restricts the space of solutions to those that are physically realizable. We explore the performance of this approach on a simple radiographic imaging problem of a simulated object evolving in time. We demonstrate that the constrained simultaneous analysis of the image sequence outperforms the independent forward modeling analysis over a range of degrees of freedom in the physics constraints, including when the physics model is under-constrained.

Collective Classification deals with the simultaneous classification of neighboring instances in relational data, until a convergence criterion is reached. The rationale behind collective classification stems from the fact that an entity in a network (or relational data) is most likely influenced by the neighboring entities, and can be classified accordingly, based on the class assignment of the neighbors. Although extensive work has been done on collective classification of single labeled data, the domain of multi-labeled relational data has not been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose a neighborhood ranking method for multi-label classification, which can be further used in the Multi-label Collective Classification framework. We test our methods on real world datasets and also discuss the relevance of our approach for other multi-labeled relational data.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of backtracking on two benchmark processes using both Q-learning and real-time dynamic programming.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.63","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406685","Q-Learning;backtracking;dynamic programming;experience replay;reinforcement learning","Dynamic programming;Erbium;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Mathematical model;Process control;Real-time systems","Markov processes;decision making;dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence)","Q-learning;complex Markov decision processes;large scale dynamic programming;offline policy generation;real-time dynamic programming;reinforcement learning algorithms","","0","","26","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multivariate sequences are categorized into three states: normal, patterns and events which are estimated by HMM.

Therefore, to assess their impact, it must be possible to accurately detect Web robot requests. Contemporary detection approaches, however, may cease to be effective as the behavior of both robots and humans evolves. In this paper, we present a novel detection approach that is based on the contrasts in the resource request patterns of robots and humans. The proposed scheme, which relies on an invariant behavioral difference between humans and robots, builds on the lessons from contemporary approaches.

Parallel coordinate, as one of the popular multidimensional data visualization techniques, is suffered from the visual clutter problem. Though changing the ordering of axis is a straightforward way to address it, optimizing the order of axis is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose a new axes re-ordering method in parallel coordinates visualization: a similarity-based method, which is based on the combination of Nonlinear Correlation Coefficient (NCC) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithms. By using this approach, the first remarkable axe can be selected based on mathematics theory and all axis are re-ordered in line with the degree of similarities among them. Meanwhile, we would also propose a measurement of contribution rate of each dimension to reveal the property hidden in the dataset. At last, case studies demonstrate the rationale and effectiveness of our approaches: NCC reordering method can enlarge the mean crossing angles and reduce the amount of polylines between the neighboring axes. It can reduce the computational complexity greatly in comparison with other re-ordering methods.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406759","Multidimensional data visualization;axes re-ordering;nonlinear correlation coefficient;parallel coordinates;singular value decomposition;visual analytics","Acceleration;Clutter;Correlation;Data visualization;Singular value decomposition;Visualization","computational complexity;data analysis;data visualisation;inference mechanisms;optimisation;singular value decomposition","NCC reordering method;NP-complete problem;SVD algorithms;analytical reasoning;axes reordering method;computational complexity;contribution rate measurement;data display;data exploration;human-centered data analysis;human-centered data interpretation;mathematics theory;multidimensional data interaction;multidimensional data visualization technique;nonlinear correlation coefficient;parallel coordinates visualization;polyline reduction;similarity-based method;singular value decomposition;visual clutter problem;visual pipeline","","4","","30","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, great challenges arise when AIMMs are expected to perform various tasks in unstructured or semi-structured environments. Since AIMMs are typically configured in the indoor environments, indoor localization & navigation is one of these challenges. A novel topological indoor localization & navigation method is proposed in this paper. Based on the depth information provided by a popular Kinect sensor, a progressive Bayesian classifier is developed to realize direct corridor type identification. Instead of extracting features from single observation, information from multi-observations are fused to achieve a more robust performance. With the ability of directly determining the corridor types, a topological map generation and loop closing method is proposed to build the environment map through autonomous exploration. By using the Markov Localization and trajectory planning method, the robot can localize itself and navigating freely in the indoor environment.

However, one known concern is that feature selection can sometimes give very different results when applied to very similar data sets. Ensemble gene selection is a promising new approach which may help resolve this concern, producing more stable gene lists and better classification results. Ensemble selection consists of multiple runs of feature ranking which are then combined into a single ranking for each feature. However, one of the most critical decisions when performing ensemble gene selection is deciding on which aggregation technique to use for combining the resulting ranked feature lists from the multiple runs of feature ranking into a single decision for each gene. This paper is an in-depth comparison between two aggregation techniques: Mean Aggregation (a simple and commonly-used technique) and Robust Rank Aggregation (a recently proposed aggregation technique designed specifically for bioinformatics). Our results show that in general Mean Aggregation will outperform (or at least match) Robust Rank Aggregation in terms of classification performance, while being significantly simpler to implement and perform. These results allows us to recommend with reasonable confidence the use of Mean Aggregation over Robust Rank Aggregation.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406590","Classification;DNA Microarray;Ensemble Feature Selection;Robust Rank Aggregation","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Data mining;Data models;Mathematical model;Probability;Robustness","bioinformatics;data mining;genetics;pattern classification","bioinformatics datasets;classification performance;data mining;ensemble gene selection;feature list ranking;feature selection;mean aggregation technique;robust rank aggregation technique","","1","","18","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These messages are hierarchically categorized on basis of neutrality, polarity (positive or negative) and presence of various emotions. The hierarchical classification approach (HC) is a specialization of the well-known flat classification task. The main difference between them is that when using HC, examples must be assigned to classes organized in a previously defined class hierarchy, while traditional flat classification does not take into account the hierarchical information.

If properly analyzed, medical data can be converted to knowledge that improves treatment, uncovers unexpected associations, and supports the personal experience of doctors and nurses, allowing them to make more informed decisions. Medical data is often generated by monitoring across a period of time, whether new data arrives quickly or slowly, consistently or sporadically, but many data mining methods are not designed to consider the temporal aspect of a data set. Besides the extra dimension of time, medical processes often involve interaction between many attributes at once, complicating the discovery of relevant patterns and associations. Specialized methods to interpret medical data can improve the quality of knowledge extracted from it. Tensors are appropriate data structures to represent our data in a multi-dimensional format, taking into account the relationship between many dimensions at once.

Dimensionality reduction and regularization based on preserving smoothness over a graph are common in these settings, and they perform particularly well if proximity in the original feature space closely reflects similarity in the classification problem of interest. However, many real-world problem spaces are overwhelmed by noise in the form of features that have no useful relevance to the concept that is being learned. This leads to a lack of robustness in these methods that limits their applicability to new domains. We present a graph-construction method that uses a collection of task-specific random subspaces to promote smoothness with respect to the problem of interest.

Masses are one type of these abnormalities which are mostly characterized by their margin and shape. For classification of masses proper features are needed to be extracted. However, the number of well-known features for describing margin is much fewer than geometrical, shape, and textural ones. In addition, most of the existing margin features are highly dependent on segmentation accuracy. In this work, new features for describing margin of masses are presented which can handle inaccuracies in segmentation. These features are obtained from a set of waveforms by wavelet analysis among each of them. For each of these waveforms an edge probability distribution is computed. Then, features are extracted from these probability distributions. Although these features are called margin features, they are highly related to the texture of the mass. For experimentation DDSM dataset was used and our simulations show the great performance of these features in classification of masses.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406741","Mammography;computer-aided diagnosis;feature extraction;margin;mass classification","Accuracy;Cancer;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Indexes;Probability distribution;Shape","image classification;image segmentation;image texture;mammography;medical image processing;patient diagnosis;probability;wavelet transforms","CAD;DDSM dataset;computer-aided diagnosis systems;edge probability distribution;mammographic mass classification;mammography images;margin features;mass texture;segmentation accuracy;wavelet analysis","","0","","25","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we address the later problem by introducing a novel algorithm that finds time series shapelet in significantly less time than the current methods by extracting infrequent time series shapelet candidates. Subsequences that are distinguishable are usually infrequent compared to other subsequences.

Several methods have been proposed, which integrate gene expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to identify subnetworks. However, existing methods treat differential expression of genes and network topology independently, which is an oversimplified assumption to model real biological systems. In this paper, we propose a sampling-based subnetwork identification approach to take into account the dependency between gene expression and network topology. Specifically, we apply Markov random field (MRF) theory to model the dependency of genes in PPI network using a Bayesian framework, followed by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to identify significant subnetworks. The MCMC approach estimates the posterior distribution of genes' significant scores and network structure iteratively. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real breast cancer data demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying subnetworks, especially several functionally important, aberrant subnetworks associated with pathways involved in the development and recurrence of breast cancer.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406744","Breast cancer;Gene expression;Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC);Markov random field (MRF);Protein-protein interaction (PPI);Subnetwork identification","Biomarkers;Breast cancer;Data models;Gene expression;Proteins;Vectors","Bayes methods;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;biological organs;cancer;genetics;molecular biophysics;patient diagnosis;proteins;random processes;sampling methods","Bayesian framework;MCMC approach;MRF theory;Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach;Markov random field theory;PPI network;aberrant subnetworks;condition-specific protein interaction subnetworks identification;disease diagnosis;diseases molecular mechanisms;gene expression;genes differential expression;microarray data;network biomarkers;network structure;network topology;posterior distribution estimation;protein-protein interaction network;real biological system modeling;real breast cancer data;sampling-based subnetwork identification;synthetic data","","0","","23","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing non-contact optical 3D sensing approaches have their own limitations in the process of 3D information calculation. The reliability of binocular vision is limited to textures of the object surface, and the measuring accuracy of the method based on structured-light projection is limited to the stability of the light generator and the number of projected images. In this paper, we will combine random speckle projection with stereo matching algorithms to study the related problems on 3D measurement in the scene. An unique random speckle pattern is projected to encode the object surface to reduce the influence of projector flickering, and improve the accuracy of stereo matching.

Most of the previous approaches in this direction assume for simplicity that the sparse codes for a low-resolution patch are equal to those of the corresponding high-resolution patch. However, this invariance assumption is not quite accurate especially for large scaling factors where the optimal weights and indices of representative features are not fixed across the scaling transformation. In this paper, we propose an augmented coupled dictionary learning scheme that compensates for the inaccuracy of the invariance assumption. First, we learn a dictionary for the low-resolution image space.

Intuitively, two pieces of code are similar if they have the same effect on a machine's state. Current state-of-the-art tools employ a variety of pair wise comparisons (e.g., template matching using SMT solvers, Value-Set analysis at critical program points, API call matching, etc.) However, these methods are unshakable for clustering large datasets, of size N, since they require O(N<sup>2</sup>) comparisons. In this paper, we present an alternative approach based upon ""hashing"". We propose a scheme that captures the semantics of functions as semantic hashes. Our approach treats a function as a set of features, each of which represent the input-output behavior of a basic block. Using a form of locality-sensitive hashing known as Min Hashing, functions with many common features can be quickly identified, and the complexity of clustering is reduced to O(N). Experiments on functions extracted from the CERT malware catalog indicate that we are able to cluster closely related code with a low false positive rate.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406693","binary static analysis;clustering;malware detection;reverse engineering;semantic comparison","Benchmark testing;Catalogs;Concrete;Feature extraction;Malware;Registers;Semantics","computational complexity;file organisation;invasive software;pattern clustering;program diagnostics","CERT malware catalog;MinHashing;binary executables;binary function clustering;clustering complexity reduction;code clustering;input-output behavior;large datasets clustering;locality-sensitive hashing;low false positive rate;malware detection;pairwise comparisons;semantic hash;semantically-related function identification","","4","","15","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, there have been several attempts to apply neural networks to predict landscape susceptibility to landslides. However, the knowledge of the neural network is expressed in a mathematical model that does not allow establishing, intuitively, relationships between the factors causing landslides. This makes it difficult for experts to interpret the output of the network, to support their results with a set of inference rules. This limitation could be overcome by a model based on the FALCON neural network, which allows not only a classification for data clustering with fuzzy logic, but also generates a set of fuzzy rules from data training. For this reason, the FALCON-ART neural network has been implemented in this study to create a set of models of susceptibility to landslides on the watershed of the Caramacate River in north-central. The input data of the model included a landslide scar map from 1992, and variables derived from a digital elevation model and a SPOT-satellite image. A cross validation determined that the best result achieved a 74% success rate in predicting areas susceptible to landslides.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406643","digital elevation models;fuzzy logic;satellite image","Adaptation models;Equations;Mathematical model;Neural networks;Terrain factors;Training;Vectors","adaptive control;artificial satellites;erosion;fuzzy control;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;geomorphology;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neural nets;pattern clustering;rivers;water resources","Caramacate River;FALCON-ART neural network model;SPOT-satellite image;catastrophic character;data clustering classification;data training;erosion process;fuzzy adaptive learning control network model;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule set;inference rules;landscape morphology;landscape susceptibility estimation;landscape susceptibility prediction;landslide scar map;landslides;watershed","","0","","15","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent reports clearly indicate that the volume of SMS spam messages are dramatically increasing year by year. Probably, one of the major concerns in academic settings was the scarcity of public SMS spam datasets, that are sorely needed for validation and comparison of different classifiers. To address this issue, we have recently proposed a new SMS Spam Collection that, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest, public and real SMS dataset available for academic studies. However, as it has been created by augmenting a previously existing database built using roughly the same sources, it is sensible to certify that there are no duplicates coming from them. So, in this paper we offer a comprehensive analysis of the new SMS Spam Collection in order to ensure that this does not happen, since it may ease the task of learning SMS spam classifiers and, hence, it could compromise the evaluation of methods. The analysis of results indicate that the procedure followed does not lead to near-duplicates and, consequently, the proposed dataset is reliable to use for evaluating and comparing the performance achieved by different classifiers.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.211","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406757","Classification;Mobile spam;Spam filtering;Text analysis;Text categorization","Artificial neural networks;Cellular phones;Databases;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Unsolicited electronic mail","electronic messaging;mobile computing;mobile handsets;pattern classification;unsolicited e-mail","SMS spam classifiers;SMS spam collection;SMS spam messages;electronic junk mail;mobile phones;near-duplicates;public SMS spam datasets","","5","","13","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this combination, it greatly improves the clustering performance. To optimize SS-NPAF, we apply the well-known projected gradient method to overcome the slow convergence problem of the mostly used multiplicative update rule.

This measure is used to explore the connection between calling behaviors and the complex structure mobile call graphs take. We study a large call graph from a major service provider and learn that distant, outlier relationships play the largest role in maintaining connectivity between cellular users, and that calling features of users more strongly influence tie variation compared to social features.

An abrupt fault is viewed as a violation of the component desired behavior. While a drift-like fault is viewed as a drift in the normal characteristics of component response to actions. An indicator measuring the change in the response characteristics of the component is used to detect a drift. This detection can be then used to warn a human operator when the component behavior starts to deviate from its normal behavior. The proposed approach is illustrated using a manufacturing system.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406774","Discrete event systems;Fault diagnosis;Manufacturing systems;component: Drift detection and monitoring","Actuators;Fault diagnosis;Histograms;Probability distribution;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Time factors","discrete event systems;fault diagnosis","abrupt fault diagnosis;asynchronous occurrence;component behavior;component model;component response;concurent discrete event systems;concurrent DES;drift-like fault diagnosis;dynamical systems;manufacturing system;system behavior","","0","","17","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The framework makes use of existing sampling techniques such as RUS, ROS, and SMOTE and ties the classification algorithm into the sampling process in a wrapper like manner. In doing so the framework is able to search for a desirably sampled training set, thus eliminating the need to specify a target distribution and automatically tuning the training set distribution to the classification algorithm's learning preferences. This is important when re-sampling multi-class data where manually searching for an appropriate target distribution would be a daunting task. We test both our Dynamic Sampling approach and traditional Static Sampling using RUS, ROS, SMOTE, ROS+RUS, and SMOTE+RUS with several classification algorithms on a four class, highly imbalanced data set. We compare the results of Static Sampling and Dynamic Sampling and find that overall both techniques are able to raise Recall for the highest minority classes, but Dynamic Sampling is also able to maintain or raise Recall for the majority classes. Also, Dynamic Sampling is overall more robust and resilient, and is better able to sustain classifier Accuracy and to raise G-Mean and Minimum F-Measures.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.144","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406737","Dynamic Sampling;Imbalanced Data;Multi-class","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Educational institutions;Heuristic algorithms;Niobium;Training","data mining;pattern classification;sampling methods;statistical distributions","G-Mean;ROS;RUS;SMOTE;classification algorithm;classification algorithm learning preferences;dynamic sampling;dynamic sampling framework;minimum F-measures;multiclass data re-sampling;multiclass imbalanced data;sampled training set;sampling process;sampling techniques;static sampling;target distribution;training set distribution","","3","","20","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Muscle categorization is typically based on visual and auditory assessment of the morphology and activation patterns of its constituent motor units. A procedure which is highly dependent on the skills and level of experience of the examiner. This motivates the development of automated or semi-automated categorization techniques. This paper describes a 2-stage Gaussian mixture model based approach. In the first stage, a muscle is classified as neurogenic or myopathic. The second stage uses a classifier specific to each disease category to confirm or refute the disease involvement. A total of 2556 motor unit potentials sampled from 48 normal, 30 neurogenic and 20 myopathic tibialis anterior muscles were utilized for this study. The proposed approach showed an average accuracy of 91.25%, which is higher than the compared linear and non-linear multi-class schemas. In addition to improved accuracy, the 2-stage approach is more suitable for the muscle categorization, because it has a hierarchical decision structure similar to current clinical practice, and its output can be interpreted as a measure of confidence.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.100","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406621","2-stage approach;Decomposition based quantitative EMG;Gaussian Mixture Model;Muscle categorization;Needle EMG","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Diseases;Electromyography;Feature extraction;Muscles;Vectors","Gaussian distribution;diseases;electromyography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;needles;neural nets;neurophysiology;physiological models;signal classification","2-stage Gaussian mixture model;artificial neural networks;feed forward ANN;motor units;muscle categorization;myopathic muscle;nerve conduction;neurogenic muscle;neuromuscular diseases;neurophysiologic effects;quantitative needle electromyography;tibialis anterior muscles","","1","","10","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To perform software quality prediction, various software metrics are collected during the software development cycle, and models are built using these metrics. However, not all features (metrics) make the same contribution to the class attribute (e.g., faulty/not faulty). Thus, selecting a subset of metrics that are relevant to the class attribute is a critical step. As many feature selection algorithms exist, it is important to find ones which will produce consistent results even as the underlying data is changed, this quality of producing consistent results is referred to as ""stability."" In this paper, we investigate the stability of seven feature selection techniques in the context of software quality classification. We compare four approaches for varying the underlying data to evaluate stability: the traditional approach of generating many sub samples of the original data and comparing the features selected from each, an earlier approach developed by our research group which compares the features selected from sub samples of the data with those selected from the original, and two newly-proposed approaches based on comparing two sub samples which are specifically designed to have same number of instances and a specified level of overlap, with one of these new approaches comparing within each pair while the other compares the generated sub samples with the original dataset. The empirical validation is carried out on sixteen software metrics datasets. Our results show that ReliefF is the most stable feature selection technique. Results also show that the level of overlap, degree of perturbation, and feature subset size do affect the stability of feature selection methods. Finally, we find that all four approaches of evaluating stability produce similar results in terms of which- feature selection techniques are best under different circumstances.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406712","feature selection;stability;subsample","Partitioning algorithms;Radio frequency;Software metrics;Software quality;Stability analysis","pattern classification;set theory;software metrics;software quality;software reliability","ReliefF technique;data subsamples;faulty class attribute;feature subset size;metric subset selection;notfaulty class attribute;overlap level;perturbation degree;quality assurance;software development cycle;software metric feature selection technique stability;software projects;software quality classification;software quality prediction","","0","","17","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been found to be responsible for many rhythmic biological movements, such as breathing, swimming, flying as well as walking. Many CPG models have been designed and proved to be useful. But the CPG outputs of these models are often sine waves or quasi-sine waves. Also these outputs are directly used as the control signals to control joint trajectories or joint torques on robots. This is obviously not an accurate design in robot walking control especially when sine or quasisine waves are not the best signals to set walking patters because of the complexity of tasks. In this paper, based on the idea of Righetti, Buchli and Ijspeert, a CPG model is designed, which is inspired by Fourier series and can produce outputs with any shape. There are a limited set of sub-components in the proposed model. Each sub-component learns one harmonic of a reference wave. A summation of these sub-components is used to approximate the wave. In this way, the wave will be learned and embedded in the CPG model. In the proposed model, FFT is used to see the harmonics and calculate the frequency. The system is designed in polar coordinates with new Hebbian learning items and Kuramoto model items. Because the whole system is a limit cycle system, it is robust to perturbation.

The workload data is first normalized and Markov chains are constructed from the dynamics of the IO loads of the data storage units. Based on the correlation of one-step Markov chain transition probabilities k-means method is employed to group the storage units that have similar behavior at each point. Such framework can then easily be incorporated in various resource management policies that aim at enhancing performance, reliability, availability.

The ensemble portion is achieved through multiple runs of feature selection which are then aggregated into a single result. The critical question is how many iterations of feature selection are appropriate. Too few iterations can make classification performance suffer. However, too many iterations will cause issues regarding computational costs. The goal is to choose the correct number of iterations to maximize classification performance without expending too much computational power. Our paper is an in-depth study on the effect of the number of iterations of feature selection on classification performance. Our work employs eleven DNA microarray datasets, on which we apply various ensemble methods, feature selection techniques, classifiers, and feature subset sizes. The results show that using 10 iterations of feature ranking during ensemble feature selection is not sufficient to optimize classification results and that a larger number of iterations is required (20 or 50). However, there is very little distinction between 20 iterations and 50 iterations, as both produce very similar classification results. Our recommendation is to use 20 iterations because while 20 iterations and 50 iterations perform similarly, 20 iterations has a much smaller computation time. To our knowledge there has not been a previous study as expansive as this one on the effects of the number of iterations of feature selection on ensemble feature selection.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406593","Classification;DNA Microarray;Ensemble Feature Selection;Number of Iterations","Bioinformatics;Biological neural networks;Cancer;DNA;Diversity reception;Stability analysis;Support vector machines","DNA;bioinformatics;classification;genetics;lab-on-a-chip","DNA microarray datasets;classification performance;ensemble gene selection;gene lists","","1","","16","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a shape comparison and classification framework that consists of two major components. A meridian-based shape representation, stemmed from spectral graph theory, possesses the merit of being able to capture the salient structure property along the direction of maximal shape variations. The meridian extraction algorithm, relying on a discrete approximation of the gradient of the induced Fiedler function, can also be utilized for other purposes, e.g., mesh generation for three-dimensional objects. After projecting the 3D meridians onto a multi-dimensional sphere, similarity/dissimilarity between shapes can be computed based on a Riemannian spherical distance metric. Group statistics, as well as object classification/clustering, can be readily carried out. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework with subcortical structures extracted from human brain MR images.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406618","Fiedler function;Riemannian Shape Spaces;Spectral Graph Theory;Subcortical Structures","Approximation algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Laplace equations;Manifolds;Measurement;Shape;Vectors","approximation theory;biomedical MRI;feature extraction;gradient methods;graph theory;image classification;medical image processing;shape recognition","CA;Riemannian shape analysis;computational anatomy;discrete gradient approximation;group statistics;human brain MR images;induced Fiedler function;intrinsic distance metric;maximal shape variations;meridian curves;meridian extraction algorithm;meridian-based shape representation;shape classification framework;shape comparison;spectral graph theory;subcortical structures","","1","","19","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this approach, the user first builds up a visual classifier from a training dataset based on its data projection plotted by HOV<sup>3</sup> with a statistical measurement of the training dataset on a 2d space where data points with the same class label are well grouped. Then the user classifies unlabeled data points by projecting them with the labeled data points of the visual classifier together in order to collect the unlabeled data points overlapped by the labeled ones. As a result, this study provides a method which is intuitive and easy to use for data classification by visualization.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.197","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406758","Classification;Data Projection;Visualization","Classification algorithms;Data visualization;Decision trees;Extraterrestrial measurements;Support vector machine classification;Training;Visualization","data visualisation;interactive systems;pattern classification;statistical analysis","2D space;HOV<sup>3</sup> method;data projection;data visualization;hypothesis-oriented verification-and-validation-by visualization;labeled data point collection;multivariate data interactive visual classification;separation feature enhancement;statistical measurement;unlabeled data point classification;unlabeled data point collection;visual classifier","","1","","18","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a method for retaining the information in prior distributions of matrix variate dynamic linear models (MVDLMs) as the eigenspace of sequential data evolves. The method starts by constructing sliding windows â"" matrices composed of a fixed number of columns containing the most recent point-in-time multivariate observation vectors. Characteristic time series, the right singular vectors, are extracted from a window using singular value decomposition (SVD). Then, a sequence of matrices capturing the rotation and scaling of the eigenspace is specified as a function of adjacent windowsâ characteristic time series. The method is tested on observations derived from daily US stock prices spanning 25 years. The results indicate that models constructed using sliding window SVD and MVDLMs, as extended in this paper, are resistant to over-fitting and perform well when used in portfolio construction applications.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406772","Online regression methods;applications of dynamic online incremental learning;unsupervised methods","Covariance matrix;Data models;Loading;Portfolios;Principal component analysis;Time series analysis;Vectors","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;singular value decomposition;vectors","MVDLM;SVD;eigenspaces;generative distribution;matrix variate dynamic linear models;nonstationary sequential data;point-in-time multivariate observation vectors;portfolio construction;singular value decomposition;temporal evolution","","0","","19","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
