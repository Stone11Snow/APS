Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) can be considered as a natural nonlinear generalization of PCA, which performs linear PCA in a high dimensional space implicitly by using kernel trick. However, both conventional PCA and KPCA suffer from the deficiency of being sensitive to outliers. Existing robust KPCA has to eigen-decompose the gram matrix directly in each step and is much more computationally infeasible due to the large size of the matrix when the number of training samples is large. By extending existing robust PCA algorithm using kernel methods, we present a novel robust adaptive algorithm for calculating the kernel principal components. The proposed method not only preserves the characteristic of capturing underlying nonlinear structure of KPCA but also is robust against outliers by restraining the effect of outlying samples. Compared with existing robust KPCA methods, our method is performed without having to store the kernel matrix, which can reduce significantly the storage burden. In addition, our method shows the potential of expansibility to the incremental learning version. Experimental results on synthetic data indicate that our improved algorithm is effective and promising.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370750","Dimensionality reduction;Feature extraction;Outliers;Robust kernel principal component analysis;Robust principal component analysis","Cybernetics;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Laboratories;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Principal component analysis;Robustness","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;principal component analysis","incremental learning;iterative algorithm;matrix algebra;natural nonlinear generalization;robust kernel principal component analysis","","5","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly a new improved strategy is proposed to restrict the end effect; then the diastolic murmurs of normal object and CAD patient are analyzed by improved Hilbert Huang transform.

We introduce the novel concept of the ridge curve and establish a theory on the degree of overlap between two components. Based on this theory, we develop an algorithm for calculating the overlap rate. We investigate factors that affect the value of the overlap rate, and show how the theory can be used to generate ""truthed data"" as well as to measure the overlap rate between a given pair of clusters or components in a mixture.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370542","Cluster analysis;Mixture model;Overlap rate;Ridge curve","Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data analysis;Data models;Electronic mail;Gaussian processes;Machine learning;Mathematics;Multidimensional systems","Gaussian processes;data mining;pattern clustering","Gaussian component;data distribution model;data mining","","1","","11","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We identify the intrusion scenarios via attack graph analysis, and then suggest a quantitative measure of network system survivability. Mathematics formulas are given and network nodes that influenced survivability are investigated. From a case study, we identify the compromisable nodes that can be penetrated and damaged by intrusion and provide valuable suggestions to enhance system survivability design.

In the transcription level, the promoter region plays an important role in binding of RNA polymerase for the subsequent initiation of transcription. In this paper, we use the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to select the most informative and discriminative word-based features to differentiate the promoter and non-promoter regions in large genomic sequences. First, we assume that the nucleotide sequence is composed of random ""words"" with the same length. Second, based on promoter and non-promoter training samples, we have two discrete distributions over the same random word, and the KL divergence is a measure of the distance between these distributions. Finally, we select two groups of words, one for the class ""promoter"" and the other for the class ""non-promoter"", which have the maximum KL divergence in training samples. The gene recognition proceeds by comparing the number of word matches between the two groups of informative words. Encouraging results are obtained in experiments on the human promoter recognition in DBTSS database. The recognition rate is comparable with those of the state-of-the-art promoter recognizers. Future works about the combination of words with different lengths are also discussed.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370721","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370721","","Bioinformatics;DNA;Gene expression;Genomics;Humans;Machine learning;Polymers;Proteins;RNA;Sequences","biology computing;genetics;macromolecules;statistical distributions","DBTSS database;Kullback-Leibler divergence;RNA polymerase;differential gene transcription;differential protein modification;discrete distributions;gene recognition;genomic sequences;human gene expression;human promoter recognition;nucleotide sequence;selective messenger RNA translation;selective nuclear RNA processing;word-based features","","1","","17","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an example, we develop a four-button interface for entering multi-digit numbers by making pushing gestures within an invisible 2 x 2 button matrix inside a square drawn by the user. Trajectories of the fingertip movements entering numbers are captured with a 3D position sensor mounted on the tip of the forefinger. Two methods are used for recognizing the gestures of drawing a square and pushing buttons.

The method is consisted of three periods, i.e. matrix analysis, sub-expression analysis and script expression analysis. In matrix analysis (sub-expression analysis), a ME (sub-expression) is decomposed into several basic matrixes (sub-expressions) and some sub-expressions (script expressions) by reconstructing the ME global structure, and then every basic matrix (sub-expression) is analyzed from bottom to up. In script analysis, graph rewriting algorithm is adopted to build script relation trees among symbols within a script expression.

Leaf reflectance spectrum, which is caused by the absorption of leaf biochemical substances to a great extent, becomes an effective and fast way for leaf biochemical estimation. In this paper, the influence of chlorophyll and leaf water on leaf reflectance spectrum was investigated at first, and two artificial neural networks (ANN) were established for chlorophyll and leaf water estimation. In the end, the accuracy of ANN was validated using measured data. The main problem of ANN modeling in this paper is that the great number of spectral bands of leaf reflectance spectrum and insufficient measured leaf samples hamper the gathering of training sample set to establish the neural network. Four bands and band combinations (spectral indices) sensitive to chlorophyll and leaf water respectively based on the result of sensitivity test were selected purposefully as independent variables for ANN modeling so as to reduce the dimension. And simulated leaf reflectance spectra coupled with biochemical parameters by a within leaf radiative transfer model were used as part of training sample set. Validation results of rice leaves showed that the accuracy of chlorophyll and leaf water estimation using neural network is satisfactory.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370515","Biochemistry;Chlorophyll;Estimation;Neural network;Reflectance spectrum;Water","Absorption;Artificial neural networks;Cybernetics;Machine learning;Neural networks;Production;Reflectivity;Spectroscopy;Testing;Vegetation","biochemistry;botany;neural nets;photosynthesis","ANN modeling;artificial neural networks;biochemical substances;chlorophyll;ecological process;leaf biochemical information;leaf biochemical status;leaf reflectance spectrum;leaf water estimation;photosynthesis;physiological process","","0","","8","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluated the method on our departmental Website. We used the CORDER method to first find related NEs of four types (organizations, people, projects, and research areas) from Web pages on the Website and then rank them according to their co-occurrence with each of the people in our department. 20 representative people were selected and each of them was presented with ranked lists of each type of NE. Each person specified whether these NEs were related to him/her and changed or confirmed their rankings. Our results indicate that the method can find the NEs with which these people are closely related and provide accurate rankings.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370469","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370469","Clustering;Named entity recognition;Ranking;Relation discovery;Similarities","Cybernetics;Data mining;Knowledge management;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Target recognition;Text mining;Text recognition;Training data;Web pages","data mining;knowledge management;text analysis","Web pages;community relation discovery;knowledge management;organizational structures;text mining method","","0","","12","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
