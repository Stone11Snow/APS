We extract the height, shape and direction from a stroke as the features and recognize it as a symbol. Then the symbol is combined with other symbols to form a music notation. The system is robust for a general use and supports enough music notations for composition.

Based on the visual technologies including computer vision and image processing, in this paper, we developed some visual functions for smart camera networks. In our current progress, the visual functions developed for the camera network consist of four main functions. These four functions are listed in the following: (i) camera model and camera coordinate transformation; (ii) point correspondence and computing 3D; (iii) visual tracking and recognition; (iv) multiple view geometry and parameter estimation. In this paper, the problems of multiple views are divided into four sub-problems, such as (a) one-view, (b) two-view, (c) three-view and (d) N-view (N>3). Some contents of geometrical properties for these four sub-problems are described and implemented. In this paper, a prototype system for camera networks using visual functions has been developed.

Clustering algorithms will help to extracts hidden patterns to identify groups and their similarities. In this paper, a modified k-mean algorithm is proposed. The data point has been allocated to its suitable class or cluster more remarkably. The Modified k-mean algorithm reduces the complex nature of the numerical computation, thereby retaining the effectiveness of applying the k-mean algorithm. Firstly, the data are extracted from the communications and movements record after tracking the park visitors over three days. Then, the original data will be visualised in a graphical format to help make a decision about how many numbers to consider as the K cluster. Secondly, the modified k-means algorithm on the clusters initial centre sensitivity will be performed. This will link similar segments and determine the occurrence of each data point in every segment group rather than partitioning the entire space into various segments and calculating the occurrence of the data point in every segment. Thirdly, result checking and a comparison with the normal k-mean will be performed. The investigation will focus on the movement of people around the park where the crime occurred, and how people move and communicate in the park, how patterns change, and the movement of groups and individuals. The experiments show that the modified K-means algorithm leads to a better way of observing the data to identify groups and their similarities and dissimilarities in the criminal dataset as a specific domain.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872990","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872990","Data Mining;Hierarchical Clustering;K-means Algorithm","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Cybernetics;Data mining;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms","data mining;data visualisation;decision making;numerical analysis;pattern clustering;public administration","criminal pattern identification;criminal prediction;data mining;data visualisation;decision making;graphical format;modified K-means clustering;numerical computation","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this paper was to evaluate the performance of least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter, the dual sensor spectral subtraction algorithm (DSSS), and independent component analysis (ICA) in eliminating the environmental noises from respiratory sounds. The performance analysis of these three methods was quantified by relative error of power spectral density between the clean lung sound and the denoised lung sound.

Given a test image, sparse error images with respect to each class can be obtained by using RPCA decomposition. In order to extract the facial features in terms of intensity distribution, a sparseness measure based on intensity histogram is then introduced by computing the histogram sparsity of those sparse error images. By doing this, we can firstly choose t candidates similar to the test face image. Finally, we use LRC to find the correct individual. The efficacy and robustness of the proposed method is verified on three popular face databases (i.e., ORL, CMU PIE and AR) with promising results. We show that if the sparsity hidden in error images can be properly harnessed, the proposed HSD is able to correctly recognize corrupted or occluded faces.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7873026","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7873026","Face recognition;Feature extraction;Occlusion;Sparsity","Algorithm design and analysis;Databases;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Histograms;Training","face recognition;feature extraction;principal component analysis;visual databases","HSD;LRC;RPCA decomposition;corrupted faces;face databases;facial feature extraction;histogram-based sparsity descriptor;intensity distribution;intensity histogram;occluded faces;robust principal component analysis;sparse error images;sparseness measure;test image","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The vibration signal from detectors can be used to recognize the status of the rolling components. This kind of vibration signals are ordinarily nonstationary and nonlinear, and the weak fault features are contained in it.

However, volunteerism in Taiwan arose later than in other countries, and the laws and regulations regarding volunteerism are relatively incomplete. Although the government has enacted a series of laws to regulate the rights and responsibilities of volunteers, it has not provided a corresponding system to coordinate the volunteer programs. Because volunteer programs are independent, the service histories of volunteers are not unified, and volunteers are not provided with recommendations to help them achieve their goals. A volunteer information platform was proposed in this study based on the volunteer program in a hospital. Using this volunteer information platform, hospital departments can find suitable volunteers and volunteers can select assignments that they are capable of.

Unfortunately, in the large parking scenario, the cost may be prohibitively expensive because of the finitely waiting time from the car owners. In this paper, we show that it is possible to identify a registered vehicle using a single training example. The key insight is that, the human visually representative properties, such as overall appearance and local texture, are described using colors and histogram of oriented gradient (HOG). They are firstly extracted from each patch to form the fundamental representation. After that, the well developed locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) technique is employed to learn a more informative representation. Next, with nearest neighbors (NN) servers as the main classifier, the classical genetic algorithm (GA) is utilized to decide the most informative patches so that the minimum mis-identified error is achieved. The proposed approach is experimentally demonstrated and evaluated on the open “Dana36” data set using vehicle images that are taken under an approximate camera pose. Good improvements are obtained with respect to the strategies that do not use LLC encoded features and selectively combined patches.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7873024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7873024","Feature learning;Genetic algorithm;LLC;One-shot learning;Patches-based learning;Vehicle identification","Automobiles;Computational modeling;Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Image color analysis;Mathematical model;Training","genetic algorithms;gradient methods;image colour analysis;image registration;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;vehicles;video coding;video surveillance","Dana36 data set;GA;HOG;LLC technique;NN servers;colors;genetic algorithm;histogram of oriented gradient;human visually representative properties;informative representation;locality-constrained linear coding;nearest neighbors servers;registered vehicle;sample based feature learning;unknown vehicle object;vehicle identification;vehicle images;video surveillance","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However dimensionality reduction may lose information that is important to the face recognition task. Although the accuracy rate of face recognition varies with different projection matrixs, most of the existing methods ignore the importance of dimensionality reduction. To exploit more information from raw data, a new algorithm that combine the dimensionality reduction and dictionary learning based on discriminative K-SVD(D-KSVD) is proposed. The algorithm conducts dimensionality reduction and D-KSVD jointly for the purpose of learning a more powerful dictionary that has less reconstruction error.

In this work, we proposed an efficient co-clustering method named SVD-based hybrid pattern search (SHPS). It is a score-function-based method, and specifically both the mean-square-residue and correlation-based scores were tested in our studies. For a data matrix, SHPS first uses SVD layers to approximate it, and then searches the SVD subspaces for hybrid patterns (cliquish or linear) along the row or column direction. Groups along the two directions are combined, and those with a score smaller than a pre-defined threshold will be outputted. After testing our method on multiple types of matrices and comparing it with the traditional Cheng and Church method, SHPS showed a good performance with multiple co-clusters and better scores. Additionally, using more SVD layers may further improve the results. Overall, SHPS can be a good and efficient alternative in future co-clustering-related studies and applications.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860912","Co-clustering;Pattern search;SVD layer;Singular vector decomposition (SVD)","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Cybernetics;Education;Gene expression;Text mining;Transmission line matrix methods","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern clustering;search problems;singular value decomposition;vectors","SHPS;SVD-based hybrid pattern search;biclustering;coclustering method;correlation-based scores;data matrix;data mining;machine learning;mean-square-residue;score-function-based method;singular vector decomposition based hybrid pattern search","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early detection and quantification of coronary plaques is therefore of high interest. CTA has rapidly emerged, and is nowadays widely used in clinical practice. A calcification detection and quantification method is proposed, which can detect the calcium plaque and quantify the stenosis of coronary artery in CT images. Firstly, the responses of the DoG operator in the center on each slice of the artery are obtained to estimate the diameter of the vessel. Then, the slice is cropped according to the feature size. Secondly, the Fuzzy C-means is applied to classify the cropped image. Finally, the calcium plaques are extracted with their intensity and the stenosis of the artery caused by the calcified plaque is quantified according to the estimated cross-section area of the vessel. Experiments show that the proposed method can detect and quantify the calcium plaques accurately.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872991","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872991","Computed tomography angiography;Coronary Artery segmentation;Fuzzy C-means;Plaques Detection;Quantification;Scale Space","Arteries;Calcium;Computed tomography;Cybernetics;Diseases;Dogs;Image segmentation","angiocardiography;blood vessels;computerised tomography;diseases;feature extraction;feature selection;fuzzy set theory;image classification;medical image processing","CT images;CTA;DoG operator;automatic scale selection;calcification detection;calcified coronary plaques detection;calcium plaque detection;calcium plaque extraction;clinical practice;coronary artery diseases;coronary artery stenosis;coronary plaque detection;feature size;fuzzy C means;heart disease;image classification;quantification method","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If a large amount of existing video data can be used to capture motion features and detect the distribution of a crowd within a monitored area over a long duration, and then be analyzed to identify the path of crowd dominated-motion as well as the spatial hot spot, the effects of the crowd flow can be more efficiently managed and congestion more effectively reduced. In this paper a grid model is constructed to describe crowd distribution within a measured area. The measured area is divided into several unit areas, and each unit area is considered as a simple cell in a grid model. The crowd motion within a measured area can be represented as a 2D status matrix. The status matrices of all the images are then accumulated and normalized over a period of long duration in order to detect the path of the crowd dominant motion. All element values in the cumulative status matrix are limited to between 0 and 1 after normalization. If the value approaches 1, it indicates that the crowd remained longer in the corresponding unit area. On the other hand, a lower status value indicates that people spent less time in that corresponding unit area. In order to determine the aggregate area occupied by the crowd, a global spatial autocorrelation in the spatial statistics is adopted to determine whether the crowd distribution in an area is one of dispersion or aggregation distribution. If the distribution is dispersed, then the path of crowd dominant motion should be distributed throughout the measured space. If the crowd distribution is aggregated, then the local spatial autocorrelation of each observation unit must be calculated based on the observation value and the LISA (Local Indicators of Spatial Association) of each observation unit in the cumu- ative status matrix. This will obtain the degree of occupation by the crowd of each observation unit and its surrounding units. Based on the observation value and the local spatial autocorrelation of each observation unit, the path of crowd dominant motion can be efficiently determined. This proposed method supplies valuable spatial information for space planning and crowd management, and is applicable to public spaces for safety surveillance and the layout planning of exhibitions.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872976","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872976","Crowd Dominated Motion;Crowd Scene Analysis;Grid Model;Spatial Autocorrelation","Area measurement;Correlation;Cybernetics;Surveillance;Target tracking","image motion analysis;matrix algebra;object detection;video cameras;video surveillance","2D status matrix;LISA;aggregation distribution;crowd distribution;crowd dominated-motion detection;crowd flow;crowd-related incidents;cumulative status matrix;dispersion distribution;grid model;local indicators of spatial association;public safety;spatial autocorrelation;spatial hot spot;surveillance cameras;video surveillance equipment","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MER is helpful in music understanding, music retrieval, and other music-related applications. As volume of online musical contents expands rapidly in recent years, demands for retrieval by emotion have been emerging lately. Determining the emotional content of music computationally is an interdisciplinary research involving not only signal processing and machine learning, but the understanding of auditory perception, psychology, cognitive science, and musicology. One of the challenges in evaluating automatic music emotion detection is that there is currently no well-developed emotion model for music emotion description. Moreover, owing to the low transparency of the acoustic feature based music emotion recognizer, it is difficult to interpret data generated by this mechanism. In this study, a two-level classification system based on both music genre and music feature pre-described by the domain knowledge is proposed. This framework has the advantage of utilizing the most suitable acoustic information. Experiments will be conducted via the measure of the correlation between diverse emotional expressions and various musical cues. To verify the performance of overall system, the proposal model will also be evaluated based on the consistency between music features and ground-truth emotions.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860930","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860930","Affective computing;Feature extraction;Music emotion recognition;Music information retrieval;Support vector machine","Cybernetics;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Rhythm;Support vector machines","acoustic signal processing;affective computing;emotion recognition;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);music;signal classification;support vector machines","MER;acoustic feature;emotional expression detection;machine learning;music emotion recognition;music emotion recognizer;music feature;music genre;music retrieval;music understanding;signal processing;two-level support vector classification","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that affects people of all ages, and one of the most common neurological diseases globally. Epilepsy can have both genetic and acquired causes, nevertheless, the exact mechanism of epilepsy is still unknown. It merits further investigation under which circumstances the brain shifts into the epileptic condition. On the other hand, the influence of the environment on the human organism is one central problem for scientific investigation. It has been suggested previously that incidence of epileptic seizure varies significantly with the weather. Thus, based on the emergency medical service database, this study analyzed the seasonal incidence patterns of epileptic seizure in Taiwan using statistical testing methods.

In this work, we firstly give a brief introduction to the Learn++ family algorithms. Then, the Learn++.NIE is tested using five different types of base classifiers on several benchmarking imbalanced drifting datasets to evaluate the effects of classifiers to the Learn++.NIE. It is found that the MLPNN and the CART perform better than others for imbalanced pattern classification problems using the Learn++.NIE. Then, the three Learn++ algorithms are compared using both the MLPNN and the CART as base classifiers. Using the same base classifiers, the Learn++.NIE and the Learn++.CDS yield better recall in minority class.

To solve the issue in across age face recognition, we propose face discriminative methods across age progression using local K-means ensemble.

However its functions related patients' symptoms and treatment have not been assessed yet, which makes acupuncture difficult to be acknowledged by the authority of medical profession. Thankfully, patient reported outcome (PRO) scale is a qualified assessment tool originated from the West, which allows patients to describe subjective feelings and quality of life in self-reporting scales. The aim of this paper is to explore the applicability of PRO in clinical evaluation of acupuncture for CS and establish a clinical outcome evaluation model. Firstly, regular PRO scales (PROs) were introduced including SF-36 life quality questionnaire (SF-36) and visual analogue scale (VAS). To explore the applicability of PRO in clinical evaluation of acupuncture for CS, several statistical methods, such as reliability, validity, factor analysis and structural equation model (SEM), are fulfilled. As results, the value of Cronbach's statistic alpha of entire scale was 0.883, and 8 factors cumulative contribution rate achieved 70.59%, which illustrated the taxonomy of questions and the structure of the scale are acceptable. And then an evaluation index system was refined by revising scale with SEM. What's more, the study on a clinical outcome evaluation model of acupuncture for CS with ANN was carried out. BP neural network (BPNN) and Elman neural network were adopted to build models, and a better evaluation model was established by BPNN with an acceptable error of 0.88%, which outperformed Elman neural network. The experimental results indicate that PRO scales are suitable for clinical evaluation of acupuncture for CS and ANN is a promising method for establishing effective assessment model.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872994","Acupuncture;Artificial neural networks;Cervical spondylosis(CS);Patient reported outcome (PRO);Structural equation model","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Indexes;Mathematical model;Numerical analysis;Pain","backpropagation;bone;diseases;medical computing;neural nets;patient treatment;statistical analysis","ANN;BP neural network;BPNN;Cronbach statistic alpha;Elman neural network;PRO scale;SEM;SF-36 life quality questionnaire;acupuncture clinical evaluation;acupuncture treatment;cervical spondylosis;clinical outcome evaluation model;cumulative contribution rate;evaluation index system;factor analysis;patient quality of life;patient subjective feelings;patient symptom;patient treatment;patient-reported outcome;structural equation model;visual analogue scale","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we introduce a simpler tilt measurement algorithm using only one linear numerical model based on the same physical model. This algorithm is able to determine accurate tilt angle with equivalent measurement error to our previous work. In the range (0°, 120°), the average error is below 0.1°.

Postures of an actor are divided into three categories: robust postures, normal postures and dangerous postures. To deal with the robust postures, direct mapping from skeleton data gathered by 3D cameras to each angle of robot joint motors is taken because the postures are robust enough for imitation in high speed. When it comes to a normal posture, one specific safe robot posture is designed to correspond to each part of separated human postures. As the actor changes his posture from one to another, the robot will also switch from the corresponding posture to another in the designed way. Meanwhile, when there is no need to switch, the direct mapping is taken to fulfill the task. The imitation strategy for dangerous postures is the same as the normal postures except that the robot can not use direct mapping when there is no switch task because some changes of the designed posture may lead to tumble.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872936","Humanoid robot;Kinect;NAO;Posture classification;Real-time imitation","Humanoid robots;Real-time systems;Robot kinematics;Robustness;Skeleton;Switches","control engineering computing;humanoid robots;image classification;pose estimation","3D cameras;dangerous postures;humanoid robots;normal postures;posture classification;real-time imitation framework;robot joint motors;robust postures;separated human postures;skeleton data","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many customers have received annoyed messages in the inappropriate time and place on their mobile devices when they were not expecting it. In this paper, the integrated applications of mall's Wi-Fi and App are proposed. The mobile devices of member card holder's media access control address (MAC address) collected by way of the mall's App via local Wi-Fi APs(access point) which connected the central administration server and received or interchanged information and configuration settings with the card account. By the integrated system, the mall and card members always keep in communication upon the system infrastructure; meanwhile, they are in visiting mall domain area. This is an important opportunity moment for the mall managers to grasp the categorized customers in real time. As the above mentioned moment, the mall manager could create extensive value and precisely aim to their products or services to their targeted customers by delivering marketing information. The typical deployment zone for the proposed approach is multiple computing applications.

In this work, we propose an explicit data-correlation-adaptive penalty on representation coefficients. Specifically, we define a data-correlation-adaptive penalty by a weighted combination of the l<sup>1</sup>-norm and l<sup>2</sup>-norm, and formulate the subspace representation as a weighted correlation adaptive regression (WCAR) problem. It can be regarded as a method which interpolates SSC and LSR adaptively depending on the correlation among data samples.

However, individual data inevitably contain private information. How to prevent potential adversaries from recognizing the mapping between a particular graph node and a real world individual is critical for data providers.

To this end, we propose encoding tree (E-Tree) to avoid the excessive computations by storing the encodings on a radix-tree like data-structure. The memory consumption is also lowered. We then propose encoding forest (E-Forest) to further lower the computation cost. E-Tree and E-Forest are compatible with any quantization-based methods. Furthermore, unlike ordinary tree structures, our E-Tree and E-Forest essentially store the encoded vectors linearly in the memory, thus they are easy to implement and compute efficiently.

When applying the multi-windowed graph Fourier transform on synthesis graph signals, a dual localization phenomenon can be found in the original and dual windowed graph Fourier transform coefficients.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7873023","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7873023","Dual frames;Graph Fourier transform;Tight frames;Windowed graph Fourier frames","Cybernetics;Fourier transforms;Modulation;Time-frequency analysis;Windows","Fourier transforms;graph theory;signal processing","dual frames;graph signal analysis;graph signal processing;multiwindowed graph Fourier frames;multiwindowed graph Fourier transform coefficients;signal window function;tight frames","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Ranking interval type 2 fuzzy sets using parametric graded mean integration representation","K. P. Chiao","Department of Industrial Management and Enterprise Information, Aletheia University Tamsui, New Taipei, Taiwan","2016 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC)","20170309","2016","2","","606","611","In this paper, we develop the parametric graded mean integration representation (PGMIR) for the interval type 2 fuzzy sets (IT2FS). The PGMIR value can be served as the type reduced or defuzzification of an IT2FS. A set of IT2FSs can then be ordered by the corresponding PGMIR values. Firstly, the parametric representation of the embedded fuzzy sets is defined for the general IT2FS. The IT2FS is characterized by the set of embedded fuzzy sets induced from the parametric function. Then, the graded mean integration representation (GMIR) of a type 1 fuzzy set (T1FS) is extended to the IT2FS through the parametric form of an IT2FS. The GMIR of the parametric embedded T1FS is defined and is called the PGMIR. In this manner, the IT2FSs are defuzzified and can be ranked by sorting the PGMIR values. The average value of the PGMIR is used to determine IT2FS ranking. A numerical example is presented to show that the proposed approach is superior to the ranking method from IT2FS centroid.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872956","Fuzzy Ranking;Parametric Graded Mean Integration Representation;Type 2 Fuzzy Sets","Cybernetics;Decision making;Electronic mail;Fuzzy sets;Pragmatics;Sorting;Uncertainty","fuzzy set theory;number theory","IT2FS;PGMIR;T1FS;defuzzification;fuzzy ranking;interval type 2 fuzzy sets;parametric graded mean integration representation;type 1 fuzzy set","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose the human-computer cooperation approach for combinatorial optimization problems. Firstly, the initial solutions are seen as the sampling in human cognition by computer games. The games are developed for special combinatorial optimization problems. Then fuzzy decomposition decomposes the optimization problem into several sub-problems according to initial solutions by human. Moreover, local search strategy is given in conformational space with human strategy development capabilities, which also explores the space of possible search strategies. Last, the stochastic elements of the search in the traditional computational algorithms are gone with human intelligence during the fuzzy composition process. Human-computer cooperation approach can indeed lead to mutual advantage, and it can improve the problem-solving skills. We apply the proposed method to two-echelon vehicle routing problem to verify its effectiveness and usefulness.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872996","Computer games;Fuzzy decomposition;Human-machine cooperation;Local search algorithm;Two-echelon vehicle routing problem","Computers;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Optimization;Satellites;Search problems;Space exploration","cognition;combinatorial mathematics;computer games;fuzzy set theory;human computer interaction;matrix decomposition;optimisation;problem solving;search problems;stochastic games;vehicle routing","computer games;fuzzy composition process;fuzzy decomposition;human cognition;human intelligence;human strategy development capabilities;human-computer cooperative approaches;human-machine cooperative approach;problem-solving skills;special combinatorial optimization problems;stochastic search;two-echelon vehicle routing problem","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The global cost of counterfeiting is as much as $500 billion (USD) annually and negatively impacts the brand of the world's leading integrated circuit manufacturers. Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) rank third of the most fraudulently discovered electronic part. This fact is significant since reconfigurable FPGAs are practically ubiquitous in many critical systems and they possess a high resell value. A noninvasive low-cost capability to detect counterfeit FPGAs within these aforementioned industries' supply chains is imperative to the operational certainty of their respective systems. The authors proposed a novel approach to ascertain inauthentic FPGAs, in particular Intel [formerly Altera] Cyclone II devices though use of infrared (IR) analysis and machine learning.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860935","Cybersecurity;Infrared Imaging;Machine Learning;Operational Reliability","Algorithm design and analysis;Counterfeiting;Cyclones;Field programmable gate arrays;Machine learning algorithms;Standards","field programmable gate arrays;independent component analysis;infrared imaging;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design","Intel cyclone II FPGA;counterfeit detection;field programmable gate arrays;infrared analysis;integrated circuits;machine learning;supply chains","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key of augmented reality is 3D registration technology which is based on tracking the artificial marker in the scene effectively. Using linear programming theory, this paper presents a tracking method which can recognize the vertices of any convex polygon in augmented reality system since most of the markers are squares.

Nevertheless, regular analytical approaches are not applicable if training samples are small while features are large. Support vector machine (SVM) with recursive feature elimination algorithm (RFE-SVM) is presented in this study for discrimination of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae through small chromatographic samples. The primary strategies of the proposed method are as follows: firstly, features for analysis are extracted according to the aligned chromatographic fingerprints (CFs), then RFE was designed to filter some irrelevant features. As result, the remaining features were adopted as input features for the proposed approach in identification of Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae, a genuine herbal medicine of Guangdong Province. RFE-SVM classifier achieved a satisfactory prediction performance with an accuracy of 93.8%, following the leave-one-out cross validation procedure. The proposed algorithms improve the accuracy of identification significantly compared with SVM, Fscore-SVM and Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) on chromatographic analysis. The study demonstrates the presented method shows interpretability and applicability for pattern recognition in chromatographic fingerprints of CMs on the occasion of limited training samples.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7872997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7872997","Chemometrics;Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae;Recursive feature elimination;Support vector machine","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Power capacitors;Support vector machines;Training","chromatography;feature extraction;medicine;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","CF;CM;Chinese medicines;Fscore-SVM;Guangdong province;HCA;Pericarpium Citri Reticulatae discrimination;RFE-SVM classifier;chromatographic fingerprints;chromatography;feature extraction;herbal medicine;hierarchical clustering analysis;leave-one-out cross validation procedure;quality control;recursive feature elimination algorithm;support vector machine","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method only requires measurement information from image and utilizes the elements of the homography matrix between current and goal images to establish an error model, which is then used to develop an extended state observer (ESO)-based controller. Therein, two ESOs are designed to compensate for the parameter uncertainties of the error model. The mobile robot will be maneuvered to a desired configuration by the controller when the position and orientation errors are regulated to zero simultaneously. Global asymptotic convergent property of system errors is proven.
