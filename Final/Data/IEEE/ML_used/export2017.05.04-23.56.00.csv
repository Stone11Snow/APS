"Sparse Approximation Through Boosting for Learning Large Scale Kernel Machines","P. Sun; X.

This technique attempts to represent the solution with only a subset of original data points also known as basis vectors, which are usually chosen one by one with a forward selection procedure based on some selection criteria. The computational complexity of several resultant algorithms scales as O(NM<sup>2</sup>) in time and O(NM) in memory, where N is the number of training points and M is the number of basis vectors as well as the steps of forward selection. For some large scale data sets, to obtain a better solution, we are sometimes required to include more basis vectors, which means that M is not trivial in this situation. However, the limited computational resource (e.g., memory) prevents us from including too many vectors. To handle this dilemma, we propose to add an ensemble of basis vectors instead of only one at each forward step. The proposed method, closely related to gradient boosting, could decrease the required number M of forward steps significantly and thus a large fraction of computational cost is saved. Numerical experiments on three large scale regression tasks and a classification problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2044244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5451128","Boosting;forward selection;kernel machines;large scale data mining;large scale problems;sparsification","","approximation theory;computational complexity;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","basis vectors;classification problem;computational complexity;gradient boosting;large scale regression tasks;learning large scale kernel machines;sparse approximation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Data Mining;Humans;Learning;Models, Statistical;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","22","","66","","20100419","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Detecting Epileptic Seizures Using Electroencephalogram: A New and Optimized Method for Seizure Classification Using Hybrid Extreme Learning Machine","G. Geetha; S. N.

Sci., Avinashilingam Univ. for Women, Coimbatore, India","2011 International Conference on Process Automation, Control and Computing","20110811","2011","","","1","6","Epilepsy is one of the frequent brain disorder that may consequence in the brain dysfunction and cognitive disorders. Epileptic seizures can occur due to transient and unexpected electrical interruptions of brain. EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) is one of the non-invasive methods for analyzing the human brain dynamics that affords a direct evaluation of cortical behavior. Seizures are featured by short and episodic neuronal synchronous discharges with considerably enlarged amplitude. This uneven synchrony may happen in the brain accordingly i.e., partial seizures visible only in few channels of the EEG signal or generalized seizures, which are seen in every channel of the EEG signal involving the whole brain. Existing analysis of epilepsy depends on difficult visual screening by extremely trained clinicians. Data recordings create very lengthy data, and therefore the inspection and identification of epilepsy takes more time for diagnosis. At present time computerized systems are usually established to make the diagnosis simpler. This paper discusses an implementation of automated epileptic EEG detection system using neural networks. In this paper, a statistical parameter regarded as Sample Entropy (SampEn), is used as a method for feature extraction for performing the task of classifying EEG signals, which are normal, ictal and interictal. Here the value of SampleEn plays a vital role in the diagnosis of Epileptic seizures. It is been observed that the value of SampEn falls suddenly during an Epileptic Seizure, and hence this information delineates the exact occurrence of Epilepsy. Classification strategies are based on models like Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN),Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Hybrid ELM (HELM) is the classification method devised in the current paper and is the first of its kind to be implemented for EEG classification. This classification method uses the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method to select the inp- - ut weights and hidden biases, the ELM algorithm to analytically determine the output weights and the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to learn the network. Experimental results show that automatic epilepsy detection using sample entropy (SampEn) and Hybrid ELM achieves better accuracy in lesser time.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-764-1; POD:978-1-61284-765-8","10.1109/PACC.2011.5978923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5978923","","Accuracy;Electroencephalography;Entropy;Epilepsy;Feature extraction;Support vector machine classification;Testing","backpropagation;decision making;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal detection;neural nets;signal classification;support vector machines","EEG signal classification;Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm;analytical hierarchy process method;automated epileptic EEG detection system;back-propagation neural network;electroencephalogram;epileptic seizure detection;feature extraction;hybrid extreme learning machine;sample entropy;seizure classification;support vector machine","","1","","21","","","20-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper machine vision system is developed by means of BP neural network with self- learning. There are 4 inputs, which are the image coordinates of a match point in left and right camera, and 3 outputs in the network. The sum square of errors between the outputs of the network and actual coordinates in world system is taken as performance index.

Several measures have been taken to improve the recognition accuracy and decrease computational burden and time involved in the overall recognition process. This work is carried out in this context, and tried to achieve the above goals. A discriminative feature set is an important component in any pattern recognition system. We have used division point features generated by recursive subdivision of chamaracter images. These features are extracted from a size normalized binary image. In many of the applications data arrive chunk by chunk or one by one, and we need a classifier which handles the data sequentially. In this paper, a fast and accurate online sequential algorithm known as OS-ELM is used for single hidden layer feed forward neural networks (SLFN) with both additive and radial basis function (RBF) hidden nodes in a unified way. We have also considered the fact that the complexity of the system increases as the number of hidden layers increases. An SLFN trained with OS-ELM is used for the classification of 44 class handwritten Malayalam characters. The only control parameter required for this system is the size of the hidden layer. After several practices we have achieved a recognition accuracy of 96.83% with 1200 neurons in the hidden layer.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8943-5; POD:978-1-4244-8941-1","10.1109/TECHSYM.2011.5783843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5783843","Division point feature;Extreme learning machine;Neural network;Online sequential extreme learning machine","Optical imaging","feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;handwriting recognition;handwritten character recognition;natural language processing;optical character recognition;radial basis function networks","OS-ELM;division point feature extraction;handwriting machine recognition;handwritten Malayalam characters;handwritten character recognition;online sequential algorithm;online sequential extreme learning machine;optical character recognition;pattern recognition system;radial basis function hidden nodes;single hidden layer feed forward neural networks","","6","","6","","","14-16 Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when dealing with very complex classification tasks where different errors bring different penalties, one should take into account the overall classification cost produced by the classifier more than its accuracy. It is thus necessary to provide some methods for tuning the SVM on the costs of the particular application. Depending on the characteristics of the cost matrix, this can be done during or after the learning phase of the classifier. In this paper we introduce two optimization schemes based on the two possible approaches and compare their performance on various data sets and kernels. The first experimental results show that both the proposed schemes are suitable for tuning SVM in cost-sensitive applications.","","POD:0-7695-1948-2","10.1109/ICIAP.2003.1234109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234109","","Cancer;Classification algorithms;Costs;Data mining;Error correction;Kernel;Pattern recognition;Risk management;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","data mining;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern recognition;support vector machines","SVM;classification cost;cost matrix;cost-sensitive applications;data mining;generalization;in-learning optimization;pattern recognition;performance;post-learning optimization;support vector machines;tuning","","0","","11","","","17-19 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While graphical models provide a clean separation between modeling and inference, learning these models with approximate inference is not well understood. Furthermore, even if a good model is learned, predictions are often inaccurate due to approximations. In this work, instead of performing inference over a graphical model, we instead consider the inference procedure as a composition of predictors. Specifically, we focus on message-passing algorithms, such as Belief Propagation, and show how they can be viewed as procedures that sequentially predict label distributions at each node over a graph. Given labeled graphs, we can then train the sequence of predictors to output the correct labeling s. The result no longer corresponds to a graphical model but simply defines an inference procedure, with strong theoretical properties, that can be used to classify new graphs.

This results in a considerable reduction in total interconnect length. Reduced wire length eventually leads to reduction in delay and hence improved performance and speed. Design of an efficient placement and routing algorithm for 3D-FPGA that fully exploits the above mentioned advantage is a problem of deep research and commercial interest. In this paper, an efficient placement and routing algorithm is proposed for 3D-FPGAs which yields better results in terms of total interconnect length and channel-width.

However, in most cases, it is very difficult to distinguish benign and malignant masses without a biopsy, hence, misdiagnosis is always possible. In this paper, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm is used to classify the suspicious masses in digitized mammograms available in the Mini-MIAS database. As selection of features is critical in efficient classification of mammograms, a study was conducted to identify the best features that make a clear distinction between the malignant and benign masses. Then, the recently developed Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classifier is used to classify the benign and malignant cases. It is observed that the performance of the batch learning ELM algorithm is dependent on the number of hidden neurons, and the magnitude of input weight initialization. An extensive study is conducted to identify the best number of neurons to achieve the best training and testing classification performance. The performance results are then compared with the classification results, available in the literature. The performance study results show that the classification efficiency of the ELM classifier is better than the other existing algorithms, for the mammogram classification problem of the database considered for this study.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7815-6; POD:978-1-4244-7814-9","10.1109/ICARCV.2010.5707794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5707794","Mammogram segmentation;extreme learning machine","Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Cancer;Classification algorithms;Databases;Neurons;Testing","cancer;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;pattern classification","benign masses;breast cancer detection;digitized mammograms abnormalities classification;extreme learning machine algorithm;feature selection;malignant masses;mini-MIAS database","","4","","21","","","7-10 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The GP-RBFN scheme is adaptive but still computationally efficient due to the single adaptive parameter and its simple learning rule. The fault measure is the moving average of a general parameter. In order to verify the performance of the proposed schemes, they are applied to fault detection of automobile transmission gears. As the acoustic time series is slightly nonlinear, the RBFN gives high-speed fault detection, but detection accuracy is not so high. To overcome this problem a TDNN is developed that achieves more accurate fault detection although it needs more computational time. A fault is detected through regression lines.

Since the original ELM was presented, several papers have been published using similar ideas, EI-ELM, OP-ELM, OS-ELM, EM-ELM, etc. In this paper, we present a bi-objective micro genetic ELM (μG-ELM). This algorithm, instead of considering random hidden weights and biases, generates them by means of a micro genetic algorithm. It is conducted considering two objectives, the number of hidden nodes and the mean square error (MSE). Furthermore, as a novelty, μG-ELM incorporates a regression model in order to decide whether the number of hidden nodes should be increased or decreased.

ELM offers very fast learning with very consistent performance. It has only one tuning parameter. It can be adapted to multiclass classification and multi output regression without any increase in training time. Its low computational intensity and short training time makes it superior to traditional algorithms such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Single and Recurrent Feed Forward Neural Networks for real time translations. Preliminary experimental results have shown that ELM can produce good generalization performance as a classifier. Increasing the dimensionality of the data results in better separation.

Feature selection is a technique that removes noisy and redundant features to improve the accuracy and generalizability of a prediction model. Although feature selection is important, it adds yet another step to the process of building a bug prediction model and increases its complexity. Recent advances in machine learning introduce embedded feature selection methods that allow a prediction model to carry out feature selection automatically as part of the training process. The effect of these methods on bug prediction is unknown. In this paper we study regularization as an embedded feature selection method in bug prediction models. Specifically, we study the impact of three regularization methods (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet) on linear and Poisson Regression as bug predictors for five open source Java systems. Our results show that the three regularization methods reduce the prediction error of the regressors and improve their stability.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6597-4; POD:978-1-5090-6598-1","10.1109/MALTESQUE.2017.7882013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882013","Bug Prediction;Feature Selection;Machine Learning","Analysis of variance;Computer bugs;Linear regression;Measurement;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Training","Java;embedded systems;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;public domain software;regression analysis;software metrics;stochastic processes","ElasticNet regularization;Lasso regularization;Poisson regression;Ridge regularization;automatic feature selection;bug prediction accuracy;embedded feature selection;linear regression;machine learning models;noisy feature removal;open source Java systems;redundant feature removal;software metrics;training process","","","","","","","21-21 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, the lifting schemes (LS) are used to construct a single decomposition stage of the wavelet transform (WT), these schemes are a fast and flexible implementation for the WT. Then the update and predictor operator of the LS are optimized by Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Lagrange's optimization. So far the ensemble of the LS and the GA is called optimal wavelet transform (OWT) and it is a signal-adapted decomposition. Then cascaded OWT's are used to implement the wavelet packet transform (WPT) which provides a tool for customizing the time-frequency plane were the signal's energy is projected. Finally the OWLM is constructed by the optimization of the time-frequency plane of the WPT by maximizing the class separability using the Davies-Bouldin (DB) criterion. Then energy features are computed from the OWLM space, also a principal component analysis (PCA) is computed in order to reduce complexity in the OWLM space. Three different basic classifiers are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method including the linear Bayesian classifier, the k-NN classifier, and the quadratic Bayesian classifier. As example the OWLM is used over a microelectrode recording (MER) signals database from four different brain zones. This signals have strong non-stationary behavior and different techniques have been used to extract discriminant information from it. Based on experiments carried out, results show that the OWLM is superior to other commonly used features selection methods, such as the WT and the WPT. The best MER classification rate 99.14% is obtained by the OWLM in the database used.","","Electronic:978-1-86135-369-6; POD:978-1-4244-8858-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580465","","Databases;Discrete wavelet transforms;Multiresolution analysis;Time frequency analysis;Wavelet packets","feature extraction;genetic algorithms;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);microelectrodes;principal component analysis;singular value decomposition;time-frequency analysis;wavelet transforms","Davies-Bouldin criterion;Lagrange optimization;MER classification;OWLM;OWT;WPT;discriminant information extraction;feature selection method;genetic algorithms;learning machine;microelectrode recording;optimal wavelet packet transform;predictor operator;principal component analysis;signal adapted decomposition;time-frequency analysis","","1","","13","","","21-23 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After that, they are included in the final training set, as well as new samples and prior samples, based on the specified parameters. The experiments are conducted with a 2-dimension partition problem. The distribution of training and test samples is created in a limited location of a 2-dimension donut ring. There are two classes of data which are represented as 0 and 1. The context of the problem is assumed to shift 45 degrees in counterclockwise direction. Every consecutive partition is set to have different class of data. The experimental results show that the placement of outpost vectors generated from only selected new samples yields the highest level of accuracy of classification for both new data and old data.

First, H-SVM offers an efficient localization procedure in a distributed manner due to hierarchical structure. Second, H-SVM could determine nodes positions based only on simpler network information, e.g., the hop counts, without require particular ranging hardware. Third, the exact mean and the variance of the estimation error introduced by H-SVM are derived which are seldom addressed in previous works.

However, many of the current state-of-the-art models usually suffer from excessive training time and complex parameters tuning problems, leading to their inefficiency for real-time implementation. In this paper, a new DSA method using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is proposed, which has significantly improved the learning speed and can therefore provide earlier detection of the risk of blackout.

It can be used to explain how the actual recognition of emotions from facial expressions can be processed in the brain. Based on the model, a neural architecture is proposed using the stochastic Helmholtz machine (SHM) with the wake-sleep algorithm. In this paper, the results of three experiments about the subcortical emotional learning are reported, where different configurations of SHMs are involved. The first two experiments are to identify a suitable way to allow behavioural responses entering the central nucleus of the amygdala for association. However, both experiments show symptoms of overfitting, where some weights and biases of neurons are observed that will unusually increase during training. Therefore, the final experiment is designed to maintain the range of weights between -1 and +1 in order to solve the overfitting problem.

When applying such methods the resulting control signal shows a heavy dependence on the machine's operating point, i.e., the flux and the load level. To achieve speed sensorless control around zero speed it is thus necessary to identify and eliminate the flux/load dependence. In this paper different neural network approaches are tested with respect to their ability to perform an autonomous self commissioning of the control. The multi layer perceptron (MLP), the functional link neural network (FNL), as well as the time delayed neural network (TDL) are all trained using the backpropagation algorithm. To avoid the necessity of a speed sensor during commissioning, a modified flux observer is applied to deliver the reference values of the training data. A machine with closed rotor slots was chosen for this investigation because this type of machine is considered the most difficult for zero speed sensorless control. The results show that for this specific problem, the MLP shows the best performance followed by the FNL whereas the TDL is only applicable using an extensive amount of training data.","0275-9306;02759306","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0655-5; POD:978-1-4244-0654-8","10.1109/PESC.2007.4342303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342303","","Frequency;Induction machines;Learning systems;Mechanical sensors;Neural networks;Sensorless control;Stators;Temperature sensors;Training data;Voltage","asynchronous machines;backpropagation;neural nets","autonomous self commissioning;backpropagation algorithm;learning methods;neural network types;speed sensorless controlled induction machines;time delayed neural network","","4","","15","","","17-21 June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bug prediction employs machine learning to predict defects in software entities based on software metrics. These machine learning models usually have adjustable parameters, called hyperparameters, that need to be tuned for the prediction problem at hand. However, most studies in the literature keep the model hyperparameters set to the default values provided by the used machine learning frameworks. In this paper we investigate whether optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model improves its prediction power. We study two machine learning algorithms: k-nearest neighbours (IBK) and support vector machines (SVM). We carry out experiments on five open source Java systems. Our results show that (i) models differ in their sensitivity to their hyperparameters, (ii) tuning hyperparameters gives at least as accurate models for SVM and significantly more accurate models for IBK, and (iii) most of the default values are changed during the tuning phase. Based on these findings we recommend tuning hyperparameters as a necessary step before using a machine learning model in bug prediction.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6597-4; POD:978-1-5090-6598-1","10.1109/MALTESQUE.2017.7882014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7882014","Bug Prediction;Hyperparameter Optimization;Machine Learning;Model Selection","Computer bugs;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Object oriented modeling;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Tuning","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;program debugging;public domain software;software metrics;support vector machines","IBK;SVM;adjustable parameters;bug prediction accuracy;hyperparameter optimization;hyperparameter tuning;k-nearest neighbours;machine learning;open source Java systems;software entities;software metrics;software system;support vector machines","","","","","","","21-21 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Intelligent maintenance makes it possible to perform maintenance similar to that of a human being. Support vector machine (SVM) has become famous and popular in artificial intelligent community due to the excellence of generalization ability than the traditional method such as neural network. However, conventional SVMs use only labeled data (feature/label pairs) to train. Labeled instances are often difficult, expensive, or time consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by using large amount of unlabeled data, together with the labeled data, to build better classifiers.

This results in a FIS that can handle any bounded nonconstant piecewise continuous membership function. Furthermore, the learning in OS-fuzzy-ELM can be done with the input data coming in a one-by-one mode or a chunk-by-chunk (a block of data) mode with fixed or varying chunk size. In OS-fuzzy-ELM, all the antecedent parameters of membership functions are randomly assigned first, and then, the corresponding consequent parameters are determined analytically. Performance comparisons of OS-fuzzy-ELM with other existing algorithms are presented using real-world benchmark problems in the areas of nonlinear system identification, regression, and classification.

Moreover, some studies showed that their interaction has a stronger negative impact on the ability of developers to comprehend and enhance the source code when compared to cases when a single code smell instance affects a code element (i.e., a class or a method). While such studies analyzed the effect of the co-presence of more smells from the developers' perspective, a little knowledge regarding which code smell types tend to co-occur in the source code is currently available. Indeed, previous papers on smell co-occurrence have been conducted on a small number of code smell types or on small datasets, thus possibly missing important relationships. To corroborate and possibly enlarge the knowledge on the phenomenon, in this paper we provide a large-scale replication of previous studies, taking into account 13 code smell types on a dataset composed of 395 releases of 30 software systems. Code smell co-occurrences have been captured by using association rule mining, an unsupervised learning technique able to discover frequent relationships in a dataset.

Thus, this paper proposes two fast solutions to pseudo-inverse computing based on QR with pivoting and Fast General Inverse algorithms. They are QR-ELM and GENINV-ELM, respectively. The benchmarks are conducted on 5 standard classification problems, i.e., diabetes, satellite images, image segmentation, forest cover type and sensit vehicle (combined) problems.

When the game tree method is used, the response time will be extended as the depth of tree. This paper proposes to use the stochastic weight assignment neural network (SWAN), trained by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), to solve this problem. ELM is a fast learning algorithm in which all of the weights and biases between the input layer and hidden layer are randomized and the weights of output layer are analytically computed through solving a generalized inverse of matrix. Since the learning process does not include iteration, the learning speed is significantly accelerated and generalization capacity is improved greatly. Moreover, considering the complexity of Chinese chess situation features, feature learning and classification of chess samples cannot be efficiently accomplished by the shallow network. A deep stochastic weight assignment network (DSWAN) is developed to settle this difficulty.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7873028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7873028","Chinese chess;Deep stochastic weight assignment network;Extreme learning machine;Man-machine game","Classification algorithms;Computers;Feature extraction;Games;Man-machine systems;Neurons;Training","computer games;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;neural nets;pattern classification;stochastic games;tree searching;user interfaces","Chinese chess machine game;Chinese chess situation features;DSWAN training;ELM;artificial intelligence;chess sample classification;chess situation evaluation functions;deep stochastic weight assignment network;deep stochastic weight assignment neural network;extreme learning machine;feature learning;game tree search algorithms;man-machine game;matrix generalized inverse","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The success of this approach can generally be seen especially to promote, advertise and market product effectively besides staying competitive in global environment. The dramatic reduction in the cost of computer hardware is put forward as the major reason for the increasing importance of computer-aided learning (CAL). Computer-aided learning or CAL usually delivers more realistic views of product to customer. Due to its distinctive characteristics of interactive, user-friendly as well as attractive, people are keen to keep explore and hardly get bored. Compared with the old-fashioned way, CAL applications assist customers to avoid from overlooking necessary information. On the company side, this helps to achieve paperless situation by replacing or reducing the usage of paper. Certainly, this saves a lot of cost in terms of printing manuals, pamphlets and fliers. The case study presented is computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine at CNC Lab, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Industri Selangor named VMC-1000 produced by GATE company. The multimedia authoring software applied to succeed this study are Macromedia Director, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro and Gold Wave.

Therefore, models for robustly detecting and describing visual attributes of objects such as, e.g., colors are of great importance. However, in order to learn robust models of visual attributes, large data sets are required. Based on the idea to overcome the shortage of annotated training data by acquiring images from the Internet, we propose a method for robustly learning natural color models. Its novel aspects with respect to prior art are: firstly, a randomized HSL transformation that reflects the slight variations and noise of colors observed in real-world imaging sensors, secondly, a probabilistic ranking and selection of the training samples, which removes a considerable amount of outliers from the training data. These two techniques allow us to estimate robust color models that better resemble the variances seen in real world images. The advantages of the proposed method over the current state-of-the-art technique using the training data without proper transformation and selection are confirmed in experimental evaluations. In combination, for models learned with pLSA-bg and HSL, the proposed techniques reduce the amount of mislabeled objects by 19.87% on the well-known E-Bay data set.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4271-3; POD:978-1-4244-8816-2","10.1109/DICTA.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692610","Webbased/Internetbased learning;color;color naming;color terms;humanmachine/humanrobot interaction;natural images;probabilistic HSL model","Colored noise;Data models;Image color analysis;Internet;Probabilistic logic;Robustness;Training","Internet;data handling;human-robot interaction;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);natural scenes;probability","HSL transformation;Internet;Web-based learning;e-bay data set;human machine interaction;imaging sensor;naturalized color model;probabilistic ranking;state-of-the-art technique;training data;visual attribute","","3","","17","","","1-3 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The interplay between the layers of VMs and applications further complicates the problem of cloud configuration. Independent tuning of each aspect may not lead to optimal system wide performance. In this paper, we propose a framework, namely CoTuner, for coordinated configuration of VMs and resident applications. At the heart of the framework is a model-free hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) approach, which combines the advantages of Simplex and RL methods and is further enhanced by the use of system knowledge guided exploration policies. Experimental results on Xen-based virtualized environments with TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate that CoTuner is able to drive a virtual server system into an optimal or near optimal configuration state dynamically, in response to the change of workload. It improves the systems throughput by more than 30% over independent tuning strategies. In comparison with the coordinated tuning strategies based solely on Simplex or basic RL algorithm, the hybrid RL algorithm gains 30% to 40% throughput improvement. Moreover, the algorithm is able to reduce SLA violation of the applications by more than 80%.","1526-7539;15267539","Electronic:978-0-7695-4430-4; POD:978-1-4577-0468-0","10.1109/MASCOTS.2011.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005364","Autonomic Configuration;Cloud Computing;Reinforcement Learning","Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Resource management;Servers;System performance;Throughput;Tuning","cloud computing;configuration management;learning (artificial intelligence);virtual machines","CoTuner;Xen-based virtualized environment;cloud computing;cloud configuration;coordinated configuration;model-free hybrid reinforcement learning;model-free learning approach;resource configuration;virtual machines;virtual server system;virtualized environments","","6","","28","","","25-27 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, their strength is also their main weakness, as the generated nonlinear models are typically regarded as incomprehensible black-box models. In this paper, we propose a new active learning-based approach (ALBA) to extract comprehensible rules from opaque SVM models. Through rule extraction, some insight is provided into the logics of the SVM model. ALBA extracts rules from the trained SVM model by explicitly making use of key concepts of the SVM: the support vectors, and the observation that these are typically close to the decision boundary. Active learning implies the focus on apparent problem areas, which for rule induction techniques are the regions close to the SVM decision boundary where most of the noise is found. By generating extra data close to these support vectors that are provided with a class label by the trained SVM model, rule induction techniques are better able to discover suitable discrimination rules. This performance increase, both in terms of predictive accuracy as comprehensibility, is confirmed in our experiments where we apply ALBA on several publicly available data sets.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2008.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4564457","ALBA.;Clustering;Data mining;Mining methods and algorithms;Support vector machine;active learning;and association rules;black box models;classification;rule extraction","","knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","active learning-based approach;opaque SVM model;rule extraction;support vector machine","","61","","54","","20080715","Feb. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We also show that any dialog system can be formally described as a sequential decision process in terms of its state space, action set, and strategy. With additional assumptions about the state transition probabilities and cost assignment, a dialog system can be mapped to a stochastic model known as Markov decision process (MDP). A variety of data driven algorithms for finding the optimal strategy (i.e., the one that optimizes the criterion) is available within the MDP framework, based on reinforcement learning. For an effective use of the available training data we propose a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning: the supervised learning is used to estimate a model of the user, i.e., the MDP parameters that quantify the user's behavior. Then a reinforcement learning algorithm is used to estimate the optimal strategy while the system interacts with the simulated user. This approach is tested for learning the strategy in an air travel information system (ATIS) task. The experimental results we present in this paper show that it is indeed possible to find a simple criterion, a state space representation, and a simulated user parameterization in order to automatically learn a relatively complex dialog behavior, similar to one that was heuristically designed by several research groups","1063-6676;10636676","","10.1109/89.817450","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817450","","Costs;Design optimization;Information systems;Man machine systems;State-space methods;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Supervised learning;System testing;Training data","Markov processes;decision theory;information systems;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language interfaces;optimisation;probability;speech recognition;travel industry","Markov decision process;air travel information system;cost assignment;dialog strategies;dialog systems;experiment;human-machine interaction;optimal strategy;optimization problem;quantitative model;reinforcement learning;sequential decision process;state space representation;state transition probabilities;stochastic model;supervised learning","","138","16","36","","","Jan 2000","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
