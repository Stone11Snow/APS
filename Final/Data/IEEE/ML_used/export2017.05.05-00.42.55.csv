In this algorithm the Euclidean distance is usually chosen as the similarity measure, which usually relates to all attributes. Accordingly one practical issue in applying K-NN algorithm is that the distance between instances is calculated based on all attributes of the instance. One interesting approach to overcoming this problem is to weight each attribute differently when calculating the distance between two instances. So we can decide different functions of each feature by using feature weight learning. Another issue is that we still need evaluate K value by testing different values. In order to avoid searching for K value in nearest neighbor experiment and make the accuracy and efficiency more perfect, we bring forward one validity function in this paper for judging clustering when the classification of data set is clear. We apply it into classification problem such as K-NN combining with supervised classification. Thus we can only select the nearest neighbor (1-NN) not only to achieve more precise classification but also to avoid the trouble of looking for K, which will reduce the query complexity greatly and improve the efficiency of nearest neighbor algorithm. Simultaneously, the nearest neighbor algorithm is one of the most basic case-base reasoning (CBR) problems and case-base maintenance (CBM) is an important issue in CBR system to obtain the efficient case bases. This paper proposes a new approach to select representative cases based on generalization capability of cases.

Semi-supervised learning is very useful in these fields since it combines labeled and unlabeled data to boost performance of learning algorithms. Many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed, among which the ""co-training"" algorithms are widely used. We present a new co-training strategy. It uses random subspace method to form an initial ensemble of classifiers, where each classifier is trained with different subspace of the original feature space.

Using this extended hierarchical (task decomposition) plan as plan representation, we present a novel probabilistic algorithm of plan recognition. The core of our algorithm is EG-Pruning. The new algorithm infers the unobserved actions using the two kinds of ordering constraints defined above to extend EG and prunes the current EG by soft ordering constraints checking to make the set of goal hypotheses restricted. Then the probabilities of the goal hypotheses are computed to grade them. Finally, it extends the goal hypotheses sub-trees selected according to their probabilities to attain the whole plan hypotheses. Meanwhile, we have introduced the concept of supporting degree to make the recognition change reasonable with more evidence collected. Benefiting from these steps, our new algorithm clarifies a number of issues that were obscured by previous approaches. In particular, our approach can handle partial observation of domains, partially ordered plans and multiple, interleaved plans. Further, it is able to eliminate the Agent's misleading actions.

A new algorithm for finding all frequent itemsets is proposed in this paper. In data mining, the process of counting any itemset's support requires a great I/O and computing cost. An impacted bitmap technique to speed up the counting process is employed in this paper. Nevertheless, saving the intact bitmap usually has a big space requirement. In this algorithm, each bit vector is partitioned into some blocks, and hence every bit block is encoded as a shorter symbol. Therefore the original bitmap is impacted efficiently. And then the algorithm converts the origin transaction database to an adjacent-itemsets-lattice (which is a directed graph) in a preprocessing, where each itemset vertex has a label to represent its support. So we can change the complicated task of mining frequent itemsets in the database to a simpler one of searching vertexes in this structure, which can speeds up greatly the mining process.

The common characteristic of these methods is that all of them are based on fuzzy equivalence relation. In other words, the underlying concept of rough sets, indispensability relation, is generalized to fuzzy equivalence relation. Here fuzzy equivalence relation is the binary relation, which is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. This paper tries to generalize the fuzzy equivalence relation to fuzzy similarity relation, which is more helpful to keeping the fuzzy information of initial data than fuzzy equivalence relation. Based on the fuzzy similarity relation, fuzzy matrix computation for information system is proposed which can be used to reduce fuzzy attributes. Firstly, fuzzy similarity relation who is isomorphic with the fuzzy similarity matrix is given as fuzzy indispensability relation. Then all the information of initial data, such as the similarity among objects and fuzzy inconsistence degree between two objects, can be represented by fuzzy similarity matrix. Secondly, by considering that the small perturbation of the fuzzy similarity matrix can be ignorable, we propose some basic concepts of knowledge reduction such as fuzzy attributes reduct, core and fuzzy significance of attributes etc in this paper. Thirdly, a heuristic algorithm based on the fuzzy significance of attributes is proposed to find close-to-minimal fuzzy attributes reduct.

Euclidean distance measure is typically used init. However, the measure is an extremely brittle distance measure. Dynamic time warping (DTW) is proposed to deal with this case, but its expensive computation limits its application in massive datasets. In this paper, we present a new distance measure algorithm, called local segmented dynamic time warping (LSDTW), which is based on viewing the local DTW measure at the segment level. The DTW measure between the two segments is the product of the square of the distance between their mean times the number of points of the longer segment. Experiments about cluster analysis on the basis of this algorithm were implemented on a synthetic and a real world dataset comparing with Euc- lidean and classical DTW measure.

Above all, the size of the basic texture units of the fabric image is acquired by calculating auto correlation function in weft direction and in wrap direction. Then the sizes of the basic texture units are taken as criterion to segment the fabric image. During scanning the fabric texture image, the basic units are segmented. And the Fisher criterion discriminator is used to assign each unit to a class at the same time. Afterwards, the fabric detects are measured according to the relationship of the suffix of the image pixel and the scale of the image and ranked scale by comparing with America Four Points System.

Under the LS-SVM framework, salient features underlying image are represented by support values, and support value transform (SVT) has been developed for image fusion. To represent edges more efficiently, we analyze image under the weighted mapping LS-SVM framework, and deduce the directional support value filters and develop directional SVT to separate edges with different orientations in each image. The parameters of the weighted mapping LS-SVM for directional support value filter is optimized for the different focuses image fusion.

The edges of a face image and its corresponding face components are detected by using the canny algorithm. In the recognition step, different classifiers such as Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k -Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Pairwise Opposite Class-Nearest Neighbor (POC-NN) can be used for face recognition.

Secondly, wavelet analysis and the neural network is integrated, we apply them in studying risk evaluation. The shortcomings of the neural network can be overcome, such as a slower study velocity and lower fit accuracy. The simulation results show that risk level of the information system can be evaluated quantitatively by trained neural network, and the shortcomings of current evaluating methods can be overcome, such as more subjectivity and fuzzy conclusion.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212464","Fuzzy-ANN;Information security;Risk evaluation;Wavelet neural network(WNN)","Artificial neural networks;Data processing;Fuzzy neural networks;Information security;Information systems;Neural networks;Risk analysis;Risk management;Uncertainty;Wavelet analysis","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;risk management;security of data;wavelet transforms","artificial neural network training;decision mechanism;fuzzy evaluation method;information security system;quantity data processing;risk assessment;risk evaluation;wavelet analysis","","1","","12","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with conventional extension matrix techniques, it is more powerful and practical to handle with ambiguities in classification problems. Rule extraction from fuzzy extension matrix involves three parameters alpha, beta and gamma. These parameters play an importation role in the entire process of rule extraction based on FEM. They greatly affect the computation of fuzzy entropy and extract rules, however those important parameter value are usually estimated based on users by domain knowledge, personal experience and requirements. This paper introduces an approach to optimization of the three parameters based GA, and provides some theoretical support of directly selection of the parameter values through experiment. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: by combining GA and local search methods, we can get the reasonable parameters.

The proposed GP-RBF network not only can create the new hidden neurons online if the approximation performance is inappropriate, but can also prune the insignificant hidden neurons online if the hidden neuron is inappropriate.

In this work we describe a method that acquires binary vessel image from a color retinal fundus image in near real time. This method first generates the phase congruency image of the green channel of a color retinal image, and then thresholding is applied on the phase congruency image to obtain the blood vessels. Our method is able to acquire the blood vessels from a retinal fundus image within 10 seconds on a PC with the values of dasiaaccuracypsila and dasiaarea under ROCpsila: (0.92, 0.94) for the standard testing database called DRIVE.

Therefore, the Bluetooth system will not yield the maximum data throughput since it cannot adapt the transmit packets to the dynamic channel conditions. To overcome this difficulty, a simple mode/packet switching scheme based on Bluetooth ARQN statistics is proposed in this paper. The results of simulation experiments carried out over AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels indicate that the proposed scheme can effectively track channel variations to switch operation mode and transmit packet and thereby significantly increases Bluetooth data throughput.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212608","ARQN statistics;Bluetooth;Rayleigh fading;data throughput;mode/packet switching scheme","AWGN;Bit error rate;Bluetooth;Cyclic redundancy check;Forward error correction;Packet switching;Payloads;Statistics;Switches;Throughput","Bluetooth;Rayleigh channels;automatic repeat request;packet switching;statistical analysis","ARQN statistics;AWGN;Bluetooth;Rayleigh fading channel;packet switching scheme","","1","","14","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
