Nowadays, malware is a serious threat of the Internet. Extensive analysis of data on the Web can significantly improve the results of malware detection. However malware analysis has to be supported by methods capable of events correlation and cross-layer correlation detection, heterogeneous data classification, etc. Recently, a class of learning methods building on kernels have emerged as a powerful techniques for combining diverse types of data. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a widely used kernel-based method for binary classification. SVM is theoretically well founded and has been already applied to many practical problems. In this paper, we evaluate the results of the application of SVM to threat data analysis to increase the efficiency of malware detection. Our results suggest that SVM is a robust and efficient method that can be successfully used to heterogeneous web datasets classification.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927654","Support Vector Machine;machine learning;malware classification","Computer networks;Correlation;Kernel;Malware;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","Internet;data analysis;invasive software;pattern classification;support vector machines","Internet threat;SVM;Web data analysis;binary classification;computer operation;cross-layer correlation detection;heterogeneous Web dataset classification;heterogeneous data classification;kernel-based method;learning methods;malware analysis;malware classification;malware detection;support vector machine;threat data analysis;user computer system access","","2","","24","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this sense, a face image is just an observation and it should not be considered as the absolutely accurate representation of the face. As more face images from the same person provide more observations of the face, more face images may be useful for reducing the uncertainty of the representation of the face and improving the accuracy of face recognition. However, in a real world face recognition system, a subject usually has only a limited number of available face images and thus there is high uncertainty. In this paper, we attempt to improve the face recognition accuracy by reducing the uncertainty. First, we reduce the uncertainty of the face representation by synthesizing the virtual training samples. Then, we select useful training samples that are similar to the test sample from the set of all the original and synthesized virtual training samples. Moreover, we state a theorem that determines the upper bound of the number of useful training samples. Finally, we devise a representation approach based on the selected useful training samples to perform face recognition. Experimental results on five widely used face databases demonstrate that our proposed approach can not only obtain a high face recognition accuracy, but also has a lower computational complexity than the other state-of-the-art approaches.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2300175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6729058","Computer vision;face recognition;machine learning;pattern recognition;uncertainty","Accuracy;Databases;Face;Face recognition;Lighting;Training;Uncertainty","face recognition;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","computational complexity;data uncertainty;face database;face recognition;face representation;recognition accuracy;virtual training samples","0","44","","45","","20140130","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing data analysis environments, such as R, are constrained by the size of the main memory and cannot scale in many applications. This paper introduces Big R, a new platform which enables accessing, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data residing on a Hadoop cluster from the R user interface. Big R is inspired by R semantics and overloads a number of R primitives to support big data. Hence, users will be able to quickly prototype big data analytics routines without the need of learning a new programming paradigm. The current Big R implementation works on two main fronts: (1) data exploration, which enables R as a query language for Hadoop and (2) partitioned execution, allowing the execution of any R function on smaller pieces of a large dataset across the nodes in the cluster.","2379-7703;23797703","Electronic:978-1-4799-5057-7; POD:978-1-4799-5058-4","10.1109/BigData.Congress.2014.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906830","Big data;Machine Learning;MapReduce","Big data;Data mining;Data visualization;Database languages;Delays;Semantics;Vectors","data analysis;data visualisation;pattern clustering;public domain software;query languages;user interfaces","Big R;Hadoop cluster;R primitives;R semantics;R user interface;data analysis;data exploration;data manipulation;data visualization;large-scale analytics;partitioned execution;query language","","0","","11","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For inference problems of this type, each input datum gives rise to a summand in the objective function, and therefore performing online inference corresponds to solving a sequence of sparse nonlinear least-squares minimization problems in which additional summands are added to the objective function over time. In this paper, we present Robust Incremental least-Squares Estimation (RISE), an incrementalized version of the Powell's Dog-Leg numerical optimization method suitable for use in online sequential sparse least-squares minimization. As a trust-region method, RISE is naturally robust to objective function nonlinearity and numerical ill-conditioning and is provably globally convergent for a broad class of inferential cost functions (twice-continuously differentiable functions with bounded sublevel sets). Consequently, RISE maintains the speed of current state-of-the-art online sparse least-squares methods while providing superior reliability.","1552-3098;15523098","","10.1109/TRO.2014.2321852","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6845338","Computer vision;machine learning;online estimation;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM);sparse least-squares minimization","Approximation methods;Convergence;Jacobian matrices;Linear programming;Minimization;Robots;Robustness","convergence of numerical methods;least squares approximations;minimisation","Dog-Leg numerical optimization method;RISE;bounded sublevel sets;global convergence;incremental trust-region method;inference problems;inferential cost functions;input datum;many point estimation problems;numerical ill-conditioning;online inference;online sequential sparse least-squares minimization;robust incremental least-squares estimation;robust online sparse least-squares estimation;sparse nonlinear least-squares minimization problems;sparse nonlinear sum-of-squares objective function;summands;twice-continuously differentiable functions","","14","","48","","20140627","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Comparison of the performance of our machine-learning algorithms against independent clinical annotations of disorder presence and severity demonstrates that, despite their differing approaches to dynamic pattern classification, dynamic neural networks, dynamic support vector machines, and hidden Markov models were equally effective in keeping error rates of the dynamic tracking well below 10%. A common set of experimentally derived signal features were used to train the algorithm without the need for subject-specific learning.

Recent work on this problem has proposed a model incorporating an open space risk term to account for the space beyond the reasonable support of known classes. This paper extends the general idea of open space risk limiting classification to accommodate non-linear classifiers in a multiclass setting. We introduce a new open set recognition model called compact abating probability (CAP), where the probability of class membership decreases in value (abates) as points move from known data toward open space. We show that CAP models improve open set recognition for multiple algorithms. Leveraging the CAP formulation, we go on to describe the novel Weibull-calibrated SVM (W-SVM) algorithm, which combines the useful properties of statistical extreme value theory for score calibration with one-class and binary support vector machines.

With increased navigational flows across all waterways and the worldwide dissemination of active and passive vessel tracking modalities, learning a vessel's behavior is becoming a strategic priority for maritime operators and decision makers. In this paper, we propose an interpretable computational model based on fuzzy-rough decision trees (FRDTs) to predict the vessel type given a summary vector in the form of descriptive track features that include kinematic, static and environmental information. The track summaries are generated from the fusion of Automatic Identification System (AIS), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Canada weather reports. Our methodology uses fuzzy rough sets to discard irrelevant features on the basis of their dependency of the vessel type, prior to the iterative construction of the FRDT. Empirical results with a real-world data set in the east coast of North America confirm that the proposed approach is able to accurately assign the correct label (i.e., type) to previously unseen vessels in over 80% of the cases.","","Electronic:978-8-4901-2355-3; POD:978-1-4799-1634-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916013","automatic identification system;behavioral learning;fuzzy decision trees;fuzzy rough sets;information fusion;machine learning;maritime domain awareness;track summaries","Data models;Decision trees;Pragmatics;Predictive models;Radar tracking;Rough sets;Target tracking","decision trees;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);marine engineering;rough set theory","AIS;Canada weather reports;FRDT;SAR;active vessel tracking modalities;automatic identification system;behavioral learning;fuzzy-rough decision trees;iterative construction;maritime domain awareness;passive vessel tracking modalities;synthetic aperture radar;vessel types","","0","","26","","","7-10 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, the correct detection and classification of surrounding vehicles through image analysis has been the focus of extensive research in the last years. Robust and reliable vehicle detection from images acquired by a moving vehicle is an important problem with numerous applications including driver assistance systems and self-guided vehicles. In particular, vehicle verification is especially challenging on account of the heterogeneity of vehicles in color, size, pose, etc. Specifically, descriptors using Gabor filters have been reported to show good performance in this task. However, Gabor functions have a number of drawbacks relating to their frequency response. Our focus in this paper is on improving the performance of on road vehicle detection by employing log Gabor filters specifically optimized for the task of vehicle detection. This means the proposal and evaluation of a new descriptor based on the alternative family of log-Gabor functions for vehicle verification, as opposed to existing Gabor filter-based descriptors. These filters are theoretically superior to Gabor filters as they can better represent the frequency properties of natural images. As a second contribution, and in contrast to existing approaches, which transfer the standard configuration of filters used for other applications tithe vehicle classification task, an in-depth analysis of the required filter configuration by both Gabor and log-Gabor descriptors for this particular application is performed for fair comparison. The extensive experiments conducted in this paper confirm that the proposed log-Gabor descriptor significantly outperforms the standard Gabor filter for image-based vehicle verification.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4363-0; POD:978-1-4799-4362-3","10.1109/ICACC.2014.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6905987","Gabor filter;hypothesis verification;intelligent vehicles;log-Gabor filters;machine learning","Accuracy;Bandwidth;Filter banks;Gabor filters;Standards;Vehicle detection;Vehicles","Gabor filters;image classification;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural scenes;object detection;road traffic;road vehicles;traffic engineering computing","Gabor filter-based descriptors;driver assistance systems;frequency properties;frequency response;image analysis;image-based vehicle verification;intelligent vehicles;log Gabor filter optimization;log-Gabor descriptors;log-Gabor functions;machine learning;moving vehicle;natural images;road vehicle detection;self-guided vehicles;surrounding vehicles;traffic monitoring;vehicle classification;video analytics","","0","","36","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Black","DTU Compute, Lyngby, Denmark","2014 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","20140925","2014","","","3810","3817","As the collection of large datasets becomes increasingly automated, the occurrence of outliers will increase -- ""big data"" implies ""big outliers"". While principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to reduce the size of data, and scalable solutions exist, it is well-known that outliers can arbitrarily corrupt the results. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art approaches for robust PCA do not scale beyond small-to-medium sized datasets. To address this, we introduce the Grassmann Average (GA), which expresses dimensionality reduction as an average of the subspaces spanned by the data. Because averages can be efficiently computed, we immediately gain scalability. GA is inherently more robust than PCA, but we show that they coincide for Gaussian data. We exploit that averages can be made robust to formulate the Robust Grassmann Average (RGA) as a form of robust PCA. Robustness can be with respect to vectors (subspaces) or elements of vectors, we focus on the latter and use a trimmed average. The resulting Trimmed Grassmann Average (TGA) is particularly appropriate for computer vision because it is robust to pixel outliers. The algorithm has low computational complexity and minimal memory requirements, making it scalable to ""big noisy data."" We demonstrate TGA for background modeling, video restoration, and shadow removal. We show scalability by performing robust PCA on the entire Star Wars IV movie.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4799-5118-5; POD:978-1-4799-5119-2","10.1109/CVPR.2014.481","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909882","Grassmann manifold;PCA;Robust PCA;computer vision;directional statistics;machine learning;subspace estimation","Complexity theory;Computer vision;Estimation;Motion pictures;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Vectors","Big Data;computer vision;principal component analysis","Gaussian data;RGA;Star Wars IV movie;TGA;big noisy data;big outliers;computational complexity;computer vision;dimensionality reduction;large datasets;memory requirements;pixel outliers;principal component analysis;robust Grassmann average;scalable robust PCA;shadow removal;trimmed Grassmann average;video restoration","","13","","31","","","23-28 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Subsequently, posture information is fed into two classifiers, one for back posture and the other one for leg posture. A hidden Markov model approach is used to establish the activity model from sitting posture sequences.

This becomes especially relevant in simulation-based optimization where the objectives lack a closed form and are expensive to evaluate. Over the years, meta-modeling or surrogate modeling techniques have been used to build inexpensive approximations of the objective functions which reduce the overall number of function evaluations (simulations). Some recent studies however, have pointed out that accurate models of the objective functions may not be required at all since evolutionary algorithms only rely on the relative ranking of candidate solutions. Extending this notion to MOEAs, algorithms which can `learn' Pareto-dominance relations can be used to compare candidate solutions under multiple objectives. With this goal in mind, in this paper, we study the performance of ten different off-the-shelf classification algorithms for learning Pareto-dominance relations in the ZDT test suite of benchmark problems. We consider prediction accuracy and training time as performance measures with respect to dimensionality and skewness of the training data. Being a preliminary study, this paper does not include results of integrating the classifiers into the search process of MOEAs.","1089-778X;1089778X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6626-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-1488-3; POD:978-1-4799-1486-9","10.1109/CEC.2014.6900641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900641","Classification algorithms;Machine learning;Meta-modeling;Multi-objective optimization;Pareto-dominance","Neurons;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","MOEA;ZDT test;benchmark problems;classification algorithms;high-computational costs;learning pareto-dominance relations;machine learning;metamodeling techniques;multiobjective evolutionary algorithms;optimization;prediction accuracy;surrogate modeling techniques;training data;training time","","3","","23","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Automatic Defect Categorization Based on Fault Triggering Conditions","X. Xia; D. Lo; X. Wang; B. Zhou","Coll. of Comput. Sci. & Technol., Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou, China","2014 19th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems","20141016","2014","","","39","48","Due to the complexity of software systems, defects are inevitable. Understanding the types of defects could help developers to adopt measures in current and future software releases. In practice, developers often categorize defects into various types. One common categorization is based on fault triggers of defects. Fault trigger is a set of conditions which activate a defect (i.e., Fault) and propagate the defect into a failure. In general, there are two types of defect based fault triggering conditions, Bohrbug and Mandelbug. Bohrbug refers to a bug which can be easily isolated, and its activation and error propagation is simple. Mandelbug refers to a bug whose activation and/or error propagation is complex (e.g., A time lag between the fault activation and the failure occurrence). With these category labels, developers can better perform post-mortem analysis to identify common characteristic of the defects, and design specific fault-tolerance mechanisms. However, in most software systems, these category labels are often unavailable. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a text mining solution which categorize defects into fault trigger categories by analyzing the natural-language description of bug reports. A previous study shows that Mandelbug is more complex and needs more time to be fixed. Thus, to better identify Mandelbugs, we propose a novel Fuzzy Set based Feature Selection algorithm named USES, which selects the features (i.e., Terms) which have high ability to distinguish Mandelbugs from Bohrbugs. USES first caches a set of terms based on their fuzzy affinity scores to Bohrbug or Mandelbug. Next, it iterates many times, and in each iteration, it selects a subset of terms, and builds a classifier on these terms. USES selects the classifier and the terms which could achieve the best performance on a training data. We evaluate our solution on 4 datasets including Linux, Mysql, Apache HTTPD, and AXIS containing a total of 809 bug reports. We sho- that USES with naive Bayes multinomial achieves the best performance, it achieves Mandelbug F-measure scores of 0.298 - 0.615. We also compare USES with other baseline approaches. The results show that USES on average improves Mandelbug F-measure scores of the best performing baseline by 12.3%.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5482-7; POD:978-1-4799-5483-4","10.1109/ICECCS.2014.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923116","Bohrbug;Categorization;Fault Triggers;Feature Selection;Fuzzy Set;Machine Learning;Mandelbug","Buildings;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Software systems;Text mining;Training","data mining;fuzzy set theory;program debugging;software fault tolerance;text analysis","AXIS dataset;Apache HTTPD dataset;Bohrbug condition;F-measure;Linux dataset;Mandelbug condition;Mysql dataset;USES algorithm;automatic defect categorization;bug reports;error propagation;fault triggering conditions;fuzzy affinity scores;fuzzy set based feature selection algorithm;natural-language description;software system complexity;text mining solution","","5","","35","","","4-7 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we propose, define, experiment with, and evaluate, four different feature categories, composed of 26 article features, for sentiment analysis. Using five different machine learning methods, we train sentiment classifiers of Norwegian financial internet news articles, and achieve classification precisions up to ~71%. This is comparable to the state-of-the-art in other domains and close to the human baseline. Our experimentation with different feature subsets shows that the category relying on domain-specific sentiment lexical ('contextual' category), able to grasp the jargon and lingo used in Norwegian financial news, is of cardinal importance in classification - these features yield a precision increase of ~21% when added to the other feature categories. When comparing different machine learning classifiers, we find J48 classification trees to yield the highest performance, closely followed by Random Forests (RF), in line with recent studies, and in opposition to the antedated conception that Support Vector Machines (SVM) is superior in this domain.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4143-8; POD:978-1-4799-4142-1","10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.82","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6927609","Artificial neural networks;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Text analysis;Web mining","Aggregates;Correlation;Feature extraction;Radio frequency;Reliability;Sentiment analysis;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;electronic publishing;emotion recognition;feature extraction;financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis;tree searching;trees (mathematics)","J48 classification trees;Norwegian financial Internet news articles;SVM;domain-specific interpretations;domain-specific sentiment lexica;feature categories;feature classifiers;feature set evaluation;financial news;jargon;lingo;machine learning classifiers;machine learning methods;negative sentiment;positive sentiment;random forests;sentiment analysis;sentiment classifiers;support vector machines","","0","","25","","","11-14 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been widely used in image processing and pattern recognition tasks due to its psychological and physiological interpretation of natural data whose representation may be parts-based in human brain. However, the nonnegative constraint for matrix factorization is generally not sufficient to produce representations that are robust to local transformations. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we proposed a topographic NMF (TNMF), which imposes a topographic constraint on the encoding factor as a regularizer during matrix factorization. In essence, the topographic constraint is a two-layered network, which contains the square nonlinearity in the first layer and the square-root nonlinearity in the second layer. By pooling together the structure-correlated features belonging to the same hidden topic, the TNMF will force the encodings to be organized in a topographical map. Thus, the feature invariance can be promoted. Some experiments carried out on three standard datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in comparison to the state-of-the-art approaches.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2294215","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6689294","Data clustering;dimension reduction;feature invariance;machine learning;nonnegative matrix factorization","Approximation methods;Artificial neural networks;Encoding;Image coding;Linear programming;Matrix decomposition;Vectors","data structures;encoding;matrix decomposition;vectors","TNMF;data representation;encoding factor;feature invariance;image processing;local transformations;nonnegative constraints;nonnegative matrix factorization;original data matrix decomposition;parts-based basis vectors;parts-based representation;pattern recognition tasks;square-root nonlinearity;structure-correlated features;topographic NMF;topographic constraint;topographical map;two-layered network","","8","","34","","20131219","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recent trends show that number of newly discovered vulnerabilities still continue to be significant. Studies have also shown that the time gap between the vulnerability public disclosure and the release of an automated exploit is getting smaller. Therefore, assessing vulnerabilities exploitability risk is critical as it aids decision-makers prioritize among vulnerabilities, allocate resources, and choose between alternatives. Several methods have recently been proposed in the literature to deal with this challenge. However, these methods are either subjective, requires human involvement in assessing exploitability, or do not scale. In this research, our aim is to first identify vulnerability exploitation risk problem. Then, we introduce a novel vulnerability exploitability metric based on software structure properties viz.: attack entry points, vulnerability location, presence of dangerous system calls, and reachability. Based on our preliminary results, reachability and the presence of dangerous system calls appear to be a good indicator of exploitability. Next, we propose using the suggested metric as feature to construct a model using machine learning techniques for automatically predicting the risk of vulnerability exploitation. To build a vulnerability exploitation model, we propose using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Once the predictor is built, given unseen vulnerable function and their exploitability features the model can predict whether the given function is exploitable or not.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5843-6; POD:978-1-4799-5844-3","10.1109/SERE-C.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6901635","Attack Surface;Machine Learning;Measurement;Risk Assessment;Software Security Metrics;Software Vulnerability","Feature extraction;Predictive models;Security;Software;Software measurement;Support vector machines","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);reachability analysis;software metrics;support vector machines","SVM;attack entry points;computer systems;decision makers;machine learning;reachability;software structure;support vector machines;vulnerabilities exploitability risk;vulnerability exploitability metric;vulnerability exploitation model;vulnerability exploitation potential;vulnerability exploitation risk problem;vulnerability location;vulnerability public disclosure","","0","","37","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And it is infrastructure based because it refers to the fact that access points devote some computing capacity to collect 802.11 packets from other 802.11 mobile devices. Such information enables positioning a 802.11 mobile device indoors. This paper is a proposal for an inexpensive IBWFP. Its main contributions are a detailed accounting on how to build the physical system (business logic within the routers, configuration of the network in terms of number and location) and how to deploy and maintain the service on top of the physical system (i.e. Site survey, location engine creation, validation and management) with enough accuracy to exploit it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to give a guideline to build your own inexpensive IBWFP technology covering all these practical aspects. Our intent is to push forward this technology by sharing our experience using it.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2947-4; POD:978-1-4799-2948-1","10.1109/IE.2014.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910424","WiFi fingerprinting indoor positioning;indoor location for intelligent environments;machine learning","Accuracy;Buildings;Calibration;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile handsets;Performance evaluation;Proposals","indoor communication;mobility management (mobile radio);position control;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN","802.11 access points;802.11 mobile device indoors;IBWFP;context-aware computing;indoor positioning;infrastructure based 802.11 fingerprinting service;infrastructure based WiFi fingerprinting positioning technology;intelligent environments","","0","","22","","","June 30 2014-July 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hua","Monta Vista High School","2014 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)","20140908","2014","","","1","6","One of the main problems in image based plant identification has been the lack of quality training image data. A few attempts for solving this problem through generating high quality plant images from crowd sourced Web image collections like Flickr are proposed in this paper. These methods try to automatically identify correct and informative training images from those Web images, which typically have very noisy metadata (for example, user tags in Flickr), to enhance existing manually labeled training set. Firstly, for each plant, a set of images is collected from searching Flickr by using the plant name as the query. Then, images are clustered into visually consistent clusters, and in each cluster hopefully a majority of the images are all relevant or irrelevant to the particular plant. From these clusters, a managed plant image data set from ImageCLEF is used as reference to automatically select the highest quality cluster for each plant. The image quality of the selected clusters is further improved by two algorithms: an iterative method and image similarity based ranking. We show that the larger training data set automatically selected by this method significantly increases the accuracy of image based plant identification. In addition, this approach is a generic solution to almost all image recognition problems as long as additional (noisy) training data can be obtained from the Internet automatically.","1945-7871;19457871","Electronic:978-1-4799-4761-4; POD:978-1-4799-4760-7","10.1109/ICME.2014.6890180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890180","Image classification;crowd sourced big data;machine learning;plant identification","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Noise measurement;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","Internet;agricultural engineering;image retrieval;iterative methods;object detection;object recognition;pattern clustering;social networking (online)","Flickr;ImageCLEF;Internet;Web image collection;automatic informative training image identification;image based plant identification;image clustering;image quality;image recognition problem;image similarity based ranking;iterative method;labeled training set;noisy Web data;query processing;visually consistent cluster","","0","","12","","","14-18 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a system for facial expression tracking based on head-mounted, inward looking cameras, such that the user can be represented with animated avatars at the remote party. The main challenge is that the cameras can only observe partial faces since they are very close to the face.

Here, we investigated diagnostics signatures derived from human triple-negative tissue. We applied REMARK criteria for the selection of relevant studies and compared the signatures gene lists directly as well as assessed their classification performance in predicting diagnosis using leave-one-out cross-validation. The cross-validation results shows excellent classification accuracy ratios using all data sets. A subset signature (17-gene) extracted from the convergence of eligible signatures have also achieved excellent classification accuracy of 89.37% across all data sets. We also applied gene ontology functional enrichment analysis to extract potentially biological process, pathways and network involved in TNBC disease progression. Through functional analysis, we recognized that these independent signatures have displayed commonalities in functional pathways of cell signaling, which play important role in the development and progression of TNBC. We have also identified five unique TNBC pathways genes (SYNCRIP, NFIB, RGS4, UGCG, LOX and NNMT), which could be important for therapeutic interventions as indicated by their close association with known drivers of TNBC and previously published experimental studies.","2162-7657;21627657","Electronic:978-1-4799-5538-1; POD:978-1-4799-5539-8","10.1109/UKCI.2014.6930192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6930192","Bioinformatics;Cell signaling and Therapeutic;Diagnosis;Gene signature;Leave-out-one cross-validation;Triple-negative breast cancer;machine learning;microarray","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Breast cancer;Gene expression;Immune system;Robustness","cancer;genetics;lab-on-a-chip;medical computing;patient diagnosis","REMARK criteria;TNBC;biomarkers;gene signatures;integrated microarray analytics;molecular classification;patient diagnosis;therapeutic resistant;triple-negative breast cancer","","0","","29","","","8-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It consists of two major parts: vibration signal feature extraction and condition classification for the extracted features. In this paper, feature extraction from faulty bearing vibration signals is performed by a combination of the signal's Kurtosis and features obtained through the preprocessing of the vibration signal samples using Db2 discrete wavelet transform at the fifth level of decomposition. In this way, a 7-dimensional vector of the vibration signal feature is obtained. After feature extraction from vibration signal, the support vector machine (SVM) was applied to automate the fault diagnosis procedure. To improve the classification accuracy for bearing fault prediction, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is employed to simultaneously optimize the SVM kernel function parameter and the penalty parameter.

As we transition from fossil-fueled cars to electric vehicles, switch to bikes with electric motors, ride in hybrid buses, or do city sightseeing on Segways, new challenges arise in distinguishing these from a mobile sensing perspective. Distinguishing electric vehicles (EVs) from fossil-fueled vehicles (FFVs) is a challenge, where traditional methods based on features such as GPS speed, or statistics on raw accelerometer data, are insufficient. In this paper, we present methods for distinguishing EVs from FFVs using smartphones with built-in inertial sensors, by reliably identifying idle-engine motor vibrations through features built on frequency analysis. We provide an extensive analysis of the challenges involved in making the EV/FFV distinction, as well as practical tools based on the methods. This includes analyzing the measurable similarities and differences between EVs and FFVs, and developing methods of reliably separating them.

The initial brand and product comparison results signify the usefulness of text mining and sentiment analysis on social media data while the use of machine learning classifier for predicting the sentiment orientation provides a useful tool for users, product manufacturers, regulatory and enforcement agencies to monitor brand or product sentiment trends in order to act in the event of sudden or significant rise in negative sentiment.","2162-7657;21627657","Electronic:978-1-4799-5538-1; POD:978-1-4799-5539-8","10.1109/UKCI.2014.6930158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6930158","machine learning;naïve Bayes;product safety;sentiment analysis;social media;text mining","Drugs;Facebook;Media;Monitoring;Sentiment analysis;Text mining;Twitter","cosmetics;data mining;drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;social networking (online);text analysis","Facebook comments;Twitter;active surveillance systems;anticounterfeiting fight;brand analysis;brand monitoring;cosmetic product sentiment prediction;cosmetic products;drug;drug sentiment prediction;enforcement agencies;machine learning classifier modeling;negative sentiment;product allergies;product counterfeiting;product manufacturers;product safety lexicon;regulatory agencies;sentiment analysis;sentiment orientation;social media data;text mining;training data","","0","","26","","","8-10 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The considerable reduction in size and energy consumption of CMOS circuitry together with the self-organizational capability of network nodes are leading WSNs to be ubiquitous. WSNs operate under very strict energy constraints and the power supply is usually the most expensive component of the node being designed. This study proposes a methodology to reduce the power consumption by means of an energy-efficient management of node resources and tasks. We focus our attention on hydrometric level sensors. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are used to predict the nonlinear dynamics of hydrometric level given a limited set of previous measurements. The procedure takes the error committed by the predictor and the battery charge status as input parameters. Based on the input state, fuzzy logic (FL) is used to infer the most appropriate sensor sampling rate and the need to transmit real-time data to the gateway node. The idea is that when battery charge is low and no flood events are occurring, then data transmission can be deferred and sampling rate can be decreased. The method efficiency has been tested in a real-world environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4988-5; POD:978-1-4799-4987-8","10.1109/EESMS.2014.6923290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6923290","Adaptive wireless sensor networks;Environmental engineering;Fuzzy logic;Machine learning","Batteries;Floods;Fuzzy logic;Predictive models;Real-time systems;Support vector machines;Wireless sensor networks","environmental monitoring (geophysics);environmental science computing;hydrological techniques;level measurement;support vector machines;telecommunication power management;wireless sensor networks","CMOS circuitry;SVM;WSN;battery charge status;data transmission;energy constraints;energy consumption;energy-efficient management;environmental conditions;fuzzy logic;gateway node;hydrometric level sensors;intelligent wireless sensor nodes;network nodes;node resources;nonlinear dynamics;physical conditions;power supply;self-organizational capability;sensor sampling rate;spatially distributed autonomous nodes;support vector machines;water monitoring systems;wireless sensor network","","3","","30","","","17-18 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although elasticity is beneficiary in terms of cost, obligation of maintaining Service Level Agreements leads to necessity in dealing with the cost-performance trade-off. Proactive auto-scaling is an efficient approach to overcome this problem. In this approach scaling actions are generated based on prediction results. Recently, several research studies have been focusing on improving prediction accuracy in order to improve the efficiency of auto-scaling mechanisms. However, the sensitivity of auto-scaling mechanisms to the prediction results is neglected in the domain. In this work we have investigated the sensitivity of auto-scaling mechanisms to the prediction results by evaluating the influence of performance predictions accuracy on the auto-scaling actions. Specifically, we have compared actions of threshold based scaling techniques which are generated based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) predictions. Our experimental results show that although SVM is more accurate than NN, scaling decisions made by the two algorithms are identical in 91.5% of the time. Furthermore, we have shown that the optimal training duration for SVM and NN is about 60% of experiment duration.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3578-9; POD:978-1-4799-3579-6","10.1109/COMPSACW.2014.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903212","Cloud computing;Machine learning;Performance prediction;Resource provisioning","Accuracy;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","cloud computing;neural nets;support vector machines","NN;SVM;auto-scaling mechanism;cloud auto-scaling system;cloud computing;cloud elasticity;cost-performance trade-off;neural networks;prediction accuracy;prediction sensitivity measurement;scaling decisions;service level agreements;support vector machine","","5","","20","","","21-25 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this, researchers have suggested many detection systems that rely on host-monitoring techniques and require deep packet inspection or which are trained by malware samples by applying machine learning and clustering techniques. To our knowledge, most approaches are either lack of being deployed easily to real enterprise networks, because of practicability of their training system which is supposed to be trained by malware samples or dependent to host-based or deep packet inspection analysis which requires a big amount of storage capacity for an enterprise. Beside this, honeypot systems are mostly used to collect malware samples for analysis purposes and identify coming attacks. Rather than keeping experimental results of bot detection techniques as theory and using honeypots for only analysis purposes, in this paper, we present a novel automated bot-infected machine detection system BFH (BotFinder through Honeypots), based on BotFinder, that identifies infected hosts in a real enterprise network by learning approach. Our solution, relies on NetFlow data, is capable of detecting bots which are infected by most-recent malwares whose samples are caught via 97 different honeypot systems. We train BFH by created models, according to malware samples, provided and updated by 97 honeypot systems. BFH system automatically sends caught malwares to classification unit to construct family groups. Later, samples are automatically given to training unit for modeling and perform detection over NetFlow data. Results are double checked by using full packet capture of a month and through tools that identify rogue domains. Our results show that BFH is able to detect infected hosts with very few false-positive rates and successful on handling most-recent malware families since it is fed by 97 Honey- ot and it supports large networks with scalability of Hadoop infrastructure, as deployed in a large-scale enterprise network in Turkey.","2325-5366;23255366","Electronic:978-9949-9544-1-4; POD:978-1-4799-5113-0","10.1109/CYCON.2014.6916407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916407","Botnet;NetFlow analysis;honeypots;machine learning","Data models;Feature extraction;Malware;Monitoring;Scalability;Training","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;pattern clustering","BFH;Hadoop infrastructure;NetFlow data;active cyber defense systems;automated bot detection system;bot detection techniques;bot-infected machine detection system;botfinder through honeypots;clustering technique;cyber-attacks;deep packet inspection;enterprise networks;honeypot systems;host-monitoring techniques;learning approach;machine learning technique;malware","","0","","30","","","3-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both approaches share a common downside: they require the knowledge provided by an external agent, either in terms of signatures or as normal-operation profiles. In this paper we describe UNIDS, an Unsupervised NIDS capable of detecting 0-day attacks, i.e., network attacks for which no signature is yet available, without using any kind of signatures, labeled traffic, or training. UNIDS uses a novel unsupervised outliers detection approach based on Sub-Space Clustering and Multiple Evidence Accumulation techniques to pin-point different kinds of network intrusions and attacks such as DoS/DDoS, probing attacks, propagation of worms, buffer overflows, illegal access to network resources, etc. In this paper we make the strong point that the de-facto approach for NIDS, namely the application of rule-based detection techniques, can be highly harmful for the protected network in case of 0-day attacks. In contrast, we show how UNIDS can work as a complementary system to current NIDS to detect the occurrence of previously unseen attacks. For doing so, we compare the performance of a standard rule-based NIDS against UNIDS to detect 0-day attacks in the well-known KDD99 dataset. In addition, we also compare the performance of UNIDS against other popular unsupervised detection techniques to detect attacks in traces collected at two operation networks.","2376-6492;23766492","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7324-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-0959-9; POD:978-1-4799-0958-2","10.1109/IWCMC.2014.6906327","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906327","Buffer Overflow attacks;C4.5 Decision Trees;Clustering;DDoS;KDD99 Dataset;NIDS;Probing attacks;Unsupervised Machine Learning","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Decision trees;Partitioning algorithms;Standards;Testing;Training","computer network security;invasive software;knowledge based systems;unsupervised learning","0-day attack;DDoS;UNIDS;buffer overflow;multiple evidence accumulation technique;probing attack;rule-based detection technique;subspace clustering;unsupervised network intrusion detection;unsupervised outliers detection approach;worms propagation","","0","","18","","","4-8 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, an offline learning phase is not sufficient for recognizing and manipulating such objects. Rather, an autonomous robot needs to acquire knowledge through its own interaction with its environment, without using heuristics encoding human insights about the domain. Interaction also allows information that is not present in static images of a scene to be elicited. Out of a potentially large set of possible interactions, a robot must select actions that are expected to have the most informative outcomes to learn efficiently. In the proposed bottom-up probabilistic approach, the robot achieves this goal by quantifying the expected informativeness of its own actions in information-theoretic terms. We use this approach to segment a scene into its constituent objects. We retain a probability distribution over segmentations. We show that this approach is robust in the presence of noise and uncertainty in real-world experiments. Evaluations show that the proposed information-theoretic approach allows a robot to efficiently determine the composite structure of its environment. We also show that our probabilistic model allows straightforward integration of multiple modalities, such as movement data and static scene features. Learned static scene features allow for experience from similar environments to speed up learning for new scenes.","1552-3098;15523098","","10.1109/TRO.2014.2334912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6870500","Intelligent robots;machine learning;object segmentation;robot vision systems","Noise;Probabilistic logic;Robot sensing systems;Robustness;Uncertainty;Visualization","image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);robot vision;statistical distributions","bottom-up probabilistic approach;dynamic unstructured environments;information-theoretic terms;offline learning phase;probabilistic segmentation;probability distribution;static images;static scene features;targeted exploration","","9","","47","","20140801","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We formulate this problem as a kernel canonical correlation clustering problem in which data samples from different modalities or 'views' are projected to a space where correlations between the samples projections are maximized. Our approach enables us to learn a semantic representation of potentially uncorrelated feature sets and this representation is clustered to give unique social events.

"Learning to Annotate Clothes in Everyday Photos: Multi-modal, Multi-label, Multi-instance Approach","A. A. Veloso; J. A. d. Santos; K. Nogueira","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. Fed. de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil","2014 27th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","20141002","2014","","","327","334","In this paper, we present an effective algorithm to automatically annotate clothes in everyday photos posted in online social networks, such as Facebook and Instagram. Specifically, clothing annotation can be informally stated as predicting, as accurately as possible, the garment items appearing in the target photo. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for recommender and e-commerce systems. We formulate the annotation task as a multi-modal, multi-label and multi-instance classification problem: (i) both image and textual content (i.e., comments about the image) are available for learning classifiers, (ii) the classifiers must predict a set of labels (i.e., a set of garment items), and (iii) the decision on which labels to predict comes from a bag of instances that are used to build a function, which separates labels that should be predicted from those that should not be. Under this setting, we propose a classification algorithm which employs association rules in order to build a prediction model that combines image and textual information, and adopts an entropy-minimization strategy in order to the find the best set of labels to predict. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed algorithm using everyday photos collected from two major fashion-related social networks, namely pose.com and chictopia.com. Our results show that the proposed algorithm provides improvements when compared to popular first choice multi-label algorithms that range from 2% to 40% in terms of accuracy.","1530-1834;15301834","Electronic:978-1-4799-4258-9; POD:978-1-4799-4257-2; USB:978-1-4799-4260-2","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2014.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915325","Automatic annotation;machine learning;multi-label classification","Clothing;Entropy;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Prediction algorithms;Social network services;Visualization","clothing;data mining;electronic commerce;entropy;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Facebook;Instagram;annotation task;association rules;chictopia.com;classification algorithm;clothing annotation;e-commerce systems;entropy-minimization strategy;everyday photos;fashion-related social networks;garment items;image comments;image content;learning classifiers;multiinstance approach;multiinstance classification problem;multilabel approach;multilabel classification problem;multimodal approach;multimodal classification problem;online social networks;pose.com;prediction model;recognition algorithms;recommender systems;systematic evaluation;target photo;textual content;vision algorithms","","0","","42","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Their suitability for emotion recognition, however, has been tested using a small amount of distinct feature sets and on different, usually small data sets. A major limitation is that no systematic comparison of features exists. Therefore, we review feature extraction methods for emotion recognition from EEG based on 33 studies. An experiment is conducted comparing these features using machine learning techniques for feature selection on a self recorded data set. Results are presented with respect to performance of different feature selection methods, usage of selected feature types, and selection of electrode locations. Features selected by multivariate methods slightly outperform univariate methods. Advanced feature extraction techniques are found to have advantages over commonly used spectral power bands.

Called felicific calculus, this system would judge an action to be morally right or wrong based on several factors like the amount of pleasure it would provide and how much pain the action would inflict upon others. Because of its basis as a type of “moral mathematics” felicific calculus may be a viable candidate as a working ethical system for artificial intelligent agents. This paper examines the concepts of felicific calculus and Utilitarianism in the light of their possible application to artificial intelligence, and proposes methods for its adoption in an actual intelligent machine.

The second (CA+GA) uses cellular automata (CA) to generate low energy schedules, while using a genetic algorithm (GA) to find good rules for the CA.

One main issue is that for accurate identification of wave conditions, longer time series data are needed. However, these pose major impediment to real-time publishing of wave conditions. This study explores the possibility of classifying wave conditions given only shorter wave height time series data. By using shorter time series, systems similar to [1] will be able to handle the data faster and efficiently hence real time publishing of wave conditions can be achieved. The classification model for the wave conditions are trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) because it promises to provide a suitable model for nonlinear classification. Wave condition parameters are expected to have nonlinear relationships hence SVM is suited for this application. To test the ability of SVM, synthetic wave records generated from JONSWAP Wave Model are utilized.

Using probabilistic rules in PSL, we predict interactions with models based on triad and tetrad structures. We apply (blocking) techniques that make link prediction in PSL more efficient for drug-target interaction prediction. We then perform extensive experimental studies to highlight different aspects of the model and the domain, first comparing the models with different structures and then measuring the effect of the proposed blocking on the prediction performance and efficiency. We demonstrate the importance of rule weight learning in the proposed PSL model and then show that PSL can effectively make use of a variety of similarity measures. We perform an experiment to validate the importance of collective inference and using multiple similarity measures for accurate predictions in contrast to non-collective and single similarity assumptions.

The first realization is a conventional correlator receiver and the second is a new support vector machine (SVM) receiver. The two realizations were aimed at examining the tradeoffs between the two receiver types and their suitability for implementation in large scale wireless communication networks. The performance benchmarks used are the bit-error-rate (BER) and system speed. In both systems the information is spread using chaotic sequences resulting in physical layer security in the time and frequency domains. The hardware platform chosen was a 32-bit floating-point TigerSHARC DSP which proved to be sufficient for the representation of chaos-based spreading codes. Both implementations show excellent agreement with the previous theoretical findings in terms of BER performance. This agreement of results proves that the finite number resolution of the DSP does not have a significant effect on the system performance. Overall it is shown that the SVM receiver outperforms the correlator receiver in terms of the BER. However this improvement is at the expense of the processing speed.","1546-1874;15461874","Electronic:978-1-4799-4612-9; POD:978-1-4799-4611-2","10.1109/ICDSP.2014.6900708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6900708","BER performance;Chaos-based DS-SS systems;DSP realization;machine learning;physical level security;support vector machine","Bit error rate;Chaotic communication;Digital signal processing;Receivers;Support vector machines;Training","chaos;code division multiple access;correlators;digital signal processing chips;electronic engineering computing;floating point arithmetic;radio receivers;spread spectrum communication;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","SVM receiver;TigerSHARC DSP;bit error rate;chaos based multiuser DS-SS;chaotic sequence;correlator receiver;digital signal processor technology;direct sequence spread spectrum system;floating point DSP;physical layer security;support vector machine receiver;system speed;wireless communication","","0","","10","","","20-23 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Low computational complexity here means not only fast speed but also less energy consumption. The sliding window object detection method with linear support vector machines (SVMs) is a general object detection framework. The computational cost is herein mainly paid in complex feature extraction and innerproduct-based classification. This paper first develops a distributed object detection framework (DOD) by making the best use of spatial-temporal correlation, where the process of feature extraction and classification is distributed in the current frame and several previous frames. In each framework, only subfeature vectors are extracted and the response of partial linear classifier (i.e., subdecision value) is computed. To reduce the dimension of traditional block-based histograms of oriented gradients (BHOG) feature vector, this paper proposes a cell-based HOG (CHOG) algorithm, where the features in one cell are not shared with overlapping blocks. Using CHOG as feature descriptor, we develop CHOG-DOD as an instance of DOD framework. Experimental results on detection of hand, face, and pedestrian in video show the superiority of the proposed method.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2301453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6748917","Cell-based histograms of oriented gradients (CHOG);computer vision;feature extraction;linear classifier;machine learning;object detection","Computational efficiency;Feature extraction;Histograms;Object detection;Support vector machines;US Department of Defense;Vectors","computational complexity;feature extraction;generalisation (artificial intelligence);image classification;object detection;spatiotemporal phenomena;support vector machines;video signal processing","BHOG feature vector;CHOG algorithm;CHOG-DOD;block-based histograms of oriented gradients feature vector;cell-based HOG algorithm;complex feature extraction;computational complexity;computational cost;distributed classification;distributed object detection framework;energy consumption;feature descriptor;generalization;innerproduct-based classification;linear SVM;linear support vector machines;partial linear classifier;sliding window object detection method;spatial-temporal correlation;subfeature vector extraction;video object detection","0","32","","58","","20140226","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithms used in this application for Machine Learning are AdaBoostM1 functioning as a classifier and REPTree as weak learner, and it's built for Android operating system. Machine Learning is a study of computer algorithms which can improve its learning ability automatically through experience. AdaBoostM1 is one of the algorithms with Boosting method. Boosting uses all instances in each repetition, but keeping the load on any instance in the training set. REPTree is a fast decision tree learner which builds a decision/regression tree using information gain as the splitting criterion and prunes it using reduced-error pruning. Testing processes are done in four environment conditions to determine the sound prediction accuracy level. The four conditions are environments with low and high noise, far and near sound sources. AudiTion has two sound databases, the first database is indoor sounds and the second database is outdoor sounds with a total of 23 sounds. The results show that the average level of accuracy is relatively low at around 26.25% for the detection in the four conditions using both sound databases. Due to the low accuracy, we conducted trials by reducing indoor databases only for five sounds. This trial shows the accuracy of 40%. Since the accuracy results are still less than 50%, we conclude that AudiTion applications need to use another approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4568-9; POD:978-1-4799-4567-2; USB:978-1-4799-4569-6","10.1109/APCASE.2014.6924487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6924487","AdaBoostM1;Android;REPTree;machine learning;sound detection for hearing-impaired","Accuracy;Auditory system;Databases;Feature extraction;Smart phones;Testing;Training","Android (operating system);acoustic signal detection;decision trees;hearing;hearing aids;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis","AdaBoostM1 classifier;REPTree weaklearner;android operating system;audio detection;boosting method;decision tree;hearing impaired people;information gain;machine learning;reduced error pruning;regression tree;sound detection application","","1","","10","","","10-12 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Microbial Genetic Algorithm (MGA) or Bacterial Genetic Algorithm is one of the newer branch of GA. MGA follows the evaluation procedure of microbial which gives better results in pattern recognition. In this paper, microbial genetic algorithm with neural network approach for fitness calculation has been developed and it is used for performance analysis of different pattern recognition problems. Proposed algorithm is named as Microbial Neuro-Genetic Algorithm (MNGA). Advantages of MNGA over simple genetic algorithm (SGA) have also been discussed.

"Simplified Training for Gesture Recognition","R. Faugeroux; T. Vieira; D. Martinez; T. Lewiner","LIX, Ecole Polytech., Paris, France","2014 27th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","20141002","2014","","","133","140","Since gesture is a fundamental form of human communication, its recognition by a computer generates a strong interest for many applications such as natural user interface and gaming. The popularization of real-time depth sensors brings such applications to the public at large. However, familiar gestures are culture-specific, and their automatic recognition must therefore result from a machine learning process. In particular this requires either teaching the user how to communicate with the machine, such as for popular mobile devices or gaming consoles, or tailoring the application to a specific public. The latter option serves a large number of applications such as sport monitoring, virtual reality or surveillance -- although it requires a usually tedious training. This work intends to simplify the training required by gesture recognition methods. While the traditional procedure uses a set of key poses, which must be defined and trained, prior to a set of gestures that must also be defined and trained, we propose to automatically deduce the set of key poses from the gesture training. We represent a record of gestures as a curve in high dimension and robustly segment it according to the curvature of that curve. Then we use an asymmetric Hausdorff distance between gestures to define a discriminant key pose as the most distant pose between gestures. This further allows to dynamically group gestures by similarity. The training only requires the user to perform the gestures and eventually refine the gesture labeling. The generated set of key poses and gestures then fits in previous human action recognition algorithms. Furthermore, this semi-supervised learning allows re-using a previous training to extend the set of gestures the computer should be able to recognize. Experimental results show that the automatically generated discriminant key poses lead to similar recognition accuracy as previous work.","1530-1834;15301834","Electronic:978-1-4799-4258-9; POD:978-1-4799-4257-2; USB:978-1-4799-4260-2","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2014.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6915300","3d motion;Depth sensors;Gesture recognition;Machine learning;Natural user interface;Pose identification;Training","Feature extraction;Gesture recognition;Joints;Real-time systems;Sensors;Training","computer aided instruction;gesture recognition;training","Hausdorff distance;automatic recognition;gaming;gesture recognition;gesture training;human communication;machine learning process;natural user interface;real-time depth sensors;semisupervised learning;simplified training","","2","","27","","","26-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we focus on the automatic multi-classification of the articles and the respective description and justification to the documentalists. While several multi-classification solutions exist they are not automatically adaptable to the problem in hands as their description of the resulting multi-classification lacks substantial correlation with the documentalists perspective. In fact, we need to consider not only the automatic classification but also the supervision of the classification and its evolution based on the documentalists supervision of the automatic classification. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide a mechanism that bridges the gap between the automatic classification mechanisms and the documentalists thesaurus, in order to support their seamless supervision of classification and of thesaurus management. Ontologies are central to our proposal, as they are used to represent and manage the thesaurus, to describe the content of the articles, and finally to automatically multi-classify them via inference process. Also, we adopt a machine learning approach for generating a prediction model for supporting the automatic classification. This paper presents a proposal for enriching the documentalist-oriented ontology with the model prediction rules, which provides the necessary capabilities to the DL reasoner for automatic multi-classification.","","CD-ROM:978-0-9893-1932-4; Electronic:978-0-9893193-1-7; POD:978-1-4799-3981-7","10.1109/SAI.2014.6918205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6918205","machine learning;multi-classify;ontology economical e-news;recommender system","Economics;Feature extraction;Indexing;Ontologies;Recommender systems;Taxonomy;Thesauri","document handling;information resources;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;recommender systems","DL-reasoner;article multiclassification;automatic article multiclassification;automatic classification mechanisms;documentalist-oriented ontology;documentalists supervision;economic new articles;economic news articles;economic news domain;economical e-news;global project;hierarchical multilabel classification;machine learning approach;ontologies;recommender system;thesaurus management","","2","","23","","","27-29 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, unsupervised learning, that is, traffic clustering, is very important in real-life applications, where labeled training data are difficult to obtain and new patterns keep emerging. Although previous studies have applied some classic clustering algorithms such as K-Means and EM for the task, the quality of resultant traffic clusters was far from satisfactory. In order to improve the accuracy of traffic clustering, we propose a constrained clustering scheme that makes decisions with consideration of some background information in addition to the observed traffic statistics. Specifically, we make use of equivalence set constraints indicating that particular sets of flows are using the same application layer protocols, which can be efficiently inferred from packet headers according to the background knowledge of TCP/IP networking. We model the observed data and constraints using Gaussian mixture density and adapt an approximate algorithm for the maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. Moreover, we study the effects of unsupervised feature discretization on traffic clustering by using a fundamental binning method. A number of real-world Internet traffic traces have been used in our evaluation, and the results show that the proposed approach not only improves the quality of traffic clusters in terms of overall accuracy and per-class metrics, but also speeds up the convergence.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2013.307","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684161","Algorithms;clustering;machine learning;network security;traffic analysis","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Internet;Maximum likelihood estimation;Unsupervised learning","Gaussian processes;Internet;maximum likelihood estimation;mixture models;pattern classification;pattern clustering;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols;unsupervised learning","EM;Gaussian mixture density;TCP/IP networking;application layer protocols;constrained clustering scheme;equivalence set constraints;fundamental binning method;k-means clustering algorithms;labeled training data;machine learning techniques;maximum likelihood estimation;observed traffic statistics;packet headers;payload-based approaches;port-based approach;statistics-based Internet traffic classification;traffic clustering;unsupervised feature discretization;unsupervised learning","","14","","32","","20131213","Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One major challenge in current BCI research is how to extract features of time-varying EEG signals and classify the signals as accurately as possible. An effective BCI should be robust against and adaptive to the dynamic variations of brain activities. Adaptive learning in a BCI system, a rapidly developing application of machine learning, would be an effective approach to conquer the challenge.

Simple features such as bounding box parameters were extracted from the foreground images and combined with 3D features extracted from the Kinect depth data. This was then fed as input to the three layered FIS for further analysis. Data collected from several participants were tested and evaluated. Such a framework can be used to model several other IADLS as well as basic activities of daily living (ADLs). Analysis of ADLs can be used to compare daily patterns in older adults to measure changes in behavior. This can then be used to predict health changes to assist older adults in leading independent lifestyles for longer time periods.","1098-7584;10987584","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2073-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-2072-3; POD:978-1-4799-2074-7","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2014.6891647","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6891647","activities of daily living;depth image;fuzzy rules;machine learning","DH-HEMTs;Data mining;Feature extraction;Fuzzy logic;Niobium;Sensors;Three-dimensional displays","feature extraction;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence)","3D feature extraction;IADL;IADLS;Kinect depth data;behavior change measurement;bounding box parameters;data collection;depth images;foreground images;fuzzy logic;health change prediction;hierarchical fuzzy rule model;instrumental activities-of-daily living recognition;older adults;three-layered FIS model;three-level fuzzy inference system model","","0","","18","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this paper, we develop a fast algorithm for lithography hotspot detection with high accuracy of detection and low probability of false-alarm counts. In addition, since higher dimensional size of feature vectors can produce better accuracy but requires longer run time, this paper proposes a grid reduction technique to significantly reduce the CPU run time with very minor impact on the advantages of higher dimensional space.

To achieve this, we propose to model the spatio-temporal signatures of a sign using an extension of sequential patterns that contain temporal intervals called Sequential Interval Patterns (SIP). We then propose a novel multi-class classifier that organises different sequential interval patterns in a hierarchical tree structure called a Hierarchical SIP Tree (HSP-Tree). This allows one to exploit any subsequence sharing that exists between different SIPs of different classes. Multiple trees are then combined together into a forest of HSP-Trees resulting in a strong classifier that can be used to spot signs. We then show how the HSP-Forest can be used to spot sequences of signs that occur in an input video. We have evaluated the method on both concatenated sequences of isolated signs and continuous sign sequences. We also show that the proposed method is superior in robustness and accuracy to a state of the art sign recogniser when applied to spotting a sequence of signs.","1063-6919;10636919","Electronic:978-1-4799-5118-5; POD:978-1-4799-5119-2","10.1109/CVPR.2014.248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909645","Machine Learning;Sequential Pattern Learning;Sign Recognition;Temporal Intervals","Assistive technology;Gesture recognition;Hidden Markov models;Indexes;Itemsets;Silicon;Videos","image classification;image sequences;sign language recognition;trees (mathematics);video signal processing","HSP-Forest;HSP-Tree;concatenated isolated sign sequences;continuous sign sequences;hierarchical SIP tree;hierarchical sequential patterns;multiclass classifier;sequential interval patterns;sign recogniser;sign spotting;spatiotemporal sign signatures;temporal intervals;videos","","5","","12","","","23-28 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many efficient algorithms have been developed based on solving the induced optimization problems. However, there exists a gap between the theoretically unbeatable convergence rate and the practically efficient learning speed. In this paper, we use the variational inequality (VI) convergence to describe the learning speed. To this end, we avoid the hard concept of regret in online learning and directly discuss the stochastic learning algorithms. We first cast the regularized learning problem as a VI. Then, we present a stochastic version of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs) to solve the induced VI. We define a new VI-criterion to measure the convergence of stochastic algorithms. While the rate of convergence for any iterative algorithms to solve nonsmooth convex optimization problems cannot be better than O(1/√t), the proposed stochastic ADMM (SADMM) is proved to have an O(1/t) VI-convergence rate for the l1-regularized hinge loss problems without strong convexity and smoothness. The derived VI-convergence results also support the viewpoint that the standard online analysis is too loose to analyze the stochastic setting properly. The experiments demonstrate that SADMM has almost the same performance as the state-of-the-art stochastic learning algorithms but its O(1/t) VI-convergence rate is capable of tightly characterizing the real learning speed.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2294741","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6698348","Alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM);machine learning;online learning;optimization;regret;stochastic learning;variational inequality (VI);variational inequality (VI).","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Closed-form solutions;Convergence;Convex functions;Optimization;Standards","convergence;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;stochastic processes;variational techniques","SADMM;VI convergence;alternating direction method of multipliers;convex optimization;l1-regularized hinge loss problems;online learning;regularized learning problem;stochastic ADMM;stochastic learning algorithms;variational inequality optimization","1","1","","24","","20140102","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Since a depth sensor usually has poorer spatial resolution compared with a color image sensor, many depth image super-resolution methods have been investigated in the literature. With an assumption that no one super-resolution method can universally outperform the other methods, in this paper we introduce a learning-based selection scheme for different super-resolution methods. In our case study, three distinctive mean-type, max-type, and median-type filtering methods are selected as candidate methods. In addition, a new frequency-domain feature vector is designed to enhance the discriminability of the methods. Given the candidate methods and feature vectors, a classifier is trained such that the best method can be selected for each depth pixel. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is first demonstrated using the synthetic data set. The noise-free and noisy low-resolution depth images are constructed, and the quantitative performance evaluation is performed by measuring the difference between the ground-truth high-resolution depth images and the resultant depth images. The proposed algorithm is then applied to real color and time-of-flight depth cameras. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional algorithms both quantitatively and qualitatively.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2317873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6799245","Depth image;feature vector;machine learning;super resolution;time of flight (ToF)","Color;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Spatial resolution;Training;Vectors","feature extraction;frequency-domain analysis;image colour analysis;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);median filters;spatial filters","color images;depth image super resolution;frequency-domain feature vector;ground-truth high-resolution depth images;learning-based filter selection scheme;max-type filtering;mean-type filtering;median-type filtering;noise-free depth images;noisy low-resolution depth images;spatial resolution;synthetic data set;time-of-flight depth cameras","","2","","36","","20140416","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Preventing the Mistraining of Anomaly-Based IDSs through Ensemble Systems","C. Fellin; M.

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) monitors a network for precisely this purpose. IDSs fall into one of two categories: signature-based and anomaly-based IDSs. Whereas signature-based IDSs rely upon pre-programmed matching rules designed by security experts and are therefore limited to pre-existing attacks in their coverage, anomaly-based IDSs attempt to identify normal and abnormal traffic, generally using machine learning, and therefore hold the promise of being able to identify novel attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs can be divided into IDSs that are trained online and IDSs that are trained offline. While IDSs that are trained online allow greater flexibility, such IDSs could be trained by an adversary to allow specific attacks. This work-in-progress paper proposes a methodology for protecting against the mistraining of an IDS trained online. Two IDSs begin with identical rule sets, but one is allowed to adjust its data to include online data while the other remains static. Both systems can report anomalies, and if the online IDS attempts to let through too much that the offline IDS does not, the decision boundaries of the online IDS are adjusted as a safeguard against mistraining. An experiment for testing the approach is proposed.","2378-3818;23783818","Electronic:978-1-4799-5069-0; POD:978-1-4799-5070-6","10.1109/SERVICES.2014.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6903245","information security;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms","Educational institutions;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Training;Training data","cloud computing;digital signatures","anomaly-based IDS;cloud networks;ensemble systems;intrusion detection system;security;signature-based IDS","","0","","9","","","June 27 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the early years of the Internet, a simple packet inspection firewall was adequate to stop the then-contemporary attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), ports scans, and phishing. Since then, DoS has evolved to include Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, especially against the Domain Name Service (DNS). DNS based DDoS amplification attacks cannot be stopped easily by traditional signature based detection mechanisms because the attack packets contain authentic data, and signature based detection systems look for specific attack-byte patterns. This paper proposes a chaos based complexity measure and a cognitive machine classification algorithm to detect DNS DDoS amplification attacks. In particular, this paper computes the Lyapunov exponent to measure the complexity of a flow of packets, and classifies the traffic as either normal or anomalous, based on the magnitude of the computed exponent. Preliminary results show the proposed chaotic measure achieved a detection (classification) accuracy of about 66%, which is greater than that reported in the literature. This approach is capable of not only detecting offline threats, but has the potential of being applied over live traffic flows using DNS filters.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6081-1; POD:978-1-4799-6082-8","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921448","Anomaly Detection;Chaos;Cognitive Machine Learning;Cyber threats;DDoS Amplification;DNS;Data traffic;Fractal;Internet;Lyapunov exponent","Chaos;Classification algorithms;Computer crime;Internet;Mathematical model;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Time series analysis","Internet;firewalls;pattern classification","DNS DDoS amplification attacks;DNS filters;Internet;attack-byte patterns;chaos based complexity measure;classification accuracy;cognitive computing approach;cognitive machine classification algorithm;cyber security threats;distributed denial-of-service attacks;domain name service;network security systems;signature based detection mechanisms;simple packet inspection firewall","","1","","25","","","18-20 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
