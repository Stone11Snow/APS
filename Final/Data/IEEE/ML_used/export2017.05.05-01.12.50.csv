This severity level of dispute policy will provide the network administrator more specific and guided information and help them to choose the debugged routing policy, eliminate policy disputes and solve the route oscillations efficiently. This method first extends Routing Policy Specification Language so as to enable it to describe the relationship between Autonomous Systems, which arises from the commercial contracts. And then, each of Autonomous System utilizes this extended language to describe the relationships between its own and its direct neighbors. When route oscillations occur, the algorithm to determine the dispute routing policies based on dispute cycle avoidance will identify the dispute policy set inducing route oscillations. Finally, according to the relationship of autonomous system and the safe configuration guidance, the severity level of dispute policy will be determined. In addition, a simulation instance is given in order to explain results of this method.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527014","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527014","Routing policy specification language;border gateway protocol;route oscillations tracking;routing policy disputes","Computer aided instruction;Contracts;Cybernetics;Debugging;Electronic mail;Guidelines;Internet;Machine learning;Routing protocols;Specification languages","","Routing policy specification language;border gateway protocol;route oscillations tracking;routing policy disputes","","0","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So an improved algorithm of ART2 has been presented in this paper. This algorithm makes use of single ART2 neural network to realize multi-layer dynamic clustering structure by simultaneously considering the information from both the winning neuron and other neurons in process of competition as well as Hebb rule. Therefore, retraining neural network is not needed for clustering with granularity of a certain range. In addition, this algorithm reduces the requirement of subjective setting of vigilance parameter. Such advantages can effectively satisfy basic demands of clustering and avoid the problems of performance and parameter setting in realizing hierarchical structure by adopting cascade structure.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527277","adaptive resonance;clustering;neural network;vigilance parameter","Adaptive systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Elasticity;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Resonance;Stability;Subspace constraints","ART neural nets;Hebbian learning;pattern clustering","Hebb rule;adaptive resonance theory network;data clustering;multilayer dynamic clustering structure;winning neuron information","","3","","6","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the sliding sector is used to find a norm decrease subspace for each subsystem and a feedback law is designed so that each point in the state space is inside at least a sliding sector of some subsystem. Therefore the VS control law of the hybrid system is to switch the hybrid system among unstabilizable subsystems to ensure the decrease of the Lyapunov function in the state space.

Due to this interaction, the weighted average model frequently used in approximate reasoning may not work well in many real-world problems. In order to handle this interaction, the paper ""IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, Volume: 34, No.5, October 2004, pp. 1 -9"" proposed to use a non-additive nonnegative set function to replace the weights assigned to rules having the same consequent and to draw the reasoning conclusion based on an integral with respect to the non-additive nonnegative set function. Handling interaction in fuzzy if-then rule reasoning in this way can lead to an improvement of reasoning accuracy. In that paper, the authors proposed an approach to determining the set function when it was not given by the experts. They need to solve a linear programming problem with too many parameters when the number of the rules is large. Actually, it is not feasible to implement in the real world because the number of parameters increases exponentially with the number of rules. This paper proposes a new approach to using the 2-additive fuzzy measure to replace the general set function for handling the interaction among if-then rules. The number of parameters determined in the new approach is greatly less than the number of parameters in the old approach. Compared with the old approach, the new one leads to an accuracy loss to some extent. But the new approach reduces the number of parameters from an exponential to polynomial quantity. It implies that the new approach is feasible and has more wide applications in the real world.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527418","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527418","2-additive fuzzy measure;Fuzzy integral;Fuzzy measure;Interaction","Computer science;Expert systems;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Hybrid intelligent systems;Linear programming;Machine learning;Mathematics;Polynomials","fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;linear programming","2-additive fuzzy measure;approximate reasoning;fuzzy if-then rule reasoning;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy integral;linear programming;nonadditive nonnegative set function;weighted average model","","0","","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this method, GA is used for clustering features to form different feature subsets according to the combination classification accuracy. Multiple NNCs based on the corresponding feature subsets are parallel and independent to classify one pattern. The final decision is aggregated by majority voting rule, which is a simple and efficient technique. To demonstrate the performance of FC-MNNC, we select four UCI databases in our experiments. The proposed FC-MNNC is compared with (i) standard NNC, (ii) feature selection using GA in individual NNC and (iii) feature subset selection using GA in multiple NNCs. The experimental results show that the accuracy of FC-MNNC is better than that of the standard NNC and feature selection using GA in individual classifier. The performance of FC-MNNC is not worse than that of feature subset selection using GA in multiple NNCs. It is also demonstrated that FC-MNNC is robust to irrelevant features.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527453","GA;Nearest neighbor classifier (NNC);feature subset clustering;majority voting rule;multiple-classifier combination","Computer science;Electronic mail;Machine learning;Mathematics;Nearest neighbor searches;Prototypes;Robustness;Spatial databases;Training data;Voting","genetic algorithms;pattern classification;pattern clustering","feature selection;feature subset clustering;genetic algorithm;majority voting rule;nearest neighbor classifier","","3","1","14","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Learning ontology from existing resources is a good solution. Because relational database is widely used for storing data and OWL is the latest standard recommended by W3C, this paper proposes an approach of learning OWL ontology from data in relational database. Compared with existing methods, the approach can acquire ontology from relational database automatically by using a group of learning rules instead of using a middle model. In addition, it can obtain OWL ontology, including the classes, properties, properties characteristics, cardinality and instances, while none of existing methods can acquire all of them. The proposed learning rules have been proven to be correct by practice.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527531","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527531","OWL;Ontology;Ontology Learning;Relational Database;Relational Model","Buildings;Information retrieval;Machine learning;OWL;Object oriented databases;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Relational databases;Resource description framework;Semantic Web","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);relational databases","OWL;ontology Web language;ontology learning;relational database","","11","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main causes lie in that the penalty of misclassification for each training sample is considered equally. Weighted support vector machines for classification are proposed in this paper where penalty of misclassification for each training sample is different. By setting the equal penalty for the training samples belonging to same class, and setting the ratio of penalties for different classes to the inverse ratio of the training class sizes, the obtained weighted support vector machines compensate for the undesirable effects caused by the uneven training class size, and the classification accuracy for the class with small training size is improved.

Ensemble classification techniques such as bagging, boosting and arcing algorithms have received much attention in recent literature. Such techniques have been shown to lead to reduced classification error on unseen cases, and this paper demonstrates that they may also be employed as noise detectors.

A new weighted support vector machine algorithm is proposed based on the analysis of the cause of such problems, which compensates for the unfavorable impact caused by the uneven class sizes and makes the decision speed faster. To obtain a good generalization performance, genetic algorithm is used to tune the regularization parameter and parameter of the kernel function when training the model. Experiments show that the proposed approach can control the misclassification error rates of classes and deal with multi-duplicate samples with good generalization performance.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527703","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527703","C-Support Vector Machine;genetic algorithms;multi-duplicate samples;parameter tuning;uneven class sizes;weighted SVM","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Electronic mail;Error analysis;Genetic algorithms;Iterative methods;Kernel;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","generalisation (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);parameter estimation;pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM training;classification error;generalization;genetic algorithm;kernel function;multiduplicated samples;parameter selection;parameter tuning;weighted support vector machine","","5","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle the problem of unknown words, we formalize Chinese text chunking as a tagging task on a sequence of known words. To do this, we employ the uniformly lexicalized HMMs and develop a lattice-based tagger to assign each known word a proper hybrid tag, which involves four types of information: word boundary, POS, chunk boundary and chunk type. In comparison with most previous approaches, our approach is able to integrate different features such as part-of-speech information, chunk-internal cues and contextual information for text chunking under the framework of HMMs. As a result, the performance of the system can be improved without losing its efficiency in training and tagging.

So unlike the most popular used SVM training algorithm sequential minimal optimization (SMO) which solves the QP subproblem containing minimal two Lagrange multipliers, SSMO can analytically update only one Lagrange multiplier at every step. Because of avoiding double loops in heuristically choosing the two Lagrange multipliers in SMO, both CPU time and iterations can be decreased greatly.

Being able to identify communities can provide invaluable help in exploiting and understanding both social and non-social networks. Several algorithms have been developed up till now. However all these algorithms can work well only with small or moderate networks with vertexes of order 10<sup> 4</sup>. Additionally, all existing algorithms are off-line and can not work well with highly dynamic networks such as Web, in which Web pages are updated frequently every day. When the already clustered network is updated, the entire network including original and incremental parts has to be recalculated, even only slight changes involved. To address this problem we develop an incremental algorithm which allows for detecting community structure in large-scale and dynamic networks. Based on the community structure it detect previously our algorithm takes little time to reclassify the entire network including both original and incremental parts. Furthermore, our algorithm is faster than most existing algorithms such as Girvan and Newman's algorithm and its improved versions.

Having implemented DSWT on an infrared image, de-noising is done using the method proposed in high frequency sub-bands which have better resolution levels and enhancement is implemented by combining the de-noising method with the non-linear gain method in high frequency sub-bands which have the worse resolution levels. According to experimental results, the new algorithm can reduce effectively the correlative noise (1/f noise), additive Gauss white noise (AGWN) and multiplicative noise (MN) in the infrared image while it also enhances contrast of the infrared image. In terms of visual quality, the algorithm is better than the traditional unshaped mask method (USM), histogram equalization method (HIS) and two methods by Gong et al. (2000) and Wu et al.

The free drawing style of sketching makes it difficult to build a robust sketch recognition system that can support the imprecision and high variability present in sketch. This paper addresses these problems inherent in sketch recognition in the framework of Bayesian network which can readily represent uncertainty in the recognition process and make inference based on partial evidence. To further improve recognition accuracy, context information is incorporated in the recognition process rather than identifying sketches in isolation. The new framework proposed in this paper offers user more sketching freedom by automatically grouping strokes and recognizing editing gestures as well as over-traced strokes.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527740","Bayesian network;over-traced stroke;sketch understanding;strokes grouping;structure match","Aggregates;Artificial intelligence;Bayesian methods;Character recognition;Engineering drawings;Machine learning algorithms;Optical character recognition software;Robustness;Support vector machines;Uncertainty","belief networks;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);uncertainty handling","Bayesian network;editing gestures;free drawing;incremental Bayesian approach;over-traced strokes;partial evidence;sketch identification;sketch recognition;sketch understanding;stroke grouping;structure matching;uncertainty representation","","1","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The historical statistical data of airport freight traffic and pertinent indices from 1983 to 2003, which are provided by National Bureau of Statistics of China and Civil Aviation Administration of China, are used as the total data set of LS-SVM. RBF kernel function, polynomial kernel function, and linear kernel function are used as the kernel function of LS-SVM to perform freight traffic volume forecasting, respectively. After five-fold cross-validation, the LS-SVM of RBF kernel function has the best forecasting performance. Eventually, RBF function is selected as the kernel function of LS-SVM and its optimal parameters are σ<sup> 2</sup>=20 and γ=13. The maximum absolute forecasting error is 12.4 and the maximum relative forecasting error is 5.66%.

"Natural language generation of negative sentences in the minimalist paradigm","Er-Qing Xu","Dept. of Linguistics, Zhejiang Univ., Hangzhou, China","2005 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20051107","2005","6","","3744","3748 Vol. 6","Different word orders will be resulted in during the generation processes of negative sentences in different natural languages. This brings us difficulties when we deal with the negative sentence generation problem. This paper studies natural language generation of negative sentences and the problem of how to handle the different word orders that occur in the generation processes in different natural languages through feature-checking theory of the minimalist paradigm. Without losing generality, we use examples in the languages of modern standard English (MSE), French, and early modern English (EME) to illustrate the issue. The main technical point is that weak tense- and agreement-features can be separated from the word that carries them and percolate up the structural tree on their own to get themselves checked; strong tense- and agreement-features cannot be separated from the word that carries them and can only move together with the phonetic form of the word when they need to get themselves checked. And this leads to different kinds of movement (i.e. attraction and movement). For the parameter of strength, we may set its value as (+) for EME and French, and (-) for MSE. Different parameter values lead to different kinds of movement that can be involved in the negative sentence generation processes. Therefore, the difference in word orders of negative sentences across languages can be handled uniformly through the approach of parameter-setting. By the study carried out in this paper, we might also justify the use of the minimalist program as the grammar that serves in natural language generation from a certain perspective.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527591","Natural language generation;feature-checking;minimalist program;negative sentences;parameter-setting","Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Humans;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Natural languages;Psychology","grammars;natural languages","feature-checking theory;grammar;minimalist program;natural languages;negative sentence generation;parameter-setting","","0","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, the vague set is more powerful in the describing and processing of uncertain and inaccurate information, in particular of conflicting information. In this paper, the notions of the vague set are introduced first, and then based on the analysis of the limitations of the existing fuzzy data fusion methods, a new multi-attribute, multi-sensor and multi-target data fusion method based on the vague set is proposed. The new method organizes data, measures similarity and evaluates the results according to the vague set. Finally, an experiment is provided to illustrate the computational steps and performance improvement of the new method.

The evidence theory is introduced to reduce the uncertainty of decision-making. In the evidence theory, a practical problem is how to determine the basic probability assignments. Usually they are evaluated subjectively by experts in advance. However, they may be far from the optimal values. Furthermore, in some cases where there is no expert knowledge, especially for aggregation in an ensemble learning system, they could not be evaluated as such. Due to the natural relation between the evidence theory and the rough sets theory, rough sets methods are applied so as to determine the basic probability assignments. The merit of the rough set theory is that it does not need any priori knowledge. Afterwards, the decisions of bagged and boosted SVMs are combined respectively by the evidence theory. Experimental results show that the presented multi-SVM system gains better performance over the popular ensemble learning methods such as Bagging and Adaboost.M1.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527513","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527513","Decision fusion;ensemble;evidence theory;rough sets;support vector machine","Automation;Computer aided instruction;Decision making;Fuzzy logic;Learning systems;Rough sets;Set theory;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Uncertainty","decision making;probability;rough set theory;support vector machines","Adaboost.M1 ensemble learning method;Bagging ensemble learning system;decision fusion method;decision-making;ensemble learning system;evidence theory;probability assignment;rough sets theory;support vector machine","","1","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, an improved variance projection function is introduced, and its practicality to the detection of gradual transition is analyzed as well. Then by using this variance projection function, the distance between the video frames is defined, and a method to calculate the feature vector of changes of the distance is proposed. Finally, a statistical learning method based on the support vector machine is devised to determine whether the changes of the distance are caused by gradual transition or not. The experiments results show that this method has better detection resolution and less timing complexity, and thus satisfactorily meets the requirements of real-time video-shot detection.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527934","Variance projection function;gradual transition detection;support vector machine;video similarity","Analysis of variance;Artificial intelligence;Cameras;Feature extraction;Gunshot detection systems;Layout;Statistical learning;Support vector machines;Timing;Video sequences","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;video signal processing","distance change feature vector;shot gradual transiton detection;statistical learning;support vector machine;variance projection function;video frames;video similarity;video-shot detection","","3","","5","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
