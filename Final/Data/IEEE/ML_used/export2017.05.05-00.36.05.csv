The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) methods have received a lot of attention for this unmixing process. Many of these NMF based unmixing algorithms are based on sparsity regularization encouraging pure spectral endmembers, but this is not optimal for certain applications, such as foods, where abundances are not sparse. The pixels will theoretically lie on a simplex and hence the endmembers can be estimated as the vertices of the smallest enclosing simplex. In this context we present a Bayesian framework employing a volume constraint for the NMF algorithm, where the posterior distribution is numerically sampled from using a Gibbs sampling procedure. We evaluate the method on synthetical and real hyperspectral data of wheat kernels.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306262","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Hyperspectral imaging;Image analysis;Image color analysis;Image sampling;Informatics;Kernel;Pixel;Sparse matrices","Bayes methods;crops;image colour analysis;image sampling;matrix decomposition;sampling methods;spectral analysis","Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization;Gibbs sampling procedure;NMF-based unmixing algorithm;food image analysis;hyperspectral image analysis;image colour analysis;numerically sampled procedure;posterior distribution;pure spectral signature;smallest enclosing simplex;volume constraint;wheat kernel","","12","","12","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to the usual pixel-wise methods, we propose a patch-based formulation for modeling semi-local interactions and detecting occlusions and other local or regional changes in an image pair. To this end, the image redundancy property is exploited to detect unusual spatio-temporal patterns in the scene. We first define adaptive detectors of changes between two given image patches and combine locally in space and scale such detectors. The resulting score at a given location is exploited within a discriminant Markov random field (DRF) whose global optimization flags out changes with no optical flow computation. Experimental results on several applications demonstrate that the method performs well at detecting occlusions and meaningful regional changes and is especially robust in the case of low signal-to-noise ratios.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306258","","Detection algorithms;Detectors;Geometry;Image analysis;Image motion analysis;Layout;Markov random fields;Optical computing;Pixel;Solid modeling","computational geometry;computer graphics;object detection;random processes;redundancy;spatiotemporal phenomena","adaptive detector;discriminant random field;image change detection algorithm;image pair;image redundancy property;occlusion detection;patch-based formulation;patch-based redundancy analysis;semilocal interaction modeling;spatio-temporal pattern;spatio-temporal regularity","","2","","32","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Signals recorded from each of EEG electrodes represent noisy spatio-temporal overlapping of activity arising from very diverse brain regions. However, un-mixing methods such as cortical current density (CCD) can be used for estimating activity of different brain regions. These methods not only improve spatial resolution but also signal to noise ratio, hence the classifiers computed using this activity may ameliorate recognition performances. However, these methods lead to a multiplied number of channels, leading to the question - ldquoHow to choose relevant and discriminant channels from a large number of channels?rdquo. In the current paper we present a channel selection method and discuss its application to the recognition of anticipation related potentials from surface EEG channels and CCD estimated cortical potentials. We compare the classification accuracies with previously reported performances obtained using Cz electrode potentials of 9 subjects (3 experienced + 6 naiumlve). As hypothesized, we observed improvements for most subjects with channel selection method applied to CCD activity as compared to surface-EEG channels and baseline performances. This improvement is particularly significant for subjects who are naiumlve and did not show a clear pattern on ERP grand averages.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306216","","Brain;Charge coupled devices;Current density;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Enterprise resource planning;Inverse problems;Prototypes;Signal to noise ratio;Spatial resolution","biomedical electrodes;brain;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;signal classification","CCD estimated cortical activity;EEG electrodes;anticipation related potentials;brain state recognition;brain-computer interaction;classifiers;cortical current density;discriminative channel selection method;electroencephalogram;noisy spatio-temporal overlapping;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial resolution;unmixing methods","","3","","11","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, to avoid the drawbacks of the existing methods, we develop a methodology for rough analysis in economic sector by combining the advantages of the fuzzy variable precision rough set model.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212452","Data mining;Fuzzy variable precision rough sets;Reducts;Rough sets","Cybernetics;Data mining;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Guidelines;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Power generation economics;Rough sets;Set theory","data mining;economic cybernetics;fuzzy set theory;rough set theory","data mining;economic practice;fuzzy variable precision;rough sets theory","","1","","12","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In novelty detection, or one-class classification, we wish to determine if data are ldquonormalrdquo with respect to some model of normality. If that model consists of generative distributions, then EVT is appropriate for describing the behaviour of extremes generated from the model, and can be used to determine the location of decision boundaries that separate ldquonormalrdquo areas of data space from ldquoabnormalrdquo areas in a principled manner. This paper introduces existing work in the use of EVT for novelty detection, shows that existing work does not accurately describe the extrema of multivariate, multimodal generative distributions, and proposes a novel method for overcoming such problems. The method is numerical, and provides optimal solutions for generative multivariate, multimodal distributions of arbitrary complexity. In a companion paper, we present analytical closed-form solutions which are currently limited to unimodal, multivariate generative distributions.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306231","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306231","","Biomedical engineering;Data analysis;Failure analysis;Jet engines;Kernel;Large scale integration;Manufacturing processes;Power system modeling;Probability distribution;Testing","decision theory;pattern classification;statistical distributions","data distribution;decision boundary;generative distribution;multimodal estimation;multivariate extreme value theory;novelty detection;numerical approach;one-class classification","","3","","13","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper addresses a novel technique of such a decomposition and investigates this idea through inpainting of images which is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of images or videos.When samples are missed in an image, the the original sparsity level in representing coefficients is changed, so with an iterative method we can estimate the original level.

This method was designed to account for three main constrains. First, most relevant spike generation models assume that sources are extended, i.e. spatially distributed over a focal or muti-focal area. Second, the background activity of the brain also contributes to EEG/MEG signals recorded during epileptic events. In this context, it can be seen as a penalizing Gaussian and spatially correlated noise. Third the array manifold is usually corrupted by errors due to the complexity of the conduction head volume. The proposed method is an adaptation of the well-established MUSIC method, that allows for the localization of Extended Sources (ExSo) assuming that all current dipoles comprised in the extended source are synchronous. In addition, we use Higher Order (HO) statistics, which are asymptotically insensitive to a Gaussian noise of unknown spatial coherence and which offer a greater robustness with respect to modeling errors. The method is called 2q-ExSo-MUSIC (q ges 2) as it combines the ExSo-MUSIC principle with the use of HO statistics. Using computer simulations of EEG signals, it is shown to highly increase the performance of classical MUSIC-like algorithms when physiologically relevant models for current sources and for volume conduction are considered.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306246","","Brain modeling;Design methodology;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Error analysis;Gaussian noise;Higher order statistics;Magnetic heads;Multiple signal classification;Spatial coherence","Gaussian noise;electroencephalography;higher order statistics;magnetoencephalography","EEG data;ExSo-MUSIC principle;Gaussian noise;Higher Order statistics;MEG data;epileptic spikes;extended intracerebral current sources localization;spatially correlated","","0","","23","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The two stock exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen were opened nearly twenty years ago. The Shenzhen stock exchange market is young and energetic. Moreover, it practices a T+1 settlement rule instead of real time trade as in Hong Kong or other exchange markets. One important research question is whether there are patterns that can be identified in stock prices that can be used to develop profitable investment strategies. If strategies can be found, then this represents a violation of the efficient market hypothesis. In this work, we propose an investment strategy by using radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) trained by localized generalization error model (L-GEM) and 4 stock price candlestick patterns. Every base RBFNN in the multiple classifier system (MCS) recognizes the occurrence of a particular candlestick pattern and the MCS combines opinions from the 4 base RBFNNs by a weighted sum to provide a final prediction. If the MCS predicts an increase for the next day, it will buy the stock and sell it within three days whenever the opening price is higher than the buy-in price or else after three days have passed.

This class of segmentation models poses a special optimization problem, as, in this case, the variables constituting the MRF are continuous and subject to probability constraints (positivity, sum-to-unity).

CCA searches for a linear projection for each view, such that the correlations between the projections are maximized. The solution is invariant to any linear transformation of either or both of the views; for tasks with small sample size such flexibility implies overfitting, which is even worse for more flexible nonparametric or kernel-based dependency discovery methods. We develop variants which reduce the degrees of freedom by assuming constraints on similarity of the projections in the two views. A particular example is provided by a cancer gene discovery application where chromosomal distance affects the dependencies between gene copy number and activity levels. Similarity constraints are shown to improve detection performance of known cancer genes.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306192","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306192","","Bayesian methods;Bioinformatics;Cancer;Computer science;Gene expression;Genetic mutations;Genomics;Multidimensional systems;Particle measurements;Vectors","bioinformatics;data handling;unsupervised learning","cancer gene discovery;canonical correlation analysis;chromosomal distance;dependency detection;gene activity levels;gene copy number;similarity constraints;unsupervised two-view learning","","3","","13","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, if the nonlinear stage can be compensated separately, then, in a second moment, one can make use of the well-established source separation algorithms for the linear case. Motivated by that, we propose in this work a novel two-stage PNL method relying on the assumption that the sources are bandlimited signals.

Speaker diarization systems basically provide an answer to the question ""Who spoke when ?"". One inherent deficiency of most current systems is their inability to handle co-channel or overlapped speech. During the past few years, several studies have attempted dealing with the problem of overlapped or co-channel speech detection and separation, however, most of the algorithms suggested perform under unique conditions, require high computational complexity and require both time and frequency domain analysis of the audio data. In this study, frame based entropy analysis of the audio data in the time domain serves as a single feature for an overlapped speech detection algorithm. Identification of overlapped speech segments is performed using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) along with well known classification algorithms applied on two speaker conversations. By employing this methodology, the proposed method eliminates the need for setting a hard threshold for each conversation or database. LDC CALLHOME American English corpus is used for evaluation of the suggested algorithm. The proposed method successfully detects 60.0% of the frames labeled as overlapped speech by the baseline (ground-truth) segmentation , while keeping a 5% false-alarm rate.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306205","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306205","","Autocorrelation;Automatic speech recognition;Computational complexity;Detection algorithms;Educational institutions;Entropy;Hidden Markov models;Linear predictive coding;Speech analysis;Speech processing","Gaussian processes;computational complexity;entropy;speech processing;temporal databases;time-varying networks","Gaussian mixture modeling;LDC CALLHOME American English corpus;audio data;computational complexity;frame level entropy analysis;frequency domain analysis;overlapped speech detection;speaker diarization system;speech detection;speech separation;time domain analysis","","6","","15","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach involves the separation of a mixed pixel into its pure components or endmember spectra, and the estimation of the abundance value for each endmember. Several techniques have been developed for extraction of spectral endmembers and estimation of fractional abundances. However, an important issue that has not been yet fully accomplished is the incorporation of spatial constraints into endmember extraction and, particularly, fractional abundance estimation. Another relevant topic is the use of nonlinear versus linear mixture models, which can be unconstrained or constrained in nature. Here, the constraints refer to non-negativity and sum to unity of estimated fractional abundances for each pixel vector. In this paper, we investigate the impact of including spatial and abundance-related constraints in spectral mixture analysis of remotely sensed hyperspectral data sets. For this purpose, we discuss the advantages that can be obtained after including spatial information in techniques for endmember extraction and fractional abundance estimation, using a database of synthetic hyperspectral scenes with artificial spatial patterns generated using fractals, and a real hyperspectral scene collected by NASA's airborne visible infra-red imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS).","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306202","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306202","","Data analysis;Data mining;Fractals;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Image databases;Layout;Spatial databases;Spectral analysis;Vectors","feature extraction;geophysical signal processing;image processing;remote sensing;spectral analysis","AVIRIS;NASA airborne visible infra-red imaging spectrometer;endmember spectral extraction;fractional abundance estimation;nonnegativity constraint;pixel separation;remotely sensed hyperspectral data;spatial constraint;spatial image processing;spectral mixture analysis;synthetic hyperspectral scene","","4","","12","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In ME models, the tradeoff between model bias and variance is found in the constraints encoded into the model - complex constraints give the model more representation capacity but may over-fit, whereas simple constraints may produce less over-fitting but may have much more model bias. We developed a greedy order-growing constraint search method to sequentially build constraints with flexible order based on likelihood gain on a validation set.

We come to the conclusion that in this formulation, all methods share the same performance limit, which is determined using the first result. The next question is what the smallest number of binary classifiers is that is needed to attain a given probability of success. To investigate this, we introduce the concept of efficiency, which is the ratio between the number bits needed to count the number of distinguishable classes and the number of bits used.

Although the use of shrinkage is optimal for Gaussian white noise with complete and unitary transforms, it has already been shown that shrinkage has promising results even with redundant transforms. In this paper, we propose using adaptive thresholding of redundant representations of the noisy image for image denoising. In the proposed thresholding scheme, a different threshold is used for each representation coefficient of the noisy image in an overcomplete transform.

Considering the relationship between the classification margin of support vector machine(SVM) and the generalization capability, the large margin of SVM can be used as the heuristic information of decision tree, in order to improve its generalization capability. This paper proposes a decision tree induction algorithm based on large margin heuristic. Comparing with the binary decision tree using the minimum entropy as the heuristic information, the experiments show that the generalization capability has been improved by using the new heuristic.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212227","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212227","Clustering;Decision tree;Generalization;SMO;Support vector machines;large margin","Classification tree analysis;Cybernetics;Decision trees;Entropy;Induction generators;Inverse problems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","decision trees;entropy;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","binary decision tree;decision tree induction algorithm;feature-based instances;knowledge classification extraction;machine learning;minimum entropy;statistical learning;support vector machine","","1","","8","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spectral features which only describe the material of structures can not distinguish objects made by the same material but with different semantic meanings (such as the roofs of some buildings and the roads). The use of geometrical features is therefore necessary. Moreover, since the dimension of a hyperspectral image is usually very high, we use linear unmixing algorithm to extract the endmemebers and their abundance-maps in order to represent compactly the spectral information. Afterwards, with the help of these abundance maps, we propose a method based on topographic map of images to estimate local scales of structures in hyperspectral images. The experiment shows that the geometrical features can improve the classification results, especially for the classes made by the same material but with different semantic meanings. When compared to the traditional contextual features (such as morphological profiles), the local scale feature provides satisfactory results without considerably increasing the feature dimension.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306266","","Buildings;Data mining;EMP radiation effects;Feature extraction;Hyperspectral imaging;Hyperspectral sensors;Image classification;Independent component analysis;Remote sensing;Roads","geometry;image classification","geometrical features;hyperspectral image classification;linear unmixing algorithm;spectral features;topographic map","","7","","13","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we address the problem of filtering and smoothing in the presence of stochastic switches where the problem is to recover both R and X from Y. In the classical conditionally Gaussian state space models, exact computing with polynomial complexity in the time index is not feasible and different approximations are used. Different alternative models, in which the exact calculations are feasible, have been recently proposed since 2008. The core difference between these models and the classical ones is that the couple (R, Y) is a Markov one in the recent models, while it is not in the classical ones. Another extension deals with the case in which the observed chain Y is not necessarily Markovian conditionally on (X, R) and, in particular, the long-memory distributions can be considered. The aim of this paper is to show that, in the context of these different recent models, it is possible to calculate any moments of the posterior marginal distribution, which makes it feasible to know these distributions with any desired precision.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306220","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306220","","Context modeling;Filtering;Polynomials;Random variables;Smoothing methods;State-space methods;Stochastic processes;Stochastic systems;Switches;Switching systems","Gaussian processes;Markov processes;computational complexity;smoothing methods;statistical distributions","conditionally Gaussian state space models;discrete finite Markov chain;filtering problem;memory stochastic switching systems;polynomial complexity;posterior marginal distribution;smoothing problem","","2","","14","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Scene variability and perception constancy in the visual system: a model of pre-processing before data analysis and learning","J. Herault; N. Guyader; A.

Is there some lost garden of Eden? Is there some way to approach it? In this paper, we deal with the human visual perception and we show how our visual system manages to process visual information in such a highly efficient way that it is able to categorize images or scenes within ranges of 100-150 ms independently of variability and noise. In fact, before high-level recognition task, the visual system unfolds a series of pre-processing stages to reduce all the variability that disturbed an image : (1) In the retina: a first adaptative process to global and local illuminant intensity and color, and a second to local contrasts preprocess the visual signal to bring equal quantity of information on the whole image. The retina spatio-temporal filter whitens the image spectra so that all the spatial frequencies are equally represented. (2) In the primary visual cortex: a bank of cortical like filters decomposes the power frequency spectrum of the visual signal; this is equivalent to estimate the local power frequency spectrum, which is relatively insensitive to image translations. Moreover such decomposition offers a log polar representation of the power spectrum, which can be useful to resolve zoom and rotation variability and also to estimate local perspective. (3) In the cortical area V4, a further Fourier Transform of the log-polar spectrum provides insensitivity to zooms and rotations, as well as to perspective transformations. In this research, an image is represented by means of a high-dimensional vector: first this image is preprocessed by the retina, then, the power spectrum of the preprocessed image is decomposed by a bank of filters and the energy output of each filter is considered. Taking advantages of all the processing stages, data variability can be expected to be optimally reduced for comparison purposes and or for categorization tasks. In the last part of this paper, we give an exampl- e of image categorization by means of CCA, a self-organizing neural network, which, after noise reduction, reduces dimension and unfolds the manifold where the data are embedded. It is also shown that the network, taught by human subjects performing the categorization task, improves its results by providing a better separation of the semantical categories.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306254","","Colored noise;Data analysis;Filters;Frequency estimation;Humans;Image recognition;Layout;Retina;Visual perception;Visual system","Fourier transforms;channel bank filters;computer vision;data analysis;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);spatiotemporal phenomena;visual perception","CCA;Fourier transform;cortical area V4;data analysis;dimension reduction;high-dimensional vector;high-level recognition task;human visual perception system;illuminant intensity;image categorization;image preprocessing;image representation;image spectra;log polar representation;machine learning;noise reduction;perception constancy;power frequency spectrum estimation;retina;retina spatio-temporal filter;rotation variability;scene variability;self-organizing neural network;visual cortex;visual signal preprocessing;visual system","","0","","36","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GLS exploits the properties of exponential family distributions, which are assumed to describe the data components, and constrains latent variables to a lower dimensional parameter subspace. Based on the latent variable information, classification is performed in the natural parameter subspace with classical statistical techniques. The benefits of decision making in parameter space is illustrated with examples of categorical data text categorization and mixed-type data classification.

For any region, a specific 3D Ising field may embody spatial correlation over the hidden states of the voxels by modeling whether they are activated or not. To make spatial regularization adaptive, our approach is first based upon a classical path sampling method to approximate a small subset of reference PFs corresponding to prespecified regions. Then, we propose an extrapolation method that allows us to approximate the PFs associated to the Ising fields defined over the remaining brain regions. In comparison with preexisting approaches, our method is robust against grid inhomogeneities within the reference PFs and remains efficient irrespective of the topological configurations of the reference and test regions. Our contribution strongly alleviates the computational cost and makes spatially adaptive regularization of whole brain fMRI datasets feasible.","1551-2541;15512541","POD:978-1-4244-4947-7","10.1109/MLSP.2009.5306210","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5306210","","Brain;Computational efficiency;Extrapolation;Filters;Hemodynamics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Magnetic separation;Robustness;Sampling methods;Testing","Ising model;biomedical MRI;extrapolation;medical image processing;neurophysiology","3D Ising field partition functions;brain activity;classical path sampling method;functional magnetic resonance imaging;joint detection-estimation;multiple extrapolations;region-dependent hemodynamic filter;spatially adaptive regularization;spatially unsupervised analysis;voxels;within-subject FMRI","","2","","10","","","1-4 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

BAS Committee is a scheme that uses feature clustering to determine the best weight assignments in the BAS framework. One of the drawbacks of BAS committee is its final step which uses a simple majority voting approach over the chosen classifiers. Entropy guided transformation learning (ETL) is a machine learning strategy that combines decision trees and transformation based learning avoiding the explicit need of template design. Here, we present ETL voting BAS committee, a scheme that combines ETL and BAS Committee in order to determine the best combination for the classifiers of the ensemble. Besides that, since no extra assumption is made, ETL voting is generic and can be used in any committee approach.
