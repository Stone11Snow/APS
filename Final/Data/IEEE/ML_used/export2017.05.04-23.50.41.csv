Traditional methods for uncertain data depend on data pre-processing. For example, substituting uncertain value with expected value or ignoring uncertain samples. However, preprocessing can introduce false value and ignore uncertainty. In this paper, we focus on classification problem. Specially, we solve the problem of classifier training with uncertain data. Based on a general uncertain data model, we propose a novel probability-weighted extreme learning machine classification algorithm for uncertain data. In the proposed algorithm, due to huge increase of training set arise from uncertainty, training process can be computationally intensive. For improving training efficiency, we optimize the solution by making it independent of the number of uncertain instances. Extensive experiments over different levels of uncertainty demonstrate that uncertain information does contribute to training and is even necessary within a certain degree of uncertainty. The results show that probability extreme learning machine beats traditional methods in most cases.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1192-6; POD:978-1-5090-1193-3","10.1109/DSC.2016.93","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7866205","Classification;Extreme Learning Machine;Uncertain data","Classification algorithms;Data models;Electronic mail;Liver;Mathematical model;Training;Uncertainty","data handling;feedforward neural nets;pattern classification;probability","classification;classifier training;probability-weighted extreme learning machine;uncertain data","","","","","","","13-16 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Following this preliminary investigation, we propose a telescopic multiscale version of local search, where the number of bits is increased in an adaptive manner, leading to a faster search and to local minima of better quality. An analysis related to adapting the number of bits in a dynamic way is presented. The control on the number of bits, which happens in a natural manner in the proposed method, is effective to increase the generalization performance.

The optimal normalised threshold for different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) is investigated, and the effects of the integration period and channel model are examined.

The recently introduced DyBM provides a particularly structured Boltzmann machine, as a generative model of a multi-dimensional time-series. This Boltzmann machine can have infinitely many layers of units but allows exact inference and learning based on its biologically motivated structure. DyBM uses the idea of conduction delays in the form of fixed length first-in first-out (FIFO) queues, with a neuron connected to another via this FIFO queue, and spikes from a pre-synaptic neuron travel along the queue to the post-synaptic neuron with a constant period of delay. Here, we present Delay Pruning as a mechanism to prune the lengths of the FIFO queues (making them zero) by setting some delay lengths to one with a fixed probability, and finally selecting the best performing model with fixed delays. The uniqueness of structure and a non-sampling based learning rule in DyBM, make the application of previously proposed regularization techniques like Dropout or DropConnect difficult, leading to poor generalization. First, we evaluate the performance of Delay Pruning to let DyBM learn a multidimensional temporal sequence generated by a Markov chain. Finally, we show the effectiveness of delay pruning in learning high dimensional sequences using the moving MNIST dataset, and compare it with Dropout and DropConnect methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899800","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899800","","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Delays;History;Neurons;Training;Unsupervised learning","","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of neural networks greatly depends on whether they can provide appealing solutions to the problems of the parameter learning (i.e., the connecting weights in each layer) and the structure learning (i.e., the network structure). These two kinds of learning can be performed simultaneously or separately. In this paper, we proposed the Jacobian Matrix-based Learning Machine (JMLM) to provide an appealing solution to the aforementioned two kinds of learning. The network structure of a JMLM can be incrementally constructed and a Jacobian-matrix-based learning method is proposed to efficiently estimate the corresponding network parameters. Furthermore, we can provide physically meaningful explanations to help human analyzers to make decisions based on the parameters embedded in a trained JMLM.

In the past decades, the difficulty level to find fault in rotor bars has attracted many researcher to develop the solving method. Therefore, this work presents an alternative to discover fault on rotor bars based on analysis of stator currents (MCSA) using Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In this study, ELM applied to detect abnormalities and fault of rotor bars on induction motor with no load condition. The performance of proposed algorithm would compared with Constructive Back Propagation Neural Network (CBP-NN). The structure of both methods consist of a single hidden layer with 20 neurons that activated by a tangent sigmoid function. In the experiment, the data input for all algorithms came from the normalized of DFT outcome. The test result shows that ELM is faster compared with CBP-NN about 0.0467 seconds in terms of time training. Although the accuracy of their training has a wide error deviation but for the new data pattern recognizing or its variation, ELM provides the output prediction closer to the target validation than CBP-NN.

Ideal gas sensors should be with selectivity, reliability, and cross-sensitivity to different odors. However, a new problem is that abnormal odors (e.g., perfume, alcohol, etc.) would show strong sensor response, such that they deteriorate the usual usage of E-nose for target odor analysis. An intuitive idea is to recognize abnormal odors and remove them online. A known truth is that the kinds of abnormal odors are countless in real-world scenarios. Therefore, general pattern classification algorithms lose effect because it is expensive and unrealistic to obtain all kinds of abnormal odors data. In this paper, we propose two simple yet effective methods for abnormal odor (outlier) detection: 1) a self-expression model (SEM) with l₁/l₂-norm regularizer is proposed, which is trained on target odor data for coding and then a very few abnormal odor data is used as prior knowledge for threshold learning and 2) inspired by self-expression mechanism, an extreme learning machine (ELM) based self-expression (SE²LM) is proposed, which inherits the advantages of ELM in solving a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network. Experiments on several datasets by an E-nose system fabricated in our laboratory prove that the proposed SEM and SEE²LM methods are significantly effective for real-time abnormal odor detection.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2017.2691909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907343","Electronic nose (E-nose);extreme learning machine (ELM);odor detection;self-expression.","Electronic noses;Encoding;Gas detectors;Neurons;Pattern recognition;Training","","","","","","","","20170424","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Conditional High-order Boltzmann Machines for Supervised Relation Learning","y. huang; W. Wang; l. wang; T. Tan","","IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Relation learning is a fundamental problem in many vision tasks. Recently, high-order Boltzmann machine and its variants have shown their great potentials in learning various types of data relation in a range of tasks. But most of these models are learned in an unsupervised way, i.e., without using relation class labels, which are not very discriminative for some challenging tasks, e.g., face verification. In this paper, with the goal to perform supervised relation learning, we introduce relation class labels into conventional high-order multiplicative interactions with pairwise input samples, and propose a Conditional High-order Boltzmann Machine (CHBM) which can learn to classify the data relation in a binary classification way. To be able to deal with more complex data relation, we develop two improved variants of CHBM. 1) Latent CHBM, which jointly performs relation feature learning and classification, by using a set of latent variables to block the pathway from pairwise input samples to output relation labels. 2) Gated CHBM, which untangles factors of variation in data relation, by exploiting a set of latent variables to multiplicatively gate the classification of CHBM. To reduce the large number of model parameters generated by the multiplicative interactions, we approximately factor high-order parameter tensors into multiple matrices. Then we develop efficient supervised learning algorithms, by first pretraining the models using joint likelihood to provide good parameter initialization, and then finetuning them using conditional likelihood to enhance the discriminant ability. We apply the proposed models to a series of tasks including invariant recognition, face verification and action similarity labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that by exploiting supervised relation labels, our models can greatly improve the performance.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2017.2698918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7913581","Action Similarity Labeling;Deep Learning;Face Verification;High-order Boltzmann Machine;Relation Learning","Computational modeling;Data models;Face;Logic gates;Measurement;Supervised learning;Tensile stress","","","","","","","","20170427","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This proposed method consists of two modules: (1) extraction of histogram of oriented gradient variant (HOGv) feature and (2) a single classifier trained by extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm. The presented HOGv feature keeps a good balance between redundancy and local details such that it can represent distinctive shapes better. The classifier is a single-hidden-layer feedforward network. Based on ELM algorithm, the connection between input and hidden layers realizes the random feature mapping while only the weights between hidden and output layers are trained. As a result, layer-by-layer tuning is not required. Meanwhile, the norm of output weights is included in the cost function. Therefore, the ELM-based classifier can achieve an optimal and generalized solution for multiclass TSR. Furthermore, it can balance the recognition accuracy and computational cost. Three datasets, including the German TSR benchmark dataset, the Belgium traffic sign classification dataset and the revised mapping and assessing the state of traffic infrastructure (revised MASTIF) dataset, are used to evaluate this proposed method. Experimental results have shown that this proposed method obtains not only high recognition accuracy but also extremely high computational efficiency in both training and recognition processes in these three datasets.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2533424","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7433451","Extreme learning machine (ELM);HOG variant (HOGv);traffic sign recognition (TSR)","Computational efficiency;Feature extraction;Histograms;Neural networks;Robustness;Shape;Training","feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);traffic engineering computing","ELM;HOGv;TSR;extreme learning machine;feature extraction;histogram of oriented gradient variant;single-hidden-layer feedforward network;traffic sign recognition","","1","","","","20160314","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The LOIDs are key for visual understanding, and are at the origin of the success of the popular approaches, such as local binary patterns (LBPs) and the scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). Whereas, LBPs and SIFT yield hand-crafted image representations, we propose to learn data-specific representations of the LOIDs in a rotation-invariant fashion. The image operators are based on steerable circular harmonic wavelets (CHWs), offering a rich and yet compact initial representation for characterizing natural textures. The joint location and orientation required to encode the LOIDs is preserved by using moving frames (MFs) texture representations built from locally-steered image gradients that are invariant to rigid motions. In a second step, we use support vector machines to learn a multi-class shaping matrix for the initial CHW representation, yielding data-driven MFs called steerable wavelet machines (SWMs). The SWM forward function is composed of linear operations (i.e., convolution and weighted combinations) interleaved with non-linear steermax operations. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed operators for classifying natural textures.

The existing training algorithms for SLFN are either gradient based iterative learning algorithms or non-iterative algorithms such as extreme learning machine (ELM). The iterative learning algorithms suffer from slow learning, under-fitting, over-fitting whereas in ELM input weights are randomly chosen consequently the classification using ELM is non-deterministic. The proposed DLM is a non-iterative algorithm in which input weights are derived from input space without finding any parameter experimentally and output weights are calculated as an exact solution of linear system. This makes very fast learning and deterministic classification. The feature extraction is performed in a multi-model way by integrating the face image pixels intensity and local entropy of the image.

Built upon the characteristics of SPRs, the SPR identification problem is modeled as a classification problem from a market participant's viewpoint, and a Support Vector Machine based data-driven approach is proposed.

Although a parallel ELM (PELM) based on MapReduce to process large-scale data shows more efficient learning speed than identical ELM algorithms in a serial environment, some operations, such as intermediate results stored on disks and multiple copies for each task, are indispensable, and these operations create a large amount of extra overhead and degrade the learning speed and efficiency of the PELMs. In this paper, an efficient ELM based on the Spark framework (SELM), which includes three parallel subalgorithms, is proposed for big data classification. By partitioning the corresponding data sets reasonably, the hidden layer output matrix calculation algorithm, matrix Û decomposition algorithm, and matrix V decomposition algorithm perform most of the computations locally. At the same time, they retain the intermediate results in distributed memory and cache the diagonal matrix as broadcast variables instead of several copies for each task to reduce a large amount of the costs, and these actions strengthen the learning ability of the SELM. Finally, we implement our SELM algorithm to classify large data sets. Extensive experiments have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. As shown, our SELM achieves an 8.71x speedup on a cluster with ten nodes, and reaches a 13.79x speedup with 15 nodes, an 18.74x speedup with 20 nodes, a 23.79x speedup with 25 nodes, a 28.89x speedup with 30 nodes, and a 33.81x speedup with 35 nodes.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2654357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906470","Big data;Spark.;classification;extreme learning machine (ELM);matrix;parallel algorithms","Big Data;Classification algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Memory management;Partitioning algorithms;Sparks;Training","","","","","","","","20170424","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In conventional RL, the goal state is selected by the user or defined by the physics of the problem, and the decoder finds an optimal policy essentially by assigning credit over time, which is normally very time-consuming. However, BMI tasks require finding a good policy in very few trials, which impose a limit on the complexity of the tasks that can be learned before the animal quits. Therefore, this paper explores the possibility of letting the agent infer potential goals through actions over space with multiple objects, using the instantaneous reward to assign credit spatially. A previous method, attention-gated RL employs a multilayer perceptron trained with backpropagation, but it is prone to local minima entrapment. We propose a quantized attention-gated kernel RL (QAGKRL) to avoid the local minima adaptation in spatial credit assignment and sparsify the network topology. The experimental results show that the QAGKRL achieves higher successful rates and more stable performance, indicating its powerful decoding ability for more sophisticated BMI tasks as required in clinical applications.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2493079","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335648","Attention-gated reinforcement learning (AGREL);brain–machine interfaces (BMIs);kernel adaptive filtering;quantization approach","Animals;Biomedical engineering;Decoding;Kernel;Learning (artificial intelligence);Quantization (signal);Trajectory","adaptive filters;brain-computer interfaces;decoding;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);network topology;quantisation (signal);signal processing","QAGKRL;backpropagation;brain-machine interface decoding;kernel adaptive filtering;local minima adaptation;multilayer perceptron;network topology;neural signals;quantized attention gated kernel reinforcement learning;spatial credit assignment","","","","","","20151123","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Many of existing Z80 learning board came with tons of user friendly interfaces, such as a keypad and alphanumerical LCD, however, the most important basic of this subject, the data transfer signaling, is sometime difficult to show. In this paper, we present a Z80 microprocessor module as learning facility with a HMI chip that is designed using FPGA chip, which is allow us to gate and control the microprocessor signals. The HMI chip implanted several control functions; the STEP unit, DMA unit, control memory unit, I/O control unit, address and data control unit, and system reset unit. Units in the HMI chip works very structured, and interconnected. With the signal controlled from the HMI chip units, the microprocessor work process becomes more easily to be manipulated and observed. The process of storing and reading program using DMA also can be easier to understand. Simple layout of the main board greatly facilitate student in operate and analyze a running program. Since the HMI chip built on an LVCMOS technology, while the classic Z80 CPU is still a CMOS, two-way bus logic level converters from 3.3V to 5V have to be used.

Additionally, they are not designed in order to deal with the intrinsic time varying nature of the problem (e.g., regular changes in the nominal timetable, etc.). The purpose of this paper is to build a dynamic data-driven TD prediction system that exploits the most recent tools and techniques in the field of time varying big data analysis. In particular, we map the TD prediction problem into a time varying multivariate regression problem that allows exploiting both historical data about the train movements and exogenous data about the weather provided by the national weather services. The performance of these methods have been tuned through the state-of-the-art thresholdout technique, a very powerful procedure which relies on the differential privacy theory. Finally, the performance of two efficient implementations of shallow and deep extreme learning machines that fully exploit the recent in-memory large-scale data processing technologies have been compared with the current state-of-the-art TD prediction systems.

The combination, includes more information of the scene than any of the individual source images. In this paper, a novel multifocus image fusion method based on extreme learning machine (ELM) and human visual system (HVS) is proposed. Three visual features that reflect the clarity of a pixel are first extracted and used to train the ELM to judge which pixel is clearer. The clearer pixels are then used to construct the initial fused image. Then, we measure the similarity between the source image and the initial fused image and perform morphological opening and closing operations to obtain the focused regions. Lastly, the final fused image is achieved by employing a fusion rule in the focus regions and the initial fused image. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is more effective and better than other series of existing popular fusion methods in terms of both subjective and objective evaluations.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2696119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906593","Multifocus image fusion;extreme learning machine;focused regions;human visual system","Feature extraction;Image fusion;Information filtering;Neural networks;Neurons;Training;Transforms","","","","","","","","20170424","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For this purpose, experiments were carried out in the laboratory implementing real load switching activity and power measurements were made with a smart meter. Nonintrusive load monitoring is performed by analysing the power signals obtained from the smart meter and detecting the operation of load appliances. A new feature extraction technique based on the time-time (TT)-transform is applied to improve the load identification. For classifying and predicting the various load operations, a new intelligent technique called as extreme learning machine with single hidden layer feedforward neural network is developed. ELM has high efficiency and simple to be implemented. The inputs to the ELM are the extracted TT-transform features together with other signals like real and reactive powers while the ELM outputs are the switching states of the load appliances.

Accordingly, a dual-mode predictive controller is developed to mitigate the machining vibrations, and the quality of the workpiece surface has been thus substantially improved.

AUVs have been widely applied to many fields, such as the ocean research, oil and gas exploitation, mineral resources investigation, fishing and military. People can obtain important ocean information by segmenting, classifying and recognizing sonar image of AUV. So studying side-scan sonar image is significant. Markov Random Field (MRF) is an efficient method for segmentation of side-scan sonar image. However, MRF may not work well for side-scan sonar image obtained from complex environment. In these images, pixel values do not change obviously. In this paper, an innovative segmentation method based MRF and Kernel-based Extreme Learning Machine (K-ELM) is proposed for real side-scan sonar image segmentation. This method has been validated on the real sonar images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms MRF in classification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5266-0; POD:978-1-5090-5267-7","10.1109/UT.2017.7890294","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890294","MRF and K-ELM;image segmentation;side-scan sonar image","Image segmentation;Imaging;Oceans;Synthetic aperture sonar;Testing;Training","Markov processes;autonomous underwater vehicles;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);radar computing;sonar imaging","AUVs;K-ELM;MRF;Markov random field;autonomous underwater vehicles;kernel-based extreme learning machine;oceanographic survey;side-scan sonar image segmentation;sonar image classification;sonar image recognition","","","","","","","21-24 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the framework of an ML-technique enhanced-EC algorithm (MLEC), the main idea is that the EC algorithm has stored ample data about the search space, problem features, and population information during the iterative search process, thus the ML technique is helpful in analyzing these data for enhancing the search performance.

Conventional WCE-VS methods extract various hand-crafted features as image representations. Researches show that such features only reflect the low-level characteristics of single frame and essentially are not effective to capture the semantic similarity between WCE frames. Motivated by the salient property of Siamese neural network (SNN) in mapping similar image pairs closer while mapping dissimilar image pairs apart in the feature space, a novel learning-based WCE-VS method is proposed in this paper. Specifically, with the availability of labelled similar and dissimilar pairs of WCE frames, SNN is trained with a contrastive loss function to extract high level semantic features. Furthermore, for similarity judgment, to avoid the challenge of manually setting optimal threshold in conventional methods, we creatively cast it into a supervised classification problem implemented by a linear SVM. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4847-2; POD:978-1-5090-4848-9","10.1109/ICPR.2016.7899817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899817","Siamese neural network;Wireless capsule endoscopy;linear SVM classifier;similarity judgment;video summarization","Convolution;Euclidean distance;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Semantics;Support vector machines;Training","","","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Domain adaptation (DA) addresses this problem by designing classifiers that are robust to mismatched distributions. Existing DA algorithms use the unlabeled test data from target domain during training time in addition to the source domain data. However, target domain data may not always be available for training. We propose a blind DA algorithm that does not require target domain samples for training. For this purpose, we learn a global nonlinear extreme learning machine (ELM) model from the source domain data in an unsupervised fashion. The global ELM model is then used to initialize and learn class specific ELM models from the source domain data. During testing, the target domain features are augmented with the reconstructed features from the global ELM model. The resulting enriched features are then classified using the class specific ELM models based on minimum reconstruction error. Extensive experiments on 16 standard datasets show that despite blind learning, our method outperforms six existing state-of-the-art methods in cross domain visual recognition.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2523538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404267","Blind domain adaptation (DA);extreme learning machines (ELMs);object recognition;visual classification","Adaptation models;Cybernetics;Data models;Joining processes;Training;Training data;Visualization","image classification;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","AELM;augmented extreme learning machine;blind DA;blind domain adaptation;feature reconstruction;source domain data;unsupervised fashion;visual classification performance;visual recognition","","1","","","","20160211","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We propose an novel online target tracking method which based on extreme learning machine(ELM). This tracking method consists of three modules: training, tracking and classifier update. The training stage aims to train ELM by using the training set. Extracting histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) features in the first frame of each sequence for training ELM. Then the tracking stage will make predictions about the object position and detect the target in candidate regions. A simple object motion model is designed to predict the object position. Finally, according to tracking results, the classifier can be updated for online learning.

In this technique current, voltage and power phasor values are measured for half cycle duration from fault inception at the relaying end of the faulted transmission line. The determinant function is used to extract fault features. Optimal fault feature set is selected using sequential forward selection (SFS) method. The selected features are fed as input to OSELM for fault classification and fault location estimation. The proposed method is extensively tested in various types of fault scenarios in a three machine nine bus power transmission network with series compensation simulated in DigSilent Power factory.

The method is based on an evolving spatiotemporal data machine of evolving spiking neural networks (SNNs) exemplified by the NeuCube architecture [1]. The method consists of several steps: mapping spatial coordinates of fMRI data into a 3-D SNN cube (SNNc) that represents a brain template; input data transformation into trains of spikes; deep, unsupervised learning in the 3-D SNNc of spatiotemporal patterns from data; supervised learning in an evolving SNN classifier; parameter optimization; and 3-D visualization and model interpretation. Two benchmark case study problems and data are used to illustrate the proposed methodology - fMRI data collected from subjects when reading affirmative or negative sentences and another one - on reading a sentence or seeing a picture. The learned connections in the SNNc represent dynamic spatiotemporal relationships derived from the fMRI data. They can reveal new information about the brain functions under different conditions. The proposed methodology allows for the first time to analyze dynamic functional and structural connectivity of a learned SNN model from fMRI data. This can be used for a better understanding of brain activities and also for online generation of appropriate neurofeedback to subjects for improved brain functions. For example, in this paper, tracing the 3-D SNN model connectivity enabled us for the first time to capture prominent brain functional pathways evoked in language comprehension. We found stronger spatiotemporal interaction between left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and left temporal while reading a negated sentence. This observation is obviously distinguishable from the patterns generated by either reading affirmative sentences or seeing pictures. The proposed NeuCube-- ased methodology offers also a superior classification accuracy when compared with traditional AI and statistical methods. The created NeuCube-based models of fMRI data are directly and efficiently implementable on high performance and low energy consumption neuromorphic platforms for real-time applications.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2612890","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7585110","Brain data classification;NeuCube;brain data modeling;brain data visualization;evolving spatiotemporal data machines (eSTDMs);functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);neuro information processing;spatiotemporal brain data (STBD);spiking neural networks (SNNs)","Brain modeling;Data models;Data visualization;Solid modeling;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Unsupervised learning","biomedical MRI;data visualisation;image classification;medical image processing;neural nets;unsupervised learning","3-D SNNc;3-D visualization;NeuCube evolving spatiotemporal data machine;NeuCube-based methodology;SNN;affirmative sentences;brain functional pathways;brain functions;brain template;classification accuracy;dynamic learning;dynamic spatiotemporal relationships;evolving spiking neural networks;fMRI data;functional magnetic resonance imaging;input data transformation;language comprehension;left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex;low energy consumption neuromorphic platforms;negative sentences;neurofeedback;spatiotemporal brain data;spatiotemporal interaction;spiking neural networks;unsupervised learning","","","","","","20161006","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
