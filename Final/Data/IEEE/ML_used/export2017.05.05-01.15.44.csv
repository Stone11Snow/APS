Usually features with small value of sensitivity are regarded as redundant ones that may be removed. By sorting the calculated sensitivity magnitudes, a sequence of features can be obtained. This sequence does depend generally on the input perturbation, which seriously affects the application of RBFNNs sensitivity to redundant feature removal. To overcome this defect, this paper gives an upper bound of input perturbation under which the sequence will be independent of the input perturbation. This upper bound keeps the feature sensitivity order unchanged and leads to a new sensitivity definition of RBFNNs. Simulation has been performed to verify the upper bound and the new sensitivity definition and the simulation result is consistent with the theoretical result.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527769","Input perturbation;RBFNNs;Sensitivity analysis;Upper bound","Computer science;Electronic mail;Function approximation;Interpolation;Mathematics;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Sensitivity analysis;Sorting;Upper bound","radial basis function networks;sensitivity analysis","input perturbation upper bound;radial basis function neural network;redundant feature removal;sensitivity analysis","","0","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key problem is not with the large number of rules because if there are indeed many rules that exist in data, they should be discovered. The main problem is with our inability to organize and represent the rules in such a way that the user can easily comprehend them. This paper proposed a technique to intuitively organize the discovered association rules in a hierarchical fashion named general-specific (GS) pattern. With this organization, the user can view the association rules at different level of details. The technique first finds a subset of the association rules called the most-general rules set (MGRS) to give the user a general relationship or a big picture of the original rules set. Then, the user can selectively view more-specific rules below a general rule that are interesting to him/her. Experiment results and practical applications show that the technique is both intuitive and effective.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527311","Association rules;Data Mining;More-General Rules;More-Specific Rules;Organization","Algorithm design and analysis;Association rules;Bellows;Computer science;Data mining;Databases;Electronic mail;Organizing;Pattern analysis;Pattern recognition","data mining;pattern classification","association rule mining algorithm techniques;general-specific hierarchical patterns;most-general rule set","","0","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second variant combines a BP network with an already calibrated parametrical model of the robot. This is a high performance solution. The presence of the neural network permits the compensation of several effects, even those not considered by the parametrical model.

To reduce the complexity of fuzzy models while keeping good model accuracy, some approximate similarity measures and simplification methods are presented. Using these methods, the redundant fuzzy rules are removed or merged. The simplified rule base is computationally efficient and linguistically interpretable.

However, in practice, this may not be always feasible as optical lenses, especially those with long focal lengths, only have a limited depth of field. One classical approach to recover an everywhere-in-focus image is to use Laplacian pyramid image fusion. First, several source images with different focuses of the same scene are taken and decomposed into the low/high-frequency components image sequences. Within these decompositions, the high-frequency components image sequences with the largest magnitude are selected at each pixel location. Finally, the fused image can be recovered from the decomposed components image sequences. In the support vector machine (SVM), the pixels with larger support values have a physical meaning in the sense that they reveal relative more importance of the data points for contributing to the SVM model. In this paper, we use Laplacian pyramid for the multi resolution decomposition, and then replace the traditional salient features by support values of the mapped least squares (LS)-SVM for fusing image. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional approach.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527871","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527871","Image fusion;Laplacian pyramid;mapped LS-SVM;support value","Focusing;Image edge detection;Image fusion;Image segmentation;Image sequences;Laplace equations;Layout;Lenses;Optical sensors;Support vector machines","edge detection;feature extraction;image reconstruction;image segmentation;image sequences;least squares approximations;sensor fusion;support vector machines","Laplacian pyramid image fusion;SVM;edge detection;everywhere-in-focus image;focal length;image recovery;image segmentation;image sequences;mapped least squares;multiresolution decomposition;optical lens;pixel location;support vector machine","","0","","14","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models were used to create the convolution equation. Counts, background, myocardial wall position and thickness were parameters of the equation. The method needs non-linear fitting by an iterative process. Computer simulated myocardial images, PET image of phantoms and patient's myocardial PET images were used for evaluating the method. For simulated images, the corrected recovery coefficient is between 0.97 and 1.10 for 2D model and is near 0.9 for 1D model. 2D model can be applied for myocardium as thin as 0.25 times of the system spatial resolution while 1D model is only for 1.5 times of it. For phantom images, the recovery coefficient of 2D is near 1.0 for different thickness of the myocardium.

Therefore, various SMT interconnection techniques are being developed to satisfy this need, including ball-grid-array (BGA). BGA has been used in a production of PCB (printed circuit board), because of their excellent characters such as high density of the lead pin pitch that can achieve a density of 400 I/Os per square inch. This paper deals with the detection of defects at BGA solder joints in PC boards by using X-ray imaging. It is possible to detect defects of solder joints by visual inspection, but only techniques utilizing X-ray could possibly inspect all BGA joints within the area array because they are hidden under the IC package. In traditional production, the inspection of BGA depends on the function test of electric circuits or boundary lighted inspection. Now with the employment of X-ray in solder joints inspection, it becomes very important about the detecting algorithm based on X-ray imaging. This paper discusses the flow of detecting defects based on the X-ray imaging and describes an approach to automatic inspection of BGA solder joint defects by using seed filling and contour extracting.

Neural networks are commonly trained to solve a specific problem for an encapsulated problem domain. Simple problems can be solved by a single network, whereby more complicated problems can be solved by sub-networks. These sub-networks then re-combined via a linking process forming a combined network, which has the ability to solve the entire problem. Insurance companies require monetary reserves for accounting, calculation of premium, reinsurance and asset liability management, which includes claims payable. Since the business of insurance companies lies in the future, accurate claims estimation for future financial years will increase profitability and ensure their solvency. A fine balance between under-reserving and over-reserving must be found because under-reserving can threaten solvency and over-reserving reduces profitability. Therefore this novel method for claims estimation with neural network linking has been developed.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526980","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526980","Finance;Linking;Multiple Experts;Neural Networks","Asset management;Companies;Costs;Electronic mail;Insurance;Joining processes;Neural networks;Neurons;Power engineering and energy;Profitability","","Finance;Linking;Multiple Experts;Neural Networks","","1","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main symptom of glaucoma is progressive loss of sight in the visual field over time. The clinical management of glaucoma involves monitoring the progress of the disease using a sequence of regular visual field tests. However, there is currently no universally accepted standard method for classifying changes in the visual field test data. Sequence matching techniques typically rely on similarity measures. However, visual field measurements are very noisy, particularly in people with glaucoma. It is therefore difficult to establish a reference data set including both stable and progressive visual fields. This paper proposes a method that uses a ""baseline"" computed from a query sequence, to match stable sequences in a database of visual field measurements collected from volunteers. The purpose of the new method is to classify a given query sequence as being stable or progressive. The results suggest that the new method gives a significant improvement in accuracy for identifying progressive sequences, though there is a small penalty for stable sequences.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527581","Confidence Interval;Glaucoma Change Probability;Sequence Matching;Visual Field","Blindness;Diseases;Electronic mail;Information technology;Medical treatment;Monitoring;Optical signal processing;Sequences;Testing;Visual databases","diseases;eye;image classification;image matching;medical computing;sequences;statistical analysis;vision defects;visual databases","baseline matching;clinical management;data set;disease;eye;glaucoma;partial blindness;progressive sequence;query sequence;stable reference sequence;visual database;visual field measurement","","1","","22","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its unique physiological structure, position and stability, ear recognition is expected to be a promising authentication technique. In this paper, a hybrid system for classifying ear images is proposed. This system combines independent component analysis (ICA) and RBF network. The original ear image database is decomposed into linear combinations of several basic images. Then the corresponding coefficients of these combinations are fed up into RBF network instead of an original feature vector comprised of pixel values of grayscale images. The local features extraction of ICA and the adaptability of RBF neural network are combined reasonably. The robustness of the system is enhanced. The experiment results show that the recognition rate of ICA RBF method is improved substantially.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527733","Ear recognition;independent component analysis (ICA);radial basis function (RBF) network","Authentication;Biometrics;Ear;Gray-scale;Image databases;Independent component analysis;Pixel;Radial basis function networks;Stability;Vectors","biometrics (access control);ear;feature extraction;image classification;independent component analysis;object recognition;radial basis function networks;visual databases","RBF network;authentication technique;biometrics;ear image classification;ear image database;ear recognition;feature extraction;feature vector;grayscale image pixel values;independent component analysis;physiological structure;radial basis function network","","12","","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the performance criterion which keeps the Lyapunov matrix out of the product of the system dynamic matrices, a sufficient condition for the existence of the robust estimator is provided in terms of linear matrix inequalities. It is shown that the proposed design strategy allows the use of parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions and hence it is less conservative than earlier results.
