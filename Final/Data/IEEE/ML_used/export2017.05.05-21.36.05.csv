"A survey of techniques for the identification of mobile phones using the physical fingerprints of the built-in components","G. Baldini; G. Steri","European Commission, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy (e-mail: gianmarco.baldini@ec.europa.eu).","IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","","2017","PP","99","1","1","In recent years, several research studies have investigated the identification of electronic devices through their physical components and properties, both from a theoretical point of view and through extensive experimental studies. Results have shown that in many cases a very high identification accuracy can be obtained by exploiting imperfections and small differences in the electronic components, which are called fingerprints in this context. Part of these studies have focused on a specific category of electronic device, the mobile phone or smartphone, which is usually equipped with components such as Radio Frequency (RF) front-ends, cameras, Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), microphones and speakers that are likely to reveal fingerprints in their digital outputs and then allow the identification of the component and of the mobile phone itself. Keeping the focus on mobile phones, this paper provides a survey of the different techniques for mobile phone identification on the basis of their built-in components. The paper describes the methodology, the classification algorithms and the types of features that are typically used in literature. Outstanding challenges and research issues are also identified and described, together with an overview of the potential applications of mobile phone fingerprinting. In addition, this paper analyzes the potential privacy risks associated to the tracking of the mobile phone on the basis of its fingerprints and the related mitigation techniques. Finally, it summarises the main issues and identifies research opportunities and potential future trends for mobile phone fingerprinting.","1553-877X;1553877X","","10.1109/COMST.2017.2694487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7902125","counterfeiting;fingerprint recognition;machine learning;radio frequency identification;security;telephone equipment","Authentication;Counterfeiting;Electronic components;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile handsets;Radio frequency;Tutorials","","","","","","","","20170417","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Continuous authentication has been explored as an approach for alleviating such concerns. Previous methods for continuous authentication primarily use biometrics, e.g., fingerprint and face recognition, or behaviometrics, e.g., key stroke patterns. We describe CABA, a novel continuous authentication system that is inspired by and leverages the emergence of sensors for pervasive and continuous health monitoring. CABA authenticates users based on their BioAura, an ensemble of biomedical signal streams that can be collected continuously and non-invasively using wearable medical devices. While each such signal may not be highly discriminative by itself, we demonstrate that a collection of such signals, along with robust machine learning, can provide high accuracy levels. We demonstrate the feasibility of CABA through analysis of traces from the MIMIC-II dataset. We propose various applications of CABA, and describe how it can be extended to user identification and adaptive access control authorization. Finally, we discuss possible attacks on the proposed scheme and suggest corresponding countermeasures.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2016.2622262","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723816","Authentication;behaviometrics;biomedical signals;biometrics;biostreams;continuous authentication;machine learning;security;wearable medical devices","Authentication;Authorization;Biomedical monitoring;Biometrics (access control);Monitoring;Scalability","","","","","","","","20161027","May 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a deep belief network (DBN)-deep neural network (DNN) to learn about the complex nonlinear relationship between the artificial feature vectors obtained from the oscillometric wave and the reference nurse blood pressures using the DBN-DNN-based-regression model. Our DBN-DNN is a powerful generative network for feature extraction and can address to stick in local minima through a special pretraining phase. Therefore, this model provides an alternative way for replacing a popular shallow model. Based on this, we apply the DBN-DNN-based regression model to estimate the SBP and DBP. However, there are a small amount of data samples, which is not enough to train the DBN-DNN without the overfitting problem. For this reason, we use the parametric bootstrap-based artificial features, which are used as training samples to efficiently learn the complex nonlinear functions between the feature vectors obtained and the reference nurse blood pressures. As far as we know, this is one of the first studies using the DBN-DNN-based regression model for BP estimation when a small training sample is available. Our DBN-DNN-based regression model provides a lower standard deviation of error, mean error, and mean absolute error for the SBP and DBP as compared with the conventional methods.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2016.2612640","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7576674","Blood pressure (BP);bootstrap;deep neural networks (DNNs);machine learning;oscillometric blood pressure estimation","Biomedical monitoring;Blood pressure;Estimation;Informatics;Neural networks;Standards;Training","","","","","","","","20160926","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we purposed self-learning method allows to adapt a detection model to network changes. This is minimized the false detection and reduce the possibility to mark legitimate users as malicious and vice versa. The developed method consists of two steps: collecting data about the network traffic by Netflow protocol and relearning the detection model with the new data. During the data collection we separate the traffic on legitimate and malicious. The separated traffic is labeled and sent to the relearning pool.

Timeous detection and identification of these flaws is, therefore, necessary to avoid adverse outcomes within the system. Metric-based heuristic frameworks have recently become popular for detecting and locating object-oriented design defects from the source code. Imperfections can occur at any level and obtaining proper threshold values is often a complicated process. To lessen this impact, an adjustable threshold methodology for metric-based design flaw detection was proposed through machine learning to compute the contribution and threshold values of each metric set. The threshold values were adjusted and adapted to conform to the software data input characteristics. Results demonstrated that the proposed method generated more appropriate threshold limits for the detection of design imperfections. Implementation was simple, less time-consuming and did not require expert knowledge compared to traditional procedures.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5210-3; POD:978-1-5090-5211-0","10.1109/ICDAMT.2017.7904988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7904988","Defect detection;Design flaws;Machine learning;Software metric","Maintenance engineering;Neurons;Software metrics;Software systems;Training","","","","","","","","","1-4 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using data analysis and machine learning techniques, common patterns and strategies from different users to execute different tasks can be extracted. In this paper, we present the evaluation results of the impact that clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis of the knee at early stages has on insole pressure sensors while walking at normal speeds focusing on the effects caused at points where knee forces tend to peak for normal users. From the different parts of the foot affected at high knee force moments, the forefoot pressure distribution and the heel to forefoot weight reallocation strategies have shown to provide better correlations with the user’s perceived pain in the knee for OA users with mild knee pain. The paper shows how the time differences and variabilities from 2 sensors located in the metatarsal zone while walking provide a simple mechanism to detect different strategies used by users suffering OA of the knee from control users with no knee pain. The weight dynamic reallocation at the midfoot, when moving forward from heel to forefoot, has also shown to positively correlate with the perceived knee pain. The major asymmetries between pressure patterns in both feet whilst walking at normal speeds are also captured. Based on the described features, automatic evaluation selfmanagement rehabilitation tools could be implemented to continuously monitor and provide personalized feedback for OA patients with mild knee pain to facilitate user adherence to individualized OA rehabilitation.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2696303","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906527","insole pressure sensors;machine learning and classification;mild knee pain;osteoarthritis","Correlation;Foot;Knee;Legged locomotion;Pain;Pressure sensors","","","","","","","","20170424","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In such cases, transfer learning, if applied correctly, would improve the performance of prediction algorithms on the test data of the target task via leveraging the auxiliary data from the related task. In this paper, we present two transfer learning approaches that combine the auxiliary data from the related task with the training data of the target task to improve the prediction performance on the test data of the target task.

In this approach, an automatic mapping is generated from a sense-level resource to a wordlevel by applying a triple unification process. This process produces a single polarity score for each term by incorporating all sense polarities. The major idea is to deal with the sense ambiguity during the lexicon transfer and provide a general sentiment lexicon for languages like Turkish which do not have a freely available machine-readable dictionary. On the other hand, the translation quality is critical in the lexicon transfer due to the ambiguity problem. Thus, this paper also proposes a multiple bilingual translation approach to find the most appropriate equivalents for the source language terms. In this approach, three parallel, series and hybrid algorithms are used to integrate the translation results. Finally, three lexicons are achieved for the target language with different sizes. The performance of three lexicons is evaluated in the lexicon-based sentiment classification task and compared with the results achieved by the supervised approach. According to experimental results, the proposed approach can produce reliable sentiment lexicons for the target language.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5698-9; POD:978-1-5090-5699-6","10.1109/SITIS.2016.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907484","Machine learning;Sentiment analysis;Sentiment lexicon;Translation approach","Benchmark testing;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Pragmatics;Semantics;Sentiment analysis","","","","","","","","","Nov. 28 2016-Dec. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For proof of idea, three subjects were asked to write seven letters with foot. We recorded and analyzed the data to study the learning process in five sessions. Since previous studies have shown that pressure of pen and stiffness of hand are inversely related to the learning level, we considered the pressure applied by a magnetic pen on a digital tablet during foot writing as one of the main features to represent the learning level. Pressure analysis demonstrated that the pressure on the tablet is decreased during successive task accomplishments. Statistical analysis of pressure indicates that the fourth day can be considered as the frontier of the learning process. The EMG signal was also recorded from eight leg muscles and for each of them 28 features were extracted. Several classification methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Classifier, Naive Bayes and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) were used in order to classify the recorded data. With 10 superior features chosen by Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm for each classifier, the accuracy of corresponding classifiers was in the range of 72%-95%. Moreover, we found out the SVM classifier, and the two Tibialis Anterior (TA) and Medial Gastrocnemius (MG) muscles could distinguish between learned and unlearned subjects most properly. The accuracy of features Mean frequency (MNF), Modified Mean Absolute Value (NMAV2) and Third spectral moment (SM3) belonging to TA and Willison Amplitude (WAMP) and Root Mean Square (RMS) belonging to MG was 90 and 85 percent, respectively. This preliminary study suggests that EMG signals can be effectively used to determine when the learning procedure is converging (or starting to converge) to its steady and ultimate level.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3452-9; POD:978-1-5090-3453-6","10.1109/ICBME.2016.7890982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890982","Classification;Electromyogram (EMG);Foot writing;Machine Learning;Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Electromyography;Feature extraction;Foot;Muscles;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machines;Writing","biomechanics;electromyography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;signal classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","EMG signal;Naive Bayes;SFFS algorithm;SVM classifier;classification method;digital tablet;electromyogram signal;feature extraction;foot writing process;k-nearest neighbor;leg muscle;linear classifier;magnetic pen;medial gastrocnemius muscle;pressure analysis;sequential floating forward selection;shank muscle;statistical analysis;support vector machine;thigh muscle;tibialis anterior muscle","","","","","","","24-25 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Root cause analysis using artificial intelligence","A. Chigurupati; N. Lassar","Google X","2017 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS)","20170330","2017","","","1","5","A complex hardware system experiences several different types of failure modes when deployed in its field of use. Although each failure mode merits its very own root cause analysis, experience has shown us that a majority of root cause analyses require us to answer a very similar set of questions. These recurring questions often use very similar type of field data to be answered. For example, usage parameters such as hours of operation, total power cycles, vibration fatigue, etc. are used almost always while trying to figure out the failure mechanism. By taking advantage of this, we can automate the process of finding the most likely failure mechanism for a given failure mode. In the current work, we start by computing what we believe are parameters that are most relevant across all different types of failure modes. Once these parameters are computed, we will build a Bayesian Network to model the cause-effect relationship between the degradation parameters (cause) and failure modes(effect) that occur on the field. Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model which concisely describes the relationship between many random variables and their conditional independence via an acyclic directed graph. Once the topology of the Bayesian network is laid out by a domain expert, the conditional probabilities can be learnt from existing data, thereby completely describing the system using the notion of joint probabilities. Two real life field issues are used as examples to demonstrate the accuracy of the network once it is modelled and built.

This learning process requires annotations in conjunction with datasets to prepare training data. Ambient Assistive Living (AAL) is one application of pervasive and ubiquitous computing that focuses on providing support for individuals. A subset of AAL solutions exist which model and recognize activities/behaviors to provide assistive services. This paper introduces an annotation mechanism for an AAL platform that can recognize, and provide alerts for, generic activities/behaviors. Previous annotation approaches have several limitations that make them unsuited for use in this platform. To address these deficiencies, an annotation solution relying on environmental NFC tags and smartphones has been devised. This paper details this annotation mechanism, its incorporation into the AAL platform and presents an evaluation focused on the efficacy of annotations produced. In this evaluation, the annotation mechanism was shown to offer reliable, low effort, secure and accurate annotations that are appropriate for learning user behaviors from datasets produced by this platform.

Next we construct positive and negative combinatorial test sets of configuration options and execute each test set with the selected dataset. Test effectiveness is measured using branch and mutation coverage. Our results suggest that when testing data mining algorithms: (1) larger datasets do not necessarily achieve higher coverage than smaller datasets, (2) test coverage increases progressively slower as test strength increases, and (3) branch coverage correlates well with mutation coverage.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6676-6; POD:978-1-5090-6677-3","10.1109/ICSTW.2017.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7899063","Branch coverage;Combinatorial Testing;Data mining;Input parameter modeling;Machine learning;Mutation testing","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Measurement;Software algorithms;Testing","","","","1","","","","","13-17 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although color palettes may come from different sources such as online crowd-sourcing, photographs and graphical designs, in this paper, we consider color palettes extracted from fine art collections, which we believe to be an abundant source of stylistic and unique color themes. We aim to capture color styles embedded in these collections by means of statistical models and to build practical applications upon these models. As artists often use their personal color themes in their paintings, making these palettes appear frequently in the dataset, we employed density estimation to capture the characteristics of palette data. Via density estimation, we carried out various predictions and interpolations on palettes, which led to promising applications such as photo-style exploration, real-time color suggestion, and enriched photo recolorization. It was, however, challenging to apply density estimation to palette data as palettes often come as unordered sets of colors, which make it difficult to use conventional metrics on them. To this end, we developed a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm to rearrange the colors in the palettes in a coherent order, which allows meaningful interpolation between color palettes. To confirm the performance of our model, we also conducted quantitative experiments on datasets of digitized paintings collected from the Internet and received favorable results.","1077-2626;10772626","","10.1109/TVCG.2017.2697948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7911336","Color palette;Colorization;Image color analysis;Machine learning","Art;Color;Estimation;Image color analysis;Interpolation;Painting;Real-time systems","","","","","","","","20170425","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This can be achieved by vertical scaling or horizontal scaling of attached resources. Live virtual machine migration of virtual machines across physical machines is a vertical scaling technique which facilitates resource hotspot mitigation, server consolidation, load balancing and system level maintenance. As live migration is triggered during heavy workload (hotspot) and its procedure takes significant amount of resources to iteratively copy memory pages from source to destination, it affects the performance of other running VMs hosted on the source as well as destination physical machine (PM). Hence to avoid such performance interference effects it is necessary to trigger the migration procedure at such a point where sufficient amount of resources will be available to all the running VMs and to the migrating procedure. It is also important to select such a VM which will produce less performance interference at the source and destination. This paper presents an intelligent decision maker to trigger the migration in such a way that it avoids the said performance interference effects. It predicts the future workload for early detection of overloads and accordingly triggers the migration procedure. It also models the migration procedure to calculate performance parameters and interference parameters which are used in the decision of selection of a VM. Experimental results show that it is able to increase the performance by 45%-50% for network intensive workloads and 25%-30% for CPU, memory intensive workloads when compared with traditional method. It improves the performance by 35%-40% for network intensive workloads and 15%-20% for CPU, memory intensive workloads when compared with Sandpiper method.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5544-9; POD:978-1-5090-5545-6","10.1109/ICCE.2017.7889244","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889244","live virtual machine migration;machine learning;resource provisioning;workload prediction","Conferences;Consumer electronics;Interference;Memory management;Predictive models;Throughput;Virtual machining","computer centres;resource allocation;virtual machines","horizontal scaling;intelligent decision maker;live virtual machine migration;load balancing;prediction based dynamic resource provisioning;resource hotspot mitigation;resource utilization;server consolidation;system level maintenance;vertical scaling;virtualized data centers;virtualized environments","","","","","","","8-10 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Any downtime due to these devices, even for a few minutes, may result in major business impact. There are many proactive event management systems/products which can monitor their health and alert on device failure. However, predicting failure with sufficient lead time still remains a challenging problem. Event management systems take system log messages and simple network management protocol (SNMP) traps as inputs and typically use rule based framework to generate network events. In this paper we discuss how we can use event data alone to build predictive model for device failures. Here all event data is generated by an event management tool. Event data volume is substantially less compared to full system log data. Also, these network devices fail rarely. Lower volume of event data enables us collect historical data for longer durations and thus collect decent number of failure samples over time which we can use for training and validation. We present a prediction model for failure events based on event sequence data. We have introduced new stratified sampling techniques along with a new feature engineering method using sliding time windows on event data. Experiments show that for rare device failure events like the load balancers it suffices to use event data to model device failures instead of using raw system log data. We have evaluated binary classification algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). Experimental results show that with the proper noise cleanup technique and model tuning we can achieve precision of 77% and recall of 67% for the failure predictions of network devices only from event data.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.171","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917199","Big Data;Failure Prediction;Machine Learning;Network;SVM","Lead;Monitoring;Predictive models;Tools;Training;Training data","","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However the issue of islanding needs to be comprehensively understood and managed given a challenging scenario ahead. This demands transition towards predictive approaches rather than the prevalent reactive ones for island detection and system management. The present work describes a machine learning based preemptive islanding detection module designed on a Raspberry Pi microcomputer for issuing advance alert to grid-interfaced solar photovoltaic inverters in the event of an imminent islanding situation and triggering the subsequent action. The module can activate a timely change in the inverter's operating mode by detecting precursors to accidental islanding, before the utility relay can trip a circuit breaker. Thus an intentional island can be maintained with acceptable power quality after the modechanging operation. The module can also issue a shut-down command to the inverter's control in order to completely avoid an unintentional island formation. Preliminary tests on an islanding precursor, discovered in simulation and on real laboratory-based network, have been presented. The precursor is simulated on a modified IEEE feeder and the online classification accuracy and speed indicate promising potential as a field-level prototype.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8888-7; POD:978-1-4673-8889-4; USB:978-1-4673-8887-0","10.1109/PEDES.2016.7914422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914422","Classification algorithms;Inverters;Islanding;Machine learning;Relays","Data models;Inverters;Islanding;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Power quality;Relays","","","","","","","","","14-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An adaptive pursuit strategy has been proposed in order to overcome this problem by enabling the transmitter through a reinforcement learning method to select the best part of the spectrum dynamically and without prior knowledge of the channel.

Experimental results are encouraging: on the ISIC Archive dataset, the proposed method achieves a sensitivity value of 78.66%, which is significantly higher than the current state of the art on that dataset.","","Electronic:978-0-88986-990-5; POD:978-1-5090-4908-0","10.2316/P.2017.852-053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7893267","Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep Learning;Machine Learning;Medical Decision Support Systems;Medical Image Analysis;Skin Lesions","Malignant tumors;Medical diagnostic imaging;Skin","","","","","","","","","20-21 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Detection of TLE from neuroimaging data is a challenging task. In many cases, patients with findings from standard clinical examination do not show any identifiable abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we propose a method to detect TLE from structural connectivity of temporal lobe structures, using an integration of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), graph theory analysis, and machine learning tools. To this end, first, we apply probabilistic tractography to extract white matter fibers and generate weighted structural connectivity graphs of 17 TLE patients and 17 healthy control subjects. Machine learning of graph theoretical measures are then used to classify TLE patients and control subjects. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, we show that graph theory measures used in logistic regression classifiers achieve accuracy in the range of 76% to 91% for the classification of the 34 subjects into the TLE and control groups. The results suggest that machine learning of the graph theoretical metrics derived from DTI-based networks of temporal lobe regions may be used for the diagnosis of TLE patients. Such a method may improve diagnostic assessment, especially in patients without obvious abnormalities in the conventional, anatomical neuroimaging examinations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3452-9; POD:978-1-5090-3453-6","10.1109/ICBME.2016.7890924","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890924","diffusion tensor imaging (DTI);graph theory;logistic regression classifier;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);probabilistic tractography;structural connectivity network;temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)","Diffusion tensor imaging;Epilepsy;Hippocampus;Logistics;Measurement","biodiffusion;biomedical MRI;feature extraction;medical disorders;medical image processing;regression analysis","DTI-based networks;TLE patient diagnosis;anatomical neuroimaging examinations;diffusion tensor imaging;graph theory analysis;leave-one-out cross-validation;logistic regression classifiers;machine learning tools;magnetic resonance imaging;neuroimaging data;probabilistic tractography;structural connectivity;temporal lobe epilepsy detection;white matter fiber extraction","","","","","","","24-25 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is used in almost all fields of the modern science and techniques. Applications of this technology is widespread: from architecture and design, to Biomedicine and aerospace. Despite its popularity, the process of additive 3D printing usually takes a while. During this process we need to be sure that the printed object stays static, besides, we need to control the absence of contamination on the print head and print defects. In this paper we propose a solution to the problem of detecting collisions in the additive process of 3D printing through the development of a universal system of visual control. Technical process control is carried out by the introduction of visual feedback. We have described two methods, which are used in computer vision for recognition: it is the machine learning and tracking based on singular points. The joint use of these two techniques provides improved quality of collision detection. During this research we have developed two types of the labels — sealed labels and superficial labels. The relevance of this development is confirmed by the possibility of obtaining economic benefits from its integration, by reducing the amount of consumables in case of collisions. It is especially true in industries that use expensive printed materials.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4865-6; POD:978-1-5090-4866-3","10.1109/EIConRus.2017.7910849","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7910849","3D printing;machine learning;sealed labels;superficial labels introduction;to control the position of printed;tracking based on singular points;universal system of visual control","Computer vision;MATLAB;Printers;Process control;Three-dimensional printing;Visualization","","","","","","","","","1-3 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to monitor a person's daily activity level can inform self-management of physical activity and related interventions.

In this work, we present ActivityAware, an application on the Amulet wrist-worn device that measures daily activity levels (sedentary, moderate and vigorous) of individuals, continuously and in real-time. The app implements an activity-level detection model, continuously collects acceleration data on the Amulet, classifies the current activity level, updates the day's accumulated time spent at that activity level, logs the data for later analysis, and displays the results on the screen. We developed an activity-level detection model using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We trained our classifiers using data from a user study, where subjects performed the following physical activities: sit, stand, lay down, walk and run. With 10-fold cross validation and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross validation, we obtained preliminary results that suggest accuracies up to 98%, for n=14 subjects. Testing the ActivityAware app revealed a projected battery life of up to 4 weeks before needing to recharge.

At the beginning of the training, the system assumes every attribute (feature) as a useless feature and then uses a concept of feature attenuating gate to select useful features. The learning process opens the gates or closes them more tightly based on utility of the features. Our system can discard derogatory and indifferent attributes and select the useful ones.

Due to poor picture quality, there is a large restriction on recognizing any object. Pattern recognition is exceedingly difficult not only in computer image processing but even in human eyes. Numerous researchers have attempted to apply various types of average filters to sonar images, and have also removed noise by using multiple images in succession. However, each of the algorithms has a limitation in that the resolution of the image itself is degraded or the image of the object is difficult to remove noise. Finally, We performed sonar image noise reduction with the auto-encoder algorithm based on convolutional neural network, which as recently been attracting attention. With the algorithm, we obtained sonar images of superior quality with only a single continuous image. We simply learned a ton of sonar images in a neural network of auto-encoder structures, and then we could get the results by injecting the original sonar images.

The objective is to develop an early warning surveillance system (framework) that can predict epidemic dengue to improve current passive surveillance system available in Malaysia. Basically, the framework introduced data harvesting process from multiple sources as input, data pre-processing using data aggregator and filtering engine, storing large data in repository, analytic engine for analysis and processing the large data, and presentation of the information to the users. The data harvested from two major sources such as weather or flood information, and social media such as build development and dengue symptom using system API, SOAP and others. The data aggregator will aggregate the data from three different types of data such as structured, semi-structured and unstructured data to be stored into the semi-structured database such as MongoDB and NoSQL. The data parse to the filtering engine for filtering and cleaning the data sources using suitable keywords prior to store it in the large data repository. After that, the large data will be processed and analyzed using algorithm or mathematical calculation to determine the expected dengue cases. Then, the processed information will be presented to the users in a form of web or mobile application and other method, for example, short message service (SMS).

The probability of its occurrence is usually dominated by the photovoltaic penetration however, as a direct consequence of this, load-inverter dynamic interactions alongside grid-side disturbances can also lead to anomalous instances that can become responsible for accidental island creation and one such anomaly has been described in this work. Given such dynamic behaviours occurring on photovoltaic inverter-integrated distribution feeders, threshold based classical islanding detection can not suffice and hence machine learning based techniques have began to be researched and adopted. However the orientation can be directed towards predictive approaches leveraging knowledge extraction from huge event data available in smart grids. Furthermore, unsupervised learning can be explored for real-time applications to enable self-learning and acting systems. This paper presents preliminary results of application of a self-organizing map neural network for preemptive detection of unintentional islanding by classifying the discovered islanding precursor from other power system events. Classification of a three phase short-circuit fault at the point of common coupling was found to be invariant to input feature reduction however the same gives contrasting results for the other two test cases investigated.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5384-1; POD:978-1-5090-5385-8","10.1109/UPCON.2016.7894680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7894680","Inverters;islanding;machine learning;power system;unsupervised learning","Inverters;Islanding;Load modeling;Power system dynamics;Unsupervised learning;Voltage control","learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;self-organising feature maps;smart power grids","accidental island creation;distributed solar photovoltaic generation;distribution network;dynamic behaviours;feature reduction;grid-side disturbances;high solar PV penetration distribution feeders;islanding detection;islanding precursor;load-inverter dynamic interactions;machine learning;photovoltaic inverter-integrated distribution feeders;photovoltaic penetration;power system events;predictive detection;preemptive detection;probability;self-organizing map neural network;smart grids;three phase short-circuit fault;unintentional islanding;unsupervised learning","","","","","","","9-11 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a super resolution reconstruction algorithm based on the combination of compressed sensing and depth perception neural networks. The algorithm originally makes use of a double pyramid of images, built starting from the input image itself, to extract the dictionary patches, and employs a regression based method to directly map the low-resolution (LR) input patches into their related high-resolution (HR) output patches. With the integration of deep neural network architecture and the compressive sensing theory, the robustness will be enhanced. Experiments on natural images show that the proposed algorithm outperforms some of the state-of-the-art algorithm in terms of peak signal to noise ratio, mean square error and structural similarity index.","","DVD:978-1-5090-1064-6; Electronic:978-1-5090-1066-0; POD:978-1-5090-1067-7; Paper:978-1-5090-1065-3","10.1109/CESYS.2016.7889920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7889920","Image super resolution;compressed sensing;machine learning;spatial processing","Compressed sensing;Image reconstruction;Machine learning;Neural networks;Spatial resolution;Training","compressed sensing;data visualisation;image recognition;image reconstruction;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture","compressed sensing;deep learning model;degraded images;depth perception neural network architecture;dictionary patch extraction;high resolution image;high-resolution output patches;image acquisition;image double pyramid;image super-resolution reconstruction;image visualization;input image;low-resolution input patches;mean square error;peak signal to noise ratio;regression based method;scene recognition;structural similarity index","","","","","","","21-22 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although some form of security mechanisms like authentication and encryption have been provided on platforms such as Android, these alone cannot mitigate all the forms of threats. Thus, the need for an intrusion detection system for smartphones has become immensely important. In this project, we capitalize on earlier approaches of host-based intrusion detection systems and behavior-based intrusion detection systems for Android smartphones to design and implement a host-based, behavior-based passive intrusion detection system, Protego, for Android smartphones. There are two versions - static and dynamic, each with its own novel approach. The static version of Protego improves predictive performance by implementing feature reduction, thus increasing classifier accuracy significantly. The novelty of dynamic approach is that it analyzes live traffic with a minimum delay (in the order of milliseconds). This opens up a variety of use cases for our system, especially in the business world where information security on smartphones is of utmost importance. We have illustrated this by also extending Protego to devise a solution for BYOD (bring your own device), a growing trend in the corporate world, by using the IDS to detect other malicious activities like peer-to-peer traffic from torrent clients.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1338-8; POD:978-1-5090-1339-5","10.1109/CAST.2016.7914972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7914972","Android;Information Security;Intrusion Detection System;Machine Learning;Protego","Androids;Classification algorithms;Intrusion detection;Principal component analysis;Smart phones;Training","","","","","","","","","19-21 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our model, we add mechanical features of automotive parts that are excluded in previous works, but can be differentiated by drivers' driving behaviors. We design the model that uses significant features through feature selection to reduce the time cost of feature processing and improve the detection performance. Further, we enrich the feature set by deriving statistical features such as mean, median, and standard deviation. This minimizes the effect of fluctuation of feature values per driver and finally generates the reliable model. We also analyze the effect of the size of sliding window on performance to detect the time point when the detection becomes reliable and to inform owners the theft event as soon as possible.

Moreover, the anticipated performance gain of a 3-D NoC-enabled many-core chip may be compromised due to the potential failures of through-silicon-vias that are predominantly used as vertical interconnects in a 3-D IC. To address these problems, we propose a machine-learning-inspired predictive design methodology for energy-efficient and reliable many-core architectures enabled by 3-D integration.

We focus on using such data to detect and localize potholes on multi-lane roads. Extracting information from aggregated vehicle data is challenging due to undersampling sensors, sensor mobility, asynchronous sensor operation, sensor noise, vehicle and road heterogeneity, and GPS position error. GPS position error is particularly problematic in multi-lane environments since the position error is generally larger than standard lane widths. In this paper, we investigate these issues and develop a crowdsourced system to detect and localize potholes in multi-lane environments using accelerometer data from embedded vehicle sensors. Our crowdsourced system reduces the required network bandwidth by determining road incline and bank angle information in each vehicle to filter acceleration components that do not correspond to pothole conditions.

These algorithms obtain vector representation for the nodes of the graph in R<sup>n</sup> while encoding information about each node's context. Such representational algorithms can be used to preprocess graph input for a variety of graph-based machine learning algorithms such as classification, link prediction etc. In our work, we introduce a distributed version of one such algorithm which can learn node representations from large scale distributed graphs using Apache Spark. Our algorithm is fast, scalable and supports online training for learning representations.

There are so many peoples all over the world who are suffering from diabetes and still undiagnosed. Many researchers have developed computational methods for diabetes diagnosis but those systems are not widely applicable and reliable because these methods are tested and trained on single dataset. Considering the global nature of diabetes there is need of a method which is tested trained and validated on all type of datasets or on all the available dataset. No such method have been still developed which is tested, trained and validated on different dataset.

Many existing methods learn a similarity measure by projecting the raw feature to a latent subspace to make the same target's distance smaller than different targets' distances. However, the same targets captured in different camera views should hold the same intrinsic attributes while different targets should hold different intrinsic attributes. Projecting all the data to the same subspace would cause loss of such an information and comparably poor discriminability. To address this problem, in this paper, a method based on elastic projections is proposed to learn a pairwise similarity measure for person reidentification. The proposed model learns two projections, positive projection and negative projection, which are both representative and discriminative. The representability refers to: for the same targets captured in two camera views, the positive projection can bridge the corresponding appearance variation and represent the intrinsic attributes of the same targets, while for the different targets captured in two camera views, the negative projection can explore and utilize the different attributes of different targets. The discriminability means that the intraclass distance should become smaller than its original distance after projection, while the interclass distance becomes larger on the contrary, which is the elastic property of the proposed model. In this case, prior information of the original data space is used to give guidance for the learning phase; more importantly, similar targets (but not the same) are effectively reduced by forcing the same targets to become more similar and different targets to become more distinct. The proposed model is evaluated on three benchmark data sets, including VIPeR, GRID, and CUHK, and achieves better performance than other methods.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2602855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7896623","Machine learning;person reidentification;representative and discriminative;video surveillance.","Cameras;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Lighting;Measurement;Robustness;Video surveillance","","","","","","","","20170412","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The vulnerability of a PUF against machine-learning attacks has been revealed. It has also been indicated that the output of a PUF is inverted from its normal output owing to the difference in environmental variations, such as the changes in power supply voltage and temperature. The resistance of a PUF against machine-learning attacks due to the difference in environmental variation has seldom been evaluated. The present study evaluated the resistance of an arbiter PUF against machine-learning attacks due to the difference in environmental variation. By performing an evaluation experiment using a simulation, the present study revealed that the resistance of an arbiter PUF against machine-learning attacks due to environmental variation was slightly improved. However, the present study also successfully predicted more than 95% of the outputs by increasing the number of learning cycles.

Hence, this paper proposes a novel dengue outbreak detection method that relies on delay permutation entropy (DPE) features extracted from daily weather data. Using data from Hong Kong between 2004 and 2015, 4383 daily DPE features have been extracted and analysed using machine learning techniques. The analysis results show that there is a strong correlation between dengue cases and rainfall DPE features. A comparison with predicted results generated from average monthly weather data, shows that the dengue outbreak detection results based on the DPE features, are up to 11% more accurate than those predicted from the monthly average data.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917200","DPE;Dengue fever;SVM;forecast;machine learning","Correlation;Entropy;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Temperature;Wind speed","","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes effective hammering sound analysis scheme, which delivers favourable defect detection performance under various noise situations. This work is inspired by the facts that hammering echo waveforms are noisy and redundant, while the underlying defect-induced patterns are anticipated to be sparse with respect to certain frequency bands. Grounded on such hypothesis, we introduce sparse coding approaches for hammering sound analysis so as to characterize representative patterns from corrupted echo signal. Particularly, there are two major steps in sparse coding: dictionary learning and codes generation. We investigated the two parts separately, allowing us to exploit contribution of each. Proposed approach is demonstrated with real-world data; furthermore, In order to validate noise robustness, echo condition assessment is performed under mismatch acoustic environments with varying noise intensities. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of our approach and even under extremely noisy scenario, i.e. -10dB, the system achieved 96% echo analysis accuracy. In addition, this paper also acts as a practical guide to select efficient sparse coding algorithms for real applications, not limited to hammering sound analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3202-0; POD:978-1-5090-3203-7","10.1109/SAS.2017.7894032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7894032","Non-destructive evaluation;impact-echo test;machine learning;signal processing;sparse coding","Acoustics;Concrete;Dictionaries;Encoding;Inspection;Noise measurement;Support vector machines","concrete;condition monitoring;echo;inspection;learning (artificial intelligence);signal denoising;structural acoustics;structural engineering computing","code generation;concrete structure condition assessment;corrupted echo signal;defect detection performance;defect-induced patterns;dictionary learning;echo condition assessment;frequency bands;hammering inspection;hammering sound analysis scheme;mismatch acoustic environments;noise intensities;noise robust hammering echo analysis;noise robustness;noisy-redundant hammering echo waveforms;sparse coding approach","","","","","","","13-15 March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address Hardly Reproducible Vulnerabilities (HRVs), security experts spend a significant amount of time, effort, and budget. Sometimes they do not succeed in the reproduction step and ignore some security failures. The exploitation of a vulnerability due to its irreproducibility may cause severe consequences. An efficient solution is to explore the behaviour of both hardly and easily reproducible security issues at the code level. We use linear regression techniques to build models based on the classical software complexity metrics and a set of attributes related to the environment of the system. The results show that the considered metrics and the vulnerability types do not have significant linear correlations with each other. Also, predicting the HRV-prone parts of large systems is a great help for security experts to focus their effort on the top-ranked vulnerable files. After identifying the suitable indicators based on linear regression, different machine learning techniques such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, C4.5 Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes are employed to build HRV prediction models. The Random Forest technique achieves the precision of 82% and recall of 84% to classify vulnerable files into HRV-prone or non HRV-prone files. We believe that the results encourage the use of software metrics for vulnerability prediction in some projects.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4379-8; POD:978-1-5090-4380-4","10.1109/PST.2016.7906955","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906955","Hardly Reproducible Vulnerability (HRV);Random Forest;Vulnerability;machine learning;security failure;software metrics","Correlation;Heart rate variability;Predictive models;Security;Software;Software metrics","","","","","","","","","12-14 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, we review prevailing works that employed the operant conditioning and machine learning strategies. Third, we present our past work on six stroke patients who underwent a BCI rehabilitation clinical trial with averaged accuracies of 79.8% during calibration and 69.5% across 18 online feedback sessions.

The results showed an increase in the amount of training data yielded improvements. Nevertheless, results of using limited preceding data showed a larger part of the improvement was due to the adaptive strategy and changing subject-specific models did not deteriorate the accuracies.

Such direct scheduling of vehicles can reduce waiting time and improve fairness, especially when the traffic volume in different lanes is imbalanced. The key challenge in such a design lies in determining appropriate size of groups with respect to real-time traffic conditions. To cope with this issue, we propose a neuro-fuzzy network-based grouping mechanism, where the network is trained using reinforcement learning technique. Also, vehicle groups are scheduled via a neuro-fuzzy network. Simulations using ns3 are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with similar works.

A linear discriminant analysis model was trained by grasps at a single force level using the natural grasping force to classify grasps generated by eight different levels of force. The results show that the grasping force significantly affects the accuracy of grasp classification such that a grasping force closer to the natural force achieves a higher accuracy.

Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based pBCI has become an important tool for real-time analysis of brain activity, since it could potentially provide, covertly - without distracting the user from the main task - and objectively - not affected by the subjective judgement of an observer or the user itself - information about the operator cognitive state. Results: different examples of pBCI applications in operational environments and new adaptive interface solutions have been presented and described. In addition, a general overview regarding the correct use of machine learning techniques (e.g. which algorithm to use, common pitfalls to avoid, etc.) in the pBCI field has been provided. Conclusion: despite recent innovations on algorithms and neuro-technology, pBCI systems are not completely ready to enter the market yet, mainly due to limitations of the EEG electrodes technology, and algorithms reliability and capability in real settings. Significance: high complexity and safety critical systems (e.g. airplanes, ATM interfaces) should adapt their behaviors and functionality accordingly to the user's actual mental state.

It has been shown that Electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used as a trait for biometric systems. Previous studies have reported proper channels and features in resting states and mental tasks. However, since EEG signal is sensitive to emotion, the stability of reported features during emotional states is not well verified. Our goal is to investigate channels and features which have stable results regardless of emotional states. To this end, three experiments were designed: `training' and `testing' an identification system with 1) mixture of emotional states; 2) the same specific emotional states; 3) different emotional states. 1728 features were extracted which later construct the feature vector of each subject and then Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to classify the subjects. After selecting 5 best features, the Correct Classification Rate (CCR) is in the range of 88% to 99% for 3 experiments. Moreover, we found that features extracted from Gamma frequency band in Left-Posterior quarter of the brain have more stable and reliable information for human identification, regardless of emotional states, comparing to other features.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3452-9; POD:978-1-5090-3453-6","10.1109/ICBME.2016.7890964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7890964","Biometrics;EEG Signal Processing;Emotional States;Human Identification;Machine learning","Biometrics (access control);Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Frequency conversion;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","biometrics (access control);electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;signal classification;support vector machines","EEG signals;biometric systems;brain left-posterior quarter;correct classification rate;emotional states;feature extraction;gamma frequency band;human identification;support vector machine","","","","","","","24-25 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multimodal biometric systems combine more than one biometric trait to identify a person for enhanced security. The proposed Multimodal biometric system combines three biometric traits for individual authentication namely Face, Fingerprint and Voice and implements indexing algorithm for faster searching and recognition of a person. The fuzzy nature of biometric data and the presence of varied degree of dimensionality hinder present search algorithms depending on sorting.

Compressed sensing exploits the sparsity of images in a transform domain or dictionary to improve image recovery fromundersampledmeasurements. In the context of inverse problems in dynamic imaging, recent research has demonstrated the promise of sparsity and low-rank techniques. For example, the patches of the underlying data are modeled as sparse in an adaptive dictionary domain, and the resulting image and dictionary estimation from undersampled measurements is called dictionary-blind compressed sensing, or the dynamic image sequence is modeled as a sum of low-rank and sparse (in some transform domain) components (L+S model) that are estimated from limited measurements. In this work, we investigate a data-adaptive extension of the L+S model, dubbed LASSI, where the temporal image sequence is decomposed into a low-rank component and a component whose spatiotemporal (3D) patches are sparse in some adaptive dictionary domain. We investigate various formulations and efficient methods for jointly estimating the underlying dynamic signal components and the spatiotemporal dictionary from limited measurements. We also obtain efficient sparsity penalized dictionary-blind compressed sensing methods as special cases of our LASSI approaches. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance of LASSI schemes for dynamicmagnetic resonance image reconstruction from limited k-t space data compared to recent methods such as k-t SLR and L+S, and compared to the proposed dictionary-blind compressed sensing method.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2017.2650960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7812765","Dictionary learning;dynamic imaging;inverse problems;machine learning;magnetic resonanace imaging;nonconvex optimization;sparse representations;structured models","Adaptation models;Compressed sensing;Data models;Dictionaries;Image reconstruction;Magnetic resonance imaging","","","","","","","","20170110","May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to technology and processes changes, some of these spares become obsolete or dead inventory. Factories have huge dead inventory worth millions of dollars accumulating over time. This is due to lack of a scientific methodology to identify them and send the inventory back to the suppliers on a timely basis. The standard approach followed across industries to deal with this is to declare a part as dead if a part is not used for a set pre-defined period of time. This leads to accumulation of the dead parts over time and these parts cannot be sold back to the suppliers as it is too late as per contract agreement. Our main idea is that the time period for identifying a part as dead cannot be a fixed pre-defined duration across all parts. This time period should depend on various properties of the part like the historical consumption pattern of the part, type of part, how many machines this part is associated with, if this part is a preventive maintenance part etc. We have designed a predictive algorithm which predicts part obsolescence well in advance with reasonable accuracy thus helping save millions of dollars.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5880-8; POD:978-1-5090-5881-5","10.1109/iThings-GreenCom-CPSCom-SmartData.2016.178","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917206","big data;machine learning;obsolete inventory;supply chain analytics","Computational modeling;Contracts;Decision trees;Maintenance engineering;Optimization;Predictive models;Probability distribution","","","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have shown promise for the problem of radio-isotope identification, their ability to identify and quantify mixtures of radio-isotopes has not been studied. Because machine learning algorithms use abstract features of the spectrum, such as the shape of overlapping peaks and Compton continuum, they are a natural choice for analyzing radio-isotope mixtures.

However, the amount of labeled data in many real-world applications is insufficient, so establishing a prediction model is impossible. Transfer learning has recently emerged as a solution to this problem. It exploits the knowledge accumulated in auxiliary domains to help construct prediction models in a target domain with inadequate training data. Most existing transfer learning methods solve classification tasks; only a few are devoted to regression problems. In addition, the current methods ignore the inherent phenomenon of information granularity in transfer learning. In this study, granular computing techniques are applied to transfer learning. Three granular fuzzy regression domain adaptation methods to determine the estimated values for a regression target are proposed to address three challenging cases in domain adaptation. The proposed granular fuzzy regression domain adaptation methods change the input and/or output space of the source domain’s model using space transformation, so that the fuzzy rules are more compatible with the target data.

We propose a new algorithm TSA (Two-Step Approximation) that balances between exploration and exploitation efficiently while enjoying the same computational complexity as existing approximations. Finally, we empirically show the value of balancing between exploration and exploitation in both toy and real-world datasets where our method outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4545-7; POD:978-1-5090-4546-4; USB:978-1-5090-4544-0","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2016.7906056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7906056","Machine learning;active learning;graph-based learning;probabilistic model;semi-supervised learning","Approximation algorithms;Covariance matrices;Error analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Minimization;Prediction algorithms;Probabilistic logic","","","","","","","","","7-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Improving intrusion detection system detection accuracy and reducing learning time by combining selected features selection and parameters optimization","B. W. Masduki; K. Ramli","Department of Electrical Engineering, Universitas Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia","2016 6th IEEE International Conference on Control System, Computing and Engineering (ICCSCE)","20170406","2016","","","397","402","IDS capability in detecting an attacks is highly dependent on the accuracy of attack detection which usually is represented by the least number of false alarms. In this work we simplify the large network dataset by selecting only the most important and influential features in the dataset to increase the IDS performance and accuracy. The creation of smaller dataset is aimed to decrease time for training the SVM machine learning in detecting attacks. This work designed and built a prototype of IDS equipped with machine learning models to improve accuracy in detecting DoS and R2L attacks. Machine-learning algorithms is added to recognize specific characteristics of the attack at the national Internet network. New methods and techniques developed by combining feature selection and parameter optimization algorithm are then implemented in the Internet monitoring system. Through experiment and analysis, we find out that for DOS attacks the proposed approach improved accuracy for the detection and increased in speed on training and testing phase. Even though limited and appropriate selection of parameters slightly decrease the accuracy in the detection of R2L attacks but our approach significantly increases the speed of the training and testing process.","","CD:978-1-5090-1177-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-1178-0; POD:978-1-5090-1179-7","10.1109/ICCSCE.2016.7893606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7893606","attack;intrusion detection system;machine-learning;support vector machine;threat","Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Payloads;Support vector machines;Training","Internet;computer network security;feature selection","DOS attacks;IDS capability;IDS performance;Internet monitoring system;R2L attack detection;SVM machine learning;attack detection accuracy;feature selection;intrusion detection system detection accuracy improvement;learning time reduction;machine-learning algorithms;national Internet network;parameter optimation algorithm","","","","","","","25-27 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
