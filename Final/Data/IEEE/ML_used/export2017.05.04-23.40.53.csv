ELM is a new approach for learning the parameters of the hidden layers of a multilayer neural network (as the multilayer perceptron or the radial basis function neural network). Its main advantage is the lower computational cost, which is especially relevant when dealing with many patterns defined in a high-dimensional space. This brief proposes a Bayesian approach to ELM, which presents some advantages over other approaches: it allows the introduction of a priori knowledge; obtains the confidence intervals (CIs) without the need of applying methods that are computationally intensive, e.g., bootstrap; and presents high generalization capabilities. Bayesian ELM is benchmarked against classical ELM in several artificial and real datasets that are widely used for the evaluation of machine learning algorithms. Achieved results show that the proposed approach produces a competitive accuracy with some additional advantages, namely, automatic production of CIs, reduction of probability of model overfitting, and use of a priori knowledge.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2103956","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692833","Bayesian;extreme learning machine;multilayer perceptron;radial basis function","Artificial neural networks;Bayesian methods;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Optimization;Training","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;radial basis function networks","Bayesian extreme learning machine;confidence interval;multilayer neural network;multilayer perceptron;radial basis function","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Bayes Theorem;Computer Simulation;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","49","","18","","20110120","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The algorithm has been developed in an open source-based environment. The algorithm was tested on a 13-year dataset (1995-2008). This paper compares the algorithm and validates its accuracy and efficiency with different platforms. Nearly 80% accuracy and 88% positive predictive value and sensitivity were recorded for the algorithm.

"Machine learning approaches for the investigation of features beyond seed matches affecting miRNA binding","C. Gao; J.

Although it has been demonstrated that the regulation is through partial binding of the seed region of a miRNA and its targets, the mechanism of this process is not fully discovered. Some biological experiments have shown that even perfect base pairing in the seed region does not always guarantee the down-regulation of the targets. It has been suspected that some other characteristics of mRNAs may facilitate the regulation. An earlier study (1) has identified five additional features beyond seed matching that seem to significantly affect repressions. However, the observation that evolutionally conserved targets have shown significantly more destabilization comparing to nonconserved targets with the same score using these five features leads to the suspicion that additional features remain to be discovered. This motivates our study to identify additional features that may differentiate down-regulated mRNAs (positive set) from those not down-regulated ones (negative set) provided both sets have perfect seed matches with miRNAs. Our first attempt to search for different sequence motifs around seed site regions in the two different sets is not successful. We further construct a set of 18 sequence/structure features based on domain knowledge and evaluate them individually and jointly. By employing feature selection techniques in combination with several classification methods, we have been able to identify a subset of features that may facilitate the down-regulation of mRNAs. Our results can be incorporated into target prediction algorithms to further improve target specificities.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-8307-5; POD:978-1-4244-8306-8","10.1109/BIBM.2010.5706564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5706564","Classification;Feature Selection;MicroRNA Target","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","bioinformatics;data acquisition;feature extraction;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);macromolecules;molecular biophysics","RNA motifs;RNA sequence;RNA structure;data collection;domain knowledge;feature selection technique;machine learning;microRNA binding;proteins;target prediction algorithms","","0","","14","","","18-21 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The behavior of each malware on an emulated (sandbox) environment will be automatically analyzed and will generate behavior reports. These reports will be preprocessed into sparse vector models for further machine learning (classification). The classifiers used in this research are k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Naïve Bayes, J48 Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MlP).

Garden path (GP) sentence is a special sentence structure in which processing breakdown and backtracking are involved in the machine decoding. Faced with GP sentence, learners have to make original misinterpretation linger even after reanalysis has occurred, and have to face the fact that initial interpretations of GP sentence are often incorrect and do not correspond to the final output. On the basis of computational skills of N-S flowchart, recursive transition network, and well-formed substring table, this paper highlights the effects on syntactic processing in garden-path sentences when context-free grammar (CFG) driven ML system is introduced. There are two main conclusions to be drawn from the above discussion. Firstly, CFG-driven ML system can help SLL learners better understand the GP sentences in second language even no rich lingual environment is provided. Secondly, the hybrid knowledge, e.g. grammatical, cognitive and semantic information, needs to be integrated into ML system to help SLL learners achieve the ""good enough"" results in decoding GP sentences.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5392-4; POD:978-1-4244-5391-7","10.1109/CISE.2010.5676998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5676998","","Decoding;Electric breakdown;Flowcharts;Machine learning;Semantics;Support vector machines;Syntactics","computational linguistics;computer aided instruction;learning (artificial intelligence)","CFG;GP;ML;N-S flowchart;SLL;computational linguistics;context-free grammar;educational technologies;garden path;garden path sentences;machine decoding;machine learning;recursive transition network;second language learning;special sentence structure;syntactic processing","","0","","23","","","10-12 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although efforts have been devoted to the development of methodology for predicting PPIs and to construct protein interaction networks, the application of most existing methods is limited because of less and incomplete information. In the present work, we integrate multi-databases which contain protein information and apply for PPI prediction and construction of the interaction network.

This trend combined with the growing need to run machine learning (ML) algorithms on massive datasets has led to an increased interest in implementing ML algorithms on MapReduce. However, the cost of implementing a large class of ML algorithms as low-level MapReduce jobs on varying data and machine cluster sizes can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose SystemML in which ML algorithms are expressed in a higher-level language and are compiled and executed in a MapReduce environment. This higher-level language exposes several constructs including linear algebra primitives that constitute key building blocks for a broad class of supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms. The algorithms expressed in SystemML are compiled and optimized into a set of MapReduce jobs that can run on a cluster of machines. We describe and empirically evaluate a number of optimization strategies for efficiently executing these algorithms on Hadoop, an open-source MapReduce implementation.

Effective selection of optimization options is a challenging task. Recent work has shown that machine learning can be used to select the best compiler optimization options for a given program. Machine learning techniques rely upon selecting features which represent a program in the best way. The quality of these features is critical to the performance of machine learning techniques. Previous work on feature selection for program representation is based on code size, mostly executed parts, parallelism and memory access patterns with-in a program. Spatial based information-how instructions are distributed with-in a program-has never been studied to generate features for the best compiler options selection using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we present a framework that address how to capture the spatial information with-in a program and transform it to features for machine learning techniques. An extensive experimentation is done using the SPEC2006 and MiBench benchmark applications. We compare our work with the IBM Milepost-gcc framework. The Milepost work gives a comprehensive set of features for using machine learning techniques for the best compiler options selection problem. Results show that the performance of machine learning techniques using spatial based features is better than the performance using the Milepost framework. With 66 available compiler options, we are also able to achieve 70% of the potential speed up obtained through an iterative compilation.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708970","auto-tuning;compiler optimization machine learning;compiler option selection;graph similarity","Benchmark testing;Histograms;Machine learning;Optimization;Predictive models;Program processors;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);optimising compilers","MiBench benchmark;SPEC2006;compiler optimization;machine learning;spatial based feature generation;spatial based information","","4","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data were sampled uniformly randomly in fish orientation. Feature-, decision-, and collaborative-fusion algorithms were then developed and tested using support vector machines (SVMs) as the underlying classifiers. Decision fusion was implemented by cascading two levels of support vectors machines. Collaborative fusion was implemented by using SVM outputs to estimate confidence levels and performing weighted averaging of probabilities computed from each view with feedback from other views. Collaborative fusion performed as well or better than the others, and did so without requiring assumptions about view geometry. In addition to a comparison between classification algorithms and feature transformations, two data collection geometries were explored, including random observation geometries.

The quadratic demand in memory for storing kernel matrices makes it impossible for training on million-size data. Sophisticated decomposition algorithms have been proposed to efficiently train SVMs using only important examples, which ideally are the final support vectors (SVs). However, the ability of the decomposition method is limited to large-scale applications where the number of SVs is still too large for a computer's capacity. From another perspective, the large number of SVs slows down SVMs in the testing phase, making it impractical for many applications. In this paper, we introduce the integration of a vector combination scheme to simplify the SVM solution into an incremental working set selection for SVM training. The main objective of the integration is to maintain a minimal number of final SVs, bringing a minimum resource demand and faster training time. Consequently, the learning machines are more compact and run faster thanks to the small number of vectors included in their solution. Experimental results on large benchmark datasets shows that the proposed condensed SVMs achieve both training and testing efficiency while maintaining a generalization ability equivalent to that of normal SVMs.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2079947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5605254","Decomposition algorithm;Kernel method;optimization;reduced set method;support vector machine","Complexity theory;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;support vector machines","SVM training;condensed vector machines;decomposition method;kernel matrices;kernel-based methods;learning fast machine;support vector machines;vector combination scheme","","5","","34","","20101018","Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An essential task for solving this problem with coarse-grained models is to deduce effective interaction potentials. The development and evaluation of new energy functions is critical to accurately modeling the properties of biological macromolecules. Knowledge-based mean force potentials are derived from statistical analysis of proteins of known structures. Current knowledge-based potentials are almost in the form of weighted linear sum of interaction pairs. In this study, a class of novel nonlinear knowledge-based mean force potentials is presented. The potential parameters are obtained by nonlinear classifiers, instead of relative frequencies of interaction pairs against a reference state or linear classifiers. The support vector machine is used to derive the potential parameters on data sets that contain both native structures and decoy structures. Five knowledge-based mean force Boltzmann-based or linear potentials are introduced and their corresponding nonlinear potentials are implemented. They are the DIH potential (single-body residue-level Boltzmann-based potential), the DFIRE-SCM potential (two-body residue-level Boltzmann-based potential), the FS potential (two-body atom-level Boltzmann-based potential), the HR potential (two-body residue-level linear potential), and the T32S3 potential (two-body atom-level linear potential). Experiments are performed on well-established decoy sets, including the LKF data set, the CASP7 data set, and the Decoys “R”Us data set. The evaluation metrics include the energy Z score and the ability of each potential to discriminate native structures from a set of decoy structures. Experimental results show that all nonlinear potentials significantly outperform the corresponding Boltzmann-based or linear potentials, and the proposed discriminative framework is effective in developing - - knowledge-based mean force potentials. The nonlinear potentials can be widely used for ab initio protein structure prediction, model quality assessment, protein docking, and other challenging problems in computational biology.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2010.86","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567096","Mean force potential;nonlinear potential;protein docking.;protein structure prediction","Computational biology;Force;IEEE Potentials;Knowledge based systems;Proteins;Support vector machines;Training","Boltzmann machines;ab initio calculations;biology computing;knowledge engineering;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;proteins;support vector machines","DFIRE-SCM potential;DIH potential;ab initio protein structure;amino acid sequences;coarse-grained models;computational biology;knowledge-based mean force potentials;machine learning;mean force Boltzmann potential;molecular biology;nonlinear classifiers;proteins;statistical analysis;support vector machine;two-body atom-level Boltzmann-based potential;two-body atom-level linear potential;two-body residue-level linear potential","Artificial Intelligence;Computational Biology;Knowledge Bases;Nonlinear Dynamics;Protein Conformation;Protein Folding;Proteins","6","","65","","20100909","March-April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this context, human interaction and communication have become a focus of attention and a hot topic of research. A crucial element in human relations is the evaluation of individuals with respect to facial traits, what is called a first impression. Studies based on appearance have suggested that personality can be expressed by appearance and the observer may use such information to form judgments. In the context of rapid facial evaluation, certain personality traits seem to have a more pronounced effect on the relations and perceptions inside groups. The perception of dominance has been shown to be an active part of social roles at different stages of life, and even play a part in mate selection. The aim of this paper is to study to what extent this information is learnable from the point of view of computer science. Specifically we intend to determine if judgments of dominance can be learned by machine learning techniques. We implement two different descriptors in order to assess this. The first is the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the second is a probabilistic appearance descriptor based on the frequencies of grouped binary tests. State of the art classification rules validate the performance of both descriptors, with respect to the prediction task. Experimental results show that machine learning techniques can predict judgments of dominance rather accurately (accuracies up to 90%) and that the HOG descriptor may characterize appropriately the information necessary for such task.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9139-1; Electronic:978-1-4244-9141-4; POD:978-1-4244-9140-7","10.1109/FG.2011.5771377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771377","","Accuracy;Context;Face;Histograms;Humans;Machine learning;Support vector machines","face recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","HOG;dominance judgement;facial trait;first impression;histogram of oriented gradient;human communication;human interaction;human relation;machine learning;multimodal device;personality trait;probabilistic appearance descriptor;rapid facial evaluation","","1","","22","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Not all approaches are applicable for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems, however, which have stringent accuracy, timeliness, and development complexity requirements. Supervised machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are a promising approach to address time complexity concerns of adaptive enterprise DRE systems. Likewise, ANNs address the development complexity of adaptive DRE systems by ensuring that adaptations are appropriate for the operating environment. This paper empirically evaluates the accuracy and timeliness of the ANN machine learning technique for environments on which it has been trained. Our results show ANNs are highly accurate in determining correct adaptations and provide predictable time complexity, e.g., with response times less than 6 μseconds.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4196-9; POD:978-1-4244-8148-4","10.1109/IPTC.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5663384","","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Complexity theory;Machine learning;Quality of service;Receivers;Time factors","adaptive systems;business data processing;distributed processing;embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;quality of service","ANN;QoS;adaptive DRE system;artificial neural networks;end-to-end quality of service;enterprise DRE system;enterprise distributed real-time and embedded system;supervised machine learning","","0","","7","","","28-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address these issues, we propose a high performance lithographic hotspot detection flow with ultra-fast speed and high fidelity. It consists of a novel set of hotspot signature definitions and a hierarchically refined detection flow with powerful machine learning kernels, ANN (artificial neural network) and SVM (support vector machine).

Images are captured from Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stained tissue slides using light microscope as it is commonly used approach for diagnosis of TB. Then colour image segmentation is used to locate the regions correspond to the bacilli. After that, affine moment invariants are extracted to represent the segmented regions. These features are invariant under rotation, scale and translation, thus useful to represent the bacilli. Finally, a single layer feedforward neural network (SLFNN) trained by Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is used to detect and classify the features into three classes: `TB', `overlapped TB' and `non-TB'.

Advancement in other technology areas such as Global Positioning System (GPS) processors and single board computers have paved the way for a new development of smart video sensors. A need exists to be able to identify stationary objects, such as buildings, and register their location back to the GIS database. Furthermore, transmitting large image streams from remote locations would quickly use available band width (BW) precipitating the need for processing to occur at the sensor location. This paper addresses the problem of automatic target recognition. Utilizing an Adaptive Resonance Theory approach to cluster templates of target buildings processing and memory requirements can be significantly reduced allowing for processing at the sensor.

A mode can be min, max, + (input), (output), or nt (non-tabled). While the traditional table-all approach to tabling is good for finding all answers, mode-directed tabling is well suited to dynamic programming problems that require selective answers. In this paper, we present three application examples of mode-directed tabling, namely, (1) hydraulic system planning, a dynamic programming problem, (2) the Viterbi algorithm in PRISM, a probabilistic logic reasoning and learning system, and (3) constraint checking in evaluating Answer Set Programs (ASP). For the Viterbi application, the feature of enabling a cardinality limit in a table mode declaration plays an important role. For a PRISM program and a set of data, the explanations may be too large to be completely stored and the cardinality limit allows for Viterbi inference based on a subset of explanations. The mode nt, which specifies an argument that can participate in the computation of a tabled predicate but is never tabled either in subgoal or answer tabling, is useful in constraint checking for the Hamilton cycle problem encoded as an ASP. These examples demonstrate the usefulness of mode-directed tabling.","1082-3409;10823409","Electronic:978-0-7695-4263-8; POD:978-1-4244-8817-9","10.1109/ICTAI.2010.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5671409","","Dynamic programming;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Probabilistic logic;Valves;Viterbi algorithm","dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence)","Hamilton cycle;Viterbi algorithm;answer set program;constraint solving;dynamic programming;hydraulic system planning;machine learning;mode directed tabling;probabilistic logic reasoning","","0","","25","","","27-29 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As such, ALIDA is designed to track the decision history (interactions) of a user. This history is then utilized to enhance the user's decision-making process by allowing the user to return to previously visited search states, as well as providing suggestions of other search states that may be of interest based on past exploration modalities. The agent passes these suggestions (or decisions) back to an interactive visualization prototype, and these suggestions are used to guide the user, either by suggesting searches or changes to the visualization view.

Ranking helps find good services for applications that use services as building blocks. Unlike other ranking problems, the goodness of Internet service qualities is dependent upon multiple key features. The key features vary across different service categories and have unequally discriminative natures. This paper divides the ranking problem into four subtasks including categorizing services according to the service functionalities, identifying key features that determine the quality, denoising for feature measurement values and computing global ranking scores with multiple key features, which are cast into machine learning problems and solved using techniques classification, feature selection, clustering, and regression respectively. In particular, we propose in this paper an efficient dense-block based denoising method for subjective features, and a Supported Vector Regression based method for computing global ranking scores. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed approach can quantitatively identify the key features across service categories, discard noisy measurement values in 10 times faster, and compute the global ranking scores using multiple features with low mean squared errors for both linear and nonlinear ranking functions.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4189-1; POD:978-1-4244-8125-5","10.1109/SKG.2010.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5663502","Classification;Dense-block based denoising method;Internet service;Ranking;Supported vector regression","","Web services;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods","feature measurement values;feature selection;global ranking scores;low mean squared errors;machine learning;multiple key features;multiple service features;noisy measurement values;nonlinear ranking functions;rank Internet service quality;supported vector regression","","0","","25","","","1-3 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a new method to analyze the chaotic nature of VF using multiple feature extraction and machine learning techniques. Human cardiac arrest data was acquired from the Richmond Ambulance Authority. A Multiple-Domain Model (MDM), which utilizes time-series and wavelet features, was developed. We report two new time-series features that are predictive of countershock (CS) success. Support vector machines were used with a radial basis function to classify 56 CS, 21 successful and 35 unsuccessful, with an average accuracy of 83.9%.

Classification plays a vital role in many information management and retrieval tasks. Document classification, also known as document categorization, is the process of assigning a document to one or more predefined category labels. Classification is often posed as a supervised learning problem in which a set of labeled data is used to train a classifier which can be applied to label future examples. Document classification includes different parts such as text processing, feature extraction, feature vector construction and final classification. Thus improvement in each part should lead to better results in document classification. In this paper, we apply machine learning methods for automatic Persian news classification. In this regard, we first try to exert some language preprocess in Hamshahri dataset, and then we extract a feature vector for each news text by using feature weighting and feature selection algorithms. After that we train our classifier by support vector machine (SVM) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms. In Experiments, although both algorithms show acceptable results for Persian text classification, the performance of KNN is better in comparison to SVM.","","Electronic:978-89-88678-32-9; POD:978-1-4244-8599-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5713467","Hamshahri;KNN;SVM;feature selection;machine learning;text classification","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Text categorization","data mining;feature extraction;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;support vector machines;text analysis","Hamshahri dataset;K-nearest neighbor algorithm;automatic Persian text classification;automatic document classification;data mining;document categorization;document classification;feature extraction;feature selection algorithm;feature vector construction;feature weighting;information management;information retrieval;information technology;machine learning algorithm;supervised learning problem;support vector machine;text processing","","2","","20","","","Nov. 30 2010-Dec. 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In conventional text classification problems, it is assumed that the feature vectors extracted from the available documents are sufficient to learn good classifiers. However, this conventional approach is not likely to work for Twitter due to the limited number of characters on each tweet. From a higher level, each tweet can be viewed as an abbreviated abstraction of a long document, and we only have a partial observation of this document. To solve the problem caused by the partial observations, we introduce a novel domain adaption/transfer learning approach called Assisted Learning for Partial Observation (ALPOS). The basic idea is to use a large number of multi-labeled examples (source domain) to improve the learning on the partial observations (target domain). In particular, we learn a hidden, higher-level abstraction space, which is meaningful for the multi-labeled examples in the source domain. This is done by simultaneously minimizing the document reconstruction error and the error in a classification model learned in the hidden space by using known labels from the source domain. The partial observations in the target space are then mapped to the same hidden space for recovery and classification. We compare the performance of this method with existing approaches on synthetic data and the well-known Reuters-21578 dataset.

In this paper, we show how to build a highly relevant metric for video compression artifacts using supervised learning. To obtain the ground truth for training, we first build a reference metric for local estimation of the artifact level, which is robust to scaling and sensitive to all types of compression artifacts. Next, we design a large feature set and use AdaBoost to create no-reference metrics trained with the output of the reference metric. Two separate trained no-reference metrics, one for flat and one for detailed areas, respectively, are necessary to cover all types of artifacts. The relevance of these metrics is validated in a compression artifact reduction application, using objective scores like PSNR and BIM, but also a subjective evaluation as proof. We conclude that our created reference metric is an accurate local estimator of the compression artifact level. We were able to copy the performance to two no-reference metrics, based on a weighted mixture of low-level features. Our new metrics enable a far superior performance of artifact reduction compared to relevant alternative proposals.","1932-4553;19324553","","10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2055832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5503981","AdaBoost;artifact reduction;compression artifact;human visual system;image quality evaluation;no-reference metric","","decoding;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);set theory;video coding","AdaBoost;artifact reduction;digital video decoding;feature set;local video compression artifact level;machine learning;no-reference metric design;supervised learning;video content","","5","","42","","20100708","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Furthermore, its power consumption is an important research focus which must be addressed. Finding an optimal solution requires information about the runtime behavior, which is not known at compile time. Moreover, the computational complexity leads to heuristic approaches based on conservative assumptions that are unable to exploit all of the program's optimization potential. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate architecture- and application-specific heuristics for power- and communication-aware task mapping using machine learning techniques to predict how programs behave at runtime. The key advantage of machine learning techniques is their ability to find relevant information in a high-dimensional space. This yields more precise heuristics than those based on pure static assumptions, as our experimental results show. Because learning is done in an off-line training phase once per architecture, the compile time itself is not extended as in other heuristic approaches like genetic or evolutionary algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5392-4; POD:978-1-4244-5391-7","10.1109/CISE.2010.5677019","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5677019","","Computer architecture;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Runtime;Training","computational complexity;concurrency control;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel programming;power aware computing;program compilers;program diagnostics;scheduling;software architecture;task analysis","communication-aware task mapping;compile time;computational complexity;concurrent architectures;evolutionary algorithms;genetic algorithms;intelligent task mapping;interprocessor communication;machine learning techniques;off-line training phase;parallel program mapping;power consumption;power-aware task mapping;program optimization potential;static assumptions;task allocation;task scheduling","","2","","17","","","10-12 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, Mathematical Morphology (MM) and Machine Learning (ML) methods were applied to characterize and classify histological images. MM techniques were employed for image analysis. The measurements obtained from image and graph analysis were fed into Machine Learning algorithms, which were designed and developed to automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data. Specifically, a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to evaluate the discriminatory power of the used measures. The results show that the methodology was successful in characterizing and classifying the differences between the architectural organization of epithelial and adipose tissues.

This process usually incorporates complex subjective studies that need to recreate the viewing conditions of the service in a controlled environment. In this paper we present Machine Learning techniques for modeling the dependencies of different network and application layer quality of service parameters to the QoE of network services using subjective quality feedback. These accurate QoE prediction models allow us to further develop a geometrical method for calculating the possible remedies per network stream for reaching the desired level of QoE.

This study used 14 similarity measures derived from relevant clinical and imaging parameters to classify the HCC patient pairs into two classes, namely the difference between their survival time being longer or no longer than 12 months. Furthermore, this paper proposes and presents a patient similarity algorithm for the classification, named SimSVM. With the 14 similarity measures as input, SimSVM outputs the predicted class and the degree of similarity or dissimilarity. A dataset was collected from 30 patients, forming 300 and 135 patient pairs as training and test datasets respectively.

After reviewing the state of the art, to mitigate future blackouts, we propose a new machine learning approach for protective relays based on binary hypothesis testing, support vector machines (SVMs), and communications between the protective relays and the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), which we call smart protective relays. The goal of smart relays is to classify and discriminate the normal conditions from fault conditions via local measurements. It is shown that the proposed SVM-based smart relays can detect the location of an initial fault using local current, voltage, real power, and reactive power measurements, and by monitoring these metrics, they can make a correct decision even when the state of the system changes after some equipment failure. We show that by making an intelligent decision on whether and when to trip, and communicating the changes observed to SCADA for fast and intelligent decision making, SVM-based smart relays have the potential to mitigate large-scale blackouts and confine them to much smaller areas. By deploying SVM-based smart relays only at relatively few locations where they have the highest probability to be tripped incorrectly, the probability of cascade of failures and a blackout can be greatly reduced.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2010.2072970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5613908","Blackout;communication networks;machine learning;smart protective relays;support vector machine (SVM) classification","Current measurement;Digital relays;Power outages;Power transmission lines;Protective relaying;Voltage measurement","SCADA systems;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;relay protection;support vector machines","SCADA;SVM-based smart relays;electric power systems;intelligent decision;large-scale blackouts;machine learning approach;protective relays;supervisory control and data acquisition;support vector machines","","16","","43","","20101101","Jan. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this task a key enabler is a robust detection and classification of the plant and species. Automatically distinguishing between plant species is a challenging task, because some species look very similar. It is also difficult to translate the symbolic high level description of the appearances and the differences between the plants used by humans, into a formal, computer understandable form. Also it is not possible to reliably detect structures, like leaves and branches in 3D data provided by our sensor. One approach to solve this problem is to learn how to classify the species by using a set of example plants and machine learning methods. In this paper we are introducing a method for distinguishing plant species using a 3D LIDAR sensor and supervised learning. For that we have developed a set of size and rotation invariant features and evaluated experimentally which are the most descriptive ones. Besides these features we have also compared different learning methods using the toolbox Weka. It turned out that the best methods for our application are simple logistic regression functions, support vector machines and neural networks. In our experiments we used six different plant species, typically available at common nurseries, and about 20 examples of each species. In the laboratory we were able to identify over 98% of these plants correctly.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708854","3D laser sensor;agricultural robotics;plant classification;supervised learning","Agriculture;Artificial neural networks;Histograms;Lasers;Robot sensing systems;Three dimensional displays","agriculture;biology computing;botany;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optical radar;robots;support vector machines","3D LIDAR sensor;Weka;agricultural robotics;crop scouting;logistic regression;machine learning;neural networks;plant species classification;supervised learning;support vector machines","","2","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its reduction is of strategic importance as it contributes to cost decreasing, time-to-market shortening, faster fault detection, achieving throughput targets, and improving production-resource scheduling. To reduce CT, we suggest and investigate a data-driven approach that identifies key factors and predicts their impact on CT. In our novel approach, we first identify the most influential factors using conditional mutual information maximization, and then apply the selective naive Bayesian classifier (SNBC) for further selection of a minimal, most discriminative key-factor set for CT prediction. Applied to a data set representing a simulated fab, our SNBC-based approach improves the accuracy of CT prediction in nearly 40% while narrowing the list of factors from 182 to 20. It shows comparable accuracy to those of other machine learning and statistical models, such as a decision tree, a neural network, and multinomial logistic regression. Compared to them, our approach also demonstrates simplicity and interpretability, as well as speedy and efficient model training.

"The Influence Machine: Nonnegative Instance-Space Learning with Differentiated Regularization","J. Zhang","CS Dept., Louisiana State Univ., Baton Rouge, LA, USA","2010 Ninth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20110204","2010","","","861","866","We introduce a new method for classification called the influence machine. The influence machine assigns influence powers to the instances in the training sample so that they can apply their influence to other instances through the connections between the instances specified by a connection matrix. A new instance is classified to be positive if the overall influence it receives is positive and vice versa. Similar to support vector machine (SVM), the influence machine selects a small subset of the training instances to give influence power. However, this selection is very different from how the support vectors are selected by SVM. Experiment results show that the classification performance of the influence machine is comparable to that of the SVM. In a few cases, the influence machine shows much better classification accuracy. The influence machine has other advantages: any similarity matrix can be applied with the influence machine, not like SVM which requires that the kernel be positive definite. Furthermore, the influence machine uses linear optimization, instead of the quadratic optimization used by SVM.

It is widely believed that they are capable of identifying hotspot patterns unknown to the trained model. The quality of a machine learning method is conventionally measured by the accuracy rates determined from experiments employing random partitioning of benchmark samples into training and testing sets. In this paper, we demonstrate that these accuracy rates may not reflect the predictive capability of a method. We introduce two metrics - the predictive and memorizing accuracy rates - that quantitatively characterize the method's capability to capture hotspots. We also claim that the number of false alarms per detected hotspot reflects both the method's performance and the difficulty of detecting hotspots in the test set. By adopting the proposed metrics, a designer can conduct a fair comparison between different hotspot detection tools and adopt the one better suited to the verification needs.","1948-3287;19483287","Electronic:978-1-61284-914-0; POD:978-1-61284-913-3","10.1109/ISQED.2011.5770713","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770713","DFM;Design for manufacturability;characterization methodology;hotspot detection;machine learning;printability","Accuracy;Encoding;Layout;Machine learning;Measurement;Testing;Training","design for manufacture;learning (artificial intelligence);lithography","hotspot detection tool;hotspot pattern identification;lithographic hotspot detection;machine learning;testing set","","1","1","13","","","14-16 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the control unit of such UAVs fails to adapt quickly when the UAVs are exposed to unpredictable and violent external disturbances such as violent wind gusts and extreme weather conditions. The cost of such adaptation failures can be extremely high and therefore, in order to use any crash preventing strategy, it is imperative to design and use intelligent tools for the early detection of such failures. In this paper we present a machine learning based autonomous tool - AWG-Detector - that detects Anomalies due to Wind Gusts (AWG), in our adaptive Altitude control unit of an Aerosonde UAV. This adaptive Altitude control unit comprises of a PI based Roll controller and a Hybrid neuro-fuzzy based Pitch controller. Experimental results show that our AWG-Detector achieves an accuracy of more than 99% in detecting anomalies due to wind gusts.

Here, we propose a two-stage machine learning approach for pathway analysis. During the first stage, informative genes that can represent a pathway are selected using feature selection methods. These “representative genes” are mostly associated with the phenotype of interest. In the second stage, pathways are ranked based on their “representative genes” using classification methods.

To reduce the effect of such variations, either color constancy algorithms or illumination-invariant color descriptors could be used. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of straightforward color constancy methods in practice, with respect to their utilization in a standard object classification problem, and also investigate their effects using local versions of these algorithms. These methods are then compared with color invariant descriptors.

Most existing approaches for abbreviation definition identification employ rule-based methods. While achieving high precision, rule-based methods are limited to the rules defined and fail to capture many uncommon definition patterns. Supervised learning techniques, which offer more flexibility in detecting abbreviation definitions, have also been applied to the problem. However, they require manually labeled training data. In this study, we make use of what we term naturally labeled data. Positive training examples are extracted from text, which provides naturally occurring potential abbreviation-definition pairs. Negative training examples are generated randomly by mixing potential abbreviations with unrelated potential definitions. The machine learner is trained to distinguish between these two sets of examples. Then, the learned feature weights are used to identify the abbreviation full form. This approach does not require manually labeled training data. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on the Ab3P, BIOADI and Meds tract corpora.

However, not all piano players and song writers are gifted with the musical talent of harmonizing piano melodies effectively since it requires keeping track of an extensive set of western music rules and concepts, years of training and practice and also musicality within them to harmonize a melody accurately. This paper discusses a solution for the tedious task of harmonization by introducing `ChordATune', an interactive tool for harmonizing melodies and generating chord progressions according to user emotions. Further, ChordATune provides a mechanism to arrange chords according to different genres, drum beats and tempi based on user preference. A machine learning approach with Hidden Markov Model (HMM), along with dynamic programming is used to generate the chord progression for a given melody and embed the emotional factor of the user. The melody is taken in as an audio file to the system, where a pitch class profile is created at run time representing the pitch content of the file over time. In order to embed the emotional factor, the Hidden Markov Model is dynamically created, and HMM properties are generated at run time according to the selected emotional factor and the input pitch classes (melody). Around 250 lead sheets were used to train the system using data driven and heuristic approaches, and the evaluation results represented 80% user satisfaction of the prototype. This research further opens a path for research concerning chord progression generation for vocals, taking into account the extraction of words, emotional factor and the tune extracted from the actual voice of the user.","2151-1802;21511802","Electronic:978-1-4244-8552-9; POD:978-1-4244-8549-9","10.1109/ICIAFS.2010.5715645","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715645","","Artificial intelligence;Generators;Hidden Markov models;Lead;Music;Training;Usability","emotion recognition;feature extraction;harmonic generation;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);music;word processing","HMM;automatic music harmonization;chord progression;dynamic programming;emotional factor;hidden Markov model;machine learning;melody;piano;tune extraction;user emotions;word extraction","","0","","11","","","17-19 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Machine learning for noise removal on breast ultrasound images","S. Sinha; F. M. Hooi; Z. Syed; R. Pinsky; K. Thomenius; P. Carson","University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","2010 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium","20110630","2010","","","2020","2023","This study assessed the utility of machine learning for isolating noise and artifacts in breast ultrasound images. Such corrupt image regions (ROIs) can be automatically excluded when registering images acquired from different angles. Artifacts included posterior acoustic shadowing and enhancement arising from cancers and cysts respectively. Images were obtained on a breast-mimicking phantom containing multiple cysts and lesions with variable speed of sound and attenuation properties. In vivo breast images of cysts and cancers were also available. Results show that the classifiers were able to identify the regions of corrupt data accurately.","1051-0117;10510117","Electronic:978-1-4577-0381-2; POD:978-1-4577-0382-9","10.1109/ULTSYM.2010.5935996","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935996","breast imaging;machine learning;signal processing;ultrasound","Accuracy;Breast;Cancer;Lesions;Phantoms;Support vector machines;Ultrasonic imaging","biological organs;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;gynaecology;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;phantoms","attenuation properties;breast ultrasound imaging;breast-mimicking phantom;cancer;corrupt image regions;cysts;in vivo breast imaging;machine learning;noise removal;posterior acoustic shadowing;sound speed","","1","","11","","","11-14 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
