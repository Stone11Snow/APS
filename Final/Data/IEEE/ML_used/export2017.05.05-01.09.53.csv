The framework applies dominant set approach to create sets of sorting vectors. With these sorting vectors, we iteratively sort and transpose the gene expression data. Weighted correlation coefficient is used to measure the similarity in the gene level and the condition level. The weights are assigned according to the similarity measures in the previous level. We refine and update the weights of our similarity measurement in each iteration. This enables us to concentrate on measuring the similarity of relevant features during the biclustering process. In this way, a highly correlated bicluster could be easily located. We have applied this biclustering approach to three real gene expression data sets and found the results very encouraging. In addition, we propose the average correlation value (ACV), a criterion to evaluate the property of a bicluster. This criterion has been compared with the mean squared residue score and ACV is found to be more appropriate.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:1-4244-0657-9; POD:1-4244-0656-0","10.1109/MLSP.2006.275563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053662","","Biomedical measurements;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data analysis;Gene expression;Iterative algorithms;Iterative methods;Parameter estimation;Search methods;Sorting","biology computing;genetics;pattern clustering;sorting","average correlation value;correlated bicluster;dominant set;gene expression data biclustering;gene expression profile;sorting vector;weighted correlated coefficient","","4","","18","","","6-8 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These ideas had already been used in the context of nonlinear denoising source separation (DSS). However, in that method the degree of separation achieved by applying these ideas was relatively weak, and the separation had to be improved by iterating within the DSS scheme.

These improvements allow us to achieve a good separation in a single step, without the need to integrate the process into an iterative DSS scheme.

High accuracy is achieved via a sign-preserving, shifted log transform applied to features with peaked, heavy-tailed distributions.

The shape of this constellation is invariant of the predecessor value and it only depends on the I last filter taps. Consequently, the localization of the Magged successors constellation can lead to the annihilation of I filter taps - a process we call channel shortening.

We describe the proposed method and compare it with the commonly used gradient descent (GD) approach using the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer (WDBC) data from the UCI benchmark repository.

Such solution recommendations can significantly improve the system efficiency and accuracy by reducing workflow generation overhead and helping users quickly identify their needs. In our work, the main challenge is the high sparsity inherent to our application data - most fields have missing values due to a customer's lack of background or uncertainty on their specific needs. We address this problem by using latent semantic indexing (LSI) to merge original sparse data records into dense and semantic records. The generated dense data are then grouped into clusters based on their correlations. These clusters, together with their user patterns and representative workflows, are used to support efficient online workflow recommendation.

The high cost associated with experimental approaches has motivated the development of computational methods to assist in their design. Essentially, these computational methods rely on various sequential and structural features to differentiate the high efficacy antisense oligonucleotides from the low efficacy. By far, however, most of the features used are either local motifs present in primary sequences or in secondary structures. We proposed a novel approach to profiling antisense oligonucleotides and the target RNA to reflect some of the global structural features such as hairpin structures. Such profiles are then utilized for classification and prediction of high efficacy oligonucleotides using support vector machines. The method was tested on a set of 348 antisense oligonucleotides of 19 RNA targets with known activity. The performance was evaluated by cross validation and ROC scores. It was shown that the prediction accuracy was significantly enhanced","","POD:0-7695-2735-3","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041492","","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Costs;Gene expression;In vivo;Inhibitors;RNA;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","biology computing;genetics;macromolecules;organic compounds;pattern classification;support vector machines","RNA;antisense oligonucleotide;gene regulation;global structure information;potential therapeutic effect;support vector machine","","0","","13","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During testing, the profile of a query protein sequence is computed and aligned with all the profiles constructed during training to obtain a feature vector for classification by the SVM classifier. Tests on Reinhardt and Hubbard's eukaryotic protein dataset show that the total accuracy can reach 99.4%, which is significantly higher than those obtained by methods based on sequence alignments and amino acid composition. It was also found that the proposed method can still achieves a prediction accuracy of 96% even if none of the sequence pairs in the dataset contains more than 5% identity.

With this in mind, complex techniques like neural networks or ensembles are normally used, resulting in opaque models impossible to interpret. When models need to be comprehensible, accuracy is often sacrificed by using simpler techniques directly producing transparent models; a tradeoff termed the accuracy vs. comprehensibility tradeoff. In order to reduce this tradeoff, the opaque model can be transformed into another, interpretable, model; an activity termed rule extraction. In this paper, it is argued that rule extraction algorithms should gain from using oracle data; i.e. test set instances, together with corresponding predictions from the opaque model. The experiments, using 17 publicly available data sets, clearly show that rules extracted using only oracle data were significantly more accurate than both rules extracted by the same algorithm, using training data, and standard decision tree algorithms. In addition, the same rules were also significantly more compact; thus providing better comprehensibility. The overall implication is that rules extracted in this fashion explain the predictions made on novel data better than rules extracted in the standard way; i.e. using training data only","","POD:0-7695-2735-3","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041465","","Artificial neural networks;Data mining;Decision trees;Informatics;Measurement standards;Neural networks;Parameter estimation;Predictive models;Testing;Training data","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","decision tree algorithm;neural network;opaque model;oracle data;predictive modeling;rule extraction algorithm","","3","","17","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The extracted time-frequency features are processed by principal component analysis to reduce the feature set which is highly correlated due to volume conduction and the neighbor cortical regions. The reduced feature set is then fed into a linear discriminant analysis for classification. We describe experimental results for 9 subjects that show the superior performance of the proposed method.

Often these dynamics are denoted as noise, and in this view, classification is difficult, due to the small signal to noise ratio. We investigate how multiple trials of our EEG data can be used to increase the classification rate. Two schemes are used to combine the measurements: i) combine probabilities of individual classifications; ii) average measurements before classification. The number of trials that was used was either fixed or flexible. Flexible means that as many trials as needed are used to get a certain reliability of the classification. It is found that combining probabilities works best for large variances and a flexible number of samples, and averaging a flexible number of measurements works best for small variance. The validation of the method is tested on an EEG data set in which a subject listened to two different rhythms. On a single trial, the classification rate was 80%, a classification rate of about 90% was achieved using the average of 2 trials, and a classification rate of approximately 95% was found for 3 trials.

The clinical profile of SZ and BP can sometimes look similar, especially when symptoms are overlapping. The determination of a reliable biologically-based indicator of these diseases (a biomarker) would be a significant advance and could provide the groundwork for developing more rigorous tools for differential diagnosis and assignment of treatments. Recently, independent component analysis applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been fruitful in grouping the data into meaningful spatially independent components. We propose an automated way to identify two distinct brain networks or 'modes' which occur in regions implicated in schizophrenia. Following identification, we propose a method for combining two brain modes and develop a supervised classification algorithm for discriminating subjects with bipolar disorder, chronic schizophrenia, and healthy controls. An adaptive threshold applied to pair-wise mean difference images for the two spatial modes is trained to minimize the total error based upon the Euclidean distance between the group mean images and the images to be classified. Using a fully validated leave-one-out approach, results indicate an average sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 95%, respectively. In summary, we show that using features derived from fMRI data with ICA and a supervised classification approach, we can objectively separate diagnostic groups and suggests that combining multiple brain networks may improve our ability to distinguish diseases processes.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:1-4244-0657-9; POD:1-4244-0656-0","10.1109/MLSP.2006.275577","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053676","","Biomarkers;Classification algorithms;Computed tomography;Data compression;Data mining;Diseases;Independent component analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Principal component analysis;Psychology","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;independent component analysis;medical image processing;minimisation;neurophysiology","adaptive image threshold;automated supervised classification algorithm;bipolar disorder;chronic schizophrenia disorder;fMRI data;feature selection;functional magnetic resonance imaging;healthy individual;independent component analysis;multiple spatial ICA functional brain mode;pair-wise mean difference image;psychiatric symptom;total error minimization","","4","","35","","","6-8 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We use the normalized frequency spectrum directly as input with the KL kernel. The proposed method demonstrates a higher accuracy than popular kernels, such as polynomial or Gaussian kernels, or the conventional fault diagnosis method and Gaussian mixture model with the KL kernel for the examined problem.

We recently proposed a new method, called the non-negative least-correlated component analysis (nLCA) for a noise-free 2 x 2 mixing system, that relaxes the source independence assumption while uses the non-negativity constraints on the sources, observations and mixing matrix. In this paper, we extend the nLCA to the case of a noisy M x N non-negative mixing system where M gesN ges 2.

Here we show how these can be efficiently calculated, when they exist. This allows algorithmic differentiation to be applied to algorithms that invoke linear programming solvers as subroutines, as is common when using sparse representations in signal processing. Here we apply it to gradient optimisation of over complete dictionaries for maximally sparse representations of a speech corpus.

Quantum clustering employs the Shrodinger partial differential equation and uses the analogy between particles with their electro-magnetic field and data samples with their corresponding probability density function (pdf).

However, this technique often ignores available contextual information that may be influential to the state of an entity, sacrificing remote predictive accuracy in favour of low computational complexity. In this paper, we present a novel extension of dead reckoning by employing neural- networks to take into account expected future entity behaviour during the transmission of entity state updates (ESUs) for remote entity modeling in DIAs. This proposed method succeeds in reducing network traffic through a decrease in the frequency of ESU transmission required to maintain consistency. Validation is achieved through simulation in a highly interactive DIA, and results indicate significant potential for improved scalability when compared to the use of the IEEE DIS Standard dead reckoning technique. The new method exhibits relatively low computational overhead and seamless integration with current dead reckoning schemes.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:1-4244-0657-9; POD:1-4244-0656-0","10.1109/MLSP.2006.275564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053663","","Accuracy;Bandwidth;Computational complexity;Contracts;Dead reckoning;Delay;Frequency;Scalability;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","distributed processing;groupware;neural nets;virtual reality","computational complexity;dead reckoning;distributed interactive application;entity state update;network traffic;neural network;predictive contract mechanism;remote entity modeling;virtual reality","","1","","15","","","6-8 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, heavy computational burden and measurement noises render these efforts difficult and approaches based on quantized levels are vigorously investigated as an alternative. Methods based on quantized values require a procedure to convert continuous expression values into discrete ones. Although there have been algorithms to quantize values into multiple discrete states, these algorithms assumed strict state mixtures (SSM,) so that all expression profiles were divided into pre-specified number of states. We propose two novel quantization algorithms (QAs), model-based quantization algorithm and model-free quantization algorithm that generalize SSM algorithms in two major aspects. First, our QAs assume the maximum number of expression states (E<sub>s</sub>) be arbitrary. Second, expression profiles can exhibit any combinations of E<sub>s</sub> possible states. In this paper, we compare the performances between SSM algorithms and QAs using simulation studies as well as applications to actual data and show that quantizing gene expression data using adaptive algorithms is an effective way to reduce data complexity without sacrificing much of essential information","","POD:0-7695-2735-3","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041490","","Adaptive algorithm;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Data engineering;Diseases;Gene expression;Genomics;Machine learning algorithms;Noise measurement;Quantization","DNA;biology computing;genetics;molecular biophysics;noise","adaptive algorithm;global gene expression data;model-based quantization algorithm;noise measurement;strict state mixture algorithm","","1","","19","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, different from normal decision trees, pruning reduces the performances of PETs. In order to get a good probability estimation, we usually need large trees which are not good in terms of the model transparency. In this paper, two hybrid models by combining the naive Bayes classifier and PETs are proposed in order to build a model with good performance without losing too much transparency.

And interpolation is edge-directed with different networks for different chosen directions. Thus networks are specialized in learning and depicting non-linear spatial inter-pixel correlations at respective gradients and directions.

This multiple-model approach helped to validate the hypothesis that by switching the neuronal firing data, the performance of the final linear prediction is improved. In this paper, we take the idea of using multiple models a step further and apply the concept to our actual switching classifier.

The paper proposes a probabilistic feature mapping (PFM) in which the mapped features depend not only on the top-1 decoded Gaussian but also on the posterior probabilities of other Gaussians in the root model. The paper also proposes speeding up the computation of PFM and BSFT parameters by considering the top few Gaussians only. Results show that PFM performs slightly better than FM and that the fast approach can reduce computation time substantially. Among the approaches investigated, the fast BSFT is found to have the highest potential for robust speaker verification over telephone networks because it can achieve good performance without any a priori knowledge of the communication channel.

However, the noise present in such recordings is significant relative to the signals of interest. To circumvent this issue multiple trials are performed for the same task and an ensemble average is performed to increase the signal-to-interference/noise ratio (SNIR). Unfortunately, perhaps 100-500 trials are required to achieve a sufficiently large SNIR. This paper describes a simple technique for improving the SNIR value given only 10 trials. The 10 trials from each of the 274 channels are first averaged. The 274 averaged channel estimates are then temporally low passed filtered, adjusting for the phase shift introduced by the filtering process. Finally, a spatial average is performed, where each channel is assigned the average value of itself and the three most similar channels. The three most similar channels are identified using correlation. The described method achieves an SNIR of 0.6 dB.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:1-4244-0657-9; POD:1-4244-0656-0","10.1109/MLSP.2006.275584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053683","","Brain mapping;Cognition;Data analysis;Filtering;Humans;Low pass filters;Magnetoencephalography;Noise reduction;Phase estimation;Signal to noise ratio","cognition;data analysis;magnetoencephalography;medical computing","MLSP data analysis;filtering;human cognition;magnetoencephelographic data denoising;phase shift;preoperative functional brain mapping;signal-to-interference/noise ratio","","2","","3","","","6-8 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically, fixed (untrained) rules of classifier combination such as voting methods are used in this case. However, these may perform poorly, especially when the local class priors, used in training, differ from the true (test batch) priors. Alternatively, we proposed a transductive strategy, optimizing the combining rule for an objective function measured on the test batch. We proposed both maximum likelihood (ML) and information-theoretic (IT) objectives and found that IT achieved superior performance. Here, we identify that the fundamental advantage of the IT method is its ability to properly account for statistical redundancy in the ensemble.

This leads to a two-steps method where in the first one a single-component mixture is trained in the original space. In the second step, based on the single Gaussian previously trained, we apply the concept of average divergence measure to estimate the transformation matrix.

This situation is common in computer intrusion analysis, when a forensic analyst browses the logs to locate traces of an intrusion of unknown nature and origin, and extends to other tasks and data sets. To facilitate such ""browsing for anomalies"", we propose an unsupervised data organization technique for initial summarization and representation of data sets, and a semi-supervised learning technique for iterative modifications of the latter representation.

This evaluation is done empirically, by exploring the parameter space through computer simulations. Two cases are studied: one in which an initial allocation is maintained during estimation of the variables, and one in which allocation can be dynamically changed at each time step according to the uncertainty of the estimate from each channel. The results suggest that there are conditions in which it is advantageous to assign a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to only one of the signals and guess the other one. Furthermore, comparison between the two allocation strategies shows that the dynamic strategy significantly improves estimation performance in low SNR scenarios when the signals have similar dynamics.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:1-4244-0657-9; POD:1-4244-0656-0","10.1109/MLSP.2006.275515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4053614","","Bit rate;Computer simulation;Context modeling;Gaussian noise;Noise level;Random processes;Resource management;Signal to noise ratio;Target tracking;Uncertainty","estimation theory;resource allocation;signal processing","noisy observations;parallel channels;parameter space;resource allocation;signal dynamics;signal estimation;signal-to-noise ratio","","0","","8","","","6-8 Sept. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both first-order difference and psychoacoustically motivated relative difference functions of the temporal profile are considered.

In this study we show that diffusion does not eliminate outliers but rather spreads them around. We calculate the resulting bias induced by diffusing the outliers in their neighbourhood.

Based on this fact the problem of kernel parameter estimation for manifold learning is addressed based on the nonparametric statistical theory estimation.

Techniques used are decision trees and G-REX, a rule extractor based on genetic programming. The overall result is that the rules induced are rather compact and have very high accuracy, thus providing good explanations of successful play. It is of course quite hard to assess the quality of the rules; i.e. if they provide something novel and non-trivial. The main picture is, however, that obtained rules are consistent with established poker theory.

In order to decrease the magnitude of dynamic stress, frequency modulation method is often used to avoid resonance, which implies the frequency of active force must be kept away from the inherent vibration frequency of blade. At present, many models of calculating inherent vibration frequency of blade are deterministic, which didn't consider the randomness of many parameters (such as loading parameters, geometric parameters, material parameters) in practical operation. So, in this paper, an equal cross-section blade is investigated and a finite element model is built parametrically. Geometrical parameters (such as length, width and thickness), material parameters (such as young's modulus and density) and rotation speed of blade are treated as input random variables while the static frequencies and dynamic frequencies are treated as output random variables. The radial basis function (RBF) neural network is adopted to model and approximate the implicit function between the inherent frequencies and input random variables. The RBF technique uses a small set of the actual data which are obtained from calling the finite element solver several times and are used to develop a trained RBF algorithm. Then a large number of function values can be obtained from the established and successfully trained RBF network and are applied by Monte Carlo simulation to obtain the statistical characteristics and cumulative distribution functions of static frequencies and dynamic frequencies of the blade. The results demonstrate that the FEM-RBF-Monte Carlo method is an optional approach for the dynamic strength reliability design of the blade as RBF network has high regression precision and rapid calculation.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370755","Blade;Finite element;Monte Carlo simulation;Probability analysis;Radial Basis Function neural network;Static (dynamic) frequency","Blades;Fatigue;Finite element methods;Frequency modulation;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Random variables;Resonance;Stress;Turbines","Monte Carlo methods;blades;finite element analysis;mechanical engineering computing;radial basis function networks;steam turbines;vibrations","Monte Carlo simulation;RBF neural network;dynamic frequency;dynamic stress;equal cross-section blade;finite element model;frequency modulation method;probability analysis;radial basis function;static frequency;steam turbine blade","","0","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
