The drive system adopts two closed loop structure including velocity and current. The velocity and current loops adopt the maximum torque/current control strategy based on vector control. Thus, the current of ldquod-qrdquo axis was computed under the condition of maximum torque by using the torque equations, and vector control relation was then obtained, and the maximum torque/current control was achieved based on vector. Due to the time varying nature and the high-bandwidth property of the uncertainties in a practical PMSM drive system, to reach exact speed control in electric vehicle drive system, the velocity loop adopts adaptive inverse control strategy based on the idea applying inverse control and adaptive control to assign signal. This control strategy deals with assign signal and interference signal respectively and eliminate noise effect on velocity output radically.

Unfortunately, problems with dimensionality can arise when the number of molecular species in the system becomes very large, which make the transparent modelling and behavior simulation extremely difficult or computationally too expensive. As an alternative, data-driven identification of molecular interaction pathways using a black-box approach has recently been investigated. One of the main objectives in building black-box models, which in many cases are linear-in-the-parameters ones, is to produce a sparse model to effectively represent the system behavior. A popular approach is to select model terms one by one from a pool of candidates (basis functions), and an information criterion is then used to stop the selection process. The advantage is the computational efficiency, the disadvantage is that the derived model is not necessarily sparse. Alternative approach is to introduce into the normal loss function a penalty term on the parameters, leading to improved sparseness and generalization performance of the derived model. Moreover, there is a positive probability that the model structure can be accurately picked up among a wide range of possibilities. Generally speaking, there are three l<sub>rho</sub> norm regularization methods, including the Lasso (rho = 1), Ridge (rho = 2) and Bridge (0 < rho < 1). In particular, Lasso has been introduced into computational biology in recent years. This paper investigates the effectiveness of the three (l<sub>rho</sub>) regularization methods on the model identification of the MAPK signal transduction pathway, and simulation results are compared and analyzed.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212751","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212751","Bridge;Lasso;MAPK signal transduction pathway;Ridge;Systems biology;dimensionality;linear-in-the-parameter model;molecular interaction;regularization","Biological system modeling;Biology computing;Bridges;Computational biology;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Differential equations;Kinetic theory;Performance loss;Systems biology","molecular biophysics","biological systems;building black-box models;computational biology;l<sub>rho</sub> norm regularization methods;molecular interactions","","0","","16","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional physical education requires an instructor teaching exercise movement individually. Teaching every student in a big class demands considerable time and efforts. Utilization of computer assisted instruction (CAI) becomes pervasive in e-learning trend. However, CAI is often confined in literal form course such as mathematics, language courses. It is necessary to develop a motion training system for physical education. In this paper, we develop a low-cost motion capture with Wii Remote Control (Wiimote) for training movement exercise, such as tennis and baseball. This system applies Wiimotes to capturing acceleration of each part of limbs. Each Wiimote is attached to the limb, and then send back the acceleration information to the computer via Bluetooth wireless link. After gathering acceleration data of multiple limbs' parts, the computer recognizes the motion and classifies the motion to several correct and incorrect categories. As a result, it is able to provide the appropriate advice to the students. The system applies a modified ID3 inductive learning to generate a decision tree with continuous-valued attributes. We develop an easy-to-use GUI interface for coaches. The results show that the average accuracy of classification is 83%.

It can be stated by a way of minimizing the sum of violations of misclassified points, generally, its objective function is non-differentiable. In order to solve this problem, commonly, ones either use the Sigmoid functions (or a concave functions) sequence to approximate the step function, while the problem is converted into a constrained linear programming model, or use differentiable functions sequence to approximate non-differential objective function by the successive iterative optimization algorithm. But one of serious deficiency of these known algorithms is that the phenomenon of ill-conditioned matrix and data overflow occurs in the numerical computing. To overcome the drawbacks mentioned above, a new differentiable functions sequence constructed by the adjustable entropy function method proposed in [14], is adopted to approximate the non-differentiable objective function of the primal problem, a new optimization algorithm is designed to solve this problem. Further, the stop criterion of above adjustable entropy function method is improved and another new optimization algorithm is given consequently.

However, most successful business cases still rely on mobile tools, such as PDA, WIFI, RFID, and GPS, to realize the concept of ubiquitous. The main challenges ahead for making real U-applications on the market are not only the definitions of Zigbee specifications and protocols, but the related optimal database build-up and interface design methods. This paper aims to explore the necessary considerations between the gaps within ubiquitous information systems analysis and design stages which could direct the right path for database arrangement. This follows the system development life cycle (SDLC) to identify a Zigbee wireless network's optimal placement, data flows, and related database design and on line analysis process (OLAP). The case study was undertaken within Hsing-Wu college campus. This ensures the scenario based experiment design could be practical for the further applications. For example, conventional campus touring rely on DM, multimedia and Web applications. Most of the cases are just to put business online. There are passively electronic papers allowing users surfing on the net. Partially applications are focus on the mobile services, such as real time navigation and musical instruments. This research aims to fill up the gaps between mobilizations to U-applications. The main objectives are to build up a U-campus prototype to allow teachers and students getting more interactively information being everywhere. This system could benefit users to find services without asking. The research results reveal that using Zigbee to build up a U-campus application are less manpower, capital assets, build-up time than the fixed Intranet services. The scenario-based planning, analysis, design and test are realistic for students to realize how to implement an I.T. system in practice.- The Zigbee geometric placements are testing by three approaches, star, mesh and snowflakes which shows the flexibility of Zigbee wireless network.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212593","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212593","U-campus;Wireless net work;Zigbee","Bones;Databases;Design methodology;Global Positioning System;Information technology;Protocols;Radiofrequency identification;System testing;Wireless networks;ZigBee","data mining;database management systems;personal area networks;ubiquitous computing","Taiwan University campus;Web application;Zigbee geometric placement;Zigbee wireless network application;data flow;fixed Intranet services;information technology evolution;interface design method;mobile services;mobile tool;multimedia application;musical instrument;on line analysis process;optimal database;protocol;system development life cycle;ubiquitous information system analysis","","0","","13","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore it is very important to segment and recognize its spiral cloud bands as clearly as possible. As it is difficult to achieve the expected result with the existing image segmentation algorithms, in the study support vector machine was applied to segmentation of Typhoon spiral cloud bands while the problem of image segmentation can be solved by transforming it to the problem of classification.

A fractal dimension image is formed after the fractal dimension of every pixels in an image is calculated. According to the characteristics of natural objects and man-made objects, their fractal dimension is different. The smoother the surface of an object appears, the less fractal dimension the pixel is. In this paper, the targets are military objects and the background of infrared image is sky and sea with complicated clutters. On the other hand, the infrared images have serious noise. However, targets can be detected because of the fractal dimension difference between natural surface and man-made surface. Whether or not targets are interference, the detection result is efficient.

Whereas, these ship relative positioning researches only make an attempt to get the novel practical positioning technology, so some assumptions are made such as synchronous working with uniform initiative time for every ship's positioning system and without data delay from other ship nodes to target ship. Therefore, these algorithms are all theoretic and not practical. Synchronously, the distributed structure with local estimate transmission is more effective than the centralized form with original positioning measurement.

In which, ADRC is used as auto speed regulator (ASR) and conventional proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is used as auto current regulator (ACR). By using tracking differentiator (TD), a desirable transition response can be defined to reduce overshoot when input signal changes. The model uncertainty and external interference can be accurately estimated and compensated to a form of integrator series by the extended state observer (ESO). Without integrator, the control law is a nonlinear function of state error and its differential. The simulation results of this control strategy for motor drive show that the design of the control system does not rely on mathematical models. This system has strong anti-disturbance capacity, fast response, nearly non-overshoot, so the system dynamic performance is improved in contrast with the conventional PID controller.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212223","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212223","Auto-disturbance-rejection-control;motor drive speed control;nonlinear function;simulation","Automatic speech recognition;Control systems;Induction motors;Interference;Pi control;Proportional control;Regulators;State estimation;Three-term control;Uncertainty","angular velocity control;closed loop systems;induction motor drives;machine control;observers;three-term control","PID controller;auto speed regulator;autocurrent regulator;autodisturbance-rejection-control;control law;double-closed-loop control system;extended state observer;external interference;mathematical model;motor drive;nonlinear function;proportional-integral-derivative controller;simulation result;slip power recovery induction motor;tracking differentiator;transition response;uncertainty model","","0","","8","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this fusion, extrinsic calibration is a prerequisite. But most existing methods need a special configuration in which the camera can observe the inertial sensor. In this paper we present an extrinsic calibration method for visual and inertial sensors in a general configuration in which the visual and inertial sensors can not observe each other. The proposed method introduces a total station as a reference. The total station can be adjusted to be parallel to the ground plane to which the inertial sensor can provide the rotation.

Using this method, the enable channels are identical wavelength operation and the unable channels are almost suppressed completely. The enable and unable channels can be setup at will based on the requirements of different applications. However, the index modulation efficiency of the sampled FBGs is very slow. To get a high efficiency, an intelligent particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to design the phase of the target spectrum. Combing the two methods together, a high efficient multi-level phase sampled FBG that each channel is suppressed or not at will, can be obtained. We also use the particle swarms optimizations (PSO) algorithm to optimize the pure phase sampling profiles of the sampled FGB. Results showed that a much high efficiency of the FBGs can be obtained compared with that obtained from the simple inverse Fourier transformation technology. If appropriate grating period chirp and sampled period chirp is applied to such a grating, a novel FBGs based OADM or interleavers devices with dispersion or dispersion slope compensation can be designed.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212353","FBGs;Grating Period;Inverse Flourier Transformation;Particle Swarms Optimizations;Sampled Period","Algorithm design and analysis;Bragg gratings;Fiber gratings;Optical fiber communication;Optical fiber devices;Optical fiber dispersion;Optical fiber polarization;Particle swarm optimization;Polarization mode dispersion;Sampling methods","Bragg gratings;Fourier transforms;optical fibres;particle swarm optimisation;sampling methods","fiber Bragg grating;index modulation structure;intelligent particle swarm optimization;inverse Flourier transformation;sampling period profile","","0","","14","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to solve the problem, a new signal processing method based on the improved HHT is used. With its ideal performance on local adaptability and time-frequency analysis, noises are removed.

In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism in e-voting system to help voting management center make decision whether they should take action in re-vote. Trust and risk are brought in to assist the process of such decision-making. The concept of trust in our paper is defined as a measurable belief of voters for their request of re-vote. The influence of fraud on the system would be reduced due to their low trust value. Additionally, risk presented here is related to the total cost of re-vote. Thus, voting management center would depend on these factors to make a rational decision. Furthermore, we presented an approach to find the relation between the complaining rate and risk to help voting management center customize their strategy.

Thus, a new approach of flatness pattern recognition is proposed, based on the credit-assignment cerebellar model articulation controller (CA-CMAC) neural network. The difference in fuzzy distances between samples and the basic patterns is introduced as the input of the CA-CMAC network. Simultaneously, a credit-assignment learning algorithm is imposed. The inverse of activated times of each memory cell is taken as the credibility, and the error correction is proportional to the credibility. The new approach with advantages, such as, fast learning speed, good generalization, and easy implementation, is efficient and intelligent.

On CASPEAL face databases, our experimental results demonstrate that eyeglasses fisherfaces performs well.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212281","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212281","eyeglasses fisherfacesgenetic algorithm3D face synthesis","Cybernetics;Machine learning","computer graphics;face recognition;genetic algorithms;visual databases","3D face synthesis method;CASPEAL face databases;eyeglasses fisherfaces based glasses-face recognition;facial image;genetic algorithm;occlusion problem","","1","","10","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the value of information and uncertainties plays an important role in the studies of uncertainty optimization problem, this paper gives two optimal indexes based on the three solution concepts, called the expected value of perfected information and the value of random fuzzy solution, and discuss their properties in the end.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212462","Two-stage random fuzzy programming;expected value of perfect information;value of random fuzzy solution;wait-and-see solution","Cybernetics;Machine learning","fuzzy set theory;stochastic programming","perfected information expected value;random fuzzy theory;stochastic programming;two-stage random fuzzy programming;uncertainty optimization problem","","0","","17","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
