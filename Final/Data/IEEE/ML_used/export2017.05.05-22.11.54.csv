However, this technique is not efficient enough to be used in applications with real world demands due to the time that the agent needs to learn. This paper investigates the use of Transfer Learning (TL) between agents to speed up the well-known Q-learning Reinforcement Learning algorithm. The new approach presented here allows the use of cases in a case base as heuristics to speed up the Q-learning algorithm, combining Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning (HARL) techniques. A set of empirical evaluations were conducted in the Mountain Car Problem Domain, where the actions learned during the solution of the 2D version of the problem can be used to speed up the learning of the policies for its 3D version. The experiments were made comparing the Q-learning Reinforcement Learning algorithm, the HAQL Heuristic Accelerated Reinforcement Learning (HARL) algorithm and the TL-HAQL algorithm, proposed here. The results show that the use of a case-base for transfer learning can lead to a significant improvement in the performance of the agent, making it learn faster than using either RL or HARL methods alone.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4231-7; POD:978-1-4244-8639-7","10.1109/LARS.2010.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702181","Case based reasoning;Machine Learning;Reinforcement Learning","","case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence)","Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm;TL-HAQL algorithm;case-based reasoning techniques;heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning techniques;mountain car problem domain;transfer learning","","2","","30","","","23-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, making sense of the many, and sometimes seemingly inconsistent, results is difficult. OBJECTIVE - We propose and evaluate a general framework for software defect prediction that supports 1) unbiased and 2) comprehensive comparison between competing prediction systems. METHOD - The framework is comprised of 1) scheme evaluation and 2) defect prediction components. The scheme evaluation analyzes the prediction performance of competing learning schemes for given historical data sets. The defect predictor builds models according to the evaluated learning scheme and predicts software defects with new data according to the constructed model. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, we use both simulation and publicly available software defect data sets. RESULTS - The results show that we should choose different learning schemes for different data sets (i.e., no scheme dominates), that small details in conducting how evaluations are conducted can completely reverse findings, and last, that our proposed framework is more effective and less prone to bias than previous approaches. CONCLUSIONS - Failure to properly or fully evaluate a learning scheme can be misleading; however, these problems may be overcome by our proposed framework.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611551","Software defect prediction;machine learning;scheme evaluation.;software defect-proneness prediction","Buildings;Data models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Software;Training;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);software fault tolerance;software performance evaluation","competing learning schemes;defect predictor;scheme evaluation;software defect proneness prediction framework","","59","","44","","20101028","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Traditional CF methods often use heuristic methods to combine the ratings given to an item by similar users, which may not reflect the characteristics of the active user and can give unsatisfactory performance. In contrast to heuristic approaches we have developed CollabNet, a novel algorithm that uses gradient descent to learn the relative contributions of similar users or items to the ranking of recommendations produced by a recommender system, using weights to represent the contributions of similar users for each active user. We have applied CollabNet to the challenging problem of people to people recommendation in social networks, where people have a dual role as both ""users"" and ""items"", e.g., both initiating and receiving communications, to recommend other users to a given user, based on user similarity in terms of both taste (whom they like) and attractiveness (who likes them). Evaluation of CollabNet recommendations on datasets from a commercial online social network shows improved performance over standard CF.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-4256-0; POD:978-1-4244-9131-5","10.1109/ICDM.2010.159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694032","Collaborative Filtering;Data Mining;Machine Learning;Recommender Systems","","data mining;groupware;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems;social networking (online)","CollabNet;collaborative filtering;datasets;learning;recommender system;social network","","7","","18","","","13-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SVM classifiers are focused on achieving more separation between classes than exploiting the structures in the training data within classes. However, the structural information, as an implicit prior knowledge, has recently been found to be vital for designing a good classifier in different real-world problems. Accordingly, using as much prior structural information in data as possible to help improve the generalization ability of a classifier has yielded a class of effective structural large margin classifiers, such as the structured large margin machine (SLMM) and the Laplacian support vector machine (LapSVM). In this paper, we unify these classifiers into a common framework from the concept of “structural granularity” and the formulation for optimization problems. We exploit the quadratic programming (QP) and second-order cone programming (SOCP) methods, and derive a novel large margin classifier, we call the new classifier the structural regularized support vector machine (SRSVM). Unlike both SLMM at the cross of the cluster granularity and SOCP and LapSVM at the cross of the point granularity and QP, SRSVM is located at the cross of the cluster granularity and QP and thus follows the same optimization formulation as LapSVM to overcome large computational complexity and non-sparse solution in SLMM. In addition, it integrates the compactness within classes with the separability between classes simultaneously. Furthermore, it is possible to derive generalization bounds for these algorithms by using eigenvalue analysis of the kernel matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that SRSVM is often superior in classification and generalization performances to the state-of-the-art algorithms in the framework, both with the same and different structural granularities.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2108315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5724308","Generalization bound;machine learning;structural granularity;support vector machine","Clustering algorithms;Covariance matrix;Ellipsoids;Kernel;Manifolds;Optimization;Support vector machines","computational complexity;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern classification;quadratic programming;support vector machines","Laplacian support vector machine;SVM classifiers;cluster granularity;computational complexity;eigenvalue analysis;kernel matrices;machine learning;maximal margin;optimization problems;quadratic programming method;second-order cone programming method;structural granularity;structural information;structural large margin classifier;structural regularized support vector machine","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Classification;Cluster Analysis;Databases, Factual;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated","34","","45","","20110307","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different methods for prediction, as well as integration with several classifiers is analyzed and the methods are evaluated in terms of computational load and loss in quality of context. The results indicate that the amount of energy which can be saved is dependent on two variables (the acceptable loss in quality of recognition, and the number of most likely classes which should be accounted for), and two scenario-dependent properties (predictability of the context sequences and size of the context-sensor dependency sets).","","Electronic:978-1-61284-937-9; POD:978-1-61284-938-6","10.1109/PERCOMW.2011.5766907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5766907","context prediction;context recognition;embedded and mobile systems;machine learning","Accuracy;Context;Markov processes;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Sensor systems;Time series analysis","mobile computing;power aware computing","class-sensor dependencies;computational load;context recognition;context sequences;context-sensor dependency sets;energy conservation prediction;mobile devices;power constraints;power consumption reduction","","3","","14","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the authors propose a method, M-eval, for implementing these opening principles in a program. M-eval is a multivariate evaluation function that provides a priori information for MCTS-based go programs. An initial vector made of k positive qualities both players wish to maximize is computed on a board position for each player. The initial vector is dimensionally reduced using non-negative matrix factorization to minimize informational loss. This reduction is done using the multivariate structure learned offline from a set of over 110,000 board positions from a database of master human games. The resulting R<sup>2</sup> encoding is converted by regression to a real value used as a priori information in MCTS. Games were played using the MCTS GoKnot/QYZ framework with M-eval enabled against the same program without M-eval.

This data set is a good environment to test classifiers as it is incomplete and ambiguous bio-signal data collected from total 452 patient cases.

Roughly speaking, a pattern tree is a hierarchical, tree-like structure, whose inner nodes are marked with generalized (fuzzy) logical operators and whose leaf nodes are associated with fuzzy predicates on input attributes. A pattern-tree classifier is composed of an ensemble of such pattern trees: one for each class label. This type of classifier is interesting for several reasons. For example, since a single pattern tree can be considered as a kind of logical description of a class, it is quite appealing from an interpretation point of view. Moreover, in terms of classification accuracy, the method has shown promising performance in first experimental studies. Yet, as will be argued in this paper, the algorithm that has originally been proposed for learning fuzzy pattern trees from data offers scope for improvement. Here, we propose a new method that modifies the original proposal in several ways. Notably, our learning algorithm reverses the direction of pattern tree construction from bottom-up to top-down. Additionally, a different termination criterion is proposed that is more adapted to the learning problem at hand. Experimentally, it will be shown that our approach is indeed able to outperform the original learning method in terms of predictive accuracy.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2010.2093532","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5639042","Classification;generalized logical operators;heuristic search;machine learning;pattern-tree induction","Accuracy;Cancer;Concrete;Data models;Learning systems;Prediction algorithms;Proposals","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;trees (mathematics)","classification method;fuzzy logical operators;fuzzy pattern trees;learning algorithm;machine learning method;pattern-tree classifier;termination criterion;top-down tree induction","","23","","32","","20101118","April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This task can become challenging for proteins isolated in their own network or those with poor or uncharacterized neighborhoods. Here, we present a novel probabilistic chain-graph-based approach for predicting protein functions that builds on connecting networks of two (or more) different species by links of high interspecies sequence homology. In this way, proteins are able to “exchange” functional information with their neighbors-homologs from a different species. The knowledge of interspecies relationships, such as the sequence homology, can become crucial in cases of limited information from other sources of data, including the protein-protein interactions or cellular locations of proteins. We further enhance our model to account for the Gene Ontology dependencies by linking multiple but related functional ontology categories within and across multiple species. The resulting networks are of significantly higher complexity than most traditional protein network models. We comprehensively benchmark our method by applying it to two largest protein networks, the Yeast and the Fly. The joint Fly-Yeast network provides substantial improvements in precision, accuracy, and false positive rate over networks that consider either of the sources in isolation. At the same time, the new model retains the computational efficiency similar to that of the simpler networks.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2010.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5432154","Biology and genetics;bioinformatics (genome or protein) databases.;machine learning","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Computer science;Joining processes;Ontologies;Predictive models;Proteins;Sequences","bioinformatics;data analysis;genetics;genomics;macromolecules;molecular biophysics;proteins","gene ontology;probabilistic chain-graph-based method;protein functions;protein homology data;protein sequence homology;protein-protein interaction","Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Computational Biology;Hymenoptera;Models, Genetic;Models, Statistical;Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs;Proteins;Sequence Homology, Amino Acid;Species Specificity;Statistics, Nonparametric;Vocabulary, Controlled;Yeasts","10","","27","","20100318","May-June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

SVM was chosen for this problem due to its generalization capability in handling noisy data. Training and test data for the SVM were obtained from an experimental setup of the test scenario. The results obtained proved that SVM was a suitable tool for this application, due to its ability in handling the noisy data caused by the NLOS condition.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7006-8; POD:978-1-4244-7004-4","10.1109/ICCS.2010.5686095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5686095","Localization;Machine Learning;Positioning;SVM;UWB-IR","Classification algorithms;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","support vector machines;telecommunication computing;ultra wideband communication","NLOS conditions;SVM approach;UWB-IR based positioning;impulse radio;localization problem;localization tag;machine learning;support vector machine","","1","","3","","","17-19 Nov. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, despite their ubiquity, performance will always be subject to availability of detailed digital road maps. Most current digital maps are still inadequate for advanced applications in unstructured environments. Lack of up-to-date information and insufficient refinement of the road geometry are among the most important shortcomings. The massive use of inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, combined with the rapidly increasing availability of wireless communication infrastructure, suggests that large amounts of data combining both modalities will be available in the near future. The approach presented here draws on machine-learning techniques and processes logs of position traces to consistently build a detailed and fine-grained representation of the road network by extracting the principal paths followed by the vehicles. Although this work addresses the road-building problem in dynamic environments such as open-pit mines, it is also applicable to urban environments. New contributions include a fully unsupervised segmentation method for sampling roads and inferring the network topology, which is a general technique for extracting detailed information about road splits, merges, and intersections, as well as a robust algorithm that articulates these two. Experimental results with data from large mining operations are presented to validate the new algorithm.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2010.2069097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5567159","Data mining;Global Positioning System (GPS);digital road maps;machine learning;road safety","","Global Positioning System;automated highways;cartography;data mining;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);radio receivers;radiocommunication;road vehicles;topology","GPS receivers;detailed representation;digital road maps;electronic vehicle guidance systems;fine-grained representation;global positioning system receivers;insufficient refinement;intelligent transportation systems;machine-learning techniques;mining operations;network topology;open-pit mines;position traces;principal paths;principal road paths;road geometry;road intersections;road merges;road network;road splits;road vehicles;robust algorithm;robust inference;sampling roads;unsupervised segmentation method;up-to-date information;urban environments;wireless communication infrastructure","","25","2","30","","20100909","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Nowadays, an increasing number of ADCs are integrated into a system-on-chip (SoC) platform design, which usually contains a digital embedded processor. In such a platform, a digital pulse wave is obviously less expensive to generate than an accurate analogue sine wave. As a result, the usage of a digital pulse wave has been investigated to test ADCs as the test stimulus. In this paper, the ability of a digital adaptive pulse wave for ADC testing is presented via the measurement results. Instead of the conventional FFT analysis, a time-domain analysis is exploited for post-processing, from which a signature result can be obtained. This signature can distinguish between faulty devices and the fault-free devices. It is also used in the machine-learning-based test method to predict the dynamic specifications of the ADC.

In the particular task of object recognition, the main deficiency of standard kernels such as the convolution one resides in the lack in capturing the right geometric structure of objects while also being invariant. We focus in this paper on object recognition using a new type of kernel referred to as ""context dependent.” Objects, seen as constellations of interest points, are matched by minimizing an energy function mixing 1) a fidelity term which measures the quality of feature matching, 2) a neighborhood criterion which captures the object geometry, and 3) a regularization term. We will show that the fixed point of this energy is a context-dependent kernel which is also positive definite.

Controllers do not receive any global track information, but only perceive simulated, car-centered sensory information about the current, local track properties and about surrounding opponents. Our racing controller, termed COgnitive BOdySpaces: TORCS-based Adaptive Racing (COBOSTAR), uses the sensors that give the most anticipatory information to learn a sensory-to-motor policy, which was optimized by means of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). The basic policy was extended by additional modules to prevent detrimental skidding, to safely land after jumps, to implement effective opponent avoidance, and to recover and learn online from accidents. Owing to this approach, COBOSTAR won two out of the three competition legs of the 2009 SCRC and, without hardly any further modifications, also was among the first in the 2010 SCRC despite the addition of noise to the utilized sensors. This paper describes the COBOSTAR controller as it was submitted to the last of the three competition legs in 2009. Evaluations of distinct controller modules are provided where possible.

Moves beyond the tree are generated by a biased random sampling policy. The recently published last-good-reply policy makes moves that, in previous playouts, have been successful replies to immediately preceding moves. This paper presents a modification of this policy that not only remembers moves that recently succeeded but also immediately forgets moves that recently failed. This modification provides a large improvement in playing strength. We also show that responding to the previous two moves is superior to responding to the previous one move.

To handle this if large set of training images are used then computational complexity will get increase as images are rather high dimension but if training set kept small, performance decreases. Since both classification and feature information are necessary for a recognition system DCT is used to lower the computational complexity and SVM for classification. Since SVM is a popular classification tool but the main disadvantage of SVM is its large memory requirement and computation time to deal with large data set. Therefore we have used incremental learning approach i.e. ISVM to avoid large training time and memory consumption for face recognition. The biggest advantage of using the proposed technique is that it not only decreases the training time and updating time but also improves the classification accuracy rate up to 100%. Experiments are performed on ORL face database and results has proved that not only the training time used by the ISVM is very less compared to SVM but also the recognition rate raised to 100%.

However, the traditional relevance feedback framework for existing techniques still suffers from: (1) high learning cost incurs substantial delay in responding to user relevance feedback, (2) the classifiers may be biased when the negative feedback samples out-number the positive feedback samples, and (3) The high feature dimensions compared to the size of the training set causes over fitting. We propose a new relevance feedback approach based on a lazy processing framework.

Many dispatching rules have been found, which perform well on different scenarios, however no rule has been found, which outperforms other rules across various objectives. To tackle this drawback, approaches, which select dispatching rules depending on the current system conditions, have been proposed. Most of these use learning techniques to switch between rules regarding the current system status. Since the study of Rasmussen has shown that Gaussian processes as a machine learning technique have outperformed other techniques like neural networks under certain conditions, we propose to use them for the selection of dispatching rules in dynamic scenarios.

"Why classifying search algorithms is essential","J. R. Woodward; J. Swan","School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK","2010 IEEE International Conference on Progress in Informatics and Computing","20110113","2010","1","","285","289","In chemistry, the periodic table of elements was a huge leap of progress. It allowed elements to be placed in a table allowing their classification. More importantly, it allowed predictions to be made about their properties, and in some cases predictions about elements which had not even been discovered at the time the periodic table was proposed. We argue that the current state of search methodologies is analogous to the state of chemistry before the arrival of the periodic table, and such a classification system is well overdue. Many machine learning research papers are currently published on the premise that the proposed algorithm does better on a particular data set than another algorithm. This approach, while it does produce better results on the given data set, does not produce an understanding of why a particular algorithm performs well on a particular problem. The No Free Lunch Theorem, while stating this is impossible over all data sets, also provides a possible framework. We state why the performance table associated with No Free Lunch (which has rows and columns similar to the periodic table), which is exactly what we are looking for, is unworkable, as problems cannot be indexed or enumerated in practice. We believe the classification of algorithms and problems is the biggest issue facing machine learning today. Progress in science is often brought about by asking the right questions, before finding the answers, and it is this question we address in this paper. Therefore, the contribution of this paper is raising the profile of the challenge of classifying algorithms and problems. An underlying aim is to reduce the number of papers with titles of the form “Algorithm X Applied to Problem Y”, or simply “A New Algorithm”, as new algorithms should only be introduced with an intended class of problem instances in mind.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6789-1; POD:978-1-4244-6788-4","10.1109/PIC.2010.5687448","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687448","bias;generalization;induction;machine learning;no free lunch theorems;optimization;search","Biology","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","machine learning;no free lunch theorem;search algorithm classification;search methodologies","","1","","14","","","10-12 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

FRN is intended to efficiently enable the inclusion of extended sets of heterogeneous n-gram features for enhanced sentiment classification. Experiments were conducted on three online review testbeds in comparison with methods used in prior sentiment classification research. FRN outperformed the comparison univariate, multivariate, and hybrid feature selection methods; it was able to select attributes resulting in significantly better classification accuracy irrespective of the feature subset sizes.

The finger has randomly distributed strain gauges and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films embedded in silicone. Different textures induce different intensities of vibrations in the silicone. Consequently, textures can be distinguished by the presence of different frequencies in the signal. The data from the finger are preprocessed, and the Fourier coefficients of the sensor outputs are used to train classifiers. We show that the classifiers generalize well for unseen datasets with performance exceeding previously reported algorithms.

However, this approach does not take advantage of the dependencies between the different feature spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to combine the different sources of similarity using a regularization framework over edges in multiple graphs. We show that the objective function induced by the framework is convex. We also propose an efficient algorithm using coordinate descent to solve the optimization problem.

Thus, no single policy fits perfectly all operating conditions. Instead of designing new policies for specific operating conditions, this paper proposes a generic power management scheme, called the Hybrid Power Management (HyPowMan) scheme. This scheme takes a set of well-known existing (DPM and DVFS) policies, each of which performs well for a given set of conditions, and adapts at runtime to the best-performing policy for any given workload.

In addition, boosting with AR and DT as components of an ensemble is more robust for predicting software faults.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-840-2; POD:978-1-61284-839-6","10.1109/ICCRD.2011.5763845","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5763845","classifers;ensemble;fault prediction;machine learning;software metrics","Accuracy;Boosting;Classification algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Software;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software engineering;software fault tolerance","machine learning;multiple classifiers;software engineering;software faults prediction","","1","","40","","","11-13 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Understanding Bank Failure: A Close Examination of Rules Created by Genetic Programming","A. L. Garcia-Almanza; B. Alexandrova-Kabadjova; S.

In order to obtain the optimum parameters of the classifying mechanism, we use a data set, obtained from the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The set consists of limited financial institutions' data, presented as variables widely used to detect bank failure. The outcome is a set of comprehensible decision rules, which allows to identify cases of bankruptcy. Further, the reliability of those rules is measured in terms of the true and false positive rate, calculated over the whole data set and plot over the Receiving Operating Characteristic (ROC) space. In order to test the accuracy performance of the mechanism, we elaborate two experiments: the first, aimed to test the degree of the variables' usefulness, provides a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. The second experiment completed over 1000 different re-sampled cases is used to measure the performance of the approach. To our knowledge this is the first computational technique in this field able to give useful insights of the method's predictive structure. The main contributions of this work are three: first, we want to bring to the arena of bankruptcy prediction a competitive novel method which in pure performance terms is comparable to state of the art methods recently proposed in similar works, second, this method provides the additional advantage of transparency as the generated rules are fully interpretable in terms of simple financial ratios, third and final, the proposed method includes cutting edge techniques to handle highly unbalanced samples, something that is very common in bankruptcy applications.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4204-1; POD:978-1-4244-8149-1","10.1109/CERMA.2010.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5692308","bankruptcy;genetic programming;machine learning","Biological system modeling;Erbium;Frequency measurement;Genetic programming;Indexes;Predictive models;Stochastic processes","banking;genetic algorithms;sensitivity analysis","bank failure detection;bankruptcy prediction;data set;evolving decision rules;financial ratio;genetic programming;receiving operating characteristic space","","0","","13","","","Sept. 28 2010-Oct. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Whereas the standard non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) assumes fixed spectral atoms, an extension is proposed where the temporal activations (coefficients of the decomposition on the spectral atom basis) become frequency dependent and follow a time-varying autoregressive moving average (ARMA) modeling. This extension can thus be interpreted with the help of a source/filter paradigm and is referred to as source/filter factorization. This factorization leads to an efficient single-atom decomposition for a single audio event with strong spectral variation (but with constant pitch).

Such systems must provide many services and in most cases must incorporate feedback to patients to advise them how to manage the daily details of their treatment and lifestyle changes. As in many other areas of healthcare, patient compliance is however an issue. In this experiment we apply machine learning techniques to three corpora containing data from trials of body worn systems for activity monitoring and feedback. The overall objective is to investigate how to improve feedback compliance in patients using personal monitoring and treatment systems, by taking into account various contextual features associated with the feedback instances. In this article we describe our first machine learning experiments.

The hybrid learning method combines both the particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the recursive least squares estimator (RLSE) to update the parameters of the fuzzy approximator. The PSO is used to update the premise part of the fuzzy system while the consequent part is updated by the RLSE. The PSO-RLSE learning method is very efficient in learning convergence.

The limitations of the single neural network approaches motivate the use of multiple neural networks for solving the problem in the form of ensembles and modular neural networks. While the ensembles solve the problem redundantly, the modular neural networks divide the computation into multiple modules. The modular neural network approach is used where a Self Organizing Map (SOM) selects the module which would perform the computation of the output, whenever any input is given. In the proposed architecture, the SOM selects multiple modules for problem solving, each of which is a neural network. Then the multiple selected neural networks are used redundantly for computing the output. Each of the outputs is integrated using an integrator. The proposed model is applied to the problem of Breast Cancer diagnosis, whose database is made available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Given a set of training examples believed to come from the same distribution or class, the task is to learn a model that will be able to distinguish examples in the future that do not belong to the same class. Traditional approaches typically compare the position of a new data point to the set of ``normal'' training data points in a chosen representation of the feature space. For some data sets, the normal data may not have discernible positions in feature space, but do have consistent relationships among some features that fail to appear in the anomalous examples. Our approach learns to predict the values of training set features from the values of other features. After we have formed an ensemble of predictors, we apply this ensemble to new data points. To combine the contribution of each predictor in our ensemble, we have developed a novel, information-theoretic anomaly measure that our experimental results show selects against noisy and irrelevant features.

The fuzzy community has also proposed many rule-based approaches, such as fuzzy decision trees and genetic fuzzy systems. This paper aims at comparing the models generated by rule-based methods for classification from both communities in terms of accuracy, and the induced rule set in terms of the syntactic complexity, taking into account the number of rules and average number of conjunctions in those rules. In general, models with lower syntactic complexity also show better interpretability, which is an important issue in knowledge acquisition. Results, using 10 datasets, a fuzzy C4.5 algorithm and two classic machine learning algorithms (C4.5 and PART), show that the fuzzy approach is able to produce lower error rates. Regarding the syntactic complexity of the models, PART produces in most cases the simplest models, although learning from different sets of features selected by filters. However, these simple models do not necessarily show a low error rate. Nevertheless, the induced fuzzy models inherit, from the fuzzy logic, the embedded ability of processing uncertainty and imprecision, avoiding the creation of rules using unnatural divisions of the attributes as the classic algorithms might do.","1522-4899;15224899","Electronic:978-0-7695-4210-2; POD:978-1-4244-8391-4","10.1109/SBRN.2010.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5715235","C4.5;Fuzzy C4.5;PART;classification;feature selection;fuzzy classification methods;machine learning","Decision trees;Error analysis;Fuzzy sets;Heart;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Vehicles","decision trees;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;knowledge acquisition;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","PART;classic learning algorithm;decision tree;feature selection;fuzzy C4.5 algorithm;fuzzy community;fuzzy logic;fuzzy method;genetic fuzzy system;knowledge acquisition;machine learning;rule inducer;rule-based classification;syntactic complexity;uncertainty processing","","2","","18","","","23-28 Oct. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, three CI paradigms, namely, the support-vector machine (SVM), regularized least square (RLS), and regularized extreme learning machine (RELM), have been employed, and their performance is compared for the said task.

We find two significant differences in the nature of the acted vs. natural occurrences of expressions. First, the acted ones are much easier for the computer to recognize. Second, in 90% of the acted cases, participants did not smile when frustrated, whereas in 90% of the natural cases, participants smiled during the frustrating interaction, despite self-reporting significant frustration with the experience. This paper begins to explore the differences in the patterns of smiling that are seen under natural frustration and delight conditions, to see if there might be something measurably different about the smiles in these two cases, which could ultimately improve the performance of classifiers applied to natural expressions.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9139-1; Electronic:978-1-4244-9141-4; POD:978-1-4244-9140-7","10.1109/FG.2011.5771425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5771425","machine learning;natural vs. acted data;smile while frustrated","Accuracy;Avatars;Cameras;Computers;Face;Feature extraction;Speech","emotion recognition","acted frustration;delightful video;emotional state recognition;facial information;frustrating interaction;natural expressions;natural frustration;prosodic information;smiling patterns","","18","","10","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The captured gestures can be mapped to sounds, synthesis algorithms, visuals, etc., or used for music transcription. Two of the most common approaches for acquiring musical gestures are: 1) “hyper-instruments” which are “traditional” musical instruments enhanced with sensors for directly detecting the gestures and 2) “indirect acquisition” in which the only sensor is a microphone capturing the audio signal. Hyper-instruments require invasive modification of existing instruments which is frequently undesirable. However, they provide relatively straightforward and reliable sensor measurements. On the other hand, indirect acquisition approaches typically require sophisticated signal processing and possibly machine learning algorithms in order to extract the relevant information from the audio signal. The idea of using direct sensor(s) to train a machine learning model for indirect acquisition is proposed in this paper. The resulting trained “surrogate” sensor can then be used in place of the original direct invasive sensor(s) that were used for training. That way, the instrument can be used unmodified in performance while still providing the gesture information that a hyper-instrument would provide. In addition, using this approach, large amounts of training data can be collected with minimum effort. Experimental results supporting this idea are provided in two detection contexts: 1) strike position on a drum surface and 2) strum direction on a sitar.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2010.2089786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5610728","Gesture recognition;machine learning;new interfaces for musical expression;surrogate sensors;virtual sensors","Context;Feature extraction;Instruments;Machine learning;Music;Sensors;Training","audio signal processing;gesture recognition;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);microphones;musical instruments;sensors","audio signal;direct invasive sensor;gesture information;indirect acquisition approach;information extraction;interactive electroacoustic music;machine learning;musical gesture acquisition system;signal processing;surrogate sensor;training data","","4","","35","","20101028","Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This paper derives the first criterion that specifically aims to find a kernel representation where the Bayes classifier becomes linear. We illustrate how this result can be successfully applied in several kernel discriminant analysis algorithms. Experimental results, using a large number of databases and classifiers, demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach.

Conventional stress testing approaches measure server capacity offline in terms of application-level performance metrics like response time and throughput. They are limited in measurement accuracy and timeliness. In a multitier website, resource bottleneck often shifts between tiers as client access pattern changes. This makes the problem of online capacity measurement even more challenge. This paper presents an online measurement approach based on low-level hardware performance metrics such as instructions execution rate and cache access behavior. Such metrics together define a system internal running state. The measurement approach uses machine learning techniques to infer application-level performance at each tier from a set of selected hardware performance counters. A coordinated predictor is induced over individual tier-wide models to make global system performance prediction and identify the bottleneck when the system becomes overloaded. Experiments were conducted on a two-tier Tomcat/MySQL-configured website using TPC-W benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach was able to achieve an overload prediction accuracy of higher than 90 percent for a priori known input traffic mix and over 85 percent accuracy even for traffic causing frequent bottleneck shifting. It costs less than 0.5 percent runtime overhead for data collection and no more than 50 ms for each online decision making.","1045-9219;10459219","","10.1109/TPDS.2010.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5467057","Multitier website;hardware performance counter.;machine learning","","Web sites;counting circuits;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation;quality of service","QoS-aware resource management;cache access behavior metrics;client access pattern;coordinated predictor;hardware performance counters;instructions execution rate metrics;machine learning;multitier Web sites;online capacity identification;quality of service;stress testing approach","","5","","39","","20100520","March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of the huge volume of transported data and services, survivability in these networks is a big issue. Technical solution for securing this traffic takes advantage of reactive methods such as protection and restoration for rerouting the traffic in a case of a failure. Among the different reasons for failures, an important percentage is actually due to optical cables damage or cuts. In this paper, we propose a new method of proactive protection/restoration where the schemes are triggered before the optical fiber is cut. The method is based on the classification of the events occurring on the optical fiber. Events are monitored thanks to real time measurement of the optical fiber parameters. Classification is based on a suitable representation of the monitored parameters and a training set made of risky events allowing early detection of its premises. The advantage of the method is discussed with respect to its ability to reduce loss of data in case of a fiber cut and thus to improve network availability. Markov state model for proactive and reactive restoration of optical links has been developed for the availability analysis.","","Electronic:978-3-901882-42-5; POD:978-1-4244-9596-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5753394","Optical fibers;machine learning;optical networks;proactive;protection;restoration","Optical fiber dispersion;Optical fiber networks;Optical fiber polarization;Optical fiber sensors","Internet;Markov processes;optical fibre networks;optical links","Internet traffic;Markov state model;event classification;optical cable;optical core network;optical fiber;optical link;proactive restoration","","1","","18","","","8-10 Feb. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reformulation is performed by introducing an additional objective function or decomposing the original objective function into multiple ones. Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms are often used to solve the reformulated problem. Such an optimization approach, which is called multiobjectivization, has been used to solve difficult single-objective problems in many studies. In this paper, we discuss the use of multiobjectivization to solve two-objective problems. That is, we discuss the idea of solving a two-objective optimization problem by reformulating it as a four-objective one. In general, the increase in the number of objectives usually makes the problem more difficult for EMO algorithms. Thus the handling of two-objective problems as four-objective ones may simply lead to the deterioration in the quality of obtained non-dominated solutions. However, in this paper, we demonstrate through computational experiments that better results are obtained for some two-objective test problems by increasing the number of objectives from two to four.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-7376-2; POD:978-1-4244-7377-9","10.1109/NABIC.2010.5716359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5716359","evolutionary multiobjective optimization;fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;knapsack problems;multiobjectivization;single-objective optimization","","evolutionary computation;optimisation;problem solving","evolutionary algorithms;multiobjective optimization;multiobjectivization;problem solving;reformulation","","2","","21","","","15-17 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
