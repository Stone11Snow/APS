This is due to the presence of co-occuring diseases, incomplete data, uncertain knowledge, and the vast amount of data to be analysed. Current approaches rely heavily on the experience, knowledge, and subjective opinions of clinicians, creating scalability issues. Automating this process requires a good knowledge representation technique to capture the knowledge of the domain experts, and multidimensional inferential reasoning approaches that can utilise a few bits and pieces of information for efficient reasoning. This study presents knowledge-based system with variants of Bayesian network models for efficient inferential reasoning, translating from available fragmented depression data to the desired information in a visually interpretable and transparent manner.

For example, the proposed threat could result in hand-written digits on a scanned check being incorrectly classified but looking normal when humans see them. This research assesses the extent to which adversarial examples pose a security threat, when one considers the normal image acquisition process. This process is mimicked by simulating the transformations that normally occur in of acquiring the image in a real world application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples, resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network. Thus just acquiring the image decreases the potential impact of the proposed security threat. We also show that the already widely used process of averaging over multiple crops neutralizes most adversarial examples. Normal preprocessing, such as text binarization, almost completely neutralizes adversarial examples. This is the first paper to show that for text driven classification, adversarial examples are an academic curiosity, not a security threat.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0020","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838124","","Agriculture;Cameras;MIMICs;Machine learning;Neural networks;Security;Training","handwritten character recognition;image classification;neural nets;optical character recognition;security of data;text analysis","adversarial examples;deep neural networks;hand-written digits;image classification;normal image acquisition;security threat;text driven classification;threat assessment","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fixture identification offers a possible alternative to reduce the number of sensors installed and the amount of data collected in smart housing. Fixture identification applies classifiers to label utility consumption data aggregated at the apartment level by the specific fixture that actually contributes the data, such as the shower or the kitchen sink. Successful fixture identification can be used to educate tenants, optimize the resource supply strategy, and offer a smart solution for detecting abnormal usage activities. In this paper, we report a case study of water fixture identification by using support vector machines (SVMs) to perform fixture classification. We use the Smart Housing Dataset from Clarkson University, which comprises of one academic year of tenant activities from 12 student apartments. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves an average accuracy between 78% to 87.8% for identifying hot water fixtures including kitchen sink, bathroom sink and shower. As a result, the number of smart meters per apartment is reduced from 7 to 3, one for hot water, one for cold water, and the third for toilet. The novelty of our study lies in the feature selection process, which is guided by our domain knowledge of water fixture characteristics and the correlation between water fixture usage and other user behavior in the apartments. We describe our proposed features, their rationale, and their effect on classification performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0162","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838266","Activity Analysis;Fixture Identification;Smart Housing;Support Vector Machines","Feature extraction;Intelligent sensors;Monitoring;Smart meters;Water conservation;Water resources","feature selection;home automation;pattern classification;support vector machines;water","Clarkson University;SVMs;data collection;domain knowledge based case study;feature selection process;fixture classification;resource supply strategy;smart housing dataset;smart housing environments;smart meters;smart sensors;support vector machines;utility consumption data;water fixture identification","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Predicting Future Agent Motions for Dynamic Environments","F. Previtali; A. Bordallo; L. Iocchi; S.

Inferring future agent motion is useful not only for improving tracking accuracy, but also for planning in an interactive motion task. Despite rapid advances in the area of activity forecasting, many state-of-the-art methods are still cumbersome for use in realistic robots. This is due to the requirement of having good semantic scene and map labelling, as well as assumptions made regarding possible goals and types of motion. Many emerging applications require robots with modest sensory and computational ability to robustly perform such activity forecasting in high density and dynamic environments. We address this by combining a novel multi-camera tracking method, efficient multi-resolution representations of state and a standard Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) technique, to demonstrate performance that is better than the state-of-the-art in the literature. In this framework, the IRL method uses agent trajectories from a distributed tracker and estimates a reward function within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. This reward function can then be used to estimate the agent's motion in future novel task instances. We present empirical experiments using data gathered in our own lab and external corpora (VIRAT), based on which we find that our algorithm is not only efficiently implementable on a resource constrained platform but is also competitive in terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art alternatives (e.g., up to 20% better than the results reported in [1]).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838128","Activity Forecasting;Inverse Reinforcement Learning;Multiple Object Tracking","Cameras;Estimation;Forecasting;Robot sensing systems;Tracking;Trajectory","Markov processes;cameras;decision theory;image motion analysis;image representation;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;object tracking","IRL technique;MDP model;Markov decision process;activity forecasting;agent trajectory;context-awareness;distributed tracker;dynamic environments;future agent motion prediction;interactive motion task planning;map labelling;multicamera tracking method;multiresolution state representations;realistic robots;resource constrained platform;reward function estimation;semantic scene;standard inverse reinforcement learning technique","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

LDA involves matrices eigen decomposition which can be computationally expensive in both time and memory, in particular when the number of samples and the number of features are large. This is the case for text and image data sets where the dimension can reach in order of hundreds of thousands or more. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm Fast-LDA to handle large scale data for discriminant analysis. The proposed approach uses a feature extraction method based on random projection to reduce the dimensionality and then perform LDA in the reduced space. By reducing data dimension, we reduce the complexity of data analysis.

"A Privacy-Preserving Solution for the Bipartite Ranking Problem","N. S. Faramarzi; E. Ayday; H. A. Guvenir","Comput. Eng. Dept., Bilkent Univ., Ankara, Turkey","2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","20170202","2016","","","375","380","In this paper, we propose an efficient solution for the privacy-preserving of a bipartite ranking algorithm. The bipartite ranking problem can be considered as finding a function that ranks positive instances (in a dataset) higher than the negative ones. However, one common concern for all the existing schemes is the privacy of individuals in the dataset. That is, one (e.g., a researcher) needs to access the records of all individuals in the dataset in order to run the algorithm. This privacy concern puts limitations on the use of sensitive personal data for such analysis. The RIMARC (Ranking Instances by Maximizing Area under the ROC Curve) algorithm solves the bipartite ranking problem by learning a model to rank instances. As part of the model, it learns weights for each feature by analyzing the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RIMARC algorithm is shown to be more accurate and efficient than its counterparts. Thus, we use this algorithm as a building-block and provide a privacy-preserving version of the RIMARC algorithm using homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. Our proposed algorithm lets a data owner outsource the storage and processing of its encrypted dataset to a semi-trusted cloud. Then, a researcher can get the results of his/her queries (to learn the ranking function) on the dataset by interacting with the cloud. During this process, neither the researcher nor the cloud learns any information about the raw dataset. We prove the security of the proposed algorithm and show its efficiency via experiments on real data.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838171","Bipartite Ranking Problem;Data mining;Privacy-Preserving","Algorithm design and analysis;Data privacy;Encryption;Hospitals;Receivers","cloud computing;cryptography;data privacy;graph theory;outsourcing;sensitivity analysis;storage management;trusted computing","RIMARC;bipartite ranking problem;dataset privacy;encrypted dataset processing;homomorphic encryption;multiparty computation;privacy-preserving solution;ranking instances by maximizing area under the ROC curve;semitrusted cloud;sensitive personal data","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, the independent system operators should use loss minimization methods to facilitate the implementation of the contracted power transactions. Loss minimization also will improve the security and stability of power network. In this paper, we present a novel loss minimization scheme based on oblivious network design, referred to as oblivious routing-based power flow method. The method is built on the bottom-up oblivious network routing scheme which offers multiple paths from several sources (generation units) to the specific destinations (electric load demands). Although there is limited information regarding other line flows and the current status of network, the routing scheme mathematically guarantees that the power flow solution is an approximation of the optimal solution with a specific competitiveness ratio. In fact, the Our main focus is on the power flow calculation while optimizing power losses. Compared with the recently developed power flow methods, our approach does not depend on the network topology and its performance for both radial and non-radial networks is accurate. Hence, it is suitable to use the propose approach for large-scale loss minimization while determining the power flows. This paper mainly focuses on the theoretical aspect of the proposed method. As our method is based on a novel concept from computer science discipline, we provide sufficient explanation about the preliminaries of oblivious routing scheme.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838217","Large scale network flow;loss minimization;oblivious routing scheme;power systems","Extraterrestrial measurements;Minimization;Optimization;Power system stability;Propagation losses;Routing","approximation theory;load flow;minimisation;permittivity;power markets;power system security;power system stability","bottom-up oblivious network routing scheme;independent system operator;line power loss minimization;lines medium permittivity;market contracts;nonradial network;oblivious routing-based power flow calculation method;optimal solution approximation;power network security improvement;power network stability improvement;radial network;smart power network;transmission loss","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many of the factors that influence fuel consumption, such as the road type, vehicle configuration or external environment, are difficult to influence. One of the most under-explored ways to lower the costs is training and incentivizing drivers. However, today it is difficult to measure driver performance in a comprehensive way outside of controlled, experimental setting. This paper proposes a machine learning methodology for quantifying and qualifying driver performance, with respect to fuel consumption, that is suitable for naturalistic driving situations. The approach is a knowledge-based feature extraction technique, constructing a normalizing fuel consumption value denoted Fuel under Predefined Conditions (FPC), which captures the effect of factors that are relevant but are not measured directly. The FPC, together with information available from truck sensors, is then compared against the actual fuel used on a given road segment, quantifying the effects associated with driver behavior or other variables of interest. We show that raw fuel consumption is a biased measure of driver performance, being heavily influenced by other factors such as high load or adversary weather conditions, and that using FPC leads to more accurate results. In this paper we also show evaluation the proposed method using large-scale, real-world, naturalistic database of heavy-duty vehicle operation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0194","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838298","driver performance;fuel consumption;fuel consumption truck;fuel prediction;truck","Cruise control;Databases;Force;Fuels;Roads;Sensors;Vehicles","behavioural sciences computing;driver information systems;fuel economy;learning (artificial intelligence);road vehicles","FPC;aggregate feature learning;driver behavior;driver performance;driver performance qualification;driver performance quantification;external environment;fuel-under predefined conditions;heavy-duty trucks;heavy-duty vehicle operation;knowledge-based feature extraction technique;large-scale-real-world-naturalistic database;machine learning methodology;naturalistic data;naturalistic driving situations;normalized fuel consumption value;raw fuel consumption;road segment;road type;truck sensors;vehicle configuration;weather conditions","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analysis performed on 'dirty' data may lead to erroneous insights and thereby shaping decisions poorly. The aspect of big data that deals with its correctness is known as big data veracity. Trusting the data acquired goes a long way in implementing decisions from an automated decision-making system and veracity helps to validate the data acquired. In this paper, we present our solution to the big data veracity problem using crowdsourcing techniques. Our solution involves the use of sentiment analysis, which deals with identifying the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. As a proof of concept, we have developed an app that requires users to tag tweets as per the sentiment it evokes in them. Each tweet would therefore get ratified by hundreds of our participants and the sentiment associated to the tweet gets tagged. The tagged emotion was then evaluated against the verified emotion as compared to a verified data set. This analysis was then plotted on a ROC curve and also evaluated against verified data using a Bayesian predictor trained with a trinomial function. As can be seen, an accuracy of 81% was obtained as displayed by the ROC curve and 89% through the Bayesian predictor. Also, a MAP analysis of the Bayesian predictor yields neutral sentiment as the most probable hypothesis. By doing this, we have proven that crowdsourcing of sentiment analysis is a viable solution to the problem of big data veracity and therefore an aid in making better decisions.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0184","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838288","Bayesian Predictor;Big Data;Crowdsourcing;Machine Learning;Sentiment Analysis;Tweet Mining","Bayes methods;Big data;Crowdsourcing;Data mining;Data models;Sentiment analysis;Twitter","Bayes methods;Big Data;crowdsourcing;decision making;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);text analysis","Bayesian predictor yields;Bayesian predictors;Big Data;MAP analysis;ROC curve;automated decision-making system;crowdsourcing techniques;dirty data;sentiment analysis;tagged emotion;tweets","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CNNs involve numerous hyperparameters that identify the network's structure such as depth of the network, kernel size, number of feature maps, stride, pooling size and pooling regions etc. These hyperparameters have a significant impact on the classification accuracy of a CNN. Selecting proper CNN architecture is different from one dataset to another. An empirical approach is often used in determining the near optimal value of these hyperparameters. Some recent works have tried optimization techniques for hyperparameter selection as well. In this paper, we develop a framework for hyperparameter optimization that is based on a new objective function that combines the information from the visualization of learned feature maps via deconvolutional networks, and the accuracy of the trained CNN model. Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA) is used in guiding the CNN architecture towards near optimal hyperparameters. Our proposed approach is evaluated on CIFAR-10 and Caltech-101 benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that the final architecture of a CNN obtained by our objective function outperforms other approaches in terms of accuracy. It is shown that our optimization framework contributes to increase in the depth of network, shrinks the size of stride and pooling sizes to obtain the best CNN architecture.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838122","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs);Deconvolutional Networks (deconvnet);Nelder-Mead Algorithm (NMA);hyperparameter optimization","Computer architecture;Data visualization;Image reconstruction;Kernel;Linear programming;Optimization;Training","computer vision;convolution;deconvolution;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;self-organising feature maps","CNN model training;CNNs;NMA;Nelder-Mead algorithm;automated optimal architecture;computer vision;deconvolutional networks;deep convolutional neural networks;hyperparameter optimization;image classification;image recognition;learned feature map visualization","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This difficulty in classification of self-paced data stems from the fact that the system has no clue about the start time of a control task and the data contains a large number of periods during which the user has no intention to control the BCI. Therefore, to improve the performance of the BCI, it is imperative to exploit the characteristics of the EEG data as much as possible. For motor imagery based self-paced BCIs, during motor imagery task the EEG signal of each subject goes through several internal state changes. Applying appropriate classifiers that can exploit the temporal correlation in EEG data can enhance the performance of the BCI. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which is able to capture the temporal correlation of the EEG signal. We compare the performance of our algorithm that is based on neural network conditional random fields to two well-known dynamic classifiers, the Hidden Markov Models and Conditional Random Fields and to the static classifier, Support Vector Machines.

Time and frequency based features were extracted from two-second windows of raw accelerometer data and a subset of the features, together with demographic information, was selected for classification. The activities were divided into five activity groups: non-ambulatory activities, walking, running, climbing upstairs, and climbing downstairs. Multiple classification techniques were tested for each classifier level and groups. Random forests were found to perform comparatively better at each level. Based upon those tests, a 3-level hierarchical classifier, consisting of 5 random forest classifiers, was built. At the first level, the non-ambulatory activities are separated from the rest. At the second, the ambulatory activities are divided into four activity groups. At the final level, the activities are classified individually. Accuracy on test sets was found to be approximately 87% overall for individual activities and 94% at the activity group level. These results compare favorably to contemporary results in classifying human activity.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838126","","Accelerometers;Activity recognition;Data mining;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Monitoring","accelerometers;gait analysis;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","3-level hierarchical classifier;classifier level;climbing downstairs;climbing upstairs;demographic information;frequency based features;hierarchical meta-classifier;human activity classification;human activity recognition;nonambulatory activities;random forest classifiers;running;single hip-worn triaxial accelerometer data;time based features;training data;two-second windows;walking","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new interpretation method of NMPCA by extracting a few essential structures from many differently trained and locally optimal parameters.

The algorithm achieves novelty detection and concept drift thanks to a forgetting function that allows micro-clusters and final clusters to appear, drift, merge, split or disappear.

The objective of this study is to present the validation of a recently developed extension of a fuzzy quantification subsethood-based algorithm on three sets of newly available breast cancer data. Results show that our algorithm is able to reproduce the seven biological classes previously identified, preserving their characterisation in terms of marker distributions and therefore their clinical meaning.

Out of the many possible factors for the rising cost of healthcare, claims fraud is a major contributor, but its impact can be lessened through effective fraud detection. We propose a general outlier detection model, based on Bayesian inference, using probabilistic programming. Our model provides probability distributions rather than just point values, as with most common outlier detection methods. Credible intervals are also generated to further enhance confidence that the detected outliers should in fact be considered outliers. Two case studies are presented demonstrating our model's effectiveness in detecting outliers. The first case study uses temperature data in order to provide a clear comparison of several outlier detection techniques. The second case study uses a Medicare dataset to showcase our proposed outlier detection model.

While several types of tampering including copy-move and seam carving forgery can now be successfully exposed in image forensics, there has been very little study to tackle inpainting forgery in JPEG images, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to the post-recompression attacks performed to cover or compromise original inpainting traces. To date, there is no effective way to detect inpainting image forgery under combined recompression attacks. To fill such a gap in image forensics and reveal inpainting forgery from the post-recompression attacks in JPEG images, we propose in this paper an approach that begins with large feature mining in discrete transform domain, ensemble learning is then applied to deal with the high feature dimensionality and to prevent the overfitting that generally happens to some regular classifiers under high feature dimensions. Our study shows the proposed approach effectively exposes inpainting forgery under post recompression attacks; especially, it noticeably improves the detection accuracy while the recompression quality is lower than the original JPEG image quality, and thus bridges a gap in image forgery detection.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838139","JPEG;combination forgery;image forgery detection;inpainting;recompression","Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Forgery;Image coding;Manganese;Quantization (signal);Transform coding","computer vision;image coding;image forensics","JPEG image quality;JPEG images;computer vision;discrete transform domain;ensemble learning;image forensics;image forgery detection;image tampering;inpainting forgery;inpainting image forgery;overfitting;post-recompression attacks;recompression quality;seam carving forgery","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a prediction technique targeting at early identification of potentially vulnerable software components. In the proposed scheme, the potentially vulnerable components are viewed as mislabeled data that may contain true but not yet observed vulnerabilities. The proposed hybrid technique combines the supports vector machine algorithm and ensemble learning strategy to better identify potential vulnerable components. The proposed vulnerability detection scheme is evaluated using some Java Android applications. The results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid technique could identify potentially vulnerable classes with high precision and relatively acceptable accuracy and recall.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838188","ensemble learning;mislabeled data;support vector machine;vulnerability","Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Software systems;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","Java;learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented programming;program testing;security of data;smart phones;software reliability;support vector machines","Java Android applications;early vulnerable software component identification;ensemble learning;robust software system;software testing process;supports vector machine algorithm;vulnerability detection scheme","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We evaluate the performance of the baseline system for speed dependent and speed independent performance. We show how feature mapping and feature normalization can help in enhancing the speed independent performance of machine fault diagnosis systems. We first perform feature mapping using locality constrained linear coding (LLC) which maps the input features to a higher dimensional feature space to be used as input to an SVM classifier (LLC-SVM). It is seen that there is a significant improvement in the speed independent performance of the fault identification system. We obtain an improvement of 11.81% absolute and 10.53% absolute respectively for time and frequency domain LLC-SVM systems compared to the respective baseline systems. We then explore variance normalization considering the speed specific variations as noise to further improve the performance of the fault diagnosis system. We obtain a performance improvement of 8.20% absolute and 6.71% absolute respectively over the time and frequency domain LLC-SVM systems.

Dimensional theory is one of the effective methods to describe and model emotions. Despite recent advances in affective computing, modeling continuous affective space remains a challenge. Here, we present a computational framework to study the role of functional areas of brain and band frequencies in modeling 4-D continuous affective space (Valence, Arousal, Like and Dominance). In particular, we used Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and adopted a recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach to select band frequencies and electrode locations (functional areas) that are most relevant for predicting affective space. Empirical analyses on DEAP dataset [1] reveals that only a small number of locations (7-12) and certain band frequencies carry most discriminative information. Using the selected features, we modeled 4-D affective space using Support Vector Regression (SVR). Regression analysis show that Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for Valence, Arousal, Dominance, Like are 1.40, 1.23, 1.24 and, 1.24, respectively. Besides SVR, the performance of feature fusion and ensemble classifiers were also compared to determine the robust model against technical noise and individual variations. It was observed that the prediction accuracy of the final model is up to 37% better than human judgment evaluated on same data set. Spillover effect of our approach may include design of task-specific (i.e., emotion, memory capacity) EEG headset with a minimal number of electrodes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838292","Affective space;EEG;assistive technology;feature selection;functional area of brain;robust modeling","Brain models;Computational modeling;Correlation;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction","biomedical electrodes;brain;electroencephalography;feature selection;medical signal processing;regression analysis;sensor fusion;signal classification;support vector machines","DEAP dataset;EEG recording;RFE;RMSE;SVR;arousal;band frequencies selection;brain frequencies;dimensional theory;dominance;electrode locations selection;electroencephalogram recordings;ensemble classifiers;feature fusion;like;recursive feature elimination approach;regression analysis;robust continuous 4D affective space modeling;root mean square error;support vector regression;task-specific EEG headset;valence","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fetal growth curves, which are a classical case of big healthcare data, are used in prenatal medicine to early detect potential fetal growth problems, estimate the perinatal outcome and promptly treat possible complications. However, the currently adopted curves and the related diagnostic techniques have been criticized because of their poor precision. New techniques, based on the idea of customized growth curves, have been proposed in literature. In this perspective, the problem of building customized or personalized fetal growth curves by means of big data techniques is discussed in this paper. The proposed framework introduces the idea of summarizing the massive amounts of (input) big data via multidimensional views on top of which well-known Data Mining methods like clustering and classification are applied.

Furthermore, to enrich the variability of background images, we include to the negative training set images that resemble human figures automatically obtained by the proposed methodology over images from commonly found surveillance scenarios. Extensive results show that by providing the enriched data as the input to a Convolutional Neural Network it is possible to precisely detect pedestrians in a number of public datasets.

This paper uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST database, and scenes in the CIFAR-10 database. Our proposed method preprocesses the data in the wavelet domain to attain greater accuracy and comparable efficiency to the spatial domain processing. By separating the image into different subbands, important feature learning occurs over varying low to high frequencies.

The amount of reduced congestion is intuitively proportional to the hit ratio in a WCDN. Cooperation among cache servers is strongly required to maximize the hit ratio in a WCDN where each cache server is equipped with a small-size cache storage space. In this paper, we address a content replacement problem that deals with how to manage contents in a limited cache storage space in a reactive manner to cope with a dynamic content demand over time. As a new challenge, we apply reinforcement learning, which is Q-learning, to the content replacement problem in a WCDN with coooperative caching. We model the content replacement problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and finally propose an efficient content replacement strategy to maximize the hit ratio based on a multi-agent Q-learning scheme. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed strategy contributes to achieving better content delivery performance in delay due to a higher hit ratio, compared to typical existing schemes of least recently used (LRU) and least frequently used (LFU).","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838200","Markov decision process;Q learning;content caching;machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Content distribution networks;Cooperative caching;Learning (artificial intelligence);Mathematical model;Servers;Wireless communication","Markov processes;cache storage;computer networks;cooperative communication;decision theory;file servers;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks","MDP;Markov decision process;WCDNs;cache servers;cache storage space;content replacement problem;cooperative caching;hit ratio maximization;mobile content;multiagent Q-learning scheme;network congestion reduction;reinforcement learning;small-size cache storage space;wireless content delivery network","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Four cohorts consisted of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, late mild cognitive impairment, early mild cognitive impairment, and normal control groups are classified using multinomial logistic regression fueled by the fusion of high-level and low-level features. The high-level features are extracted from the stacked autoencoders. The results show that feature fusion enhance the performance of typical autoencoders.

A set of TFBS sequences is a type of multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Thus, the hidden Markov model (HMM), as a powerful tool to model MSA, has been extensively applied in TFBS analysis. However, with the sizes of TFBS problems, training HMM in a deterministic way is computationally intractable. While the traditional heuristic Baum-Welch (BW) algorithm depends heavily on initial conditions, evolutionary optimizatioin approaches have been applied to train the model. These methods showed reasonable results but had much to improve. In this paper, we proposed a re-estimation brain storm optimization (RBSO) algorithm to train HMM for TFBS analysis. Our hybrid algorithm combines the global optimizing ability of brain storm optimization (BSO) and the advantage on convergence speed of the BW-based re-estimation operator. The algorithm has a considerable improvement compared to traditional BSO. In comparative experiments, RBSO performed significantly better than other approaches that have been used in this problem, judging from all critical criteria including log-odds score, convergence speed and robustness. The results indicate that our algorithm is very promising in extensive use in future TFBS sequencing study.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838134","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Hidden Markov models;Optimization;Robustness;Silicon;Training","bioinformatics;evolutionary computation;hidden Markov models;optimisation","BW-based re-estimation operator;HMM;MSA;RBSO algorithm;TFBS sequences;bioinformatics;computational analysis;convergence speed;evolutionary optimizatioin approach;global optimizing ability;hidden Markov model training;hybrid algorithm;log-odd score;multiple sequence alignment;re-estimation brain storm optimization algorithm;robustness analysis;transcription factor binding site analysis","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the previous link prediction studies neglect the evolution of the network over time and mainly focus on the predicting the future links based on a static features of nodes and links. However, real-world networks have complex dynamic structures and non-linear varying topological features, which means that both nodes and links of the networks may appear or disappear. These dynamicity of the networks make link prediction a more challenging task. To overcome these difficulties, link prediction in such networks must model nonlinear temporal evolution of the topological features and link occurrences information of the network structure simultaneously. In this article, we propose a novel link prediction method based on NARX Neural Network for evolving networks. Our model first calculates similarity scores based on quasi-local measures for each pair of nodes in different snapshots of the network and create time series for each pair. Then, NARX network is effectively applied to prediction of the future node similarity scores by using past node similarities and node connectivities. The proposed method is tested on DBLP coauthorship networks. It is shown that combining time information with node similarities and node connectivities improves the link prediction performance to a large extent.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838172","Evolving Networks;Link Prediction;NARX Neural Network;Node Similarities;Social Network Analysis","Adaptation models;Indexes;Neural networks;Predictive models;Time measurement;Time series analysis","information networks;neural nets;time series","DBLP coauthorship networks;NARX neural network;link prediction performance;nonlinear varying topological features;quasi-local node similarity measurement;temporal link prediction;time series","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Also, email service providers may mark such emails as spam if too many of their users are contacted in a short time-window. Optimizing email recommendation systems such that they can yield a maximum response rate for a minimum number of email sends is thus critical for the long-term performance of such a system. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation email system that not only generates recommendations, but which also leverages a combination of individual user activity data, as well as the behavior of the group to which they belong, in order to determine each user's likelihood to respond to any given set of recommendations within a given time period. In doing this, we have effectively created a meta-recommendation system which recommends sets of recommendations in order to optimize the aggregate response rate of the entire system. The proposed technique has been applied successfully within CareerBuilder's job recommendation email system to generate a 50% increase in total conversions while also decreasing sent emails by 72%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0071","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838175","CareerBuilder;Recommendation emails;Response likelihood model;job recommendation email system;meta-recommendation system","Aggregates;Collaboration;Electronic mail;Market research;Real-time systems;Recommender systems;Remuneration","electronic mail;optimisation;recommender systems","CareerBuilder's job recommendation email system;Web site;email recommendation response rates;email service providers;group affinity trends;individual activity levels;macro optimization;optimizing email recommendation systems","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) can work very well with SDN networks as it can help monitor the overall security of a network by analyzing the network as a whole and making choices to defend the network based on data from the entire network. Using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), a NIDS could monitor a network and learn from the evolving network activity of the present and react accordingly.

In this study, we aim to fill this gap and performed travel time predictions for freight vehicles at individual level using Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) models. All the features were extracted or composed from vehicles' temporally sparse trajectory data. Three routes were selected for the prediction experiments. Bayesian optimisation was adopted for model fitting while the results show that both pre-start (before trip starts) and post-start (after trip starts) predictions accuracies reach above 80%. The results also show that the prediction performance can be gradually improved by adding more mean speed estimates of traveled distance from the first 5 minutes as the real-time information. And the prediction performance can be further improved by about 2% by adding more mean speed estimates even if an unusual and non-recurring events occurred at a location of a route segment.

Many high-dimensional data, such as object or face images, lie on a union of low-dimensional subspaces which are often called manifolds. The proposed method is able to learn the structure of these manifolds by exploiting the local neighborhood arrangement around each point. It tries to preserve the local structure by minimizing a cost function that measures the discrepancy between similarities of points in the high-dimensional data and similarities of points in the low-dimensional embedding. The cost function is proposed in a way that it provides a hyper-spherical representation of points in the low-dimensional embedding. Visualizations of our method on different datasets show that it creates large gaps between the manifolds and maximizes the separability of them. As a result, it notably improves the quality of unsupervised machine learning tasks (e.g. clustering).

One particular type of representation that is very appropriate for these situations is the NetFeatureMap, which describes by means of features the relevant aspects that are inherent to the environment where the agent actuates. In renowned intelligent agents, such features are manually selected, which certainly leads to inadequate choices. In this way, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new approach, based on Association Rules, that automatically selects these features. Under the intent of investigating the efficacy of such a proposal, the authors utilize the domain of Checkers player agents as their study laboratory. The best performance of the Association Rules-based agents proves the efficacy of the present proposal.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0167","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838271","Checkers;Machine Learning;Mining Association Rules;NetFeaturemap;State Representation","Conferences;Games;Genetic algorithms;Intelligent agents;Itemsets;Proposals;Training","data mining","Checkers player agents;NetFeatureMap;association rules;intelligent agent construction;state space representation","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Component failures result in unscheduled or reactive maintenance on turbines which incurs significant downtime and, in turn, increases production cost, ultimately limiting the competitiveness of renewable energy. Thus, a critical task is the early detection of faults. To this end, we present a framework for fault detection using machine learning that uses Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data from a large 3MW turbine, supplemented with features derived from this data that encapsulate expert knowledge about wind turbines. These new features are created using application domain knowledge that is general to large horizontal-axis wind turbines, including knowledge of the physical quantities measured by sensors, the approximate locations of the sensors, the time series behaviour of the system, and some statistics related to the interpretation of sensor measurements. We then use mRMR feature selection to select the most important of these features. The new feature set is used to train a support vector machine to detect faults. The classification performance using the new feature set is compared to performance using the original feature set. Use of the new feature set achieves an F1-score of 90%, an improvement of 27% compared to the original feature set.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838160","FDD;Fault Detection;Feature selection;SCADA Data;SVM;Wind Turbine;domain knowledge;mRMR","Feature extraction;Generators;Maintenance engineering;Sensors;Time series analysis;Wind speed;Wind turbines","SCADA systems;fault diagnosis;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;power engineering computing;power generation faults;power generation reliability;support vector machines;time series;wind power plants;wind turbines","SCADA;domain knowledge;electricity production maximisation;horizontal-axis wind turbines;mRMR feature selection;power 3 MW;reactive maintenance;sensor measurements;supervisory control-and-data acquisition;support vector machine;wind turbine diagnostics;wind turbine reliability","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This problem is of particular importance in social science where news reports contain information about socially relevant incidents. Previous address extraction work focuses on web pages where addresses are separated from other text, however news reports contain addresses embedded in text. Hence, the need for different methods. This paper describes and compares three supervised learning approaches and one semi-supervised learning approach to automatically extract street addresses from news reports. Experimental results with actual news reports show performance close to that achieved for web pages and some lift in accuracy from the semi-supervised approach. These results also show that different news sources produce different outcomes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838245","Geographic Data;Machine Learning;Named Entity Extraction","Boosting;Data mining;Decision trees;Labeling;Semisupervised learning;Training;Web pages","Web sites;learning (artificial intelligence);social sciences computing;text analysis","Web pages;address extraction work;conditional random fields;news reports;semisupervised learning approach;social science;socially relevant incidents;spatial analysis;supervised learning approaches;text reports","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A modern storage system is a very complex combination of hardware and software elements and inferring its state from those of its individual components is practically impossible. Moreover, the state of the system undergoes continuous changes due to diverse and evolving workloads, frequent configuration changes and natural degradation in components. This paper presents an approach to predict the future response time of a storage system by applying a combination of machine learning techniques on the data of its internal parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the response time of a storage system directly from the time-series of its internal parameters. We present a systematic experimental setup for collecting the system data and for measuring its response time while loading the system with different standard workloads. Another novel contribution of the paper is a combination of time-series forecasting model followed by a regression model to predict the response time repeatedly in real-time. The said model is shown to be able to repeatedly predict fairly accurate 15-minutes-ahead response time values using the system data of the past 20-minutes' window. It is shown that the validation calculations typically complete within ~30 seconds on an average using a computer of moderate configurations making the presented model applicable for practically reasonable prediction horizons. The design of the model is such that it can be adaptively tuned online at regular intervals as more system data is observed.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838116","counters;forecasting;storage system;time series","Correlation;Forecasting;Load modeling;Predictive models;Radiation detectors;Time factors;Time measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;time series","counter time series data;efficient management;filer response time prediction;forecasting models;frequent configuration changes;hardware elements;machine learning;natural degradation;regression model;software elements;standard workloads;storage system;system data;time-series forecasting model","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a method for anomaly detection on syslog data, one of the most important data streams for determining system health. Syslog messages pose a difficult question for analysis because they include a mix of structured natural language text as well as numeric values. We present an anomaly detection framework that combines graph analysis, relational learning, and kernel density estimation to detect unusual syslog messages. We design an event block detector, which finds groups of related syslog messages, to retrieve the entire section of syslog messages associated with a single anomalous line. Our novel approach successfully retrieves anomalous behaviors inserted into syslog files from a virtual machine, including messages indicating serious system problems. We also test our approach on syslog messages from the Trinity supercomputer and find that our methods do not generate significant false positives.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838262","anomaly detection;high performance computing;machine learning;relational learning","Data mining;Feature extraction;Kernel;Monitoring;Natural languages;Supercomputers;Virtual machining","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;security of data;text analysis","Trinity supercomputer;anomaly detection;computing system logs;high performance computing;kernel density estimation;relational learning;syslog data;text relational synthesis;unusual syslog messages;virtual machine","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
