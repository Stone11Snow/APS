Threats come from hardware failures, software flaws, tentative probing and malicious attacks. In this paper, a new detection method, Intrusion Detection based on Unsupervised Clustering and Chaos Simulated Annealing algorithm (IDCCSA), is proposed. As a novel optimization technique, chaos has gained much attention and some applications during the past decade. For a given energy or cost function, by following chaotic ergodic orbits, a chaotic dynamic system may eventually reach the global optimum or its good approximation with high probability. To enhance the performance of simulated annealing which is to find a near-optimal partitioning clustering, simulated annealing algorithm is proposed by incorporating chaos. Experiments with KDD cup 1999 show that the simulated annealing combined with chaos can effectively enhance the searching efficiency and greatly improve the detection quality.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370702","Chaos;Intrusion detection;Partitioned clustering;Simulated annealing","Chaos;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer networks;Cost function;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;Simulated annealing;Training data","chaos;computer networks;pattern clustering;security of data;simulated annealing;telecommunication security","chaos simulated annealing algorithm;computer networks security;hardware failures;malicious attacks;near-optimal partitioning clustering;optimization technique;software flaws;tentative probing;unsupervised clustering intrusion detection method","","4","","15","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called <i>ProAnt</i> which combines ant colony optimization and progressive alignment to improve the accuracy of alignment. To avoid the errors occurring in the early stage, the algorithm first calculates the posterior probability of all pairs of characters using ant colony optimization and probabilistic consistency updating. Then the algorithm computes the final alignment using progressive method where the matching score of character pair is replaced by their posterior probability. Experimental results on data from the BAliBASE database show that our algorithm can obtain much more accurate results and higher speed than the other progressive alignment method.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370272","Ant colony optimization;Bioinformatics;Multiple sequences alignment","Ant colony optimization;Bioinformatics;Cybernetics;Databases;Evolution (biology);Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Probability;Proteins;Sequences","biology computing;molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;optimisation;probability;proteins","BAliBASE database;ProAnt;ant colony optimization;bioinformatics;molecular biology;multiple sequence alignment;posterior probability;probabilistic consistency updating;protein","","0","","27","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a solution called API invocation fingerprint detection (AIFD) to eliminate overflow vulnerability with very low performance penalty. The solution is API-hook-based, which does not require compiler extensions or operating system kernel patches. Unlike other API-hook-based solutions, which will not discover that system calls are actually invoked by malicious code in certain cases, AIFD works well in those cases. By it, programs protected will not yield control to the exploitation code, but rather enter a fail-safe state.

We apply the Revelation Principle to our analysis and characterize the optimal contract. The result shows that the project bid works best when offered to the contractor with high capability includes either a penalty scheme or a gain-sharing scheme, and the contract offered to the contractor with low capability includes only premium. Furthermore, the more attractive the gain-sharing scheme, or alternatively, the more severe the penalty is, the less the initial remuneration is and vice versa.

This method includes three steps. The first step detects the code region using the Otsu algorithm and the Least Square Method (LSM). The second method searches for the cut-off rules with a scanning approach. In the third step symbol characters are segmented from the original image.

It is found that the difference of the interest rates is negatively correlated with the difference of trading volumes between IBO and repo with the same maturity. By examining the conditional expectation and variance using joint conditional density of the interest rate difference and the trading volume difference estimated by the SNP, the trading volume difference is found capable of explaining the expected difference of interest rates, which is consistent with the pricing theory that illiquidity is rewarded by higher expected return. The trading volume difference can also explain the volatility of the interest rate difference, indicating that liquidity shares the cause of market fluctuation. Moreover, the analysis confirms the influence of the interest rate difference on the investors' behaviors by showing that larger interest rate difference will relatively enlarge the subsequent trading volume difference, which also illuminates that the inter-bank money market is still dominated by the money lenders as a whole.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370151","IBO;Interest rate;Repo;SNP;Trading volume","Conference management;Economic indicators;Financial management;Insurance;Machine learning;Pricing;Security;Statistical analysis;Stock markets;Volume measurement","banking;economic indicators;nonparametric statistics;pricing;stock markets;transaction processing","Chinese inter-bank money market;SNP;illiquidity;inter-bank offerings;interest rate difference;joint conditional density;liquidity shares;market fluctuation;pricing theory;short-term transactions;trading volume difference","","0","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For each cluster, a fuzzy rule is defined with ellipsoidal regions. Finally, the rules are adjusted by genetic algorithms. This classifier with such fuzzy rules is evaluated by two typical data sets.

Discretization based on rough set has some particular characteristics, and consistency must be satisfied for discretization of decision systems. Existing discretization methods cannot well process continuous interval-valued attributes in rough set theory. A new approach is proposed to discretize continuous interval-valued attributes in this paper, which enhances the precision of classification and accurate recognition rate in pattern recognition. In the simulation experiment, the decision table was composed of 3 features and 17 radar emitter signals, and the recognition results obtained from this discretization algorithm show that the proposed approach is valid and feasible.

After deep analyzing the properties of top-rank-k frequent patterns, we propose an efficient algorithm called FAE to mining top-rank-k frequent patterns. FAE is the abbreviation of ""Filtering and Extending "". During the mining process of FAE, the undesired patterns are filtered and useful patterns are selected to generate other longer potential frequent patterns.

It is usually required to classify large data sets with high similar characteristics in many applications. Analyzing and identifying those data is a laborious task when the methods adopted are primarily based on visual inspection. In many field applications, data sets are measured and recorded continuously using automatic monitoring equipments. Therefore, a large amount of data can be collected, and manual inspection has become an unsuitable approach to recognizing those data. This proposed hierarchical neural network integrates self-organizing feature map (SOM) networks and learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks. The SOM networks provide an approximate method for computing the input vectors in an unsupervised manner. Then the computation of the SOM may be viewed as the first stage of the proposed hierarchical network. The second stage is provided by the LVQ networks based on a supervised learning technique that uses class information to improve the quality of the classifier from the first stage. The multistage hierarchical network attempts to factorize the overall input vector into a number of small groups, each of which requires very little computation.

It is difficult to explicitly specify what constitutes a financial distress and the intrinsic relationship between financial distress and a failed bank. This paper attempts to apply a fuzzy system named FCMAC-TVR to bank failure analysis. The FCMAC-TVR network is a generic network, in which the numerical operation is carried out by neural network, but the readable rules are generated by TVR inference scheme. The trained FCMAC-TVR operates as a bank failure classification and prediction system and the formulated fuzzy rule base shed lights on the inherent contributions of the selected financial covariates to bank failure.

It's important and significant to perform load transfer for improving the service reliability of distribution network and decreasing outage loss. However, distribution load transfer operation was mostly completed by manual work and experience in the past. Several analysis program modules, such as network analysis and connectivity analysis, are adopt to deal with outage of distribution network on the basis of distribution GIS. The power flow is stored in the database as the attributes of line switches for load transfer analysis. When a system outage such as fault and overload occurs, the load transfer is then executed to find the switches to be operated by the reactive Tabu Search (RTS) method while subjected to the system operation rules. By the proposed method, using the program modules, the network topology can be updated according to switches status. Since all the system facilities are stored in the GIS database according to the actual spatial coordinates, it provides practical information for the system operators and crews to allocate and operate switches easily. Finally load transfer scheme will be given including switches operation and theirs sequence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the integrated GIS system with application programs using reactive Tabu search for distribution operation, an urban distribution system is selected for a case study.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370369","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370369","Distribution network;GIS;Load transfer;Reactive Tabu search","Conductors;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Geographic Information Systems;Machine learning;Spatial databases;Substations;Switches;Transformers;Visual databases","geographic information systems;load flow;power distribution reliability;power engineering computing;reactive power;search problems","analysis program module;distribution load transfer analysis;distribution network GIS database;geographic information system;network topology;power flow;reactive Tabu search method;urban distribution system","","2","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Analytic and simulation results showed that rule-based reasoning acts much like uses the concept of absolute accuracy. Instance-based inferring method uses relative accuracy to identify varied difficult levels in words. Since scoring a word's difficulty via absolute accuracy is not always applicable, the grading system accomplished the task by the instance-based approach.

To address this, we propose constrained TKE, which is an OOS extension of TKE capable of learning such a mapping function. This is achieved by including the mapping in the objective function optimized by the TKE algorithm. More broadly, this mapping function can be applied in other data reduction methods as an OOS extension. Furthermore, to improve the accuracy of predictions in case where new samples are presented in batch, a refinement strategy is introduced by exploiting the similarity between new samples which is often ignored by other methods.

GGCI based on GGD uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of images space, then applies the extended nearest neighbor approach to cluster images. Different from the usual nearest neighbor approach, GGCI considers the density around the nearest points within manifolds embedded in high dimensional image space, which better reflects the intrinsic geometric structure of manifold. Experimental results suggest that the proposed GGCI approach achieves lower error rates in image clustering.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370401","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370401","Geodesic distance;Image clustering;Manifold","Cybernetics;Euclidean distance;Geophysics computing;Level measurement;Machine learning;Manifolds;Nearest neighbor searches;Photoreceptors;Retina;Robustness","geometry;image processing;pattern clustering","extended nearest neighbor;generalized geodesic distance;global geometric clustering for image;image clustering;image distance","","2","","9","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
