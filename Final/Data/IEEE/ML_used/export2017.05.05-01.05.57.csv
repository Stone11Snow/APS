However, conventional real-time scheduling algorithms ignore the applications' security requirements. Tao Xie, Xiao Qin et al. have proposed a security-aware scheduling strategy, or SAREC, and scheduling algorithm SAREC-EDF, which integrates security requirements into scheduling for real-time applications. However, there are some disadvantages in his algorithms. The scheduling problem is a maximization optimization problem with constraints, but SAREC-EDF does not compare its solutions in global scope, just like greedy algorithm, as a result, its last result maybe not the best one. In this paper, on the one hand, we originally construct two mathematic models for the real-time scheduling problems considering security requirements. On the other hand, we propose a new security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm based on genetic algorithm (SAREC-GA), which can improve overall security level of the system by up to approximately 25% on the base of SAREC-EDF when real-time requirement is guaranteed. Experiment data and simulated results show the feasibility and availability of the proposed models and method.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370684","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370684","Genetic algorithm;Real-Time scheduling;Real-Time systems;Security awareness","Application software;Cryptography;Cybernetics;Data security;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Real time systems;Scheduling algorithm","constraint theory;cryptography;genetic algorithms;real-time systems;scheduling","encryption;genetic algorithm;mathematic models;maximization optimization problem;security-aware real-time scheduling algorithm;timing constraints","","1","","12","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional approaches to this so-called personalization problem adopt predefined formats to describe the customer requirements. This always leads to distortion in eliciting requirement information and thus inaccurate recommendations. In this paper, we propose a personalized recommendation system using association rule mining and classification in e-commerce. Customer requirements are extracted from text documents and transformed into a set of significant phrases. Allowing the transformed transaction records, a set of association rule are mined from database using Apriori algorithm. CBA-CB algorithm is applied to produce the best rules out of the whole set of rules. The best classifiers are then generated after the test and validation of those rules, aimed to predict the item labels for new customer requirements and thus assigns the corresponding class labels to the customer.

The typical MANET routing protocols of IETF are shortest routing protocols, that is, the least hops but do not consider the energy aware problem. Because the ad hoc network is an energy constrained system with the portable devices, it is a very important metric to evaluate the routing protocols whether which have a longer network lifetime or not. Based on the mobile node energy level and using the different forward tactics, this paper presents an energy level based routing protocol - ELBRP. The routing protocol not only makes the system energy consumption low but also prolongs the system lifetime and improves the delay characteristic. In this paper, the proof of correctness and complexity analysis of ELBRP are given. This paper compares the performance of existing protocols AODV, RDRP and proposed ELBRP via simulation. The simulation result shows that ELBRP has a better delay performance, a lower energy consumption and longer network lifetime than the other two and provides an available approach to ad hoc networks routing.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370700","Ad hoc networks;Energy constrained;Energy level;Routing protocol","Ad hoc networks;Batteries;Cybernetics;Delay;Energy consumption;Energy states;Machine learning;Mobile ad hoc networks;Network topology;Routing protocols","ad hoc networks;mobile radio;routing protocols","MANET routing protocols;energy constrained routing protocol;mobile ad hoc networks","","4","","11","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The advantages of S_CMAC_GBF are simpler addressing structure, lower consuming memory space and easier hardware application, and it will not degrade the accuracy of the original input. For achieving better learning efficiency and speeding the hardware output, this paper proposed the local learning to perform more efficient learning. In local learning, every area only use better relative weights rather than use all weights, so the computation can be speed up in learning. Because in the hardware output, it only needs to calculate better relative weights, therefore, the learning speed is greatly increased. Although local learning lowers down the output accuracy of S_CMAC_GBF, the advantage of using S_CMAC_GBF is not affected, especially in the hardware application; the accuracy is almost the same.

The paper proposed a risk-based evolutionary (RBE) bidding strategy for agents participating in multiple auctions, which is flexible and adaptive to the changing environment of online auctions. Two models were developed to determine the optimize values for different parameters of the strategy. The first one is a risk-based bidding strategy model constructed by combining two tactic functions, in which some of behavior-relative parameters adjusted adaptively according to the change of agent's risk attitude.

The functions of them are still largely unclear, but some of them have been shown to cause human disease, and have relationship with regulatory functions. Thus, detecting tandem repeats has considerable significance. Because of the undetermined length of repeat pattern and indels and substitutions existing in a tandem repeat, identifying a tandem repeat in genomic sequence data is a difficult task. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed, which is based on the autoregressive (AR) model. We analyze residual errors of the AR model with different orders for a DNA sequence. According to changes of residual errors, we can determine whether a sequence contains a tandem repeat and what pattern size is.

This paper presents a Chinese-Portuguese query translation for CLIR based on a machine translation (MT) system that parses constraint synchronous grammar (CSG). Unlike traditional transfer-based MT architectures, this model only requires a set of CSG rules for modeling syntactic structures of two languages simultaneously to perform the translation.

The comprehensive evaluation network has a simple and intuitively understandable structure, and is not only used to tune the weights distribution and membership functions of fuzzy systems, but also used to tune the compound operators continuously. Its learning techniques can automate this process and substantially reduce development time and cost while improving performance. Therefore, it can be used to a wide range of complex comprehensive evaluation problems.

However, it is time and memory consuming for large datasets. This study proposed a parameter-free method to accelerate NNR. This method employs a class-based clustering algorithm to divide the training data to several clusters with respective members belonging to the same class. Cluster representations are extracted clustering border data based on the nearest neighbors between the different class clusters. Since the cluster representations are the clustering border data rather than the clustering centers, the predicting accuracy will not be affected by removing a cluster's internal data. In the predicting phase, the nearest neighbor search area is narrowed down by referring to a distance between a testing data and its nearest cluster. Thus the predicting process is speeded up. In this paper, the performance of the proposed method was evaluated and compared with NNR, K-NNR, and LIBSVM by using 5 benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed parameter-free classification algorithm is very easy to operate and gives consideration to speed and accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370457","Accelerating;Classification;Clustering;Nearest neighbor;Parameter-Free","Acceleration;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Machine learning;Nearest neighbor searches;Training data","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class-based clustering;cluster representations;fast nearest neighbor classification;nearest neighbor rule;parameter-free classifier","","1","","18","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, a better technique for alert analysis and management is imperative for promoting the network security. We have developed a two layered PA-based (primitive attack-based) correlation approach to tackle this problem. The first layer does PA construction by integrating related alerts into proper PAs. The second layer is the attack subplan-based correlation layer, which does attack scenario correlation from recognized PAs by employing attack subplan templates to guide the correlation process. This paper focuses on the second layer, by discussing how to automatically construct attack subplan templates, how to eliminate invalid attack subplan templates, how the attack subplan templates can direct the process of scenario correlation, and how a proper fusion process can reduce superfluous attack information. Our experiments show this correlation approach can effectively unearth the attack strategies of the attackers, reduce the cognitive loading of the network manager in comprehending alert reports, and also relieve him from the time consuming and skillful analysis task required in manually analyzing alerts to construct correlation knowledge.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370455","Attack ontology;Attack scenario;Attack subplan template;Intrusion detection;Primitive attacks","Cities and towns;Computer science;Computer security;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Information security;Intrusion detection;Machine learning;National security;Protection","computer network management;security of data","alert analysis;alert management;attack subplan-based attack scenario correlation;attack subplan-based correlation layer;event granularities;information assets protection;network security;primitive attack-based correlation approach;security sensors","","5","","19","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
