"Recognition of Electromyographic Signals Using Cascaded Kernel Learning Machine","Y. H. Liu; H. P. Huang; C. H. Weng","Chung Yuan Christian Univ., Chungli","IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","20070618","2007","12","3","253","264","Electromyographic (EMG) signals recognition is a complex pattern recognition problem due to its property of large variations in signals and features. This paper proposes a novel EMG classifier called cascaded kernel learning machine (CKLM) to achieve the goal of high-accuracy EMG recognition. First, the EMG signals are acquired by three surface electrodes placed on three different muscles. Second, EMG features are extracted by autoregressive model (ARM) and EMG histogram. After the feature extraction, the CKLM is performed to classify the features. CKLM is composed of two different kinds of kernel learning machines: generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) algorithm and support vector machine (SVM). By using GDA, both the goals of the dimensionality reduction of input features and the selection of discriminating features, named kernel FisherEMG, can be reached. Then, SVM combined with one-against-one strategy is executed to classify the kernel FisherEMG. By cascading SVM with GDA, the input features will be nonlinearly mapped twice by radial-basis function (RBF). As a result, a linear optimal separating hyperplane can be found with the largest margin of separation between each pair of postures' classes in the implicit dot product feature space. In addition, we develop a digital signal processor (DSP)-based EMG classification system for the control of a multi-degrees-of-freedom prosthetic hand for the practical implementation. Based on the clinical experiments, the results show that the proposed CKLM is superior to other frequently used methods, such as k-nearest neighbor algorithm, multilayer neural network, and SVM. The best EMG recognition rate 93.54% is obtained by CKLM.","1083-4435;10834435","","10.1109/TMECH.2007.897253","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4244390","Autoregressive model (ARM);electromyography (EMG);generalized discriminant analysis (GDA);prehensile postures' classification;prosthetic hand;support vector machine (SVM)","Electrodes;Electromyography;Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Pattern recognition;Signal processing algorithms;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","autoregressive processes;digital control;electromyography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;prosthetics;radial basis function networks;signal classification;support vector machines","EMG classifier;EMG histogram;EMG recognition;autoregressive model;cascaded kernel learning machine;electromyographic signals recognition;feature extraction;generalized discriminant analysis;linear optimal separating hyperplane;multidegrees-of-freedom prosthetic hand;pattern recognition;radial-basis function;support vector machine","","56","","33","","","June 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We compared the pattern similarity amongst the methods and validated the predictions using known SNPs on chromosome 22. Parameterization of both machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms was critical to their performance. Memory usage was broadly constant amongst the pattern discovery algorithms, but the CPU running time varied significantly between deterministic and probabilistic pattern discovery methods, i.e., on average, probabilistic methods run 19 times slower than deterministic methods. This is the first demonstration of SNP prediction, as well as the first comparison of machine learning and pattern discovery algorithms in SNP prediction studies.","","POD:0-7695-3032-X","10.1109/GrC.2007.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4403141","","Biological cells;Biophysics;Computer science;DNA;Humans;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Sampling methods;Sequences","biology computing;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","DNA sequences;K-nearest neighbours;human single nucleotide polymorphisms;machine learning;pattern discovery;random forests","","2","","13","","","2-4 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, existing models give very loose error bounds. This explains why classification systems generally rely on experimental validation for their claims on prediction accuracy. In this talk we will revisit this problem and explore the idea of developing a new generalization error model based on the assumption that only prediction accuracy on unseen points in a neighbourhood of a training point will be considered, since it will be unreasonable to require a pattern classifier to accurately predict unseen points ""far away"" from training samples. The new error model makes use of the concept of sensitivity measure for a multiplayer feedforward neural network (Multilayer Perceptron or Radial Basis Function Neural Network). It could be demonstrated that any knowledgebase system represented by a set of features may be simplified by reducing its feature set using such a model.

This type of problem has been widely studied in the soft computing community. In recent years, neural networks have been successfully applied to surface reconstruction and classification problems involving scattered data. However, due to the iterative nature of training a neural network, the resulting high cost in computational time limits the implementation of machine learning based methods in many real world applications (for example, navigation applications in unmanned aerial vehicles) that require fast generation of terrain models. A recently proposed machine learning method, the extreme learning machine (ELM), is able to train single-layer feed forward neural networks with excellent speed and good generalization. In this paper, we present terrain modeling using various machine learning methods, and we compare the performances of these methods with ELM. We also present a comparison of terrain modeling performances between ELM and the popular choice of terrain and surface modeling technique, the Delaunay triangulation with linear interpolation. Our results show that machine learning using ELM offers a potential solution to terrain modeling problems with good performances","","CD-ROM:1-4214-042-1; POD:1-4244-0341-3","10.1109/ICARCV.2006.345471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4150400","Back Propagation;Delaunay Triangulation;ELM;Machine Learning;Terrain Modeling","Computational efficiency;Computer networks;Function approximation;Iterative methods;Learning systems;Machine learning;Navigation;Neural networks;Scattering;Surface reconstruction","feedforward neural nets;function approximation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);mesh generation;terrain mapping","Delaunay triangulation;extreme learning machine;feedforward neural networks;function approximation;generalization;linear interpolation;machine learning;soft computing;surface classification;surface modeling;surface reconstruction;terrain modeling","","0","","17","","","5-8 Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One method was shown to produce the same solution as an SVM in a batch mode, but the other, which stores the set of support vectors, was known to have a larger generalization error. In this study, we derive learning curves of the latter method, assuming that the probability the set of support vectors is updated is proportional to the current margin and so is the decrease of the margin in the update, too.

For most real robot implementations, however, it is often the case that the control hierarchy is hand-coded. As a result, the development process is often time intensive and error prone. In this paper, we explore the use of an experts learning approach, based on Auer and colleagues' Exp3 (1995), to help overcome some of these limitations. In particular, we develop a modified learning algorithm, which we call rExp3, that exploits the structure provided by a control hierarchy by treating each state machine as an 'expert'. Our experiments validate the performance of rExp3 on a real robot performing a task, and demonstrate that rExp3 is able to quickly learn to select the best state machine expert to execute. Through our investigations in these environments, we identify a need for faster learning recovery when the relative performances of experts reorder, such as in response to a discrete environment change. We introduce a modified learning rule to improve the recovery rate in these situations and demonstrate through simulation experiments that rExp3 performs as well or better than Exp3 under such conditions.","1050-4729;10504729","CD-ROM:1-4244-0602-1; POD:1-4244-0601-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2007.363635","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4209399","","Automata;Computer science;Control systems;Delay;Machine learning;Mobile robots;Robot control;Robotics and automation;Two-term control;Velocity control","finite state machines;learning (artificial intelligence);robots","autonomous robot;control hierarchy;expert advice;hierarchical state machines;learning algorithm;state machine selection learning","","2","","13","","","10-14 April 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The technique is based on principles similar to Tarantula but addresses its main flaw: its difficulty to deal with the presence of multiple faults as it assumes that failing test cases execute the same fault(s). The improvement we present in this paper results from the use of C4.5 decision trees to identify various failure conditions based on information regarding the test cases' inputs and outputs. Failing test cases executing under similar conditions are then assumed to fail due to the same fault(s). Statements are then considered suspicious if they are covered by a large proportion of failing test cases that execute under similar conditions. We report on a case study that demonstrates improvement over the original Tarantula technique in terms of statement ranking. Another contribution of this paper is to show that failure conditions as modeled by a C4.5 decision tree accurately predict failures and can therefore be used as well to help debugging.","1071-9458;10719458","POD:0-7695-3024-9","10.1109/ISSRE.2007.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4402205","","Debugging;Decision trees;Failure analysis;Laboratories;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Reliability engineering;Software quality;Software reliability;Testing","","","","14","","26","","","5-9 Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The goal is to incorporate the results of the learning engine into a predicate calculus-based reasoning engine so that radios can remember lessons learned in the past and act quickly in the future. We also investigate the differences between reasoning and learning, and the fundamentals of when a particular application requires learning, and when simple reasoning is sufficient. The basic architecture is consistent with cognitive engines seen in AI research. The focus of this article is not to propose new machine learning algorithms, but rather to formalize their application to cognitive radio and develop a framework from within which they can be useful.

First, we consider the problem of selecting the best ""pure"" sorting algorithm as a function of the characteristics of the input data. We used machine learning algorithms to compute a function for each target machine that, at runtime, is used to select the best algorithm. Our second approach generalizes the first approach and can build new sorting algorithms from a few primitive operations. We use genetic algorithms and a classifier system to build hierarchically-organized hybrid sorting algorithms.

In an attempt to overcome these major roadblocks, we combine tools capable of producing accurate results over broad ranges of conditions, such as off-line data mining and machine learning, with the approximate, well-understood deterministic methods, such as sensitivity-based methods.

The subjective test scores for modified images are obtained with-out referring to their original images (called 'no reference'). Here, the problem of quality estimation is transformed to a sparse data classification problem using a sparse extreme learning machine (S-ELM). The S-ELM classifier estimate the posterior probability of a given image. Here, the mean opinion score ('visual quality') of an image is derived using the predicted class number and their estimated posterior probability. The experimental results prove that the estimated visual quality emulate the mean opinion score very well.

To enable knowledge sharing and reuse, current middleware make the assumption that a single, universally accepted, ontology exists with which queries and assertions are exchanged. We argue that such an assumption is unrealistic. Rather, different communities will speak different `dialects'; in order to enable cross-community interactions, thus increasing the range of services and information available to users, on-the-fly translations are required. In this paper we introduce MaLM, a middleware for pervasive computing devices that exploits an unsupervised machine learning technique called self-organising map to tackle the problem of ontology heterogeneity. At any given time, the MaLM instance running on a device operates in one of two possible modes: `training', that is, MaLM is autonomically learning how to group together semantically closed concepts; and `expert', that is, given in input a query or assertion expressed in a foreign dialect, MaLM identifies the concept, expressed in the device mother-tongue, that most closely represents it","","POD:0-7695-2788-4","10.1109/PERCOMW.2007.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4144877","","Application software;Computer science;Educational institutions;Knowledge representation;Machine learning;Middleware;Mobile communication;Ontologies;Pervasive computing;Protocols","knowledge based systems;self-organising feature maps;ubiquitous computing;unsupervised learning","knowledge-based interactions;ontology heterogeneity;pervasive computing devices;self-organising map;unsupervised machine learning technique","","1","","20","","","19-23 March 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work focuses on helping to understand the molecular basis of catalysis by exploring the nature of catalytic residues, their environment and characteristic properties in a large data set of enzyme structures and using this information to predict enzyme structures' active sites. A machine learning approach that performs feature extraction, clustering and classification on a protein structure data set is proposed. The 6,376 residues directly involved in enzyme catalysis, present in more than 800 proteins structures in the PDB were analyzed.

Several methods are tested on the same training and test corpora. The experimental results show that the CRF models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

As interest in applications for natural languages and data mining has increased, the machine learning of graph grammars poses a prime area of research. A unified graph grammar construction, parsing, and inference tool is proposed. Existing technologies can provide a context-free tool. However, a general context-sensitive tool has been elusive.

To learn a well-performed hypothesis, a large amount of diagnosed samples are required. Although the samples can be easily collected from routine medical examinations, it is usually impossible for medical experts to make a diagnosis for each of the collected samples. If a hypothesis could be learned in the presence of a large amount of undiagnosed samples, the heavy burden on the medical experts could be released. In this paper, a new semisupervised learning algorithm named Co-Forest is proposed. It extends the co-training paradigm by using a well-known ensemble method named Random Forest, which enables Co-Forest to estimate the labeling confidence of undiagnosed samples and easily produce the final hypothesis. Experiments on benchmark data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Case studies on three medical data sets and a successful application to microcalcification detection for breast cancer diagnosis show that undiagnosed samples are helpful in building CAD systems, and Co-Forest is able to enhance the performance of the hypothesis that is learned on only a small amount of diagnosed samples by utilizing the available undiagnosed samples.","1083-4427;10834427","","10.1109/TSMCA.2007.904745","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4342802","Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD);co-training;ensemble learning;machine learning;microcalcification cluster detection;random forest;semisupervised learning","Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Computer aided diagnosis;Labeling;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Semisupervised learning;Supervised learning;Technological innovation","cancer;gynaecology;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical expert systems;pattern clustering;tumours","breast cancer diagnosis;co-forest semi supervised learning algorithm;computer-aided diagnosis;machine learning technique;medical data sets;medical expert system;microcalcification cluster detection;random forest ensemble method;routine medical examination;undiagnosed samples","","98","","47","","","Nov. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The audio is synthesized from MIDI files, providing exact information of onset events. We test three state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, support vector machines (SVM), neural networks (NN), and Naive Bayes (NB) with Ada boosting, for learning and classifying audio onsets. We found that SVMs perform best in general, based on the average of training and 10-fold cross validation errors as the evaluation criterion. We then test the SVM and NN, the two best performing methods, on Bach's Prelude in C major BWV 943, transposed to different keys and time-stretched to various tempi. The error rates ranged from 23.91% (when training set key and tempo equals those of the test set) to 37.22% (when the key is off by four accidentals) and 37.91% (when tempo is 20 beats per minute faster).

Almost all learning machines used in information processing are singular, for example, layered neural networks, normal mixtures, binomial mixtures, Bayes networks, hidden Markov models, Boltzmann machines, stochastic context-free grammars, and reduced rank regressions are singular. In singular learning machines, the likelihood function can not be approximated by any quadratic form of the parameter. Moreover, neither the distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator nor the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution, even if the number of training samples tends to infinity. Therefore, the conventional statistical learning theory does not hold in singular learning machines. This paper establishes the new mathematical foundation for singular learning machines. We propose that, by using resolution of singularities, the likelihood function can be represented as the standard form, by which we can prove the asymptotic behavior of the generalization errors of the maximum likelihood method and the Bayes estimation.

In this paper, we propose to apply i) hierarchical classifiers, ii) hierarchical classifiers in combination with semi-supervised learning and iii) hierarchy expansion for question classification for improving the precision. When the number of classes is large, the performance of classification algorithms may be affected. In order to improve the performance by reducing the number of classes for each classifier, we propose to use hierarchical classifiers according to the question taxonomy, in which each internal node is attached a classifier. We try to use semi-supervised learning to consume unlabeled questions with expectation to improve the performance of classifiers in the hierarchy. We explored different applications of learning methods in for each classifier of the hierarchy: a) supervised learning for all classifiers at all levels; b) semi-supervised learning for the first-level classifier and supervised learning for other classifiers; c) semi-supervised learning for all classifiers. The experiments show that the first method (a) has better results than those of flat classification; the second method (b) produces better results than those of the first method while the effort to increase the performance of fine classifiers in the last method (c) is not so successful. As another effort, we propose to automatically group question classes by clustering in order to expand a node which has a large number of classes in the question taxonomy.

One of the practical approaches to open domain QA consists in extracting facts from free text offline and using a lookup mechanism when answering user's questions online. This approach is related to natural language interfaces to databases (NLIDBs) that were studied extensively from the 1970s to the 1990s. NLIDB systems employed a range of techniques, from simple pattern-matching rules to formal logical calculi such as the lambda calculus, but most were restricted to specific domains. In this paper we describe a machine learning approach to querying tabular data for QA which is not restricted to specific domains. Our approach consists of two steps: for an incoming question, we first use a classifier to identify appropriate tables and columns in a structured database, and then employ a free-text retrieval to look up answers. The system uses part-of-speech tagging, named-entity normalization and a statistical classifier trained on data from the TREC QA task.

While the SOA paradigm provides flexibility and agility to better respond to changing business requirements, the task of assessing the reliability of SOA-based systems is challenging, especially for composite services. However, deriving high confidence reliability estimates for mission- critical systems can require huge costs and time. This paper presents a reliability assessment and prediction model for SOA-based systems. The services are assumed to be realized with reuse and logical composition of components. The model uses AI reasoning techniques on dynamically collected failure data of each service and its components as one of the evidences together with results from random testing. Memory-Based Reasoning technique and Bayesian Belief Networks are used as reasoning tools to guide the prediction analysis. The least tested and ""high usage "" input subdomains are identified and necessary remedial actions are taken depending on the predicted results from the proposed model.

Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer programs is an important step to unveil proteins' three dimensional conformation and functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical influence over biological study. The explanation of how a decision is made during prediction is also important for improving protein structure prediction and guiding the ""wet experiments"".

Traditionally, however, either only one of the objectives is adopted as the cost function or multiple objectives are aggregated to a scalar cost function. This can mainly attributed to the fact that most conventional learning algorithms can only deal with a scalar cost function. Over the last decade, efforts on solving machine learning problems using the Pareto-based multi-objective optimization methodology have gained increasing impetus, particularly thanks to the great success of multi-objective optimization using evolutionary algorithms and other population-based stochastic search methods. It has been shown that Pareto-based multi-objective learning approaches are more powerful compared to learning algorithms with a scalar cost functions in addressing various topics of machine learning, such as clustering, feature selection, improvement of generalization ability, knowledge extraction, and ensemble generation. This talk provides first a brief overview of Pareto-based multi-objective machine learning techniques. In addition, a number of case studies are provided to illustrate the major benefits of the Pareto-based approach to machine learning, e.g., how to identify interpretable models and models that can generalize on unseen data from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions. Three approaches to Pareto-based multi-objective ensemble generation are compared and discussed in detail.

The RBF neural network is further used as a nonlinear modeler. We discuss the threshold selection and give a procedure for threshold estimation using out-of sample validation.

The proposed method is an improved version of the regular neuro-fuzzy TSK fuzzy inference system. For the proposed method, first, the data that are processed are grouped by the k-means clustering method. The membership of arbitrary input for each fuzzy rule is then derived through an ELM, followed by a normalization method. At the same time, the consequent part of the fuzzy rules is obtained by multiple ELMs. At last, the approximate prediction value is determined by a weight computation scheme. For the ELM-based TSK fuzzy inference system, two extensions are also proposed to improve its accuracy. The proposed methods can avoid the curse of dimensionality that is encountered in backpropagation and hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) methods. Moreover, the proposed methods have a competitive performance in training time and accuracy compared to three ANFIS methods.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2007.901375","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4305290","<formula formulatype=""inline""><tex>$k$</tex></formula>-means clustering;Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS);Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy inference system;extreme learning machine (ELM)","Clothing;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Gold;Machine learning;Neural networks;Sun;Textiles","backpropagation;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural nets;inference mechanisms","ANFIS;ELM;Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference system;backpropagation;extreme learning machine;fuzzy logic;fuzzy rule;hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;k-means clustering method;learning machines;neural network technique;normalization method","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Fuzzy Logic;Logistic Models;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Systems Integration","64","","25","","","Oct. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The weighting rule of AdaBoost is modified to deal with the overfitting problem which may be even worse when boosting strong classifiers, and the strength of SVM is weakened by adaptively adjusting the kernel parameters, then we proposed the algorithm WwBoost.

We present a new host-based intrusion detection approach, based on analyzing the behavior of the computer to detect the presence of unknown malicious code. The new approach consists on classification algorithms that learn from previous known malcode samples which enable the detection of an unknown malcode. We performed several experiments to evaluate our approach, focusing on computer worms being activated on several computer configurations while running several programs in order to simulate background activity. We collected 323 features in order to measure the computer behavior. Four classification algorithms were applied on several feature subsets.

In this paper, we propose to involve machine learning to improve the segmentation process using the watershed transform.

Fortunately, analytic bounds on, or approximations to, the leave-one-out cross-validation error are often available, providing an efficient and generally reliable means to guide model selection. However, the degree to which the incorporation of prior knowledge improves performance over that which can be obtained using ""standard"" kernels with automated model selection (i.e. agnostic learning), is an open question.
