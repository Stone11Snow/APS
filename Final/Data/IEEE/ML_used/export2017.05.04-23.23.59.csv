Elders","(email: rory.telford@strath.ac.uk)","IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Increasing prevalence of DC sources and loads has resulted in DC distribution being re-considered at a micro-grid level. However, in comparison to AC systems, the lack of a natural zero crossing has traditionally meant that protecting DC systems is inherently more difficult – this protection issue is compounded when attempting to diagnose and isolate fault conditions. One such condition is the series arc fault, which poses significant protection issues as their presence negates the logic of overcurrent protection philosophies. This paper proposes the IntelArc system to accurately diagnose series arc faults in DC systems. IntelArc combines time-frequency and time domain extracted features with hidden Markov models to discriminate between nominal transient behavior and arc fault behavior across a variety of operating conditions. Preliminary testing of the system is outlined with results showing that the system has the potential for accurate, generalized, diagnosis of series arc faults in DC systems.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2016.2633335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762215","DC power systems;Fault diagnosis;arc discharges;hidden Markov models;wavelet transforms","Circuit faults;Fault diagnosis;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Impedance;Time-frequency analysis;Transient analysis","","","","","","","","20161129","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The current trend is to efficiently separate the waste in order to appropriately deal with it. The separation must be done as early as possible in order to reduce the contamination of waste by other materials. The need to automate this process is a significant facilitator for waste companies. This research aims to automate waste sorting by applying machine learning techniques to recognize the type of waste from their images only. Two popular learning algorithms were used: deep learning with convolution neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM). Each algorithm creates a different classifier that separates waste into 3 main categories: plastic, paper and metal using only 256 × 256 colored png image of the waste. The accuracies of the two classifiers are compared in order to choose the best one and implement it on a raspberry pi 3. The pi controls a mechanical system that guides the waste from its initial position into the corresponding container. However, in this paper we only compare the two machines learning techniques and implement the best model on the pi in order to measure its speed of classification. SVM achieved high classification accuracy 94.8% while CNN achieved only 83%. SVM also showed an exceptional adaptation to different types of wastes. NVIDIA DIGITS was used for training the CNN while Matlab 2016a was used to train the SVM. The SVM model was finally implemented on a Raspberry pi 3 where it produced quick classification, taking on average 0.1s per image.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5281-3; POD:978-1-5090-5282-0","10.1109/IMCET.2016.7777453","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777453","","Biological neural networks;Computers;Convolution;Neurons;Sorting;Support vector machines;Training","environmental science computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;production engineering computing;separation;support vector machines;waste handling;waste reduction","SVM;autonomous waste sorting;convolution neural networks;deep learning;machine learning;support vector machines;waste contamination reduction;waste separation","","","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While an attractive approach to this problem is to use formal models of protocols in combination with mathematical optimization, such methods are often limited by either poor scalability or approximations of the models, leading to weak usability for realistic use-cases. In order to overcome those drawbacks, an emerging trend has been to use machine learning based techniques, which offer accurate predictions of the performance of network protocols. Our contribution in this paper is a general methodology which combines the statistical analysis of realistic data with an optimization algorithm in order to plan and optimize network topologies. One benefit of our approach is that it does not require prior knowledge on the studied topology and protocol. As an application example of our method, we address the challenge of placing virtual machines in a given topology with the general goal of optimizing the average bandwidth of TCP flows. In our numerical evaluation, our approach results in an overall average increase of the performance of TCP flows by more than 50%.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8991-4; POD:978-1-4673-8992-1; USB:978-1-4673-8990-7","10.1109/NETWKS.2016.7751147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751147","","Analytical models;Bandwidth;Mathematical model;Network topology;Optimization;Protocols;Topology","learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical analysis;optimisation;protocols;telecommunication computing","TCP flows;automatic performance optimization;configuration parameters;machine learning based techniques;mathematical optimization;network performances;network protocols;network topology;numerical evaluation;optimization algorithm;statistical analysis","","","","","","","26-28 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Calculation of moments necessitates measurement of forces and moment arms about joints during walking. Dynamically changing moment arms can be calculated from motion trackers either optically or with wireless inertia sensing units, but the measurement of forces is more problematic. Either the patient has to walk over a force platform or a force sensing device has to be built into the sole of the shoes. One possible means of registering abnormal joint moments without the restrictions due to force measurements is to predict moments from the movement of body segments using advanced machine learning techniques. To test the viability of this approach, we aimed to predict the frontal plane internal knee abduction moment form 3D Euler angles of the ankle, knee, hip and pelvis during a single gait cycle of 31 patients with alkaptonuria. Four machine-learning algorithms were used in our experiment to predict moments namely: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Linear Regression and Multilayer Perceptron neural network. Based on performance measures of prediction (R2, root mean squared error and area under the recall curve), the random forest algorithm performed best but this was also the slowest by a factor of 10. Considering both performance and speed, the Multilayer Perceptron neural network method was superior with R2, root mean square of error, area under the recall curve and required training time of 0.8616, 0.0743, 0.874 and 730 ms, respectively.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727882","alkaptonuria;knee moment;machine learning;osteoarthritis;prediction","Correlation;Hip;Knee;Machine learning algorithms;Pelvis;Prediction algorithms;Training","decision trees;diseases;gait analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;regression analysis","3D Euler angles;R2;abnormal joint moments;advanced machine learning techniques;alkaptonuria;area under the recall curve;body segment movement;decision tree;dynamically changing moment arms calculation;force measurement;force platform;force sensing device;frontal plane internal knee abduction moment prediction;gait cycle;knee loading prediction;knee pain predictors;linear regression;machine learning methods;moments calculation;moments prediction;multilayer perceptron neural network;optical motion trackers;osteoarthritis;random forest algorithm;root mean squared error;wireless inertia sensing units","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Solvency II requires European insurance companies to conduct consistent evaluation and continuous monitoring of risks-a process which is computationally complex and extremely resource-intensive. To this end, companies are required to equip themselves with adequate IT infrastructures, facing a significant outlay. In this paper we present the design and the development of a Machine Learning-based approach to transparently deploy on a cloud environment the most resource-intensive portion of the Solvency II-related computation. Our proposal targets DISAR(R), a Solvency II-oriented system initially designed to work on a grid of conventional computers. We show how our solution allows to reduce the overall expenses associated with the computation, without hampering the privacy of the companies' data (making it suitable for conventional public cloud environments), and allowing to meet the strict temporal requirements required by the Directive. Additionally, the system is organized as a self-optimizing loop, which allows to use information gathered from actual (useful) computations, thus requiring a shorter training phase.

HT severity mainly stems from its low-cost and stealthy nature where the HT only functions at a strict condition to purposely alter the logic or physical behavior for leaking secrets. This fact makes HT detection very challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel HT detection technique based on machine learning approach. The described solution is constructed over one-class SVM and is shown to be more robust compared to the template based detection techniques. An unsupervised approach is also applied in our solution for mitigating the golden model dependencies. To evaluate the solution, a practical HT design was inserted into an AES coprocessor implemented in a Xilinx FPGA. Based on the partial reconfiguration, the HT size can be dynamically changed without altering cipher part, which helps to precisely evaluate the HT influence.

One-class classification, to learn a model that properly describes the normal samples, is one of many anomaly detection approaches that have shown promising performance in real-world applications. Extreme learning machines (ELMs), a recent developed machine learning technique, have outperformed SVMs and other machine learning methods for many machine learning problems. ELMs have been originally used for binary or multiclass classification and regression as well. Using ELM for one-class classification has emerged very recently, but has not been widely explored for real world applications. In this paper, we adopt ELMs to a new application domain - industrial machine condition monitoring. More specifically, we apply one-class ELMs for more accurate anomaly detection of gas turbine combustors. We evaluate different one-class ELMs and compare them against other one-class classifiers. Using a real-world gas turbine combustor anomaly detection as the case study, we demonstrate that one-class ELMs can be more effective than other one-class classification algorithms in early detecting gas turbine combustor anomalies.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727567","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727567","anomaly detection;combustor;extreme learning machine;gas turbine;one-class classification","Kernel;Maintenance engineering;Neurons;Temperature measurement;Training;Wind turbines","condition monitoring;gas turbines;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;mechanical engineering computing;pattern classification","ELM;SVM;binary classification;domain-industrial machine condition monitoring;gas turbine combustor anomaly detection;machine learning methods;machine learning problems;maintenance costs;multiclass classification;one-class classification algorithms;one-class classifiers;one-class extreme learning machines;power plant operations","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The monitoring system is a great help to quickly gain insight of the system from all sides. By the monitoring system, the administrator can evaluate various metrics on the different fields in one single arranged page and understands the whole picture of current system status from brief reports. Although this kind of problem solving flow does well in certain circumstance, it may still be too late for some critical BSS. To further improve the speed of trouble-shooting, administrator sets the thresholds to each performance metric. Those thresholds are set based on knowledge and experience of administrator. If the performance metric collected from the system is over the set threshold, monitoring system will send alerts to administrator to inform current BSS status, and he can check the system status in advance before the situation get worse. This kind of traditional approach finds the problem about ten minutes before the emergency break out. In our work, we leverage a machine learning approach to determine emergency earlier.

"Detecting heterogeneity in PV modules from massive real-world “step” I-V curves: A machine learning approach","Y. Hu; E. Schnabel; M. Kohl; R. H. French; T. J.

In the laboratory-based experiments, we show that heterogeneity in a PV module can be detected from “step” IV curves that are collected under non-uniform irradiance. On the other hand, heterogeneous cell performance can lead to bypassing even under uniform irradiance. This hypothesis was tested using a fabricated 4-cell mini-module with cells that were engineered to have highly heterogeneous front contact resistivity and a SPICE-based circuit model. We find good agreement between the experimentally determined curve and simulations. We illustrate a technique for automatically classifying and analyzing massive real-world I-V curves and for gaining insights into the performance of PV modules. By classifying 3.7 million I-V curves, we demonstrate the occurrence of “step” I-V curves under two irradiance conditions: under non-uniform irradiance condition, mirror augmented PV module in Cleveland, Ohio; and under uniform irraidance condition at the Negev Desert, Israel, Gran Canaria, Spain and Mount Zugspitze, Germany. Under the uniform irradiance conditions, we found that the percentage of “step” I-V curves in all three I-V curve types gradually increase over time. This indicates the electrical characteristics within a PV module change from homogeneous to heterogeneous. Since the “step” I-V curves have a lower maximum power and a lower fill factor than normal I-V curves at the same irradiance condition, the heterogeneity in I-V module directly cause power degradation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2724-8; POD:978-1-5090-2725-5","10.1109/PVSC.2016.7749594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7749594","","Integrated circuit modeling;Meteorology;Mirrors;Photovoltaic cells;Resistance;SPICE;Temperature measurement","SPICE;electrical resistivity;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power semiconductor diodes;solar cells","4-cell mini-module;SPICE-based circuit model;automatic classification;bypass diodes;electrical characteristics;fill factor;forward bias;heterogeneity detection;heterogeneous cell performance;heterogeneous front contact resistivity;machine learning;mirror augmented PV module;nonuniform irradiance condition;power degradation;step current-voltage curves;uniform irraidance condition","","1","","","","","5-10 June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A preventive scheduling of available resources in response to these events can be of significant importance in reducing the related undesirable aftermath. An Event-driven Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (E-SCUC), as discussed in this paper, can be used as a viable tool to schedule available grid resources in minimizing possible supply interruptions during component outages as a consequence of these events. An accurate estimation of the component outages, however, is of ultimate importance in ensuring a viable resource schedule. In this work, a machine learning method, based on regression and data mining, is proposed to model the power system components that can potentially fail during an anticipated extreme event. The proposed model is trained on artificial and historical data of storm-related damages, where the prediction is further used in the proposed E-SCUC problem. Numerical simulations on the standard IEEE 30-bus system in various hurricane path and intensity scenarios illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3270-9; POD:978-1-5090-3271-6","10.1109/NAPS.2016.7747873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7747873","Event-driven operation;extreme events;machine learning;power system resilience;resource scheduling security-constrained unit commitment","Bandwidth;Estimation;Hurricanes;Kernel;Load modeling;Numerical models;Power systems","data mining;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);numerical analysis;power generation dispatch;power generation scheduling;power system reliability;power system security","E-SCUC problem;IEEE 30-bus system;data mining;electric power systems;event driven security constrained unit commitment;machine learning method;outage estimation;preventive scheduling;regression analysis","","","","","","","18-20 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nowadays, developing indoor positioning systems has become an attractive research topic due to the increasing demands on ubiquitous positioning. WiFi technology has been studied for many years to provide indoor positioning services. The WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach are widely used in the literature. These systems attempt to find the perfect match between the user fingerprint and pre-defined set of grid points on the radio map. However, Fingerprints are duplicated from available Access Points (APs) and interference, which increase number of matched patterns with the user's fingerprint. In this research, the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is utilized to improve the performance and to reduce the computation cost of the WiFi indoor localization systems based on machine learning approach. All proposed methods were developed and physically realized on Android-based smart phone using the IEEE 802.11 WLANs. The experimental setup was conducted in a real indoor environment in both static and dynamic modes. The performance of the proposed method was tested using K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine classifiers. The results show that the performance of the proposed method outperforms other indoor localization reported in the literature.

These architectures are validated using seizure prediction from electroencephalogram (EEG) as an application example. To improve the accuracy of proposed stochastic classifiers, a novel approach based on linear transformation of input data is proposed for EEG signal classification using linear SVM classifiers.

The machine learning algorithms that we propose for assessing sedentary behavior will allow us to re-examine existing accelerometer data to better understand the association between sedentary time and health in various populations.

Numerous research models have been proposed in network traffic classification to classify different types of applications and achieve significant accuracy results. However, no work has been done to classify WeChat messages flow traffic. WeChat is a free instant messaging application. Hence, it is very important to classify WeChat text messages traffic. In this paper, we classify WeChat messages flows traffic using two different data sets, which are first captured using Wireshark tool from two different locations network environments, Harbin Institute of Technology Lab and Jinyuan Hotel and then 50 features are extracted from captured traffic. After that four machine learning algorithms SVM, C4.5, Bayes Net and nalve Byes are applied to classify the WeChat text messages traffic. Experimental results show that all classifiers give very high accuracy results using two different data sets. Using Jinyuan data set SVM and C4.5 decision tree algorithm give 100% accuracy result as compared to Bayes Net and Naive Bayes algorithm and using Harbin Institute of Technology Lab data set all classifiers give 99.7% high accuracy results.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3765-0; POD:978-1-5090-3766-7","10.1109/ICITCS.2016.7740379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740379","","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Software;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Training","Bayes methods;Web services;decision trees;electronic messaging;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","Bayes Net algorithm;C4.5 decision tree algorithm;Harbin Institute of Technology Lab;Jinyuan Hotel;Naive Bayes algorithm;SVM;WeChat text messages service flow traffic classification;Wireshark tool;feature extraction;free instant messaging application;machine learning;network management;network security;network traffic classification","","","","","","","26-26 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With these large numbers, having lower level information has both privacy and computational limitations. We propose a black box approach to investigating the longevity of aggregated response of a virtual power plant using historic bidding and aggregated behaviour with machine learning techniques. The two supervised machine learning techniques investigated and compared in this paper are, multivariate linear regression and single hidden layer artificial neural network (ANN). Both techniques are used to model a relationship between the aggregator portfolio state and requested ramp power to the longevity of the delivered flexibility. Using validated individual household models, a smart controlled aggregated virtual power plant is simulated. A hierarchical market-based supply-demand matching control mechanism is used to steer the heating devices in the virtual power plant. For both the training and validation set of clusters, a random number of households, between 200 and 2000, is generated with day ahead profile scaled accordingly. Further, a ramp power (power deviation) is assigned at various hours of the day and requested to hold for the remainder of the day. Using only the bidding functions and the requested ramp powers, the ramp longevity is estimated for a number of different cluster setups for both the artificial neural network as well as the multi-variant linear regression. It is found that it is possible to estimate the longevity of flexibility with machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is, on average, able to estimate the longevity with a 15% error. However, there was a significant improvement with the ANN algorithm achieving, on average, a 5.3% error. This is lowered 2.4% when learning for the same virtual power plant. With this information it would be possible to accurately offer res- dential VPP flexibility for market operations to safely avoid causing further imbalances and financial penalties.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1919-9; POD:978-1-5090-1920-5","10.1109/EPEC.2016.7771738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7771738","Aggregation;Demand response;Energy flexibility;Heating Systems;Neural Networks;Prediction;Smart Grids","Heat pumps;Linear regression;Load management;Mathematical model;Power generation;Space heating;Water heating","demand side management;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;power markets;power plants;power system planning;regression analysis;virtualisation","ANN;aggregator portfolio;day ahead profile;demand response;end-user systems;historic bidding;machine learning techniques;multivariate linear regression;single hidden layer artificial neural network;smart controlled aggregated virtual power plant;supply-demand matching control mechanism;virtual power plants forecasting flexibility","","","","","","","12-14 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a lot of time is consumed in execution and learning from the humongous datasets. In the last decade General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) have revolutionized the computing industry by their capability to process data in parallel and hence speedup the entire process. This paper aims to showcase a generic model which can be used as a reference to convert implementations of serial machine learning algorithms to parallel implementations. Because of varying types of machine learning algorithms, the model was developed with a broad mindset to support most of them. After development, for the purpose of testing the correctness of the model, a few machine learning algorithms of different kinds are experimented with. They were processed step-by-step in accordance with the model and their original serial implementations in C and the resultant parallel implementations in CUDA were compared w.r.t. the computation time. Also, the serial implementations and parallel implementations were mapped to check if they gave the exact same results i.e. whether perfectly correct parallelism was obtained. The results obtained showed that the model when used for parallelization, gave absolutely correct parallel implementations, without any losses due to parallelization. The model gave highly efficient outcomes for non-neural network based supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms with a speedup of 146× achieved in K-NN algorithm and 75× achieved in K-Means algorithm. The model also gave a correct parallel implementation for Backpropagation algorithm, however here the parallel implementation could not execute faster than the serial implementation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1022-6; POD:978-1-5090-1023-3; Paper:978-1-5090-1020-2; USB:978-1-5090-1021-9","10.1109/CSITSS.2016.7779378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7779378","K-means;K-nearest neighbor (K-NN);backpropogation;graphics processing unit (GPU);machine learning","Acceleration;Computational modeling;Hardware;Irrigation;Optimization;Reliability;Robots","backpropagation;graphics processing units;parallel architectures;unsupervised learning","CUDA;GPGPU;K-Means algorithm;K-NN algorithm;backpropagation;general purpose graphics processing units;machine learning;nonneural network based unsupervised learning;parallel data processing;parallel implementation;serial machine learning algorithms","","","","","","","6-8 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Stability assessment is an important component of power system planning. Due to generation technology diversity and inherent intermittent availability of most renewable sources in future grids, the conventional method to conduct stability analysis based on choosing a limited number of worst case operating points becomes infeasible. One way to capture the stability profile of a future grid scenario is to scan a large number of possible operating conditions. However, to achieve fast scanning and make the time consuming numerical study computationally affordable, the simulation burden has to be reduced. To that end, we propose a fast scanning approach based on feature selection and weighted clustering to reduce simulation burden when conducting stability scanning over a long period of time. We propose a novel algorithm based on conventional Relief-F and K-means techniques.

Hence, the search for classification methods that are both accurate and efficient is highly relevant.

"Fast Mode and Partition Decision Using Machine Learning for Intra-Frame Coding in HEVC Screen Content Coding Extension","F. Duanmu; Z. Ma; Y.

Extensive statistical studies and complexity evaluations are conducted to explore the distribution of different coding modes and their complexities. The proposed encoder scheme is designed based on the results from these studies. Firstly, a CU is classified as either a natural image block (NIB) or a screen content block (SCB). An SCB only goes through SCC modes at the current CU level. An NIB is further classified as “ partitioned” or “ non-partitioned”. The partitioned block will bypass current level intra modes. The non-partitioned block is classified as “ directional” or “ non-directional” and only goes through a subset of intra candidates. Decision tree classifiers are designed with chosen features that can distinguish different types of blocks. Furthermore, additional mode/partition checking is terminated once the current mode coding rate is lower than a statistics-based threshold.

In this paper, we propose the use of graph theory for representing position of amino acids of the protein as graph nodes, and graph edges connect amino acids that are close to each other under a given threshold.

The proposed work includes capturing a skin image and getting its type as output. The steps followed for implementing the proposed work includes acquisition of the skin images then preprocessing them to convert into gray scale and then obtaining various features like mean, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis using Law's filter and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) feature extraction techniques. After obtaining these features, they are given as input to classifier like Artificial Neutral Network (ANN). The input image set used is of 197 images grouped into training and testing set. The skin images were gathered from various areas of Pune, India and were rated as normal, good or bad skin from a standard dermatologist in the range of 1 to 10.

Additionally estimating in-advance the expected formal's complexity promotes a lot of potential tricks and clever setup techniques to overcome the initial push-button capacity limitation of the formal verifies and improve their capabilities to handle designs with higher complexity. This paper illustrates the application of regression machine learning (ML) techniques to build an estimation model for the cost of formal verification. Up to 10,000 formal verification runs on RTL designs with good varieties of design/properties attributes are used to learn the relationship between HW designs and the final formal cost in terms of formal run time. We demonstrate the use of Ridge-Regression to decide on the bias-variance trade-off during the regression-model design step as well as the application of Lasso-Regression for the feature selection phase.

However, when we apply them to data mining from large data, we need huge computation time for fitness evaluation. In our previous studies, we have proposed parallel distributed implementation of fuzzy GBML for fuzzy classifier design from large data. The basic idea of our parallel distributed implementation is to divide not only a population but also a training data set into N sub-populations and N training data subsets, respectively. A pair of a sub-population and a training data subset is assigned to each of N CPU cores in a workstation or a cluster. This dual division strategy achieved a quadratic speedup (i.e., N<sup>2</sup> times faster than the use of a single CPU core) while maintaining the generalization ability on test data. In this paper, we apply our parallel distributed implementation to GAssist which is a non-fuzzy Pittsburgh-style GBML algorithm.

These problems are often characterized by imbalanced data, the presence of which often leads to inaccurate predictive models, since the distribution of testing data may differ from that of training data while learning, leading to misclassification of the response variable. The primary focus of the paper is on Credit Risk which is defined as the probability of defaulting on the loan or credit acquired from a banking or financial institution. The base risk is that of the loss of primary principal and interest, disruption of cash flows and increased collection costs. Loan Default is an uncommon phenomena, henceforth we obtain the imbalanced data.

A machine-learning approach is then developed. Bias correction for calculated power is conducted using linear regression method. During this procedure, categorization in accordance to critical parameters is employed to obtain a fine approximation.

However, this is not always a good strategy especially when training patterns from different classes are heavily overlapping in the pattern space. A simple but practically useful idea is the use of a reject option. In this case, the pattern space is partitioned into (M+1) disjoint subspace where the classification of new patterns is rejected in the (M+1)th subspace. In this paper, we discuss the design of fuzzy rule-based classifiers with a reject option. The rejection subspace is specified by a threshold value for the difference of a kind of matching degrees between the best matching class and the second best matching class. The important research question is how to specify the threshold value. We examine the following two approaches: One is manual specification after designing a fuzzy rule-based classifier, and the other is simultaneous multiobjective optimization of a threshold value and a fuzzy rule-based classifier. In the latter approach, we use three objectives: maximization of the correct classification, and minimization of the rejection and the complexity of the classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0626-7; POD:978-1-5090-0627-4; USB:978-1-5090-0625-0","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737854","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737854","Fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;evolutionary multiobjective optimization;reject option","Complexity theory;Error analysis;Fuzzy systems;Minimization;Optimization;Training;Training data","fuzzy set theory;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification","classifier design;fuzzy rule-based classifiers;machine learning;multiobjective fuzzy genetics;multiobjective optimization;pattern space;reject option;training patterns","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an integrative and intelligent machine learning framework is proposed through combining cloud computing, machine learning and heuristic optimization. Essentially, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method is extended with the Grid Search (GS) or Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) as a heuristic optimization method together with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Feature Noise Filter (FNF) to construct quantitative investment forecasting models for efficient executions on cloud computing platforms. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, the Hang Seng Index and some major stocks listed on the Hong Kong Exchange are predicted using the constructed models on a daily basis.

Our previous research [1] achieves more than 80% of accuracy in application identification when not using DPI (Deep Packet Inspection). In this paper, we propose an extension to the previous method using DPI and on-line machine learning with pre-classification of traffic based on ports to improve the inference accuracy. The evaluation shows that our method can identify more than 92% of traffic accurately using DPI when learning period is 5 days, and achieves up to 93% of accuracy at best for general traffic. When limited to HTTP, the accuracy becomes 96%. This result shows that we can build a system identifying more than 92% of the applications adaptively in relatively short training period, e.g., 5 days of training, even when new applications emerge.

Hence, mobile devices are also source of valuable and confidential company information. Accordingly, there is a growing need for malware detection methods and tools to protection mobile devices against attacks targeting them. In this study, an automated feature-based static analysis method is applied to detect malicious mobile applications on Android devices. By utilizing the metadata of applications on the official market and an online free malware scanner, the feasibility of a mobile malware detection model using free public sources and having quite acceptable accuracy rates is shown. As opposed to previous studies considering only the requested permissions as feature set, additional market metadata including but not limited to application category, download number, developer name, and average rating are included in the analysis as the feature set for training supervised classification algorithms. Based on an experimental evaluation of the majority voting of antivirus (AV) engines on the free online AV community, applications in the training set are labeled as malicious or benign. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm is chosen as supervised learning algorithm for the detection task. In addition, as filter-based algorithms, Chi-Square, Information Gain and ReliefF feature selection methods are used for overcoming potential overfitting problems.

This two-phase study explored the design of visualizations to aid ML diagnosis. In phase 1, twelve ML practitioners were asked to diagnose a model using ten state-of-the-art visualizations; seven design themes were identified. In phase 2, several design themes were embodied in an interactive visualization. The visualization was used to engage practitioners in a participatory design exercise that explored how they would carry out multi-step diagnosis using the visualization.

Greedy Stepwise feature search method has been incorporated for searching informative feature of the Enron email dataset. The comparison has been done among different machine learning classifiers (such as Bayesian, Naïve Bayes, SVM (support vector machine), J48 (decision tree), Bayesian with Adaboost, Naïve Bayes with Adaboost). The concerned classifiers are tested and evaluated on metric (such as F-measure (accuracy), False Positive Rate, and training time). By analysing all these aspects in their entirety, it has been found that SVM is the best classifier to be used. It has the high accuracy and the low false positive rate.

Real-world data is incomplete and ambiguous; moreover, its rapid increase in size complicates the analysis process. Therefore, data reduction techniques that consider data uncertainty are highly required. In this paper, our objective is to conceptually reduce uncertain data without losing information. Two reduction methods are proposed that are mainly rooted in formal concept analysis theory. The first method is targeting approximate data reduction; it uses the result of Baixeries et al. for detecting functional dependencies by transforming an instance of a database into an approximate formal context. The second method is based on fuzzy data reduction that employs the algorithm of Elloumi et al. in fuzzy data reduction using Lukasiewicz logic. These reduction methods have been compared to three other machine learning based reduction algorithms through a classification case study of breast cancer data. Classification accuracy, root mean square error and reduced data size have been reported to show that reduced training sets using our methods result in very accurate classifiers with minimal data size. Moreover, the reduced data has the advantage of decreasing communication time and memory space.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0626-7; POD:978-1-5090-0627-4; USB:978-1-5090-0625-0","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737914","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737914","approximate reduction;formal concept analysis;fuzzy reduction;uncertain data analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Birds;Context;Databases;Formal concept analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Uncertainty","cancer;data mining;data reduction;formal concept analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","breast cancer data classification;communication time;formal concept analysis theory;functional dependencies;fuzzy data reduction;knowledge discovery;machine learning;memory space;root mean square error;uncertain training data set conceptual reduction","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve these problems, a novel architecture called CNN-ELM has been proposed here. Its core architecture is based on a local image (local receptive field) version of the ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) adopting random feature learning. Using MATLAB 2015a, classification experiments using the raw image data as input, show a comparable or mostly better classification performance compared to the BP trained CNN, with its training speed up to 200 times faster on MNIST, NORB, and CIFAR-10 datasets. Pedestrian detection experiments using INRIA datasets also exhibits much faster training than the BP trained CNN without sacrificing detection performance.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727403","CNN-ELM;Convolutional Neural Network (CNN);Deep Learning;Extrememe Learning Machine (ELM);Pedestrian Detection","Convolution;Kernel;Machine learning;Neural networks;Object recognition;Training;Training data","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematics computing;neural nets;object detection;object recognition;pedestrians;random processes","CNN classifiers;CNN-ELM architecture;ELM;MATLAB 2015a;convolutional neural network classifiers;extreme learning machine;image recognition;local image;local receptive field;object recognition;pedestrian detection;random feature learning;raw image data","","1","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A machine learning-based system is designed to analyze years of sunspot and flare data to create associations that can be represented using computer-based learning rules. An imaging-based real-time system that provides automated detection, grouping, and then classification of recent sunspots based on the McIntosh classification is also created and integrated within this system. The properties of the sunspot regions are extracted automatically by the imaging system and processed using the machine learning rules to generate the real-time predictions.

In this paper, four traditional machine learning algorithms are tested on sonar data with a high amount of false alarms together with synthetic submarine echoes. It is shown that some of the algorithms can outperform simple signal to noise ratio (SNR) thresholding by a significant amount, but that the performance is highly dependent on the parameter values chosen for each algorithm.

Building on a C++ and MPI based middleware system Smart, we present a machine-learning library prototype (Smart-MLlib). Like MLlib, Smart MLlib allows machine learning implementations to be invoked from a Scala program, and with a very similar API. To test our library's performance, we built four machine-learning applications that are also provided in Spark's MLlib: k-means clustering, linear regression, Gaussian mixture models, and support vector machines.

In this paper, we perform an alternative investigation of Shepperd et al.'s data. We observe that (a) research group shares a strong association with other explanatory variables (i.e., the dataset and metric families that are used to build a model); (b) the strong association among these explanatory variables makes it difficult to discern the impact of the research group on model performance; and (c) after mitigating the impact of this strong association, we find that the research group has a smaller impact than the metric family. These observations lead us to conclude that the relationship between the research group and the performance of a defect prediction model are more likely due to the tendency of researchers to reuse experimental components (e.g., datasets and metrics). We recommend that researchers experiment with a broader selection of datasets and metrics to combat any potential bias in their results.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2016.2553030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450669","Software quality assurance;defect prediction;researcher bias","Analysis of variance;Analytical models;Data models;Interference;Measurement;NASA;Predictive models","learning (artificial intelligence);software fault tolerance;software quality","machine learning;researcher bias;software defect prediction;software quality assurance","","2","","","","20160411","Nov. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Attacks using a compromised server could be DoS attacks, Phishing attacks, E- mail spamming and so on. This paper questions whether the attacks from a compromised SSH server be segregated from other attacks using the network flows. In this work, we categorize SSH attacks into two types. The first category consists of all attack activities after a successful compromise of an SSH server. We name it as ""severe"" attacks. The second type includes all attacks leading to a successful compromise. It consists of SSH port scanning, SSH Brute-force attack, and compromised SSH server with no activities. The second category is named as ""not-so-severe"" attacks. We employ Machine Learning algorithms, namely, Naive Bayes learner, Logistic Regression, J48 decision tree, and Support Vector Machine to classify these attacks. Suitable features were selected based on domain knowledge, literature survey, and feature selection technique to evaluate the performance of machine learning algorithms using the metrics accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and F-score.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3765-0; POD:978-1-5090-3766-7","10.1109/ICITCS.2016.7740316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740316","","Decision trees;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Servers;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;cryptography;decision trees;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines","DoS attacks;F-score;J48 decision tree;SSH attacks classification;SSH brute-force attacks;SSH port scanning;SSH server;attack activities;cryptographic algorithm;domain knowledge;e-mail spamming;feature selection;logistic regression;machine learning algorithms;metrics accuracy;naive Bayes learner;network flows;not-so-severe attacks;phishing attacks;secure shell;support vector machine","","","","","","","26-26 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In our paper, we would like to present a novel approach to build a network based intrusion detection system using machine learning approach. We have proposed a two-tier architecture to detect intrusions on network level. Network behaviour can be classified as misuse detection and anomaly detection. As our analysis depends on the network behaviour, we have considered data packets of TCP/IP as our input data. After, pre-processing the data by parameter filtering, we build a autonomous model on training set using hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Further, data gets classified as regular traffic pattern or intrusions using KNN classification. This reduces cost-overheads. Misuse detection is conducted using MLP algorithm. Anomaly detection is conducted using Reinforcement algorithm where network agents learn from the environment and take decisions accordingly. The TP rate of our architecture is 0.99 and false positive rate is 0.01. Thus, our architecture provides a high level of security by providing high TP and low false positive rate. And, it also analyzes the usual network patterns and learns incrementally (to build autonomous system) to separate normal data and threats.","","CD:978-1-4673-9936-4; DVD:978-1-4673-9937-1; Electronic:978-1-4673-9939-5; POD:978-1-4673-9940-1; USB:978-1-4673-9938-8","10.1109/ICEEOT.2016.7755404","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7755404","Anomaly detection;Hierarchical clustering;KNN Classification;MLP;Misuse detection;Reinforcement Learning","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Data models;Intrusion detection;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data;transport protocols","KNN classification;MLP algorithm;TCP/IP;anomaly detection;autonomous model;data preprocessing;hierarchical agglomerative clustering;intrusion detection system architecture;machine learning approach;malicious attack detection;misuse detection;network behaviour classification;parameter filtering;reinforcement algorithm;two-tier architecture;two-tier network","","","","","","","3-5 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Model-based Machine Learning Approach to Probing Autonomic Regulation from Nonstationary Vital-Signs Time Series","L. w. Lehman; R. Mark; S. Nemati","Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.","IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","","2016","PP","99","1","1","Physiological variables, such as heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respiration (RESP), are tightly regulated and coupled under healthy conditions, and a break-down in the coupling has been associated with aging and disease. We present an approach that incorporates physiological modeling within a switching linear dynamical systems (SLDS) framework to assess the various functional components of the autonomic regulation through transfer function analysis of nonstationary multivariate time series of vital signs. We validate our proposed SLDS-based transfer function analysis technique in automatically capturing (i) changes in baroreflex gain due to postural changes in a tilt-table study including 10 subjects, and (ii) the effect of aging on the autonomic control using HR/RESP recordings from 40 healthy adults. Next, using HR/BP time series of over 450 adult ICU patients, we show that our technique can be used to reveal coupling changes associated with severe sepsis (AUC=0.74, sensitivity=0.74, specificity=0.60). Our findings indicate that reduced HR/MAP coupling is significantly associated with severe sepsis even after adjusting for clinical interventions (P<=0.001). These results demonstrate the utility of our approach in phenotyping complex vital-sign dynamics, and in providing mechanistic hypotheses in terms of break-down of autoregulatory systems under healthy and disease conditions.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2636808","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776821","Baroreflex;HRV;Physiological Control Systems;RSA;Switching Linear Dynamical Systems","Couplings;Heart rate;Oscillators;Physiology;Switches;Time series analysis;Transfer functions","","","","","","","","20161207","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper proposed a distributed and networked machine learning platform on smart gateways based smart grid. It can analyze occupants motion, provide short-term energy forecasting and allocate renewable energy resource. Firstly, occupant profile is captured by real-time indoor positioning system with Wi-Fi data analysis; and the energy profile is extracted by real-time meter system with electricity load data analysis. Then, the 24-hour occupant profile and energy profile are fused with prediction using an online distributed machine learning with real-time data update. Based on the forecasted occupant motion profile and energy consumption profile, solar energy source is allocated on the additional electricity power-grid in order to reduce peak demand on the main electricity power-grid. The whole management flow can be operated on the distributed smart gateway network with limited computation resource but with a supported general machine-learning engine. Experiment results on real-life datasets have shown that the accuracy of the proposed energy prediction can be 14.83% improvement comparing to SVM method. Moreover, the peak load from main electricity power-grid is reduced by 15.20% with 51.94% energy cost saving.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4075-9; POD:978-1-5090-4076-6","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2016.7778809","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7778809","","Data analysis;Data mining;Energy management;Logic gates;Real-time systems;Smart grids;Solar energy","energy consumption;energy management systems;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;renewable energy sources;smart power grids;wireless LAN","SVM method;Wi-Fi data analysis;distributed machine learning;distributed smart gateway network;electricity load data analysis;electricity power-grid;energy consumption profile;energy cost saving;energy prediction;management flow;networked machine learning;occupant cognition;occupant motion profile;real-time data analysis;real-time meter system;realtime indoor positioning system;renewable energy resource;short-term energy forecasting;smart-grid energy management;solar energy source","","","","","","","6-9 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Feature selection is a problem of choosing a subset of relevant features to increase the execution speed of the algorithm and the classification accuracy. It also removes inappropriate features to increase the precision and improve the performances. There has been much effort for solving the feature selection problem up to now and many researchers have proposed and developed many feature selection algorithms in this purpose. In this paper, we propose a new feature selection method based on neural network and machine learning. This new algorithm tends to highlight the best features among existing ones: new weighting-based method of the input features is used in the neural network to choose the best features. Performances show that this method selects the best features on simulated data.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5281-3; POD:978-1-5090-5282-0","10.1109/IMCET.2016.7777431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7777431","classification;feature selection;machine learning;neural network;performance","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Classification algorithms;Conferences;Machine learning algorithms;Neurons","digital simulation;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","classification accuracy;feature selection method;machine learning;neural network;simulated data;weighting-based method","","","","","","","2-4 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
