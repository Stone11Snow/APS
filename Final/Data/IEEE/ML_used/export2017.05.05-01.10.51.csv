We propose a novel method for over-complete blind source separation. Two powerful source separation techniques have been combined, independent component analysis and binary time-frequency masking. Hereby, it is possible to iteratively extract each speech signal from the mixture. By using merely two microphones we can separate up to six mixed speech signals under anechoic conditions. The number of source signals is not assumed to be known in advance.

Univ., Prague, Czech Republic","Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'05)","20060320","2005","","","6 pp.","","Devising algorithms for learning from multi-relational data is currently considered an important challenge. The wealth of traditional single-relational machine learning tools, on the other hand, calls for methods of 'propositionalization', i.e. conversion of multi-relational data into single-relational representations. A major stream of propositionalization algorithms is based on the construction of truth-valued features (first-order logic atom conjunctions), which capture relational properties of data and play the role of binary attributes in the resulting single-table representation. Such algorithms typically use backtrack depth first search for the syntactic construction of features complying to user's mode/type declarations. As such they incur a complexity factor exponential in the maximum allowed feature size. Here we present a polynomial-runtime alternative based on an efficient reduction between the feature construction problems on the propositional satisfiability (SAT) problem, such that the latter involves only Horn clauses and is therefore efficiently solvable.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.27","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607460","","Logic programming;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Polynomials;Relational databases;Spatial databases;Stochastic processes","Horn clauses;backtracking;computability;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);relational databases;tree searching","backtrack depth first search;binary attributes;complexity factor exponential;first-order logic atom conjunctions;multirelational data;polynomial-runtime alternative;propositional satisfiability problem;propositionalization algorithms;relational features;single-relational machine learning tools;single-relational representations;single-table representation","","0","","7","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, in classification systems, feature selection based on MI estimation between features and class labels helps to identify the most useful features directly related to the classification performance. MI estimation is extremely difficult and imprecise in high dimensional feature spaces with an arbitrary distribution. We propose a framework using ICA and sample-spacing based entropy estimators to estimate MI. In this framework, the higher dimensional MI estimation is reduced to independent multiple one-dimensional MI estimation problems. This approach is computationally efficient, however, its precision heavily relies on the results of ICA. In our previous work, we assumed the feature space has linear structure, hence linear ICA was adopted. Nevertheless, this is a weak assumption, which might not be true in many applications. Although nonlinear ICA can solve any ICA problem in theory, its complexity and the requirement of data samples restrict its application. A better trade-off between linear and non-linear ICA could be local linear ICA, which uses piecewise linear ICA to approximate the non-linear relationships among the data. In this paper, we propose that by replacing linear ICA with local linear ICA, we can get precise MI estimation without greatly increasing the computational complexity. The experiment results also substantiate this claim","1551-2541;15512541","POD:0-7803-9517-4","10.1109/MLSP.2005.1532865","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532865","Entropy Estimation;Feature Selection;Local Linear ICA;Mutual Information","Biomedical engineering;Biomedical signal processing;Clustering algorithms;Computational complexity;Entropy;Independent component analysis;Linear approximation;Mutual information;Piecewise linear approximation;Piecewise linear techniques","computational complexity;entropy;feature extraction;independent component analysis;pattern classification","computational complexity;entropy estimation;feature selection;feature space linear structure;independent multiple 1D mutual information estimation;local linear independent component analysis;pattern classification;sample-spacing based entropy estimator","","0","","18","","","28-28 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first problem is how to visualize events detected by 32 cameras during 24 hours. The solution is obtained using self-organizing maps.

Information extraction now routinely goes beyond second order spectral analysis, as obtained via power spectral methods, and uses higher order spectral methods. In this paper we present a model which generalises the autoregressive class of polyspectral models by having a semi-parametric description of the residual probability density. We estimate the model in the variational Bayesian framework and extract higher order spectral features. Testing their importance for depth of anaesthesia classification is done on three different EEG data sets collected under exposure to different agents. The results show that significant improvements can be made over standard methods of estimating higher order spectra. The results also indicate that in two out of three anaesthetic agents, better classification can be achieved with higher order spectral features.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607457","","Bayesian methods;Brain modeling;Data mining;Electroencephalography;Entropy;Noise robustness;Public healthcare;Spectral analysis;Statistical analysis;Testing","autoregressive processes;belief networks;electroencephalography;generalisation (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;medicine;probability;spectral analysis","EEG data sets;EEG waveform;anaesthesia assessment;anaesthesia classification;anaesthetic agents;generative polyspectral models;higher order spectral methods;information extraction;power spectral methods;residual probability density;second order spectral analysis;variational Bayesian framework","","2","3","15","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Effectively, the choice of the training set is an important factor in deriving good classification rules. Traditional approach for association rules mining divides the dataset into training set and test set based on statistical methods. In this paper, we highlight the weaknesses of the existing approach and hence propose a new methodology that employs genetic algorithm (GA) in the process. In our approach, the original dataset is divided into sample and validation sets. Then, GA is used to find an appropriate split of the sample set into training and test sets. We demonstrate through experiments that using the obtained training set as the input to an association rules mining algorithm generates high accuracy classification rules. The rules are tested on the validation set for accuracy. The results are very satisfactory; they demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our approach.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607471","association;classification;clustering;data mining;data-splitting.;genetic algorithms;pre-processing","Association rules;Classification algorithms;Computer science;Data engineering;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Databases;Delta modulation;Genetic algorithms;Testing","data mining;genetic algorithms;pattern classification","association rules mining algorithm;classification rules;data mining preprocessing;data test set;data training set;genetic algorithm;statistical method;validation set","","1","","17","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Security vulnerabilities of 802.11 wireless networks are investigated, leading to a summary of network traffic metrics relevant to modeling the security of wireless networks. The proposed approach utilizes a simple distance-based heuristic measure to label clusters as either normal or intrusive. The classification of network traffic instances is further enhanced with the aid of tracers, i.e., a small set of instances with known labels - normal or intrusive.

The features are the linear combinations of Haar-like patterns in the frequency domain. By learning in a boosting manner, the particle and scratch are recognized out of the other defects. And, we propose another feature in the spatial domain which is based on the orientation histogram in the local region. The spatial feature is combined with frequency domain features in a boosting manner. According to the experiments with various defect samples, the accuracy of defect classification is larger than 92% on the average, and scratch is especially recognized with 98% purity.

This requires intelligent search and classification capabilities for users to find required information. It is especially true for repositories of scientific medical articles due to their extensive use, large size and number of new documents, and well maintained structure. This research aims to provide an automated method for classification of articles into the structure of medical document repositories, which would support currently performed extensive manual work. The proposed method classifies articles from the largest medical repository, MEDLINE, using state of the art data mining technology. The method is based on a novel associative classification technique which considers recurrent items and most importantly multi-label characteristic of the MEDLINE data. Based on large scale experiments that utilize 350,000 documents several different classification algorithms have been compared including both recurrent and non-recurrent associative classification. The algorithms are capable of assigning each medical document to several classes (multi-label classification) and are characterized by relatively high accuracy. We also investigate different measures of classification quality and point out pros and cons of each. Based on experimental result we show that recurrent item based associative classification demonstrates superior performance and propose three alternative setups that allow the user to obtain different desired classification qualities.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607448","","Automatic control;Back;Biomedical engineering;Biomedical measurements;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Large-scale systems;Libraries;Testing","classification;document handling;information retrieval systems;medical information systems","MEDLINE;article classification;data mining technology;intelligent classification;intelligent search;largest medical repository;medical document repositories;medical documents;multilabel associative classification;scientific document access;scientific medical articles","","8","","22","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In cross-validating KFD, the training examples are split into 2 distinct subsets for a number of times (L) wherein a subset of m examples is used for validation and the other subset of (n - m) examples is used for training the classifier. In this case L linear systems of dimension (n - m) need to be solved. We propose a novel method for cross-validation of KFD in which instead of solving L linear systems of dimension (n - m), we compute the inverse of an n × n matrix and solve L linear systems of dimension 2m, thereby reducing the complexity when L is large and/or m is small.

This technique can be quite useful when an independent test set is not available and crossvalidation is used as a validation step. It removes many of the ambiguities surrounding the final model selection process giving a computationally simple and transparent way to choose a robust model. The robust model selection is mainly accomplished by utilizing the fold frequencies of markers selected in repeated crossvalidation experiments in a direct and effective manner. The technique, both in terms of feature selection and classification is not method specific and therefore can be used with different sets of feature selection and classification methods. The usefulness of this technique extends even to situations where independent test set is available. Using this technique it allows one to squeeze extra performance out of the feature selection procedure and increase the odds of replication in an independent test set. Frequently only one test set is available and in this case use of this technique can help avoid repeated use of the test set. Availability of techniques such as one described in this study can be of great practical value in developing biomedical genomic applications e.g., molecular diagnostic tests.

This regression problem is complicated by the fact that data is censored, and there is no standard measurement of error for censored data. This paper applies modified regression trees, called Censored Time Trees (cTT™), to predict time to PSA recurrence. In order to assess the performance of cTT™, we explored different error measurements, such as the concordance index, AUC (area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve), sensitivity and specificity, and average error. Bagging of Censored Time Trees™ improves their performance.

Data from impact acoustic tests made on wooden beams have been used. The relation between condition of the wooden beams and respective sounds they make when struck, has been analyzed experimentally. Features were extracted from the acoustic emissions of wooden beams and were used for pattern classification. Features such as magnitude of the signal, natural logarithm of the magnitude and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, yielded good results. The extracted feature vectors were used as input to various pattern classifiers for further pattern recognition task.

Real-world datasets are often inundated with various types of data integrity issues, particularly noisy data. In response to the difficulties created by low-quality data, we propose a novel technique to detect noisy instances relative to an attribute of interest (AOI). Any attribute in the dataset can be defined by the user as the attribute of interest. A noise ranking of instances relative to the chosen attribute is output. This approach can be iterated for any number of user-specified attributes of interest. The case study described in this work demonstrates how our technique may be used to detect class noise, which occurs when errors are present in the class or dependent variable. In this scenario the class is declared to be the attribute of interest and an instance noise ranking relative to the class is provided. Our technique is compared to the well-known ensemble and classification filters which have been previously proposed for class noise detection. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and show that our procedure is a useful tool for improving data quality.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607431","","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Cleaning;Computer science;Costs;Data engineering;Data mining;Filters;Software engineering;Software quality","data integrity;data mining;pattern classification","attribute of interest;class noise detection;classification filters;data cleaning;data integrity;data mining;ensemble filters;instance noise ranking;low-quality data;noisy data;noisy instances;software quality","","3","","15","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The objective of this study is to discuss ensemble methods for gait classification as a part of preliminary studies of designing a semi-automated diagnosis system. For this purpose gait data is collected from 110 sick subjects (having knee osteoarthritis (OA)) and 91 age-matched normal subjects. A set of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) is trained by using joint angle and time-distance parameters of gait as features. Large dimensional feature vector is decomposed into feature subsets and the ones selected by gait expert are used to categorize subjects into two classes; healthy and patient. Ensemble of MLPs is built using these distinct feature subsets and diversification of classifiers is analyzed by cross-validation approach and confusion matrices. High diversifications observed in the confusion matrices suggested that using combining methods would help. Indeed, when a proper combining rule is applied to decomposed sets, more accurate results are obtained.

Sci. & Eng., Minnesota Univ., Minneapolis, MN, USA","Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'05)","20060320","2005","","","6 pp.","","This paper presents a method named ""orthogonal projection reduction by affinity"", or OPRA-faces, for face recognition. As its name indicates, the method consists of an (explicit) orthogonal mapping from the data space to the reduced space. In addition, the method attempts to preserve the local geometry, i.e., the affinity of the points in a geometric representation of the data. The method starts by computing an affinity mapping W, of the data, which optimally expresses each point as a convex combination of a few nearest neighbors. This mapping can be viewed as an optimal representation of the intrinsic neighborhood geometries and is computed in a manner that is identical with the method of locally linear embedding (LLE). Next, and in contrast with LLE, the proposed scheme computes an explicit linear mapping between the high dimensional samples and their corresponding images in the reduced space, which is designed to preserve this affinity representation W. OPRA-faces shares some properties with Laplacianfaces, a recently proposed technique for face recognition, which computes the linear approximation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the image manifold. Laplacianfaces aims at preserving locality but does not explicitly consider the intrinsic geometries of the neighborhoods as does OPRA. As a result of the preservation of the affinity mapping W, OPRA will tend to produce a linear subspace which captures the essential geometric characteristics of the dataset. This feature, which appears to be crucial in representing images, makes the method very effective as a tool for face recognition. OPRA is tested on standard face databases and its effectiveness is compared with that of Laplacianfaces, eigenfaces and Fisherfaces. The experimental results indicate that the proposed technique produces results that are sharply superior to the other methods, at a comparable or lower cost.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607433","","Computational geometry;Embedded computing;Face recognition;Image databases;Linear approximation;Linear discriminant analysis;Nearest neighbor searches;Principal component analysis;Testing;Topology","approximation theory;computational geometry;face recognition","Fisherfaces;Laplace-Beltrami operator;Laplacianfaces;OPRA-faces;affinity mapping;affinity representation;eigenfaces;face databases;face recognition;geometric data representation;image manifold;image representation;intrinsic neighborhood geometries;linear approximation;local geometry;locally linear embedding;nearest neighbors;orthogonal mapping;orthogonal projection reduction by affinity","","3","","11","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such expert-generated rules are then evaluated and refined in clinical tests. Once verified, these knowledge-driven rules are used to expedite diagnosis and treatment for the serious cases and to limit unnecessary tests for low-probability cases. Alternatively, machine learning techniques can be used for automated induction of comprehensible data-driven rules from vast amount of existing clinical data. This paper investigates how the rules generated by the clinical experts compare with the data-driven rules. The paper describes three outcomes: rule confirmation, contradiction, and expansion. The study concentrates on prediction rules for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea using three clinical data sets with 1,318 records.

The leave-one-out cross validation experiments and principal component analysis indicate that some attributes such as residue propensity and hydrophobicity are more important than other attributes such as curvedness and shape index in differentiating a binding patch from nonbinding patch. Second, we incorporate those attributes to predict protein-protein interaction by simple concatenation of the attribute vectors of candidate interacting partners.

We present here a practically motivated study of a frequent pattern extraction from sequences of data objects that are described within a domain ontology. As the complexity of the descriptive structures is high, an entire framework for the pattern extraction process had to be defined.

Our work is based on prefix gene expression programming (P-GEP), a new GP method featured by a prefix notation based linear genotype representation. Since P-GEP uses a functional language paradigm, its framework results in natural self-emergence of substructures as functional components during the evolution.

In brain slices of neuronal tissue, it has become possible to both measure electro-physiological properties of a given neuron and to extract a sample of its cytoplasm so that expressed genes can be amplified. Thus, the presence or absence of genes related to ion channels in the neuronal cell membrane can be correlated with neuronal behavior encoded as a set of electro-physiological parameters. A typical gene amplification process is asymmetric in the sense that false positives are very rare, whereas false negatives (genes expressed but not amplified) are rather common. An analysis of a probabilistic model of that process yields a similarity measure between two strings of amplified genes that takes the asymmetry of the amplification process into account. This similarity measure can be put under the form of a conformal-transformed kernel.

The label for the each category is represented by m-dimensional vector, and the weights for the feature and other parameters are also modified accordingly. We have performed simulation for the artificial data and the face data with different rotation angles.

Automating this process is a challenging task due to the often high degree of intensity and textural similarity between normal areas and tumor areas. Several recent projects have explored ways to use an aligned spatial 'template' image to incorporate spatial anatomic information about the brain, but it is not obvious what types of aligned information should be used. This work quantitatively evaluates the performance of 4 different types of alignment-based (AB) features encoding spatial anatomic information for use in supervised pixel classification. This is the first work to (1) compare several types of AB features, (2) explore ways to combine different types of AB features, and (3) explore combining AB features with textural features in a learning framework.

In this work, we introduce the concept of emergent loose modules based on a new linear GP system, prefix gene expression programming (P-GEP), in an attempt to balance between the stochastic exploration and the hierarchical construction for the optimal solutions. Emergent loose modules are dynamically produced by the evolution, and are reusable as sub-functions in later generations.

This is unrealistic in time-stamped domains, which are standard for real life business data. The question ""which association rules exist?"" is replaced by ""how do properties of association rules change?"" In order to cope with the vast number of detectable rule changes, preprocessing techniques are required that find those rules which are root cause to interesting rule changes. The paper proposes an approach based on statistical tests that finds derivative rule change histories and marks the respective rules as redundant. The effectiveness in reducing the number of rule histories is demonstrated using real life survey data.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607481","","Association rules;Data analysis;Data mining;History;Intelligent structures;Intelligent systems;Internet;Pattern analysis;Relational databases;Testing","data mining;statistical testing","association rule discovery;association rule pruning;business data;derivative rule change history;detectable rule change;redundant association rule","","1","1","11","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most important stage in these systems is to design an algorithm for lip finding and tracking. These systems normally find the lip area in the first captured image and then try to initialize a tracking algorithm with the results. After initialization, the tracking algorithm tries to follow the defined features to track the lip contour. The time adaptive self organizing map is a powerful method for active contour modeling in non-stationary environments. In this paper we have used the TASOM based active contour modeling algorithm to track the lips.

Modern intrusion detection applications face complex requirements - they need to be reliable, extensible, easy to manage, and have low maintenance cost. In recent years, data mining-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have demonstrated high accuracy, good generalization to novel types of intrusion, and robust behavior in a changing environment. Still, significant challenges exist in the design and implementation of production quality IDSs. Instrumenting components such as data transformations, model deployment, and cooperative distributed detection remain a labor intensive and complex engineering endeavor. This paper describes DAID, a database-centric architecture that leverages data mining within the Oracle RDBMS to address these challenges.

The scoring scheme is refined with weighting factors that are collected from the training data and are iteratively updated from the predicted results.

In this report, we are especially interested in documents with relative time order, which we also call document streams. Examples include TV news, forums, emails of company projects, call center telephone logs, etc. To get an insight into these document streams, first we need to detect the events among the document streams. We use a time-sensitive Dirichlet process mixture model to find the events in the document streams. A time sensitive Dirichlet process mixture model is a generative model, which allows a potentially infinite number of mixture components and uses a Dirichlet compound multinomial model to model the distribution of words in documents. In this report, we consider three different time sensitive Dirichlet process mixture models: an exponential decay kernel model, a polynomial decay function kernel Dirichlet process model and a sliding window kernel model. Experiments on the TDT2 dataset have shown that the time sensitive models perform 18-20% better in terms of accuracy than the Dirichlet process mixture model. The sliding windows kernel and the polynomial kernel are more promising in detecting events. We use ThemeRiver to provide a visualization of the events along the time axis. With the help of ThemeRiver, people can easily get an overall picture of how different events evolve. Besides ThemeRiver, we investigate using top words as a high-level summarization of each event. Experiment results on TDT2 dataset suggests that the sliding window kernel is a better choice both in terms of capturing the trend of the events and expressibility","","POD:0-7695-2735-3","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041505","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Event detection;Information retrieval;Kernel;Polynomials;Sampling methods;TV;Telephony;Text analysis","data encapsulation;document handling","Dirichlet compound multinomial model;ThemeRiver visualization;document stream;information hidden;polynomial decay function;sliding window kernel model;time-sensitive Dirichlet process mixture model","","1","","20","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm uses novel shape features extracted from a control chart pattern (CCP) instead of the unprocessed CCP data or its statistical properties. These shape features can be extracted in parallel. A parallel algorithm that is based on distributed and synergistic neural network structure for recognition of CCPs is described.

The REDB query language extends relational algebra project-select queries with conditions on probabilities of first-order logical expressions, which in turn involve linear combinations of learned attributes and views, and arithmetic comparison operators.

Poh","National University of Singapore, Singapore","2006 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'06)","20061226","2006","","","157","161","Microarray experiments often produce missing expression values due to various reasons. Accurate and robust estimation methods of missing values are needed since many algorithms and statistical analysis require a complete data set. In this paper, novel imputation methods based on least absolute deviation estimate, referred to as LADimpute, are proposed to estimate missing entries in microarray data. The proposed LADimpute method takes into consideration the local similarity structures in addition to employment of least absolute deviation estimate. Once those genes similar to the target gene with missing values are selected based on some metric, all missing values in the target gene can be estimated by the linear combination of the similar genes simultaneously. In our experiments, the proposed LADimpute method exhibits its accurate and robust performance when compared to other methods over different datasets, changing missing rates and various noise levels","","POD:0-7695-2735-3","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041485","","Algorithm design and analysis;Data engineering;Employment;Gene expression;Least squares approximation;Least squares methods;Robustness;Singular value decomposition;Statistical analysis;Systems engineering and theory","biology computing;data analysis;genetics;statistical analysis","LADimpute;genetics;least absolute deviation imputation;microarray data;robust missing value estimation;statistical analysis","","0","","17","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, a two-phase framework is introduced to attack the problem of leadership discovery in an organization based on email communication history among the employees. Two heuristic metrics are proposed for evaluating pair-wise leadership factors among a group of employees. We also address several issues in discovering the organization's structure through mining leadership graph constructed from the leadership factors. Experimental studies are carried out by applying the framework to Enron email corpus.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607463","","Computer network management;Computer science;Data mining;Electronic mail;History;Network topology;Psychology;Social network services;Sociology;Tin","","","","1","","17","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both algorithms map the contour of the shape to be recognized into a string of symbols. The first algorithm is based on supervised learning using string kernels as often used for text categorization and classification. The second algorithm is very weakly supervised and is based on the procrustes analysis and on the edit distance used for computing the similarity between strings of symbols. The second algorithm correctly recognizes 98.29% of shapes from the MPEG-7 database, i.e. better than any previous algorithms.

"A new clustering algorithm using message passing and its applications in analyzing microarray data","Huimin Geng; Xutao Deng; H. Ali","Dept. of Pathology & Microbiol., Nebraska Univ., Omaha, NE, USA","Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'05)","20060320","2005","","","6 pp.","","In this paper, we proposed a new clustering algorithm that employs the concept of message passing to describe parallel and spontaneous biological processes. Inspired by real-life situations in which people in large gatherings form groups by exchanging messages, message passing clustering (MPC) allows data objects to communicate with each other and produces clusters in parallel, thereby making the clustering process intrinsic and improving the clustering performance. We have proved that MPC shares similarity with hierarchical clustering but offers significantly improved performance because it takes into account both local and global structure. MPC can be easily implemented in a parallel computing platform for the purpose of speed-up. To validate the MPC method, we applied MPC to microarray data from the Stanford yeast cell-cycle database. The results show that MPC gave better clustering solutions in terms of homogeneity and separation values than other clustering methods.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607443","","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological processes;Clustering algorithms;Data analysis;Information analysis;Information science;Message passing;Parallel processing;Partitioning algorithms;Pathology","biology computing;genetics;message passing;parallel processing;pattern clustering","Stanford yeast cell-cycle database;clustering performance;hierarchical clustering;message exchange;message passing clustering;microarray data analysis;parallel biological process;parallel computing platform;spontaneous biological process","","2","","15","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Reducing High-Dimensional Data by Principal Component Analysis vs. Random Projection for Nearest Neighbor Classification","S. Deegalla; H. Bostrom","Stockholm University and Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden","2006 5th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA'06)","20061226","2006","","","245","250","The computational cost of using nearest neighbor classification often prevents the method from being applied in practice when dealing with high-dimensional data, such as images and micro arrays. One possible solution to this problem is to reduce the dimensionality of the data, ideally without loosing predictive performance. Two different dimensionality reduction methods, principle component analysis (PCA) and random projection (RP), are investigated for this purpose and compared w.r.t. the performance of the resulting nearest neighbor classifier on five image data sets and five micro array data sets. The experiment results demonstrate that PCA outperforms RP for all data sets used in this study. However, the experiments also show that PCA is more sensitive to the choice of the number of reduced dimensions. After reaching a peak, the accuracy degrades with the number of dimensions for PCA, while the accuracy for RP increases with the number of dimensions. The experiments also show that the use of PCA and RP may even outperform using the non-reduced feature set (in 9 respectively 6 cases out of 10), hence not only resulting in more efficient, but also more effective, nearest neighbor classification","","POD:0-7695-2735-3","10.1109/ICMLA.2006.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4041499","","Computational complexity;Computational efficiency;Decision trees;Discrete cosine transforms;Image analysis;Learning systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Performance analysis;Principal component analysis;Supervised learning","data mining;pattern classification;principal component analysis","PCA;high-dimensional data reduction;nearest neighbor classification;principal component analysis;random projection","","12","2","17","","","Dec. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such application takes place in two steps: ""clustering"" and ""classification"". In the clustering step, the objects of a training set are clustered using a cluster technique, Q. The outcome is a set of clusters, C. Each cluster, ci, is assigned a class label, ki, which reflects the common features of the objects in ci. The ki is a member of set K. In the classification step, a new object from a test set is assigned to one of the clusters in C using the Q, C, and K of the former step. The goal of this research effort is two fold: (1) introducing a methodology for decoupling ""clustering"" and ""classification "" steps and (2) establishing the validity of the proposed methodology by comparing its classification performance with the performance of the rough sets approach, and disciminant analysis.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607464","","Application software;Computer science;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Pediatrics;Performance analysis;Physics;Random number generation;Rough sets;Testing","pattern classification;pattern clustering;rough set theory","cluster-based classification;clustering decoupling;discriminant analysis;extended self-organizing map;rough set approach;rule extraction;rule generation","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
