International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030129","2002","3","","1214","1218 vol.3","Association rule mining is an important research area in data mining, which has a broad application background. There exist two short-comings in the classical association rule mining problem, namely every itemset is treated equivalently and use a uniform minimum support and minimum conference as weighting standard. Through introducing the function of the degree of interest on itemsets, φ, a direct generation of the problem of association rule mining, called φ-association rule mining, was introduced in Li (2001). It can solve the two short-comings at the same time. Based on an FP-tree, a universal algorithm for mining a T-frequent closed itemset was proposed in Li et al. (2001). Because this algorithm is based on general definition of φ, it will not perform well for all φ. In this paper, aiming at a kind of specific φ, namely, the degree of interest of every item is given, we present an improved algorithm. The experimental and performance studies show that our algorithm is more efficient than previous algorithm.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167393","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167393","","Association rules;Cybernetics;Data mining;Electronic mail;Itemsets;Machine learning;Mathematics;Transaction databases","data mining;set theory;transaction processing","FP-tree;association rule mining;data mining;degree of interest;mining algorithm","","2","","10","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to effectively deal with similarity in reasoning procedure, the inference rule paramodulation is extended to fuzzy reasoning. It is shown that the resolution and paramodulation are complete and sound for fuzzy predicate calculus, i.e., on one hand, if a set of clauses is S-unsatisfiable, then there is a refutation using the resolution and/or paramodulation from the set; on the other hand, if every clause in a set of clauses is something more than a ""half-truth"" and the most unreliable clause has a truth-value A, then it is guaranteed that all the logical consequence obtained by repeatedly applying the resolution and/or paramodulation will have truth-value no less than A.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167386","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167386","","Artificial intelligence;Calculus;Concurrent computing;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy reasoning;Fuzzy sets;Machine learning;Parallel processing;Terminology;Uncertainty","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms;uncertainty handling","fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;inference rule;paramodulation;similarity relation;truth-value;uncertainty handling;vagueness","","2","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although there are a number of text classification algorithms, most of them are either inefficient or too complex. We present a linear text classification algorithm called SRFW, which is fast, effective and easily used. SRFW obtains relevance factors. For new unlabelled documents, SRFW adopts sum of weights based on relevance factors to obtain the probability that these documents belong to each category and assigns them to categories that have the biggest probability. We have evaluated our algorithm on a subset of Reuters-21578 and 20-newsgroups text collections and compared it against k-NN and SVM. Experimental results show that SRFW is competitive with k nearest neighbor (k-NN) and support vector machines (SVM), while SRFW is much simpler and faster than them.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167407","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167407","","Classification algorithms;Computer science;Electronic mail;Laboratories;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Probability;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization","information retrieval;learning automata;natural languages;pattern classification;text analysis","20-newsgroups text collection;Reuters-21578 text collection;SRFW;discriminating power;documents assignment;k-nearest neighbor method;linear text classification algorithm;relevance factors;statistical methods;support vector machines;topic hierarchies;unlabelled documents","","1","","19","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel palm print feature, named wavelet energy features (WEF), is defined employing wavelet which is a powerful tool of multiresolution analysis. In this paper. WEF can reflect the wavelet energy distribution of the principal lines, wrinkles and ridges in several directions at different wavelet decomposition levels (scales), so its ability to discriminate palms is very strong.

In this paper, a method of 2D recovery of human posture is proposed. The recovery process is as follows: first, the image sequences that involve human motion are acquired by single camera, and the body region is extracted from the image by background subtraction. The silhouette surrounding the region of the body is represented by FCC (Freeman Chain Code). Then each part of the body is labeled, and the coordinates of joints among the parts are retrieved. Thus the sequence of 2D human skeletons is recovered from the image sequence. This paper gives the tracking results for three different kinds of human motion. The 2D human skeletons can be successfully retrieved in the whole course of the complex movement. This proves that the system has certain advantages and fascinating applications.

International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030129","2002","3","","1283","1286 vol.3","How can a system be more adaptive and efficient? In a multi-agent system (MAS), it may be a good idea to evolve each agent separately and evaluate them together in the common task. We propose a multi-agent system composed of adaptive agents, which are incorporated in MAS environments to pursue their goals separately and then co-evolved together in order to make them more adaptive and efficient. In this system, each agent is embedded with an inner-learning unit (LU), which concentrates on the reinforcement algorithm with historical local information and an external co-evolutionary learning unit that acquires global reinforcing information from the environment and other agents. Agents adjust action strategies according to the evaluation of global rewards. Through such operation, agents are expected to co-evolve together to achieve a global optimized result. To store the best result of MAS ever gained in the learning process, a shared memory unit is used. Compared to the widely used ""top-down"" method, this approach emphasizes a co-evolutionary method about distributive control, which aims at unifying the individual's self-evolving ability and the system's global information. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this approach, the predator/prey domain is used as an example of simulation in which agents represent different predators and prey. The result from the simulation shows that the proposed approach has a high potential for distributive co-operative problem.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167410","","Adaptive systems;Automation;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Control systems;Distributed computing;Learning;Multiagent systems;Performance evaluation;Power system modeling","adaptive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","action strategies;adaptive agents;adaptive behavior;co-evolutionary agent model;distributive control;external co-evolutionary learning unit;global information;global reinforcing information;global rewards;historical local information;inner-learning unit;predator/prey domain;reinforcement algorithm;self-evolving ability","","0","","8","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many pattern recognition problems, such as handwriting/sketching recognition and speech recognition, are user dependent since different users' handwritings, drawing styles, and accents are different. Hence, the classifiers for solving these problems should provide the functionality of user adaptation so as to let all users experience better recognition results. However, the user adaptation functionality requires the classifiers have the incremental learning ability in order to learn fast. In this paper, an SVM-based incremental active learning algorithm is presented to solve this problem. By utilizing the support vectors and only a small portion of the nonsupport vectors as well, in addition to the new interrogative samples, in the iterative training and reclassification cycle, both the training time and the storage space are saved with only very little classification precision being lost. Theoretical analysis, experimentation, evaluation, and real application samples in our online graphics recognition system are presented to show the effectiveness of this algorithm.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167432","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167432","","Computer graphics;Computer science;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Speech recognition;Statistics;Sun;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","image recognition;interactive systems;learning (artificial intelligence);learning automata;online operation","SVM-based incremental active learning;classifiers;handwriting recognition;human-computer interaction systems;interrogative samples;iterative reclassification cycle;iterative training cycle;nonsupport vectors;online graphics recognition system;pattern recognition;sketching recognition;speech recognition;storage space;support vectors;training time;user adaptation","","4","","20","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Generally they assess a specific term by calculating its occurrences among individual categories or in the entire corpus, where ""occurring in a document"" is simply defined as occurring at least once. A major drawback of this measure is that, for a single document, it might count a recurrent term the same as a rare term, while the former term is obviously more informative and should less likely be removed. In this paper we propose a possible approach to overcome this problem, which adjusts the occurrences count according to the relative term frequency, thus stressing those recurrent words in each document.

The algorithm performance is analyzed, which shows that this method can shrink each generation scale greatly and create a good niche for patterns evolving.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1176712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176712","","Algorithm design and analysis;Biology computing;Computer science;Computer security;Condition monitoring;Detectors;Encoding;Humans;Immune system;Intrusion detection","computer network reliability;data mining;encoding;genetic algorithms;pattern recognition;security of data","artificial immune theory;clonal selection;data mining;encoding;genetic algorithm;negative selection;network intrusion detection system;pattern classification","","10","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As to achieve FLS's function approximation ability, it is very important to find algorithms to synthesis the fuzzy rule parameter value. The table-lookup algorithm is a kind of fuzzy rule design method and its computational cost is quite low. Based on the classic table-lookup algorithm idea, we designed another simpler table-lookup synthesis method, called a simplified table-lookup algorithm, and its computational cost is less than the original one. Then we used this algorithm to design the rule parameters of a standard fuzzy controller, which has four inputs and one output.

Our goal is to modify the embedded string model based MCE algorithm to handle the case of a large number of cross-syllable trip hones used in a large vocabulary recognition system. A selective strategy about MCE based discriminative training method, in particular for Mandarin speech syllable loop recognition, is introduced. We use a syllable loop recognition task to evaluate the performance of the acoustic model of an established large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system. The basic idea is that since decoding errors occur in parts of the models in whole decoded sentences, it is reasonable to adjust the parameters of the ""wrong models"". As a result, a weighted MCE formulation is derived, which can provide more effective convergence and about a 10% error rate reduction for a large training set. Our experiments show that, although the performance of the recognition system is improved, some original correct recognition results are misrecognized after discriminative training, and a divide and conquer strategy is proposed as a solution. Thus, the acoustic feature space is divided into two or more sub-spaces according to the discriminative training procedure. By combining these two methods, we obtain over 14.5% error rate reduction in syllable loop recognition.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174423","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174423","","Automatic speech recognition;Computer errors;Computer science;Educational institutions;Error analysis;Maximum likelihood decoding;Maximum likelihood estimation;Speech recognition;Viterbi algorithm;Vocabulary","convergence;divide and conquer methods;error statistics;signal classification;speech coding;speech recognition","Mandarin speech recognition;Mandarin speech syllable loop recognition;acoustic feature space;acoustic model;convergence;cross-syllable trip hones;decoding errors;discriminative training;divide and conquer strategy;embedded string model;error probability;error rate reduction;large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system;large vocabulary recognition system;minimum classification error based discriminative methods;selective MCE training strategy;selective strategy","","0","","9","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
