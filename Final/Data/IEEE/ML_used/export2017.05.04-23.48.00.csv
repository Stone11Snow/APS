The feedback of the machine directly responding to the person's imitation can strengthen the trust of this connection. However, vocal imitation of machines often bear little resemblance to the target due to physiological limitations. In practice, we need a way to detect human vocalization of machine sounds that can generalize to new machines. In this study we learn the relationship between vocal imitation of machine sounds and the target sounds to create a predictive model of vocalization of otherwise humanly impossible sounds. After training on a small set of machines and their imitations, we predict the correct target of a new set of imitations with high accuracy. The model outperforms distance metrics between human and machine sounds on the same task and takes into account auditory perception and constraints in vocal expression.","1931-1168;19311168","POD:0-7803-9154-3","10.1109/ASPAA.2005.1540238","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1540238","","Acoustic signal detection;Databases;Human voice;Instruments;Machine learning;Medical treatment;Multiple signal classification;Music;Predictive models;Psychology","acoustic signal processing;audio signal processing","auditory perception;human vocalization;learning auditory models;machine sounds;machine therapy sessions;machine voices;physiological limitations;predictive model;vocal imitation;vocalization","","2","","15","","","16-19 Oct. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is not easy task to distinguish those two tables because HTML does not separate presentation and structure. This makes information extracting from those tables more difficult.

Moreover, test results are hardly obtainable in a reasonable amount of time requiring one to return over and over again for regular checkup intervals, delaying the treatment and extending the period of infectivity developing risks of unwanted, sometimes unimaginable, complications. Syndromic approach to management of STDs is based on the identification of a consistent group of symptoms and syndromes to classify the exact disease or infection be-forehand, so that further investigations are sought for based on this initial criterion. In this paper, we will analyze results based on two different approaches: Human and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Tracking the health state of a machine, even if the machine is working properly, is very critical for detecting, identifying, and localizing the failure (i.e., diagnosis) and estimating the remaining-useful-life of the component/machine (i.e., prognosis) for carrying out proper maintenance. Hidden Markov models (HMM) present us an opportunity to estimate these unobservable health states using observable sensor signals. Hierarchical HMM is composed of sub-HMMs in a hierarchical fashion, providing functionality beyond a HMM for modeling complex systems. Implementation of HMM based models as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) facilitates compact representation as well as additional flexibility with regard to model structure. Regular and hierarchical HMMs are employed here to estimate on-line the health state of drill-bits as they deteriorate with use on a CNC drilling machine. In the case of regular HMMs, each HMM (that is part of a committee) competes to represent a distinct health state and learns through competitive learning. In the case of hierarchical HMMs, health states are represented as distinct nodes in the top of the hierarchy. Detailed results from regular and hierarchical HMMs are very promising and are reported in this paper.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9048-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556145","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556145","","Automatic speech recognition;Bayesian methods;Change detection algorithms;Degradation;Failure analysis;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Mechanical systems;State estimation;Stochastic processes","belief networks;drilling machines;electrical engineering computing;failure (mechanical);fault diagnosis;hidden Markov models;machine testing;sensors;unsupervised learning","competitive learning;drilling machine;dynamic Bayesian network;failure mechanism;hierarchical hidden Markov model;machine diagnostics;machine health state;mechanical system;observable sensor signal","","5","","19","","","31 July-4 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus their correct application in a system's design may significantly improve its internal quality attributes such as reusability and maintainability. In software maintenance the existence of up-to-date documentation is crucial, so the discovery of as yet unknown design pattern instances can help improve the documentation. Hence a reliable design pattern recognition system is very desirable. However, simpler methods (based on pattern matching) may give imprecise results due to the vague nature of the patterns' structural description. In previous work we presented a pattern matching-based system using the Columbus framework with which we were able to find pattern instances from the source code by considering the patterns' structural descriptions only, and therefore we could not identify false hits and distinguish similar design patterns such as state and strategy. In the present work we use machine learning to enhance pattern mining by filtering out as many false hits as possible. To do so we distinguish true and false pattern instances with the help of a learning database created by manually tagging a large C++ system.","1063-6773;10636773","POD:0-7695-2368-4","10.1109/ICSM.2005.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1510125","C++;Columbus;Design Patterns;Machine Learning;StarOffice","Application software;Databases;Documentation;Filtering;Machine learning;Pattern matching;Pattern recognition;Software design;Software maintenance;Tagging","C++ language;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented methods;software maintenance;software reusability","C++ system;design pattern mining;machine learning;object-oriented software design;pattern matching-based system;software maintenance","","18","2","24","","","26-29 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data-mining systems based on machine-learning usually need a large number of iterations to acquire correct solutions, whereas people usually find appropriate hidden rules after only a small number of observations of the instances in a dataset. We think that this quick learning is the result of using tentative hypothesis as the data-model in the early steps of the learning. If the hypothesis happens to be accurate, the learning is completed immediately after the hypothesis is applied. We therefore reduce the effort required for learning by gambling on the possibility that the tentative hypothesis is accurate. Our new machine learning system emulates this process by minimizing an objective function that represents not only the likelihood of error but also the predicted learning-cost. In experiments, the new system yields appropriate solutions to function approximation problems with only a small number of observations of instances. This system is helpful for emergent problem solving.","","POD:4-907764-22-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1491834","","","data mining;function approximation;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;neural nets","data-mining systems;data-model;function approximation problems;human learning behavior;machine learning system;objective function;problem solving;quick model selection","","0","","6","","","4-6 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It aims at replacing the conventional mechanical milling machines which are currently used in such vocational training courses. VTT proposes an interactive manipulation of a cutter of a virtual milling machine, with visual, audio and haptic (force) feedback. VTT uses a haptic device which was specifically designed for the purpose of our pedagogical application. When the virtual cutter mills a piece of material, a plastic deformation algorithm is used and the material is progressively carved. Trainees can feel the cutting effort thanks to a force feedback which varies as a function of different simulation parameters (rotation speed of the tool, type of material to carve, etc). Realistic audio feedback (which was recorded in real situations) and additional visual assistance may be added, in order to increase the perception and understanding of the milling task. A preliminary evaluation of VTT showed that this simulator could be used by vocational trainers successfully. It could help them to teach the basic principles of machining at the first stages of vocational training courses on numerically-controlled milling machines.","1087-8270;10878270","POD:0-7803-8929-8","10.1109/VR.2005.1492766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1492766","","Force feedback;Haptic interfaces;Machine learning;Machining;Metalworking machines;Milling machines;Plastics;Programming profession;Virtual reality;Vocational training","computer based training;cutting;cutting tools;educational courses;force feedback;haptic interfaces;milling;milling machines;plastic deformation;teaching;user centred design;virtual reality","audio feedback;cutter manipulation;force feedback;haptic device;haptic feedback;learning;multisensory feedback;numerically-controlled milling machines;pedagogical application;plastic deformation algorithm;virtual milling machine;virtual reality;virtual technical trainer;visual feedback;vocational training courses","","6","","21","","","12-16 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fourth IEEE International Conference on","20050404","2004","","","146","153","In the past, machine learning algorithms have been successfully used in many problems, and are emerging as valuable data analysis tools. However, their serious practical use is affected by the fact, that more often than not, they cannot produce reliable and unbiased assessments of their predictions' quality. In last years, several approaches for estimating reliability or confidence of individual classifiers have emerged, many of them building upon the algorithmic theory of randomness, such as (historically ordered) transduction-based confidence estimation, typicalness-based confidence estimation, and transductive reliability estimation. Unfortunately, they all have weaknesses: either they are tightly bound with particular learning algorithms, or the interpretation of reliability estimations is not always consistent with statistical confidence levels. In the paper, we propose a joint approach that compensates the mentioned weaknesses by integrating typicalness-based confidence estimation and transductive reliability estimation into joint confidence machine. The resulting confidence machine produces confidence values in the statistical sense (e.g., a confidence level of 95% means that in 95% the predicted class is also a true class), as well as provides us with a general principle that is independent of to the particular underlying classifier. We perform a series of tests with several different machine learning algorithms in several problem domains. We compare our results with that of a proprietary TCM-NN method as well as with kernel density estimation. We show that the proposed method significantly outperforms density estimation methods, and how it may be used to improve their performance.","","POD:0-7695-2142-8","10.1109/ICDM.2004.10089","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1410278","confidence estimation;machine learning;quality assessment;transduction;typicalness","Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Kernel;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Probability distribution;Quality assessment;Reliability theory","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;reliability theory;statistical analysis","TCM-NN method;data analysis tool;data mining;density estimation method;individual classifications;joint confidence machine;kernel density estimation;learning algorithm;machine learning;quality assessment;transduction-based confidence estimation;transductive reliability estimation;typicalness-based confidence estimation","","2","","22","","","1-4 Nov. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper shows that ELM can be extended to radial basis function (RBF) network case, which allows the centers and impact widths of RBF kernels to be randomly generated and the output weights to be simply analytically calculated instead of iteratively tuned. Interestingly, the experimental results show that the ELM algorithm for RBF networks can complete learning at extremely fast speed and produce generalization performance very close to that of SVM in many artificial and real benchmarking function approximation and classification problems.

Framework documentation plays a major role in facing the above challenges. It directly affects the learning curve, maintainability, and defect removal aspects of the application frameworks. We have studied various documenting approaches and concluded that the current approaches are not very effective in overcoming the above challenges, especially on the efficiency problem.

RVM is based on Bayesian estimation theory, and as a feature it can yield a decision function that depends on only a very small number of so-called relevance vectors. The proposed method is tested using a database of 141 clinical mammograms, and compared with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which we developed previously. It is demonstrated that the RVM classifier achieves essentially the same detection performance as the SVM classifier, but does so with a much sparser kernel representation. Consequently, the RVM classifier greatly reduces the computational complexity, making it more suitable for real-time implementation.","1522-4880;15224880","POD:0-7803-9134-9","10.1109/ICIP.2005.1529674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1529674","Computer-aided diagnosis;microcalcifications;relevance vector machine","Bayesian methods;Breast cancer;Cancer detection;Estimation theory;Kernel;Machine learning;Spatial databases;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","Bayes methods;cancer;computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical diagnostic computing","Bayesian estimation theory;breast cancer diagnosis;mammograms;microcalcifications detection;relevance vector machine learning","","0","","11","","","11-14 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the leaf contour classification, a scaled CCD code system is proposed to categorize the basic shape and margin type of a leaf by using the similar taxonomy principle adopted by the botanists. Then a trained neural network is employed to recognize the detailed tooth patterns. The measurement on an unlobed leaf is also conducted automatically according to the method used in botany. For the leaf vein recognition, the vein texture is extracted by employing an efficient combined thresholding and neural network approach so as to obtain more vein details of a leaf.

Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements. We adopt a case-based framework for requirements prioritization, called case-based ranking, which exploits machine learning techniques to overcome the scalability problem. This method reduces the acquisition effort by combining human preference elicitation and automatic preference approximation. Our goal in this paper is to describe the framework in details and to present empirical evaluations which aim at showing its effectiveness in overcoming the scalability problem.

In many cases, simulation is the only way to select a good plan among a great number of candidates. When there exist complicated constraints, direct selection could be very inefficient since many candidates may not be feasible but cannot be excluded beforehand. To meet the challenge, a machine learning method is introduced in this paper to perform feasibility analysis. The rough set theory is first applied to establish the relationship between a plan and its feasibility and an iterative reinforcement process is applied to enhance confidence. The numerical testing results show that this method is promising and scalable for the large-scale problems. The research lays a basis for developing an efficient simulation-based optimization method with complicated constraints. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated by the resource planning problem for a complex remanufacturing system, which is very important but in general extremely difficult to deal with in terms of, e.g., problem size and uncertainties. Simulation is probably the only way available to select a good plan among a number of candidates. When there exist complicated constraints, simulation becomes even more difficult and selection through simulation could be very inefficient since many candidates may not be feasible but cannot be excluded before simulation. Determining feasibility beforehand is extremely difficult by analytical or numerical methods. This paper suggests a new method using a machine learning-based approach to predict the plan feasibility required in practical applications and can be considered as the first step for optimization-based planning. By applying the rough set theory, the prediction rules are obtained or learned from a training dataset generated by simulation. Then, an iterative reinforcement process is applied to enhance the confidence of learning and to perform iterative retraining on new datasets by the rough set method to generate new rules to add to the knowledge base until the preset threshold is satisfied. The numerical testing results show that the above method is capable of determining the feasible plans for a remanufacturing sy- stem with good accuracy. The method is efficient and scalable for the large-scale problems. The method developed in the paper is being incorporated in the framework of ordinal optimization, and a new constrained ordinal optimization method has been developed for remanufacturing planning.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2005.849090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1458719","Manufacturing planning;remanufacturing systems;rough set theory;simulation-based optimization","Iterative methods;Large-scale systems;Learning systems;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Set theory;Testing;Uncertainty","design for disassembly;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);manufacturing resources planning;optimisation;recycling;rough set theory","feasibility analysis;iterative reinforcement process;machine learning approach;numerical methods;numerical testing;ordinal optimization method;remanufacturing system;resource planning;rough set theory;simulation-based optimization method","","12","","54","","","July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A QSAR generalizes how the structure of a compound relates to its biological activity. There is growing interest in the application of machine learning techniques in QSAR modeling research. However, no single technique can claim to be uniformly superior to any other. This study introduced the ensemble machine learning, a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined in some way (typically by weighted or unweighted voting) to improve the performance of the overall system. A comparative study was carried out of two popular ensemble learning algorithms, Bagging and AdaBoost, for QSAR modeling. Two test case problems were studied: the inhibition of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by pyrimidines, and the inhibition of rat/mouse tumor DHFR by triazines. It was observed that the ensemble learning algorithms, Bagging and AdaBoost, can significantly improve the performance of decision tree C4.5 and 1-R (p - 0.05), while naive Bayesian and 1-nearest neighbor did not benefit from ensemble learning. Furthermore, in general, AdaBoost outperformed Bagging on the tested data sets.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607449","","Bagging;Biological system modeling;Decision trees;Drugs;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mice;Neoplasms;Testing;Voting","drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification","AdaBoost ensemble learning;Bagging ensemble learning;Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase;Pyrimidines;QSAR modeling;biological activity;decision tree;drug design;ensemble machine learning;mouse tumor DHFR;quantitative structure-activity relationship;triazines","","0","","26","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Which users were affected, and for how long? How do we diagnose and correct problems caused by configuration errors or operator errors? Although these problems are posed at a high level of abstraction, all we can usually measure directly are low-level behaviors - analogous to driving a car while looking through a magnifying glass. Machine learning can bridge this gap using techniques that learn ""baseline"" models automatically or semi-automatically, allowing the characterization and monitoring of systems whose structure is not well understood a priori.

This, however, is at the cost of large numbers of evaluations of the program. This paper develops a new methodology to reduce this number and hence speed up iterative optimization. It uses predictive modelling from the domain of machine learning to automatically focus search on those areas likely to give greatest performance. This approach is independent of search algorithm, search space or compiler infrastructure and scales gracefully with the compiler optimization space size. Off-line, a training set of programs is iteratively evaluated and the shape of the spaces and program features are modelled. These models are learnt and used to focus the iterative optimization of a new program. We evaluate two learnt models, an independent and Markov model, and evaluate their worth on two embedded platforms, the Texas Instrument C67I3 and the AMD Au1500. We show that such learnt models can speed up iterative search on large spaces by an order of magnitude.

With this data we train a machine learning model which mimics the expert's behaviour. This is just a simple application of a modelling technique known as ""mimetism"", which has many other applications. This ""soft"" approach to knowledge acquisition has many advantages: any machine learning technique can be used, the expert must only answer simple questions (cases) and we can combine the decisions of several experts easily. However, one problem of this approach is that we do not know in advance how many cases we will need to ask in order to get a good model which is accurate wrt. the expert's knowledge. Obviously, as more data is labelled by the expert better results are obtained. However, asking thousands of cases to the expert is usually impractical. In this paper, we analyse the behaviour of knowledge acquisition through mimetic learning according to two factors: accuracy and comprehensibility of the resulting model and we devise a method to compute the minimum number of cases that we need to ask the expert to attain a certain quality level.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607430","","Automatic control;Decision making;Equations;Expert systems;Input variables;Knowledge acquisition;Machine learning;Numerical models;Predictive models;Thumb","expert systems;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence)","knowledge acquisition;machine learning;mimetic learning;soft approach","","1","","10","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One approach in achieving this is to dynamically assess the modules in the synthesized code using software defect prediction techniques. Statistical models; such as stepwise multi-linear regression models and multivariate models, and machine learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, instance-based reasoning, Bayesian-belief networks, decision trees, and rule inductions, have been investigated for predicting software quality. However, there is still no consensus about the best predictor model for software defects. In this paper; we evaluate different predictor models on four different real-time software defect data sets.

An alternate view shows compression algorithms implicitly map strings into implicit feature space vectors, and compression-based similarity measures compute similarity within these feature spaces. Thus, compression-based methods are not a ""parameter free"" magic bullet for feature selection and data representation, but are instead concrete similarity measures within defined feature spaces, and are therefore akin to explicit feature vector models used in standard machine learning algorithms.

The understanding of protein structures is vital to determine the function of a protein and its interaction with DNA, RNA and enzyme. The information about its conformation can provide essential information for drug design and protein engineering. While there are over a million known protein sequences, only a limited number of protein structures are experimentally determined. Hence, prediction of protein structures from protein sequences using computer programs is an important step to unveil proteins' three dimensional conformation and functions. As a result, prediction of protein structures has profound theoretical and practical influence over biological study. In this talk, we would show how to use machine learning methods with various advanced encoding schemes and classifiers improve the accuracy of protein structure prediction. The explanation of how a decision is made is also important for improving protein structure prediction. The reasonable interpretation is not only useful to guide the ""wet experiments"", but also the extracted rules are helpful to integrate computational intelligence with symbolic AI systems for advanced deduction. Some preliminary results using SVM and decision tree for rule extraction and prediction interpretation would also be presented.","","POD:0-7803-9017-2","10.1109/GRC.2005.1547225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1547225","","Biochemistry;Biological information theory;Biology computing;DNA;Drugs;Encoding;Learning systems;Protein engineering;RNA;Sequences","biology computing;decision making;encoding;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;proteins","DNA;RNA;SVM;biological study;computer programs;decision tree;drug design;encoding scheme;enzyme;machine learning methods;prediction interpretation;protein engineering;protein sequences;protein structure prediction;protein three dimensional conformation;rule extraction;symbolic AI systems","","1","","","","","25-27 July 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One convincing argument is that a gene may participate in multiple pathways that may or may not be co-active under all conditions. It is biologically more meaningful to cluster both genes and conditions in gene expression data $leading to the so-called biclustering analysis. In addition, we have developed a set of systematic preprocessing methods to effectively comply with various coherence models. This paper will show that the proposed framework enjoys a vital advantage of ease of visualization and analysis. Because a gene may follow more than one coherence models, a multivariate biclustering analysis based on fusion of scores derived from different preprocessing methods appears to be very promising.

In this research, an intelligent agent-based single machine scheduling system is proposed, where the agent is trained by a new improved Q-learning algorithm. In such scheduling system, agent selects one of appropriate dispatching rules for machine based on available information. The agent was trained by a new simulated annealing-based Q-learning algorithm. The simulation results show that the simulated annealing-based Q-learning agent is able to learn to select the best dispatching rule for different system objectives.

The parser's ability to skip words and rule symbols, however, results in a much bigger search space and greatly increases the parse ambiguity. Previous approaches resolved these issues through manually labeling the types of rule symbols, or by utilizing heuristic scores or statistical probabilities. However, these approaches have certain drawbacks. This paper proposes to exploit embedded machine learning techniques to help with pruning and disambiguation in robust parsers. An embedded machine learning system is integrated with the heuristic score and the strategy of basing the types of rule symbols upon their correspondence to the domain model. This integration can considerably relieve the reliance of robust parser development on linguistic expert handcrafting. Our experiments show that this integration offers stronger capability in ambiguity resolution, thereby enabling the robust parser to achieve better parsing accuracy.","","POD:0-7803-9361-9","10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598729","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598729","","Computer science;Labeling;Learning systems;Machine learning;Natural languages;Probability;Robustness;Speech;Statistical analysis;Training data","embedded systems;grammars;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages","disambiguation method;embedded machine learning system;linguistic expert handcrafting;pruning method;robust spoken language parsing;spontaneous spoken utterance","","0","","12","","","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is necessary for manufacturing enterprises to detect the states of production process in real time, in order to find the early faults in machines, so that the losses of production failure and investments of facility maintenance can be minimized.

Based on the model, the method of inductive learning is adopted to obtain the statistical boundary vectors of the signal automatically, and then a normal feature space is built, according to which an abnormal signal can be detected, and consequently the faults in a complicated system can be found easily. Furthermore, under the condition of without existing fault samples, the precise results of fault diagnosis can also be achieved in real time. The theoretical analysis and simulation example demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527507","Fault Diagnosis;Feature Extraction;Machine Learning","Computer vision;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Feature extraction;Investments;Machine learning;Manufacturing processes;Manufacturing systems;Production;Signal detection","fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);maintenance engineering;manufacturing systems;signal detection","fault diagnosis model;fault samples;feature extraction;machine learning;manufacturing system;statistical boundary vector;theoretical analysis","","0","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Linear models are plagued by the massive disparity of the input and output dimensions thereby leading to poor generalization. A solution would be to use non-linear models like the recurrent multi-layer perceptron (RMLP) that provide parsimonious mapping functions with better generalization. However, this results in a drastic increase in the training complexity, which can be critical for practical use of a BMI. This paper bridges the gap between superior performance per trained weight and model learning complexity. Towards this end, we propose to use echo state networks (ESN) to transform the neuronal firing activity into a higher dimensional space and then derive an optimal sparse linear mapping in the transformed space to match the hand position. The sparse mapping is obtained using a weight constrained cost function whose optimal solution is determined using a stochastic gradient algorithm.","1520-6149;15206149","POD:0-7803-8874-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2005.1416283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1416283","","Intelligent networks;Machine learning","brain models;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","BMI;RMLP;brain machine interfaces;disparity;echo state networks;generalization;hand position matching;learning mappings;linear models;model input dimensions;model output dimensions;neural activity map;neuronal firing activity;nonlinear models;optimal solution;optimal sparse linear mapping;primate hand position;recurrent multi-layer perceptron;sparse mapping;stochastic gradient algorithm;training complexity;transformed space;weight constrained cost function","","6","","13","","","18-23 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is done by comparing the performance of an idealized genetic algorithm that uses a fitness function based on the generalization error with that of an empirical genetic algorithm based on Rademacher penalization. The inequalities indicate that although we are not able to implement the idealized algorithm (because of the inability to compute the generalization error), the empirical algorithm does almost as well as the idealized algorithm would.","","POD:0-7695-2495-8","10.1109/ICMLA.2005.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1607473","","Algorithm design and analysis;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mathematics;Network topology;Neural networks;Process design;Statistics;Virtual colonoscopy","generalisation (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);self-adjusting systems","Rademacher penalization;data driven penalization;generalization error;idealized algorithm;machine learning;probabilistic oracle inequality;self bounding genetic algorithm","","0","","14","","","15-17 Dec. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Yang-Ming Univ., Taipei, Taiwan","Conference, Emerging Information Technology 2005.","20051205","2005","","","2 pp.","","RNA-binding proteins play many essential roles in the regulation of gene expression. In the cell, mRNA molecules and their precursors are always bound by proteins. RNA binding protein that are involved in RNA processing, cellular localization, gene expression, regulation, transcription and translation have been identified, and structural domains involved in RNA recognition have been described (Siomi et al., 1997; Cusack et al. 1999; Stefl et al. 2005). RNA-binding proteins are an extremely diverse group of proteins, reflecting the different functional requirements of different types of RNA molecules (Andreev et al. 2004). However, despite their obvious functional importance, the specific mechanisms of protein RNA interactions are still poorly understand. Identification of the most putative RNA-binding residues in these proteins is an important and challenging problem of molecular recognition. Despite the significant increase in the number of structures for RNA-protein complexes in the last few years, the molecular basis of specificity remains unclear even for the best studied protein families. Very few studies (Jeong et al. 2004) have been addressed so far to the important problem of predicting RNA-interacting sites in the protein as a critical goal in the field of molecular recognition. We have developed a method for identification of RNA-binding residues using machine learning approaches. Several machine learning techniques and feature selection methods based on protein composition, sequence, charge and structural information have been investigated for their classification accuracy. In detailed cross validation analysis using non redundant RNA-protein complexes deposited in the protein data bank, our method shows satisfactory performance for identification of RNA-binding residues.","","POD:0-7803-9328-7","10.1109/EITC.2005.1544341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1544341","","Bioinformatics;Gene expression;Genomics;Machine learning;Neural networks;Performance analysis;Proteins;RNA;Regulators;Spectroscopy","biology computing;chemistry computing;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);macromolecules;proteins","RNA processing;RNA recognition;RNA-binding protein residues;RNA-binding residue identification;RNA-interacting sites;cellular localization;cross validation analysis;feature selection;gene expression;gene regulation;gene transcription;gene translation;mRNA molecules;machine learning;molecular recognition;nonredundant RNA-protein complexes;protein RNA interactions;protein charge;protein composition;protein data bank;protein sequence;protein structural information;putative RNA-binding residues","","0","","5","","","15-16 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the first part, an overview is given of the fundamental ideas of SVM approximation, starting from the classification problem. Then, it is shown how SVM can be extended to the case of regression with noisy data. A set of different loss functions and their implications on robustness of the estimation procedure is presented, together with derivation of the corresponding optimization functionals.

To date, our focus has been on text information categorization using both existing text classification techniques (e.g. Weighted Feature Vector (WFV) classification) and machine learning algorithms based on inductive logic programming (ILP) and natural language processing techniques. The algorithms have been used to automatically assign documents to a pre-existing set of categories by correlating text within the documents to text relating to classifications/categories. Once text documents are categorized according to their content, then fusion can begin. The results of initial experiments indicate that the ILP approach performs at least as well as the WFV technique, and outperforms it in one set of experiments.

It is difficult to determine the appropriate patch-size for patch-based approach. So multi-size patches are used simultaneously to represent the image regions and an ensemble is constructed in which each classifier handles one patch size. The combination of classifiers trained using multiple-size patches can recognize abnormal regions more effectively than only using single-size patches. The classification of the image patches can be performed using a discriminative binary support vector machine (SVM) or a recognition-based one-class SVM. Integration of the two types of SVMs is expected to further improve abnormal region detection. Experimental results show the good performance of our proposed ensemble.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-2372-2","10.1109/CVPR.2005.201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1467506","","Colonic polyps;Image recognition;Image segmentation;Kernel;Machine learning;Neoplasms;Pixel;Shape;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","image classification;image recognition;image representation;image segmentation;medical image processing;support vector machines","abnormal region detection;colonoscopic images;discriminative binary support vector machine;hybrid kernel machine ensemble;image classifiers;multisize patches","","3","","13","","","20-25 June 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These algorithms compare an unseen protein sequence with all the identified protein sequences and returned the higher scored protein sequences. As the sizes of the protein sequence databases are very large, it is a very time consuming job to perform exhaustive comparison of existing protein sequence. Therefore, there is a need to build an improved classification system for effectively identifying protein sequences. In this paper, a recently developed machine learning algorithm referred to as the extreme learning machine (ELM) is used to classify protein sequences with ten classes of super-families downloaded from a public domain database. A comparative study on system performance is conducted between ELM and the main conventional neural network classifier - backpropagation neural networks. Results show that ELM needs up to four orders of magnitude less training time compared to BP Network. The classification accuracy of ELM is also higher than that of BP network. For given network architecture, ELM does not have any control parameters (i.e, stopping criteria, learning rate, learning epoches, etc.) to be manually tuned and can be implemented easily.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:0-7803-9048-2","10.1109/IJCNN.2005.1556080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1556080","","Bioinformatics;Classification tree analysis;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Genomics;Machine learning;Neural networks;Protein engineering;Protein sequence;Sequences","biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;proteins","backpropagation neural network;extreme learning machine;feature patterns extraction;neural network classifier;protein sequence classification;protein sequence database;public domain database;sequence alignment","","12","","12","","","31 July-4 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These methods have a number of shortfalls e.g. many applications can use unpredictable port numbers and protocol decoding requires a high amount of computing resources or is simply infeasible in case protocols are unknown or encrypted. We propose a novel method for traffic classification and application identification using an unsupervised machine learning technique. Flows are automatically classified based on statistical flow characteristics.

Chinese question classification is the process that analyzes a question and labels it based on its question type and expected answer type. In this paper, we propose an integrated knowledge-based and machine learning approach for Chinese question classification that focuses on factoid question answering. We develop a Chinese question classification scheme for CLQA C-C (cross language question answering Chinese to Chinese) factoid question answering, and define a coarse-grained and fine-grained classification taxonomy for a Chinese question-answering system. We adopt INFOMAP inference engine to support the knowledge-based approach for Chinese questions, which can be formulated as templates and use SVM (support vector machines) as the machine learning approach for large collections of labeled Chinese questions. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of Chinese question classification using INFOMAP alone is 88% and 73.5% with SVM alone. In contrast, classification based on a hybrid approach that incorporates SVM and INFOMAP yields an accuracy rate of 92%.","","POD:0-7803-9361-9","10.1109/NLPKE.2005.1598811","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1598811","","Chaos;Computer science;Engines;Information management;Information science;Machine learning;Natural languages;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Taxonomy","classification;inference mechanisms;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Chinese question classification;Chinese question-answering system;INFOMAP inference engine;cross language question answering;knowledge-based approach;machine learning;support vector machines","","3","","17","","","30 Oct.-1 Nov. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
