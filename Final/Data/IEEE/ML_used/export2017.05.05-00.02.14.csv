As a result, violent attacks may take place and facilities may be destroyed. Such gatherings are often the beginning of security problems, about which the police are eager to obtain important relevant information. Many recent studies have focused on crowd scene analysis, while texture analysis has also been employed as a feasible method. Dynamic texturing involves patterns in a sequence of visual images with time-variation and repetition within a spatial domain, such as smoke, foliage, crowds or traffic conditions. Basically, dynamic texture lacks a uniform definition, yet exhibits a statistical regularity, with repetition of seemingly random movement patterns within a spatial domain, and exhibiting stability within a time domain. In a word, texture patterns always maintain similar characteristics in a sequence of visual images. This study uses a fixed camera to monitor a measured area, and proposes a grid model to describe crowd distribution within that area; the status value in the grid model shows various texture patterns, reflecting the crowd's motion. While the activities of a crowd are often limited to a specific space, they are not stagnant at all, as some people may occasionally join or leave; the pattern in a sequence of images of a crowd shows an obvious dynamic texture distribution. Since the dynamic textures in temporal and spatial domains have some degree of similarity, the grey relational method in gray system theory is adopted to detect the similarity among a series of test images, and to identify the dynamic texture. Under these circumstances, when the number of congested cells in the grid model increases and a high degree of similarity exists in a series of images, it is possible to identify the occurrence of dynamic texture, an- this serves as a basis for recognizing the `people gathering' phenomenon. This method can be used in public places to provide useful data when crowds gather in order to maintain public safety.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340944","Crowd scene analysis;Dynamic texture;Grey relational analysis;Grid model","","grey systems;image recognition;image sequences;image texture;object detection","crowd distribution;crowd scene analysis;dynamic texture detection;dynamic texture distribution;gray system theory;grey relational method;grid model;people gathering recognition;public safety;visual image sequence","","","","8","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This data can be valuable if they are properly organized. Only with the proper organization of these data into scalable structures, we will be able to find pattern in these data. A very important step in organizing these data is to organize the social network itself. The main challenge for users of social media is to organize their networks and content generated by them by categorizing their friends and the people they follow into different social circles. Social circles are actually lists of people from a person's friends that can be used for content filtering, privacy and sharing information only among those people in his/her circle.

In particular, machine learning algorithms are used to discover meaningful knowledge or build predictive models from data. For example, inductive learning algorithms involve generation of rules which can be in the form of either a decision tree or if-then rules. However, most of learning algorithms suffer from overfitting of training data. In other words, these learning algorithms can build models that perform extremely well on training data but poorly on other data. The overfitting problem is originating from both learning algorithms and data. In this context, the nature of machine learning problem can be referred to as bias and variance. The former is originating from learning algorithms whereas the latter is originating from data. Therefore, the reduction of overfitting can be achieved through scaling up algorithms on one side or scaling down data on the other side. Both bias and variance can be reduced through use of ensemble learning approaches. This paper introduces particular ways to address the issues on overfitting of rule based classifiers through both scaling up algorithms and scaling down data in the context of ensemble learning.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340951","Data mining;Ensemble learning;If-then rules;Inductive learning;Machine learning;Rule based classification","","data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);learning by example;pattern classification","bias reduction;classification rule generation;decision tree;hybrid ensemble learning approach;if-then rules;inductive learning algorithm;intelligent data processing;machine learning algorithm;meaningful knowledge discovery;predictive model;rule based classifier;training data overfitting;variance reduction","","","","15","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Ensemble based machine learning is a solution of minimizing risk in decision making. Bagging, boosting, stacked generalization and mixture of expert methods are the most popular techniques to construct ensemble systems. For the purpose of combining outputs of class labels, weighted majority voting, behaviour knowledge space and border count methods are used to construct independent classifiers and to achieve diversity among the classifiers which is important in ensemble learning. It was found that an ideal ensemble method should work on the principal of achieving six paramount characteristics of ensemble learning; accuracy, scalability, computational cost, usability, compactness and speed of classification. In addition, the ideal ensemble method would be able to handle large huge image size and long term historical data particularly of spatial and temporal.

Different kinds of features have different dimensions and stay in different feature space, it seems unreasonable to concatenate these features to a long vector and then deliver this feature vector to a classifier. To address this issue, we investigate into the multiple kernel learning method. This method uses the kernel trick to map the original features into a unified Hilbert space and then combine them.

Clustering analysis is an active area of machine learning and a fundamental technique of information granulation. By using different clustering algorithms and different parameters of an algorithm, a data set can be granulated into multiple granular spaces. Clustering ensemble with these granular spaces is an effective strategy of multigranulation information fusion. The existing algorithms of clustering ensemble can be categorized into three types: feature-based method, combinatorial method and graph-based method. Given the fact that every type of methods has their own advantages and disadvantages, combining their advantages will obtain better granulation results. Based on this consideration, this paper introduces a Dempster-Shafer evidence theory based clustering ensemble method that combines advantages of combinatorial method and graph-based method. In this strategy, the definition of mass functions considers neighbors of an object using the graph binarization and the final clustering ensemble result is generated by applying the Dempster's combination rule. The form of the Dempster's combination rule makes the algorithm conforming to the pattern of combinatorial method. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better performance in comparison with other seven clustering ensemble methods conducted on fourteen numerical real-world data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340898","Clustering ensemble;Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;Information fusion;Multigranulation","","graph theory;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;sensor fusion","Dempster-Shafer evidence theory;clustering analysis;clustering ensemble method;combinatorial method;feature-based method;graph binarization;graph-based method;human cognitive ability;information granulation;machine learning;multigranulation information fusion","","","","15","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many applications, the test cost of collecting features must be taken into account. Therefore, the optimal test cost feature selection with positive region constraints is an important research topic in cost-sensitive learning. To address this issue, a λ-weighted information gain algorithm has been proposed. However, this algorithm is computationally time consuming and does not produce optimal solution in most cases. To overcome these shortcomings, in this work, we design a β weighted heuristic algorithm to solve the optimal test cost feature selection with positive region constraints problem. More specifically, two major issues are addressed with regard to the β weighted heuristic algorithm. The first one takes the advantage of the test costs information and the information gain. The other one relates to a positive number β which is the only parameter selected by the user. Weights are decided by test costs and β. The proposed algorithm is compared using six datasets from UCI and a representative test cost distribution.

However, emergent event detection and prediction for platform reliability management is still an unsolved problem for most cloud service providers, especially for virtualized platforms. Hardware failure, software errors, outside attacks, and mis-actions of virtual machines make cloud platforms unstable and unreliable. In order to avoid critical events affecting reliability, resources, applications, and services can be rescheduled to get around predicted failures and mitigate potential impacts. In a cloud platform, different layers of service execution may generate different types of system events. Events from different layers can affect a system's stability together. Thus, event pattern detection and prediction are especially important for reliability and stability management. In this paper, we propose a framework to detect and predict system critical event patterns from different service types and execution layers using a reversed pattern tree augmented mechanism, so that detection and prediction can speed up. Meanwhile, wavelet neural network is also used to control the balance between prediction accuracy and speed, so that system reliability and stability can be improved.

Recent work has demonstrated that incorporating human insights with short-term automated evolution has a synergistic effect that eases deception and accelerates the discovery of solutions. While human evaluators provide rich insight into a domain, they fatigue easily. Previous work reduced the number of human evaluations by evolving a diverse set of candidates via intermittent searches for novelty. While successful at evolving solutions for a deceptive maze domain, it lacked the ability to measure solution qualities that the human evaluator implicitly identified as important. The key insights of this paper are that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) foster diversity and that the non-dominated set can serve as a surrogate for novelty while measuring user preferences data. This new approach, called Pareto Optimality-Assisted Interactive Evolutionary Computation (POA-IEC), leverages human intuitions by allowing users to identify candidates in the non-dominated set that they feel are promising. Interestingly, the experimental results demonstrate that POA-IEC finds solutions in significantly fewer evaluations than previous approaches, and that the non-dominated set contains significantly more novel behaviors than the dominated set. In this way, POA-IEC simultaneously leverages human insights while quantifying their preferences.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424447","Interactive evolutionary computation;multi-objective evolutionary algorithm;novelty search;serendipitous discovery","Artificial neural networks;Evolutionary computation;Linear programming;Robots;Search problems;Sociology;Statistics","Pareto optimisation;evolutionary computation","MOEA;POA-IEC;deceptive fitness landscape;deceptive maze domain;human evaluator;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective optimization;nondominated set;pareto optimality-assisted interactive evolutionary computation;short-term automated evolution;solution quality;user preference data","","","","29","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A network has multiple tasks, which consist of multiple network services aiding the execution of a task. An emerging track of security research has focused on event prioritization and correlation to rank the criticality of events and reduce the number of low-level events. To prioritize and correlate events, the ongoing tasks in an enterprise network are identified, as the goal of network operators is to protect ongoing tasks when a security breach occurs. The prioritization of an event depends on the criticality of an ongoing task that is potentially threatened by the event. Additionally, in order to support network operators, we correlate all events that target the same task. A particular task may depend on multiple network services and involve multiple network devices. So, if one network service becomes unavailable, other network services will be affected over time since they Unfortunately, dependency details are often not documented and are difficult to discover by relying on human expert knowledge.

As a major drawback, EFIS depends on detection of the object of interest for feature calculation, a task that is highly application-dependent. In this paper, a new version of EFIS is proposed to overcome these limitations. The new EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS), uses available training data to auto-configure the parameters that are fixed in EFIS.

In the first step a deep neural network is trained using raw Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features to discover hidden structures in the data and employing the activations of the last hidden layers of the DNN as acoustic features. In the second step using nearest neighbor, an adaptation algorithm learns speaker similarity scores based on a small amount of adaptation data from each target speaker using the DNN-based acoustic features. Based on the speaker similarity score, classification is done using a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The novelty of this work is that instead of modifying and re-training the DNN for speaker adaptation, which comprises a large number of parameters and is computationally expensive, activations of the learned DNN are used to project features from MFCC to a sparse DNN space, then speaker adaptation is performed based on similarity (i.e. nearest neighbor) using k-NN algorithm. With only a small amount of adaptation data, it reduces the number of phoneme classification error in the TIMIT dataset by 23%.

"Learning Context-Based Outcomes for Mobile Robots in Unstructured Indoor Environments","P. Parashar; R. Fisher; R. Simmons; M. Veloso; J.

The idea is that certain features in the environment may be predictive of differences in outcomes, such as how long a mobile robot takes to traverse a corridor. Doing so enables the robot to plan more effectively, and also be able to interact with people more effectively by more accurately predicting when its plans may take longer to execute or may be likely to fail. We use a node-and-edge based map of the environment and treat the traversal time of the robot for each edge as a random variable to be characterized. The first step is to determine whether the distribution of the random variable is multimodal and, if so, we learn to classify the modes using a hierarchy of plan-time features (e.g., time of the day, day of the week) and run-time features (observations of recent traversal times through other corridors). We utilize a cascading regression system that first estimates which mode of the traversal distribution we expect the robot to observe, and then predict the actual traversal time through a corridor. On average, our method produces a mean residual error of less than 2.7 seconds.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424402","Mobile robotics;regression trees","Computational modeling;Mobile robots;Regression tree analysis;Robot kinematics;Training","control engineering computing;indoor environment;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;path planning;random processes;regression analysis;statistical distributions","behaviors;cascading regression system;context-based outcomes learning;context-dependent outcomes;mean residual error;mobile robots;modes classification;node-and-edge based map;plan-time features;random variable distribution;robot planning;robot traversal time;run-time features;traversal distribution;unstructured indoor environments","","","","11","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast, in medical imaging, not all parts of the image may be equally significant or relevant to the image retrieval application at hand. For instance, in lung x-ray image, the lung region may contain a tumour, hence being highly significant whereas the surrounding area does not contain significant information from medical diagnosis perspective. In this paper, we propose to detect salient regions of images during training and fold the data to reduce the effect of irrelevant regions. As a result, smaller image areas will be used for LBP features calculation and consequently classification by SVM. We use IRMA 2009 dataset with 14,410 xray images to verify the performance of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate the benefits of saliency-based folding approach that delivers comparable classification accuracies with state-of-the-art but exhibits lower computational cost and storage requirements, factors highly important for big data analytics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424297","Image classification;folding;local binary patterns;saliency;support vector machines","Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Support vector machines;Training;Visualization","Big Data;X-ray imaging;image classification;image retrieval;medical image processing;patient diagnosis;support vector machines;tumours","LBP features;SVM;big data analytics;image retrieval;local binary patterns;lung X-ray image;medical diagnosis;medical image classification;saliency-based folded data;support vector machines;tumour","","5","","27","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Topic labeling, which aims to assign meaningful labels for discovered topics, has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we argue that the quality of topic labeling can be improved by considering ontology concepts rather than words alone, in contrast to previous works in this area, which usually represent topics via groups of words selected from topics. We have created: (1) a topic model that integrates ontological concepts with topic models in a single framework, where each topic and each concept are represented as a multinomial distribution over concepts and over words, respectively, and (2) a topic labeling method based on the ontological meaning of the concepts included in the discovered topics. In selecting the best topic labels, we rely on the semantic relatedness of the concepts and their ontological classifications. The results of our experiments conducted on two different data sets show that introducing concepts as additional, richer features between topics and words and describing topics in terms of concepts offers an effective method for generating meaningful labels for the discovered topics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424318","DBpedia ontology;Statistical learning;topic model labeling;topic modeling","Computational modeling;Computer science;Knowledge based systems;Labeling;Ontologies;Semantics;Vocabulary","ontologies (artificial intelligence);statistical distributions;text analysis","automatic topic labeling;latent topic;multinomial distribution;ontological classification;ontology-based topic model;semantic relatedness;text corpora","","","","18","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using the modified LBP adds a discriminating factor to the examined feature via the addition of an edge detector.

The human mind is able to efficiently and quickly process images through the visual cortex, in part due to its parallel nature. A basic Kohonen self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is one example of a mapping methodology in the class of neural networks that does this very well. Optimally the result is a nicely mapped neural network representative of the data set, however SOFMs do not translate to a parallelized architecture very well. The problem stems from the neighborhoods that are established between the neurons, creating race conditions for updating winning neurons. We propose a fully parallelized mapping architecture based loosely on SOFM called decaying potential fields neural network (DPFNN). We show that DPFNN uses neurons that are computationally uncoupled but symbolically linked. Through analysis we show this allows for the neurons to reach convergence with having only a passive data dependency on each other, as opposed to a hazard generating direct dependency.

It needs a model that is capable of estimating the consequences of possible actions, so that planning, control, and decision-making become feasible. For scientific purposes, such models are usually created in a problem specific manner using differential equations and other techniques from control-and system-theory. In contrast to that, we aim for an unsupervised approach that builds up the desired model in a self-organized fashion. Inspired by Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), our approach is to extract subsignals from the input, that behave as predictable as possible. These ""predictable features"" are highly relevant for modeling, because predictability is a desired property of the needed consequence-estimating model by definition. In our approach, we measure predictability with respect to a certain prediction model. We focus here on the solution of the arising optimization problem and present a tractable algorithm based on algebraic methods which we call Predictable Feature Analysis (PFA). We prove that the algorithm finds the globally optimal signal if this signal can be predicted with low error. To deal with cases where the optimal signal has a significant prediction error, we provide a robust, heuristically motivated variant of the algorithm and verify it empirically. Additionally, we give formal criteria a prediction model must meet to be suitable for measuring predictability in the PFA setting and also provide a suitable default model along with a formal proof that it meets these criteria.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424307","data analysis;dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;model building;predictability;self organization;signal analysis;unsupervised learning","Conferences","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation","PFA;SFA;algebraic methods;consequence-estimating model;control-theory;differential equations;formal criteria;globally optimal signal;optimization problem;predictable feature analysis;prediction error;prediction model;slow-feature analysis;system-theory;tractable algorithm;unsupervised approach","","","","16","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Its undesirable effect on the classification performance is compounded with the fact that, in general, the class with fewer instances is the class of interest. Bagging has been utilized by practitioners in the field to overcome the challenge of class imbalance and to improve the classification performance. Our motivation for this study is to investigate whether changes to the bootstrapping step of bagging classifiers can further improve their performance. Specifically, these modifications to the bootstrapping process take into account the membership of the classes. We performed an extensive empirical study utilizing four bootstrap approaches within bagging framework using three feature rankers along with four feature subset sizes and two base classifiers across 15 imbalanced bioinformatics datasets. Three of these bootstrap approaches were proposed and implemented by our research team for this study. Our results show that all new approaches improve performance over the classic bootstrap approach, with balanced bagging having the highest performance, however, observed increases in performance are not statistically significant. We recommend the balanced bootstrap approach because it shows the most improvement, in terms of frequency of having the highest performance, and it generates fully balanced bootstrap datasets that can account for the class imbalance problem. The uniqueness of this paper is proposing and implementing the three innovative bootstrapping approaches to examine the effects of these bootstrapping processes against the classic one on the performance of bagging classifiers in the domain of bioinformatics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424449","Class imbalance;bagging;bioinformatics;bootstrap approaches","Algorithm design and analysis;Bagging;Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Decision trees;Learning systems;Training","bioinformatics;data mining;feature extraction;pattern classification","bagging classifiers;balanced bagging;balanced bootstrap;base classifiers;bioinformatics datasets;bootstrapping approaches;class imbalance;classification performance;data mining;feature rankers;feature subset sizes;innovative bootstrapping","","1","","28","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some of the developed works assumed that classifiers' outputs are independent, however in practice an ensemble of classifiers shows dependent behavior between each other. In this work, a theoretical model is derived for estimating the misclassification error probability of MCS based on majority vote combiner. In the derivation, we assumed that each classifier produces at its output an estimation of the posterior class probability that has a Gaussian distribution. In addition, we assumed that each classifier has two classes, and the outputs of classifiers are dependent and identically distributed. We validated our model using computer simulations. Results show that the ensemble performance is highly sensitive to class variance while exhibits a smoother behavior against class mean. Also, results show that as the correlation among classifiers' outputs increases, the probability of classification error degrades exponentially. The trend continues until the performance reaches the behavior of a single classifier regardless of the number of base classifiers used in the ensemble.

CPNMF preserves the geometrical structure of dataset via manifold regularization meanwhile captures the inherent structure of labels by using label correlations.

On average, wind energy accounts for 20% of Nicaragua's total generation, and can produce up to 50% within a given hour. Under the renewable energy regime fuel-oil generators are the main source of grid flexibility. Information-driven flexibility, such as improved demand prediction, can be used to reduce the need of fuel-oil based flexibility without affecting reliability. This paper evaluates and compares the use of multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR) in their ability to minimize electricity demand forecast error in Nicaragua. We find SVR reduces the mean absolute percent error of prediction to 3.8%, compared with MLR (7.7%). SVR further performs a prediction with 21% less error than the current prediction mechanism employed by the utility. Finally, we discuss how improved prediction algorithms can be used to reduce Nicaragua's dependency on fuel-oil for flexibility, while also reducing costs for the utility.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.40","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424335","MLR;Nicaragua;STLF;SVR;grid flexibility","Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Reliability;Renewable energy sources;Training;Wind forecasting","electricity supply industry;load forecasting;power grids;regression analysis;renewable energy sources;support vector machines","MLR;Nicaragua;SVR;electricity demand prediction;electricity supply;fuel-oil generators;grid flexibility;multiple linear regression;power production;renewable energy;support vector regression","","","","25","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to further improve the performance of a model learned from data with these integrated labels, we propose an active learning framework to further improve the data quality, such that to improve the model quality, through acquiring limited true labels from experts (the oracle). We further investigate two active learning strategies in terms of two uncertainty measures (i.e., CLUE and MUE) within the active learning framework.

It is essential that, the accurate data must be sharable with research communities and scientists in order to improve quality of life. However, accurate records of personal data include sensitive information about individuals. Hence sharing these records without applying any anonymization criteria paves the way for disclosure of personal privacy. In an effort to protect personal privacy, Privacy-Preserving Data Mining (PPDM) and Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing (PPDP) approaches have been studied extensively. Numerous works have been dedicated to diversifying techniques for de-identification or anonymization of identifiable datasets, but there is an important trade-off between data loss and data privacy. While original data anonymized, it exposed to information loss. In order to minimize information loss, the anonymization algorithms discard keeping diversity. In this study, we proposed an approach that uses a clustering algorithm as a pre-process for privacy preserving methods to improve the diversity of anonymized data. In addition, the effect of clustering on anonymization was evaluated by using original and clustered form of a real world dataset. The results are evaluated with the aspect of usability in scientific works and it was observed that a clustering algorithm and an affective anonymization algorithm must be used in privacy preservation approaches in order to keep diversity of the original datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.198","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424321","anonymization;clustering;data diversity;data privacy;privacy preserving","Clustering algorithms;Data privacy;Human immunodeficiency virus;Privacy;Publishing","data mining;data privacy;pattern clustering","PPDM approach;PPDP approach;anonymization criteria;clustering effect;data loss;data privacy;dataset diversity;personal privacy;privacy preservation approach;privacy-preserving data mining;privacy-preserving data publishing","","","","23","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Decision tree pruning technique is regarded as an important component of the optimization of decision tree. However, many previous cost-sensitive decision trees researches focus on minimizing the misclassification rate and removing nodes when the cost of the pruned tree is less than the original one. In this paper, we propose an effective method for building cost-sensitive decision tree and a probabilistic pruning mechanism for the decision tree. There are two major contributions of this paper. Firstly, the cost-sensitive decision tree is built to make predictions to minimize the total cost of test costs and different costs associated with different types of misclassification. Compared with existing models, leaves are labeled by minimizing the total cost instead of the majority class. Secondly, we design a probabilistic pruning mechanism where the pruning probability is related to the change of costs around pruning. The pruning results yield worse performance on the training set, but better performance on the testing set. Therefore, the probabilistic pruning mechanism improves the performance of the cost-sensitive decision tree. Experimental results show the efficiency of the probabilistic pruning mechanism for cost-sensitive decision tree.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340902","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340902","Cost-sensitive decision tree;Granular computing;Misclassification cost;Probabilistic pruning;Test cost","","data mining;decision trees;granular computing;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;probability","classification tasks;cost-sensitive decision tree;data mining;decision tree optimization;machine learning;probabilistic pruning mechanism","","","","22","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to these difficulties, variations in kidney shapes, positions and gray levels make automated identification and segmentation of the kidney harder. Also, different image characteristics with different scanners much more increase the difficulty of the segmentation task. Therefore, in this paper, we present an automated kidney segmentation method by using a multi-layer perceptron based approach that adapts all parameters according to images to handle all these challenging problems. The efficiency in terms of the segmentation performance is achieved by using the information from the previously segmented kidney image. The proposed approach is also efficient in terms of required processing time since it does not include pre-processing and training stages, which are very time consuming. Moreover, the unsupervised segmentation approach eliminates the common problem of most neural network based approaches that is dependency of results to the chosen data in the training stage.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.229","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424483","Kidney segmentation;MR images;neural networks","Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Conferences;Image segmentation;Kidney;Neural networks;Shape","biomedical MRI;image segmentation;image sequences;kidney;medical image processing;multilayer perceptrons","MR images;adjacent organs;automated kidney identification;automated kidney segmentation method;contrast media injection;gray level similarities;kidney shapes;medical image sequences;multilayer perceptron;neural network;partial volume effects;robust kidney segmentation;unsupervised segmentation approach","","1","","15","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work we create a dominance-MPCA (D-MPCA) with a network of populations that implements a dominance strategy.

However, MSE is just a second order statistics and hence does not capture the entire information about the probability distribution of the error in the system. An information theoretic alternative is using the minimum error entropy (MEE) cost function. Adaptive algorithms based on this criterion have been developed and shown to be superior as compared to MSE counterparts. In this work, kernel versions of some of these methods are designed and tested on predicting the annual sunspot number. The sunspot number is the number of visibly darker regions on the solar surface and has been shown to be instrumental in modeling space weather, state of the ionosphere, climatic anomalies and even global warming. A comparative performance study of the various linear and kernel algorithms, trained with both MEE and MSE criteria, in predicting such a chaotic non-linear time series is presented in this paper. Experimental results clearly show the advantage of the MEE based kernel design which is as per expectation given that it has the advantage of being non-linear along with being able to derive maximum information from the error distribution.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.173","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424329","Error Entropy;Information theoretic learning;Kernel methods","Approximation algorithms;Cost function;Entropy;Kernel;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Signal processing algorithms","adaptive filters;atmospheric techniques;entropy;geophysical signal processing;global warming;ionosphere;mean square error methods;minimisation;statistical distributions;sunspots;time series","MEE cost function;MEE-based kernel design;MSE cost function minimization;adaptive algorithm;adaptive filtering;chaotic nonlinear time series;climatic anomaly;global warming;ionosphere;kernel adaptive filter;mean squared error cost function minimization;minimum error entropy cost;minimum error entropy cost function;probability distribution;solar surface;space weather modeling;sunspot number prediction","","","","12","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, its feedback gain selection becomes more sensitive and difficult since the switching frequency tends to be faster in recent converters to satisfy the requirements of miniaturization and power efficiency. Therefore, a novel control method is needed to improve the transient response of output voltage effectively. Recently, the reference modification method has been proposed to improve the transient response. It is expected to have a superior performance since it can be adopted without sensitive gain selection. This paper investigates improved characteristics by employing the reference modification method based on a neural network predictor for a digital PI controller of dc -- dc converters. The reference modification is a method which is added to the conventional feedback controls without gain selection such as auto tuning method during the transient state to improve the transient response. Therefore, it is expected that the unstable phenomena from gain selection can be avoided. Additionally, the reference modification is realized by a neural network predictor, which learns the dynamical behavior of the output voltage of converter. The designing of the feedback gain parameter becomes a easier task since the reference modification can adjust the command value to be more suitable one without changing the gain parameter. The effect of improvement is shown in simulated results and it is confirmed that the reference modification can be improve the transient characteristics compared to the conventional digital PI control.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.123","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424480","PI control;dc-dc converter;neural network","Neural networks;Pi control;Switches;Transient analysis;Transient response;Voltage control","DC-DC power convertors;PI control;control system synthesis;digital control;feedback;neurocontrollers;voltage control","PI controller;controller transient response;digital feedback control;digitally controlled DC-DC converter;direct current;feedback gain parameter design;feedback gain selection;neural network predictor;output voltage transient response;power supply;proportional-integral controller;reference modification method;switching converter control;switching frequency","","","","10","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents two audio content-based systems for influence recognition: a system using a spectral representation (Constant-q transform) and support vector machines and another system that obtains features by using a deep belief network and then logistic regression for classification. The system using the spectral representation provides a baseline for future comparisons and evidence to support the idea that influence recognition can be performed using information extracted from the audio signal. The other system attempts to improve performance by using a deep belief network to learn features useful for influence recognition by mapping data extracted from the audio signal to labeled influence data.

In this work, we investigate whether they could help improve genre classification in music. In particular, we explore various dichotomy structures of binary classifiers in music data. In addition to the existing ones, we propose several strategies to build new binary tree structures. We base our approach on the observation that people find it easy to distinguish between certain classes and difficult between others.

It was hypothesized that a system could be constructed with comparatively accurate classifications to Rösler & Suendermann's K*-based system, but with enough speed to be utilized within a BCI by constructing ensembles from eager learners (e.g. decision trees). To meet these requirements, three ensemble learners were developed: a rotational forest that implements random forests as its base classifiers (RRF), a rotational forest that implements J48 trees as its base classifiers and is boosted by adaptive boosting (ada(RJ48F)), and an ensemble of the RRF model with Rösler & Suendermann's K* model (RRF+K*). The RRF and ada(RJ48F) models were shown to have a classification speed faster than the K* model by a factor of seventeen and thirteen respectively, though the RRF model was significantly less accurate and the ada(RJ48F) model had an accuracy comparable to K*. The results of this study indicate that instance-based learners like the K* algorithm are likely to be too slow to be used within a BCI device, while the ada(RJ48F) model performed accurate classifications well within the time constraints of real-time classification and control.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.89","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424351","EEG;boosting;classification;eye state;rotational forest","Boosting;Brain modeling;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Vegetation","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;eye;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;signal classification;trees (mathematics)","BCI;EEG data;EEG recordings;J48 trees;K*-based system;RRF model;ada-RJ48F models;boosted rotational forests;brain activity;brain-computer interfacing technology;eager learners;electrode recording data;eye state prediction;random forests;time constraints","","","","19","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With that in mind, we built a system, BreakFast, to measure and compare the speed of delivery of breaking news from various news sources to readers. One of the primary challenges of this comparison is how to identify which breaking news items are about the same emerging event but reported by different news agencies with different headlines and content. To tackle this problem, we extracted keywords automatically from the content, identified important topics, and then developed a classification model. The model identifies the same breaking stories from multiple news sources with an accuracy of approximately 90%. We also proposed new metrics to evaluate the speed of breaking news services and built real-time dashboards to monitor performance over time.

Common Linear In the Parameters (LIP) approximation structures are for example polynomials, radial basis functions or grid-based lookup tables. Typical learning algorithms accompanying them are for example Passive-Aggressive (PA) or Recursive Least Squares (RLS). Usually, these two choices are not independent as not every learning algorithm is able to handle any approximation structure well. Here we present a formalism that allows the designer to treat these two design aspects independently from each other. By decorrelating the basis functions of the approximator we form a new set of basis functions that can be handled by any learning algorithm. We develop design guidelines in order to make our approach an easy to use tool and to support the designer in making the learning progress reliable at design time.

Eng., Western Univ., London, ON, Canada","2015 IEEE 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","20160303","2015","","","509","514","Predicting energy demand peak is a key factor for reducing energy demand and electricity bills for commercial customers. Features influencing energy demand are many and complex, such as occupant behaviours and temperature. Feature selection can decrease prediction model complexity without sacrificing performance. In this paper, features were selected based on their multiple linear regression correlation coefficients. This paper discusses the capabilities of M5 model trees in energy demand prediction for commercial buildings. M5 model trees are similar to regression trees, however they are more suitable for continuous prediction problems. The M5 model tree prediction was developed based on a selected feature set including sensor energy demand readings, day of the week, season, humidity, and weather conditions (sunny, rain, etc.). The performance of the M5 model tree was evaluated by comparing it to the support vector regression (SVR) and artificial neural networks (ANN) models. The M5 model tree outperformed the SVR and ANN models with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.94 compared to 10.02 and 12.04 for the SVR and ANN models respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424367","M5 model trees;artificial neural networks;feature selection;multiple linear regression;predicting energy demand peak;support vector regression","Artificial neural networks;Autoregressive processes;Buildings;Correlation coefficient;Linear regression;Mathematical model;Predictive models","energy consumption;environmental science computing;feature selection;regression analysis;trees (mathematics)","ANN model;M5 model tree prediction;SVR model;artificial neural networks;energy demand peak prediction;feature selection;multiple linear regression correlation coefficients;regression trees;support vector regression","","1","","24","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Improved Wind Power Forecasting Using Combination Methods","C. E. Köksoy; M. B. Özkan; S. Buhan; T. Demirci; Y. Arslan; A. Birtürk; P. Karagöz","Middle East Tech.

Moreover, the power plant owners need reliable information about day-ahead power production for market operations. Therefore, wind power forecasting approaches have been gaining importance in renewable energy research area. The Wind Power Monitoring and Forecast System for Turkey (RITM) currently monitors a growing number of wind power plants in Turkey, and uses wind power measurements in addition to different numerical weather predictions to generate short-term power forecasts. Forecasting models of RITM give considerably good results individually. However, forecast combination approaches are frequently used in order not to rely on a single forecast model, and also utilize forecast diversification. In this paper, an analysis of wind power domain and the current wind power forecasting methods of RITM are presented. Then, three main forecast combination approaches, namely Lp-norm based combination, FSS (Fuzzy Soft Sets) based combination and tree-based combination, are proposed to provide better forecasts. These combination methods have been verified on forecasts data of RITM in terms of normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) metric. The experimental results show that all of the applied combination methods give lower NMAE rates for most of the wind power plants compared to individual forecasts.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.60","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424473","Lp-norm estimators;forecast combination;fuzzy soft sets;random forests;regression trees;wind power forecasting","Artificial neural networks;Forecasting;Predictive models;Training;Wind forecasting;Wind power generation","load forecasting;power grids;power markets;power system measurement;power transmission;weather forecasting;wind power;wind power plants","NMAE;RITM;Turkey;combination methods;day-ahead power production;forecasting models;fuzzy soft sets;normalized mean absolute error;power forecasts;power plant owners;renewable energy;transmission grid;tree-based combination;weather predictions;wind power domain analysis;wind power forecasting methods;wind power measurements;wind power monitoring and forecast system;wind power plants","","","","18","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new mixed-membership Bayesian generative model of the latent topics in XML corpora is proposed. Approximate posterior inference and parameter estimation are derived for the devised XML topic model and implemented by a Gibbs sampling algorithm. This is used to infer the topic distributions of the input XML documents. In turn, such distributions are separated to divide the whole XML corpus by latent-topic similarity. Experiments on real-world XML corpora reveal an overcoming effectiveness with respect to several state-of-the-art competitors.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0287-0; POD:978-1-5090-0288-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2015.148","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7424368","Bayesian Probabilistic XML Analysis;Generative XML Topic Modeling;XML CLustering","Adaptation models;Bayes methods;Parameter estimation;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Vegetation;XML","Bayes methods;XML;data mining;parameter estimation;pattern clustering;sampling methods","Bayesian generative topic modeling;Gibbs sampling algorithm;XML corpora;XML documents;XML topic model;approximate posterior inference estimation;mining clusters;parameter estimation;topic distributions","","","","36","","","9-11 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
