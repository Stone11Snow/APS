Such sequences are a family of sampling methods commonly employed for numerical integration, yielding a more efficient covering of multidimensional sets with respect to random sequences, without the need for any computationally intensive procedure. In particular, we prove that the universal approximation property of the ELM is guaranteed when LDSs are employed, and how an efficient covering affects the convergence positively.

In this approach, the distinctive features of PQ event signals have been acquired by applying the HT on all the decomposed levels and in order to analysis the performance of the proposed method on noisy conditions, three types of PQ event data sets are constructed by accumulating noise of 25, 35 and 45 dB.

However, not many kernel functions combining directly the bitemporal images' information are designed specifically for change detection tasks. In addition, extreme learning machine (ELM) has not found wide applications in change detection tasks, even though it is a potential kernel method possessing outstanding approximation and generalization capabilities as well as great classification accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, an approach relying on a difference correlation kernel (DCK) and a multistage ELM (MS-ELM) is proposed in this paper for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change detection. First, a DCK function is constructed specifically for change detection by measuring the ‚Äúdistance‚Äù between any two pixels. The DCK function depicts the cross-time similarities between couples of bitemporal image patches at any cyclic shifts with a kernel correlation operation and the high-order spatial distances between two differently located pixels with an algebraic subtraction. The DCK function possesses strong noise immunity and good identification of changed areas simultaneously. Second, an MS-ELM classifier is constructed for obtaining the change detection result. In MS-ELM, the hidden nodes and weights between the hidden and output layers are updated stage by stage by improving the kernel functions that compose them. Each stage of the MS-ELM is a standard kernel-ELM, and the DCK function is utilized in the first stage. The regenerative kernel functions incorporate the output spatial-neighborhood information of the previous stage for enhancing remarkably the MS-ELM's discriminating ability and noise resistance. The converged result at the last stage of MS-ELM is the final change detection result. Experiments on real SAR image change detection demonstrate the effectiveness of the - CK function and the MS-ELM algorithm, particularly its good identification of changed areas and strong robustness against noise in SAR images.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2016.2578438","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498649","Change detection;difference correlation kernel (DCK) function;multistage extreme learning machine (ELM) (MS-ELM);spatial-neighborhood information;synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image","Change detection algorithms;Correlation;Feature extraction;Kernel;Standards;Support vector machines;Synthetic aperture radar","image classification;radar imaging;remote sensing by radar;synthetic aperture radar","DCK function;MS-ELM classifier;SAR image change detection;algebraic subtraction;application-adaptive kernelized classifier;bitemporal image patches;bitemporal images information;change detection tasks;correlation kernel;kernel function;kernel functions;kernel methods;multistage extreme learning machine;noise immunity;noise resistance;output spatial-neighborhood information;real SAR image change detection;standard kernel-ELM;synthetic aperture radar","","","","","","20160623","Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

From the observation data, the growth behavior is modeled by regression graphs using single hidden layer feed-forward network (SLFN). To train and test the data, extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm is applied. Recently, ELM is approved to be the fastest algorithm to learn an SLFN for regression. ELM is also well-known for its high learning accuracy as various activation functions can be applied in hidden layer. Yet the over-fitting in regression is still an issue in ELM.

In such conditions, electricity price is a key index that reflects competition between generators, percentage of renewable generation and load behavior. An accurate forecast of the future price allows both producers and customers to plan their strategies, increase their profits and avoid contingencies. For this purpose, this paper proposes two predictors that perform half-hour-ahead and day-ahead price forecast, respectively. Both predictors are based on three learning machines, namely artificial neural network, support vector regression and random forest, in addition to persistence model which is used as reference. The built models are tested through real historical time series from New South Wales in Australia, which include half-hourly price and load. The profiles are analyzed with the aim of defining correlations and choosing adequate inputs. Then, the performance of each machine is assessed using the mean absolute percentage error, in order to determine the most suitable prediction machine according to the case.

SSDL is a semisupervised extension of recent fully supervised label consistent dictionary learning approach, since the number of labeled machine data is usually limited in practice. To enable the supervised dictionary learning model to use both labeled and commonly readily available unlabeled data for enhancing performance, we propose to incorporate the merits of label prediction and present a joint label consistent dictionary learning and adaptive label prediction technique. In this setting, we first employ the existing label prediction model to estimate the labels of unlabeled training signals in a transductive fashion for enriching supervised prior. Then, we use predicted labeled data for label consistent dictionary learning. After that, we apply the discriminant sparse codes as the adaptive reconstruction weights for label prediction to update the estimated labels of unlabeled training data and the discriminative sparse codes matrix for label consistent dictionary learning so that classification performance can be enhanced. Thus, an informative dictionary, a sparse-code matrix, and an optimal multiclass classifier can be alternately obtained from one objective function. Besides, the tricky process of choosing optimal kernel width and neighborhood size can also be effectively voided in our scheme due to the adaptive weights. Extensive simulations on several machine fault datasets show that our SSDL method can deliver enhanced performance over other state-of-the-arts for machine fault classification.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2015.2496272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312982","Dictionary learning;Semi-supervised learning;dictionary learning;label prediction;machine fault classification;semisupervised learning","Encoding;Linear programming;Optimization;Sparse matrices;Training;Training data","condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);mechanical engineering computing;signal classification;sparse matrices","SSDL framework;adaptive label prediction technique;adaptive reconstruction weight;adaptive weight;classification performance;discriminant sparse codes;discriminative sparse code matrix;informative dictionary;joint label consistent dictionary learning;labeled machine data;neighborhood size;objective function;optimal kernel width;optimal multiclass classifier;semisupervised label consistent dictionary learning framework;semisupervised machine fault classification;unlabeled training data;unlabeled training signals","","3","","24","","20151030","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, the performance of the fingerprinting technique severely suffers from device heterogeneity existing across commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, tablet computers, etc.) and indoor environmental changes (e.g., the number, distribution and activities of people, the placement of furniture, etc.). In this paper, we transform the received signal strength (RSS) to a standardized location fingerprint based on the Procrustes analysis, and introduce a similarity metric, termed signal tendency index (STI), for matching standardized fingerprints. An analysis of the capability of the proposed STI to handle device heterogeneity and environmental changes is presented.

In this paper, we explore supervised learning algorithms and propose a new model named Conditional High-order Boltzmann Machine (CHBM), which can be directly used as a bilinear classifier to assign similarity scores for pairwise images. Then, to better deal with complex data relation, we propose a gated version of CHBM which untangles factors of variation by exploiting a set of latent variables to gate classification. We perform four-order tensor factorization for parameter reduction, and present two efficient supervised learning algorithms from the perspectives of being generative and discriminative, respectively.

In addition, it has been shown that Heart Rate Variability (HRV) may well be utilized as an early indicator of cardiac disease susceptibility and the existence of diabetes. As a result, the HRV can be exercised for early clinical test of these diseases. Most existing systems make use of Support Vector Machine (SVM), owing to the generalization performance, it is not sufficient for the accurate classification of heart rate data. In order to overcome this complication, Improved Extreme Learning Machine (IELM) classifier is used, to obtain the best parameter value and best feature subset through the use of Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) that feed the classifier. Here in this work, features of linear and nonlinear are extracted from the HRV signals. Following the preprocessing, feature extraction is done effectively together with feature selection with the assistance of BFO for the purpose of data reduction.

The ELM developed was reverse mapped to identify the optimum levels of independent parameters to achieve the lowest miss and multiple indices, and precision in seed spacing. The reverse mapping of the ELM resulted in 3 solutions, and they can be adopted in the actual precision planter. The forward and reverse mapping of the ELM regression model was found to be effective in prediction of performance and optimization of the design and operational parameters of the planting equipment.","","DVD:978-1-4673-6706-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-6708-0; POD:978-1-4673-6709-7","10.1109/ISACC.2015.7377317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7377317","extreme learning machine;optimization;precision planter;prediction;reverse mapping","Indexes;Predictive models;Silicon","agricultural engineering;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;optimisation;regression analysis","ELM regression;extreme learning machine;forward mapping;mean square error;miss index;multiple index;optimization;planting equipment;pneumatic planter;precision planter;reverse mapping;sigmoid activation function","","","","11","","","14-15 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) is usually used to select a model with good generalization performance among potential candidates. The primary reason for using the LOO-CV is that it is unbiased and reliable as long as similar distribution exists in the training and testing data. However, the LOO-CV has rarely been implemented in practice because of its notorious slow execution speed. In this paper, an efficient LOO-CV formula and an efficient LOO-CV-based ELM (ELOO-ELM) algorithm are proposed. The proposed ELOO-ELM algorithm can achieve fast learning speed similar to the original ELM without compromising the reliability feature of the LOO-CV. Furthermore, minimal user intervention is required for the ELOO-ELM, thus it can be easily adopted by nonexperts and implemented in automation processes.

The orthogonal least squares (OLS) is introduced to derive a new criterion for evaluating candidate hidden units, which avoids the computation of Moore-Penrose generalized inverse in the training process. Moreover, the calculation of output weights can be greatly simplified. Besides its efficiency, we show that the proposed evaluation function can effectively identify optimal candidate unit which leads to maximum error (sum of squared errors, SSE) reduction of the network.

Route stability and energy saving are key issues for an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) working in the underwater environment. To ensure that AUV can pass through the target area steadily and safely, a path smoother is required. This paper puts forward a novel path planning method based on extreme learning machine (ELM), which generates a smooth and safe path at a quite fast speed. First a Voronoi preprocessor is employed to label the obstacles in the map and generate a rough path connecting the initial and the goal positions. Due to the property of nonlinear separating surface as well as fast learning speed, ELM is then applied to regenerate and smooth the path to ensure that the vehicle drives automatically and safely. Related experiments also validate the performance of our proposed method as expected. More analysis and some possible limitations are also discussed.","","Electronic:978-0-9339-5743-5","10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7401951","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7401951","autonomous underwater vehicle;extreme learning machine;path planning;smooth","Collision avoidance;Heuristic algorithms;Joining processes;Path planning;Planning;Underwater vehicles;Vehicles","autonomous underwater vehicles;computational geometry;learning (artificial intelligence);path planning","AUV;ELM;Voronoi preprocessor;autonomous underwater vehicle;energy saving;extreme learning machine;nonlinear separating surface;path planning algorithms;path smoother;piecewise linear functions;route stability;underwater environment","","","","19","","","19-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, machinery operates in a dynamic environment and the acquired condition monitoring data are usually noisy and subject to a high level of uncertainty/unpredictability, which complicates prognostics. The complexity further increases, when there is absence of prior knowledge about ground truth (or failure definition). For such issues, data-driven prognostics can be a valuable solution without deep understanding of system physics. This paper contributes a new data-driven prognostics approach namely, an ‚Äúenhanced multivariate degradation modeling,‚Äù which enables modeling degrading states of machinery without assuming a homogeneous pattern. In brief, a predictability scheme is introduced to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Following that, the proposed prognostics model is achieved by integrating two new algorithms namely, the summation wavelet-extreme learning machine and subtractive-maximum entropy fuzzy clustering to show evolution of machine degradation by simultaneous predictions and discrete state estimation. The prognostics model is equipped with a dynamic failure threshold assignment procedure to estimate RUL in a realistic manner.

Then automatic windowing was applied to images to reduce the negative impact on the process of image-free areas of tissue information. The obtained images were normalized and thresholded using histogram equalization. The average, standard deviation and distortion values of the image feature matrix obtained by applying wavelet transform (WT) and complex valued wavelet transform (CVWT) onto the thresholded images were calculated.

Huang","School of Information and Electronics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","20160315","2016","27","4","809","821","Extreme learning machine (ELM) is an emerging learning algorithm for the generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks, of which the hidden node parameters are randomly generated and the output weights are analytically computed. However, due to its shallow architecture, feature learning using ELM may not be effective for natural signals (e.g., images/videos), even with a large number of hidden nodes. To address this issue, in this paper, a new ELM-based hierarchical learning framework is proposed for multilayer perceptron. The proposed architecture is divided into two main components: 1) self-taught feature extraction followed by supervised feature classification and 2) they are bridged by random initialized hidden weights. The novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) unsupervised multilayer encoding is conducted for feature extraction, and an ELM-based sparse autoencoder is developed via ‚Ñì<sub>1</sub> constraint. By doing so, it achieves more compact and meaningful feature representations than the original ELM; 2) by exploiting the advantages of ELM random feature mapping, the hierarchically encoded outputs are randomly projected before final decision making, which leads to a better generalization with faster learning speed; and 3) unlike the greedy layerwise training of deep learning (DL), the hidden layers of the proposed framework are trained in a forward manner. Once the previous layer is established, the weights of the current layer are fixed without fine-tuning. Therefore, it has much better learning efficiency than the DL. Extensive experiments on various widely used classification data sets show that the proposed algorithm achieves better and faster convergence than the existing state-of-the-art hierarchical learning methods. Furthermore, multiple applications in computer vision further confirm the generality and capability of the proposed learning scheme.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2424995","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103337","Deep learning (DL);deep neural network (DNN);extreme learning machine (ELM);multilayer perceptron (MLP);random feature mapping;random feature mapping.","Artificial neural networks;Feature extraction;Least squares approximations;Nonhomogeneous media;Optimization;Training","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification","DL;ELM random feature mapping;ELM-based hierarchical learning framework;ELM-based sparse autoencoder;computer vision;decision making;deep learning;extreme learning machine;feature learning;feature representations;generalized single hidden layer feedforward neural networks;greedy layerwise training;hierarchical learning methods;hierarchically encoded outputs;learning algorithm;learning speed;multilayer perceptron;random initialized hidden weights;self-taught feature extraction;supervised feature classification;unsupervised multilayer encoding","","33","","33","","20150507","April 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is well-established for parameter identification; however EIS has traditionally been a laboratory procedure. With the recent prevalence of low-cost DSPs, it has become feasible to use EIS in online applications. This paper focuses on implementing EIS using a DC/DC converter topology commonly found in renewable energy applications. An AC ripple voltage is injected into the battery by modulating the PWM duty cycle, then the current and phase-shift response is analyzed to determine the frequency-dependent impedance. Voltage and current sensing devices have been developed so that the technique can be implemented on a TI F2833 DSP. EIS is performed at set intervals during entire charge cycles on test batteries in order to produce a data-driven model. Regression is performed using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) neural-network algorithm. The derived model is then verified by predicting the SoC of a battery used as a test sample.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7657-7; POD:978-1-4799-7658-4","10.1109/IFEEC.2015.7361603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7361603","","Batteries;Battery charge measurement;Current measurement;Hardware;Impedance;Mathematical model;Voltage measurement","DC-DC power convertors;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;power engineering computing;power system parameter estimation;renewable energy sources;secondary cells","AC ripple voltage;DC-DC converter topology;DSP;EIS;ELM;PWM duty cycle;TI F2833 DSP;battery SoC;battery state-of-charge;battery state-of-health;current sensing device;data-driven model;electrochemical impedance spectroscopy;extreme learning machine;frequency-dependent impedance;neural-network algorithm;parameter identification;phase-shift response;renewable energy;voltage sensing device","","1","","17","","","1-4 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The former lack representation ability while the latter require large amounts of training data and learning time. In real-time robotics applications involving RGB-D sensors, we do not have the luxury of both. In this paper, we propose Localized Deep Extreme Learning Machines (LDELM) that efficiently learn features from RGB-D data. By using localized patches, not only is the problem of data sparsity solved, but the learned features are robust to occlusions and viewpoint variations. LDELM learns deep localized features in an unsupervised way from random patches of the training data. Each image is then feed-forwarded, patch-wise, through the LDELM to form a cuboid of features. The cuboid is divided into cells and pooled to get the final compact image representation which is then used to train an ELM classifier. Experiments on the benchmark Washington RGB-D and 2D3D datasets show that the proposed algorithm not only is significantly faster to train but also outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and classification time.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6795-0; POD:978-1-4673-6796-7","10.1109/DICTA.2015.7371280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7371280","","Feature extraction;Neural networks;Object recognition;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Training data;Visualization","image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;object recognition;robot vision","2D3D datasets;ELM classifier;LDELM;RGB-D data;RGB-D object recognition methods;RGB-D sensors;channel specific handcrafted features;classification time;compact image representation;cuboid;data sparsity;deep localized features;deep networks;localized deep extreme learning machines;localized patches;random patches;robotics applications;training data","","2","","35","","","23-25 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method to automatically generate pseudo-code from source code, specifically adopting the statistical machine translation (SMT) framework. SMT, which was originally designed to translate between two natural languages, allows us to automatically learn the relationship between source code/pseudo-code pairs, making it possible to create a pseudo-code generator with less human effort.

Current algorithms are already quite good at learning to recognize handwritten digits, which enables to use them for sorting letters and reading personal checks. Neural networks are a powerful technology for classification of visual inputs arising from documents, and have been extensively used in many fields due to their ability to approximate complex nonlinear mappings directly from the input sample. Different variations of Multi-Layer Neural Networks (MLNN), using back propagation training algorithm, yield a very high recognition rates on handwritten digits benchmarks, but lacks the aspect of speed in training time. Learning time is an important factor while designing any computational intelligent algorithm for classifications, especially when online improving by adapting new samples is needed. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) has been proposed as an alternative ANN, which significantly reduce the amount of time needed to train a MLNN and has been widely used for many applications. The ELM analytical process of learning reduces the time of learning comparing to back propagation by avoiding the process of iterative learning. In this paper, we present a process which boosts few Extreme learning machines using Ada-boosting in order to improve the recognition rates iteratively. A pre-processing step is used to improve the ability of the ELM, and special weighting process to improve the boosting process.

First of all, because of the non-stationary characteristics of the wind speed sequence, the wind speed sequence is decomposed into several components with different frequency bands by the EMD to reduce the non-stationary characteristics. Secondly, to avert the randomness of input dimensionality selection of the extreme learning machine, the author reconstructs the phase space of each component. Thirdly, the ELM model of each component is established to predict the wind speed sequence. Finally, the predicted results of each component are superimposed to get the final result. The simulation result shows that the combination forecasting method presented in this paper has high prediction accuracy.","","Electronic:978-9-8815-6391-0; POD:978-1-5090-0910-7","10.1109/ChiCC.2016.7553904","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7553904","Empirical Mode Decomposition;Extreme Learning Machine;Phase Space Reconstruction;Prediction;Wind Speed Sequence","Empirical mode decomposition;Forecasting;Neurons;Reconstruction algorithms;Signal resolution;Terrestrial atmosphere;Wind speed","geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);signal reconstruction;wind","ELM;EMD;component phase space reconstruction;empirical mode decomposition;extreme learning machine;frequency bands;input dimensionality selection randomness;short-term combination forecasting model;short-term wind speed forecasting;short-term wind speed sequence nonstationary characteristics","","","","","","","27-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we concentrate on managing physical host nodes in DDVMC strategy and propose a cooperative multi-agent learning paradigm to make optimal decisions towards energy and performance efficiency in cloud data centers. Our approach is also able to assure scalability due to increasing the number of hosts in the data center. The experimental results show that our approach yields far better results w.r.t. the energy-performance tradeoff in cloud data centers in comparison to state-of-the-art algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7741-6; POD:978-1-4673-7742-3","10.1109/NCCA.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340026","Dynamic Virtual Machine Consolidation;Energy Efficient Virtual Machine Management;Fuzzy System;Multi Agent Learning;Multi Agent System;Reinforcement Learning","Cloud computing;Decision making;Degradation;Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Servers;Virtual machining","cloud computing;computer centres;decision making;distributed algorithms;energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;virtual machines","DDVMC;VM placement optimization;cooperative multiagent learning approach;decision-making process quality;distributed algorithm;distributed dynamic virtual machine consolidation;energy efficiency;energy-performance tradeoff optimization;performance efficiency;physical host node management;virtual machine management strategy;virtualized cloud data center","","1","","17","","","11-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On top of that, to obtain the adaptive models for online monitoring and fault detection in unsteady-stage conditions, instead of the static ones established by traditional HSSVM and KPCA, multiple methods are adopted, including Recursive KPCA, Adaptive Control Limit (ACL) and Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM), all of which update the detection model in real time with dynamically adjusting. The T2 control limit of Recursive KPCA, the classification hyperspheres of HSSVM and the single hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) trained with OS-ELM work collaboratively in monitoring the real time process data to detect the possible faults.

Basically image retrieval is part of classification problem. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of technique that can solve classification problem well. In fact, SVM is a linear classifier, it's mean that this algorithm can only be used to classify linear separable data. In order to classify not linear separable data, this algorithm should be modified with kernel learning. Determine the appropriate kernel during the learning process is difficult, therefore, many researchers are trying to develop more flexible kernel learning called Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL). This framework will build a classification model based on SVM algorithm modified with multiple kernel learning and applied to image retrieval. The image retrieval contain five categories of image and the experimental uses k-fold cross-validation.

Therefore, this paper describes and analyzes a novel tight frame learning scheme for machine fault diagnosis. The objective cost is evolved by integrating the tight frame constraint into the popular dictionary learning model. The resulting tight frame design strategy thus could be formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which can be solved by alternatively implementing hard thresholding operation and singular value decomposition. Then, fault information is sparsely represented over the learned dictionary and could be effectively detected through sparse pursuit techniques. Compared with the state of the art analytic wavelet tight frame, the proposed algorithm has two main advantages: firstly, the tight frame filters are directly learned from the noisy signals and thus the sparse intrinsic structures of feature information could be profoundly captured. Secondly, sparse level of representation coefficients is promoted largely and the process of extracting fault feature information is highly adaptive. Moreover, the performance of the proposed framework is evaluated through numerical experiments and its superiority with respect to the analytic wavelet tight frame is further demonstrated through performing the diagnosis of an engineering gearbox.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9220-4; POD:978-1-4673-9221-1","10.1109/I2MTC.2016.7520471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7520471","dictionary learning;machine fault diagnosis;sparse approximation;sparse intrinsic structures;tight frame","Dictionaries;Fault diagnosis;Feature extraction;Filter banks;Noise measurement;Transforms;Vibrations","concave programming;electric machines;fault diagnosis;feature extraction;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);numerical analysis;signal representation;singular value decomposition;vibration measurement","analytic wavelet tight frame filter;dictionary learning model;engineering gearbox diagnosis;hard thresholding operation;machine vibration signal;nonconvex optimization problem;numerical experiment;rotary machine fault diagnosis;singular value decomposition;sparse approximation dictionary;sparse intrinsic structure;sparse pursuit technique;sparsity-aware tight frame learning;vibration measurement","","","","","","","23-26 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm combined the LSTD(X) algorithm with RELM. The RELM is used to approximate value functions. Furthermore, the eligibility trace term is introduced to increase data efficiency. In experiments, the performances of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated and compared with those of LSTD and ELM-LSTD. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a more stable and better performance in approximating the value function under a fixed policy.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-9713-1; Electronic:978-1-4673-9714-8; POD:978-1-4673-9715-5","10.1109/CCDC.2016.7532255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7532255","Function approximation;Least-squares temporal difference learning;Markov decision processes;Regularized Extreme learning machine;Reinforcement learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Artificial neural networks;Function approximation;Learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Tuning","Markov processes;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;neural nets","ANN;ELM;MDP;RELM-LSTD-X;artificial neural network;continuous Markov decision processes;eligibility traces;learning speed;least-squares temporal difference learning;regularized extreme learning machine;reinforcement learning problem;value function","","","","","","","28-30 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though researchers have already gained some achievements, studies on this field are scarce and the existing achievements still need to be improved. This paper proposes a system based on multi-feature fusion and extreme learning machine (ELM) to classify Chinese traditional opera genre. Inspired by music genre classification, each aria is split into multiple segments. 19 features are then extracted and fused to generate the fusion feature. Finally, we use ELM and majority voting methods to determine the genre of the whole aria. The research data are 800 arias of 8 typical genres collected from Internet. This system achieves a mean classification accuracy of 92% among 8 famous Chinese traditional opera genres. The experimental results demonstrated that multi-feature fusion improves classification accuracy of Chinese traditional opera genres. Feature fusion is more effective than decision fusion in dealing with this problem.","","Electronic:978-9-8814-7680-7; POD:978-1-4673-9593-9","10.1109/APSIPA.2015.7415449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7415449","","Correlation;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Frequency-domain analysis;Modulation;Music;Time-domain analysis","acoustic signal processing;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);music;sensor fusion;signal classification","Chinese traditional culture;Chinese traditional opera genre classification;ELM;extreme learning machine;feature extraction;fusion feature;majority voting methods;mean classification accuracy;multifeature fusion;music genre classification","","","","30","","","16-19 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper studies the classification problem of the digestive organs for wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images aiming at saving the review time of doctors. Our previous study has proved the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based WCE classification system is able to achieve 95% classification accuracy in average, but it is difficult to further improve the classification accuracy owing to the variations of individuals and the complex digestive tract circumstance. Research shows that there are two possible approaches to improve classification accuracy: to extract more discriminative image features and to employ a more powerful classifier. In this paper, we propose to design a WCE classification system by a hybrid CNN with Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). In our approach, we construct the CNN as a data-driven feature extractor and the cascaded ELM as a strong classifier instead of the conventional used full-connection classifier in deep CNN classification system. Moreover, to improve the convergence and classification capability of ELM under supervision manner, a new initialization is employed. Our developed WCE image classification system is named as HCNN-NELM. With about 1 million real WCE images (25 examinations), intensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance. Results illustrate its superior performance compared to traditional classification methods and conventional CNN-based method, where about 97.25% classification accuracy can be achieved in average.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9675-2; USB:978-1-4673-9674-5","10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7419037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7419037","","Endoscopes;Esophagus;Feature extraction;Image classification;Iron;Testing;Training","diseases;endoscopes;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets","CNN-based WCE classification system;HCNN-NELM;WCE image classification system;cascaded ELM;complex digestive tract;data-driven feature extractor;deep CNN classification system;digestive organs;discriminative image features extraction;extreme learning machine;full-connection classifier;hybrid CNN;hybrid convolutional neural networks;noninvasive gastrointestinal disease examination;wireless capsule endoscopy","","","","14","","","6-9 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A key challenge in such a system is sharing network resources between small MTDs, which have limited memory and computational capabilities. In this paper, a novel learning with finite memory framework is proposed to enable MTDs to effectively learn about each others message state, so as to properly adapt their transmission parameters. In particular, an IoT system in which MTDs can transmit both delay tolerant, periodic messages and critical alarm messages is studied. For this model, the characterization of the exponentially growing delay for critical alarm messages and the convergence of the proposed learning framework in an IoT are analyzed. Simulation results show that the delay of critical alarm messages is significantly reduced up to 94% with very minimal memory requirements. The results also show that the proposed learning with finite memory framework is very effective in mitigating the limiting factors of learning that prevent proper learning procedures.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9457-4; POD:978-1-4673-9458-1","10.1109/CISS.2016.7460572","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460572","","Delays;Information science;Memory management;Random variables;Reliability;Throughput;Wireless communication","Internet of Things;delay tolerant networks","Internet of things;IoT system;MTD;critical alarm messages;delay tolerant;finite memory framework;learning framework;machine type communication;machine-type devices;network resource sharing;periodic messages","","1","","11","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, existing ELMs leave four uncharted problems: complexity, uncertainty, concept drifts, curse of dimensionality. To correct these issues, a novel incremental meta-cognitive ELM, namely Evolving Type-2 Extreme Learning Machine (eT2ELM), is proposed. Et2Elm is built upon the three pillars of meta-cognitive learning, namely what-to-learn, how-to-learn, when-to-learn, where the notion of ELM is implemented in the how-to-learn component. On the other hand, eT2ELM is driven by a generalized interval type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) as the cognitive constituent, where the interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function is used in the hidden layer, whereas the nonlinear Chebyshev function is embedded in the output layer. The efficacy of eT2ELM is proven with four data streams possessing various concept drifts, comparisons with prominent classifiers, and statistical tests, where eT2ELM demonstrates the most encouraging learning performances in terms of accuracy and complexity.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8697-2; POD:978-1-4799-8698-9","10.1109/SMC.2015.487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379619","evolving neuro fuzzy system;extreme learning machine;fuzzy neural network;metacognitive learning;sequential learning","Chebyshev approximation;Complexity theory;Covariance matrices;Fuzzy neural networks;Neural networks;Training;Uncertainty","Big Data;fuzzy neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence)","big data applications;eT2ELM;evolving type-2 extreme learning machine;generalized interval type-2 fuzzy neural network;how-to-learn component;interval type-2 multivariate Gaussian function;nonlinear Chebyshev function;novel meta-cognitive extreme learning machine","","","","23","","","9-12 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
