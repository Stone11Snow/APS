Event-related potentials (ERPs) are usually investigated by the group-level analysis, for which tensor factorization can be used. However, sizes of a tensor including time-frequency representation of ERPs of multiple channels of multiple participants can be immense. It is time-consuming to decompose such a tensor. The low-rank approximation based sequential nonnegative Tucker decomposition (LraSNTD) has been recently developed and shown to be computationally efficient with respect to some benchmark datasets. Here, LraSNTD is applied to decompose a fourth-order tensor representation of ERPs. We find that the decomposed results from LraSNTD and a benchmark nonnegative Tucker decomposition algorithm are very similar.

In order to guarantee optimal performance its parameters need to be determined, specifically its kernel parameters, regularization and, most importantly in non-stationary environments, its forgetting factor. This is a common difficulty in adaptive filtering techniques and in signal processing algorithms in general. In this paper we demonstrate the equivalence between KRLS-T's recursive tracking solution and Gaussian process (GP) regression with a specific class of spatio-temporal covariance. This result allows to use standard hyperparameter estimation techniques from the Gaussian process framework to determine the parameters of the KRLS-T algorithm.

We projected frequency information to a 2-dimensional space in order to visualise flight-condition transitions using the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) and a variant which supports simultaneous feature selection. We created an objective measure of the separation between different flight conditions in the visualisation space by calculating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) fitted to each class: the higher the KL-divergence, the better the interclass separation. To find the optimal combination of sensors, they were considered in pairs, triples and groups of four sensors. The sensor triples provided the best result in terms of KL-divergence.

As is normally the case in acoustic echo cancellation, the first filter includes a large number of taps to guarantee that the active (i.e., non-null) coefficients of the true echo path are correctly identified. The second filter is a shorter and faster one, intended to span just the region of active coefficients. To identify this active region, we present a method based on clustering of the combined filter coefficients. We also propose two different combination strategies that simultaneously improve steady-state and convergence performance. When the echo path is very sparse, the computational cost incurred by our schemes is just slightly higher than that of a single NLMS filter.

Lyngby, Denmark","2012 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","20121110","2012","","","1","6","We consider learning and prediction of pairwise comparisons between instances. The problem is motivated from a perceptual view point, where pairwise comparisons serve as an effective and extensively used paradigm. A state-of-the-art method for modeling pairwise data in high dimensional domains is based on a classical pairwise probit likelihood imposed with a Gaussian process prior. While extremely flexible, this non-parametric method struggles with an inconvenient O(n<sup>3</sup>) scaling in terms of the n input instances which limits the method only to smaller problems.

An IARD algorithm is a class of sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) schemes. It permits an intuitive and simple adjustment of estimation expressions, with the adjustment having a simple interpretation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This adjustment allows for implementing a trade-off between sparsity of the estimated model versus its accuracy in terms of residual mean-square error (MSE). It is found that this adjustment has a different impact on the IARD performance, depending on whether the measurement model coincides with the used estimation model or not. Specifically, in the former case the value of the adjustment parameter set to the true SNR leads to an optimum performance of the IARD with the smallest MSE and estimated signal sparsity; moreover, the estimated sparsity then coincides with the true signal sparsity. In contrast, when there is a model mismatch, the lower MSE can be achieved only at the expense of less sparser models. In this case the adjustment parameter simply trades the estimated signal sparsity versus the accuracy of the model.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349805","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349805","","Approximation methods;Estimation;Mean square error methods;Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Vectors","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods","IARD algorithm;IARD performance;adjustment parameter;approximation quality;estimation expressions;estimation model;incremental automatic relevance determination frameworks;measurement model;optimum performance;residual mean-square error;signal sparsity;signal-to-noise ratio;sparse Bayesian learning","","0","","18","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach can be viewed as an extension of expectation-maximization (EM)-based source separation to DMAs. To achieve distributed processing, we assume the conditional independence (with respect to sources' activities) of the normalized recordings of different nodes. By doing so, only the posterior probabilities of sources' activities need to be shared between nodes. Consequently, the EM algorithm is formulated such that at the expectation step, local posterior probabilities are estimated locally and shared between nodes. In the maximization step, every node fuses the received probabilities via either product or sum rules and estimates its local parameters. We show that, even if we make binary decisions (presence/ absence of speech) during EM iterations instead of transmitting continuous posterior probability values, we can achieve separation without causing significant speech distortion.

The method also provides inequalities on interventional distributions, which can be used to bound causal effects. All these constraints are characterized in terms of a new graphical separation criterion, providing an easy and intuitive method for their derivation.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349796","Causal model;controlled direct effect;directed acyclic graph;intervention;marginalized","Abstracts;Indexes;Instruments","directed graphs;inference mechanisms","causal effects;directed acyclic graph model;discrete model distribution;graphical methods;graphical separation criterion;inequality constraints;marginalized DAG","","3","","12","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents several insights on the neural correlates of human visual perception by analyzing the neural correlates that result when humans view realistic images using a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) image display paradigm. We propose an image information extraction model and examine the relationship between the brain evoked response - using event related potential (ERP) characteristics - and the level of difficulty for humans to detect targets as a function of both visual stimulus complexity and task difficulty. We develop a computational model to quantify subject performance and the difficulty of realistic stimuli. Our results show that: (1) more difficult trials produce less prominent ERP patterns, thus reducing the performance of machine-based ERP detection; (2) on average for the same behavioral performance level, a pair of ERP's extracted from two easy trials are more similar than a pair of ERP's from two hard trials; and (3) both stimulus and task difficulty are correlated with neural activity. Our findings indicate that, for dynamic tasks involved in visual information processing, the brain may allocate additional cognitive resources, such as attention, to a given visual stimulus, as the task and/or stimulus difficulty increases.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349766","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349766","Electroencephalography (EEG);event related potential (ERP);rapid serial visual presentation;stimulus complexity;task difficulty;visual information processing","Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Correlation;Electroencephalography;Humans;Information retrieval;Visualization","electroencephalography;feature extraction;image recognition;medical signal processing;visual perception","ERP characteristics;RSVP image display paradigm;brain evoked response;event related potential;human brain signals;image information extraction model;image recognition;neural correlates;rapid serial visual presentation paradigms;realistic images;visual information processing;visual perception","","0","","15","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection can be considered as a classification problem discriminating noise-like, earthquake-caused and explosion-like data. Classification of the recorded data is challenging because it suffers from large amounts of missing features. While the classification performance of support vector machines has been evaluated, no such results for Bayesian network classifiers are available. We provide these results using classifiers with generatively and discriminatively optimized parameters and employing different imputation methods. In case of discriminatively optimized parameters, Bayesian network classifiers slightly outperform support vector machines. For optimizing the parameters discriminatively, we extend the formulation of maximum margin Bayesian network classifiers to missing features and latent variables.

In this paper we take into account the existence of multiple foci, performing a spectral analysis to detect their number and frequencies. In order to obtain a cleaner signal on which the spectral analysis can be performed, we introduce sparsity-aware learning techniques to infer the spike trains corresponding to the activations.

Typically, physicians manually trace small blood vessels and visually estimate RBC velocities. The task is labor intensive, tedious, and time-consuming.

Classical approaches to stuttered speech analyzed dysfluencies in very short intervals, which were sufficient for recognizing simple repetitions of phonemes. However, the problem of repetitions of syllables or words was typically ignored due to high computational demands of classical methods for analysis of longer intervals.

Just as one would use Markov random fields (MRF) to solve image segmentation problems, we propose a method of modeling source separation using MRFs, and then solving such problems via common MRF inference methods. To this end, as a preprocessing, we convert stereophonic spectrograms into a integrated form based on their inter-channel level differences (ILD), which is a procedure analogous to getting a disparity map from stereo images for matching problems. Given the ILD matrix as an observed image, we estimate latent labels which stand for the responsibility of each spectrogram's time/frequency bin to a specific sound source. It is shown that the proposed method shows reasonable separation performance in a variety of mixing environments including online separation and moving sources.

In the absence of the clean signal, the only way to estimate the level of accuracy that can be obtained in the transcription is to develop an objective methodology for intelligibility measurements. In this paper a method based on the Normalized Spectrum Envelope (NSE) and Sparse Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) is proposed to evaluate the signal intelligibility. The approaches are tested with three different noise types and the results are compared with the speech intelligibility scores measured by subjective tests. The results of the experiments show a high correlation between objective measurements and subjective evaluations.

This problem is difficult. As a first step, we consider the extreme sparse code given by vector quantization, i.e. each pixel is finally associated to 1 single atom. For Gaussian noise, the natural solution is K-means clustering using the sum of the squares of differences between gray levels as the dissimilarity measure between patches. For non Gaussian noises (Poisson, Gamma,...), a new measure of dissimilarity between noisy patches is necessary. We study the use of the generalized likelihood ratios (GLR) recently introduced by Deledalle et al. in [1] to compare non Gaussian noisy patches. We propose a K-medoids algorithm generalizing the usual Linde-Buzo-Gray K-means using the GLR based dissimilarity measure.

This motivates protecting video packets unequally based on their loss visibility. This paper proposes an adaptive online algorithm for unequal error protection driven by two key motivations: On one hand, for real-time video, where a video sequence is not pre-encoded, an offline approach is infeasible and determining the unequal protection levels to maintain a target video quality level must be performed online. On the other hand, an online approach enables adapting to scene changes as well as changes in video temporal and spatial characteristics. The proposed online algorithm uses local linear regression to learn the mapping between packet losses from each scalable video layer and quality degradation without assuming an underlying statistical model. The notion of locality captures the similarity in video scene characteristics as well as proximity in time. The algorithm provably guarantees an average target video quality level and converges rapidly to a stable solution. Furthermore, it provides a bias/variance tradeoff between factual estimation of loss visibility and fine adaptation to the changing video temporal characteristics.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349781","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349781","","Error correction codes;Linear regression;Quality assessment;Quantum cascade lasers;Video recording","encoding;image sequences;motion compensation;real-time systems;regression analysis;video coding","bias/variance tradeoff;factual estimation;inter-frame coding;local linear regression;motion compensation;natural scenes;online learning;perceived video quality;psycho-visual perception;quality degradation;quality-driven unequal protection;real-time video;scalable video layer;unequal error protection;unequal motion;video encoding;video packet losses;video sequence","","1","","8","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The remaining concern is that NeRV has quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number of data. We introduce an efficient learning algorithm for NeRV where relationships between data are approximated through mixture modeling, yielding efficient computation with near-linear computational complexity with respect to the number of data.

High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging refers to methods and systems that aim to generate images that exhibit higher dynamic range between the lightest and the darkest parts of the an image. A typical approach for generating HDR images is exposure bracketing where multiple frames, each one with a different exposure setting, are captured and combined to a HDR image of the scene. The large number of images that exposure bracketing requires often leads to motion artefacts that limit the visual quality of the resulting HDR image. In this work, we propose a novel approach in HDR imaging that significantly reduces the necessary number of images. In our proposed system, we employ the notion of random exposure where each pixel of a single frame collects light for a random amount of time. By collecting a small number of such images, the full sequence of low dynamic range images can be reconstructed and subsequently used for HDR generation. The problem is solved by casting the reconstruction of the sequence as a nuclear norm minimization problem following the premises of the recently proposed theory of Matrix Completion. Experimental results suggest that the proposed method is able to reconstruct the sequence from as low as 20% of the images that traditional techniques require with minimal reduction in image quality.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349802","High dynamic range imaging;low rank;matrix completion","Cameras;Conferences;Dynamic range;Image reconstruction;Minimization;Sensors","image motion analysis;image reconstruction;image sequences;matrix algebra","HDR generation;HDR image;digital camera;exposure bracketing;high dynamic range imaging;image quality;image reconstruction;low dynamic range image sequence;matrix completion;motion artefact;nuclear norm minimization problem;reconstruction casting;scene radiance;sequence reconstruction","","2","","18","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our improvement in the filling-in order is based on a combination of priority terms, previously defined by Criminisi, that better encourages the early synthesis of linear structures. The second contribution helps reducing the error propagation thanks to a better detection of outliers from the candidate patches carried.

First, a representation is learned from the unlabeled data via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and then it is applied to the labeled data used for classification. In this work, we implemented this method for the music genre classification task using two different databases: one as unlabeled data pool and the other for supervised classifier training. Music pieces come from 10 and 6 genres for each database respectively, while only one genre is common for both of them.

Speech and noise separation is performed by applying non-negative sparse coding using a separate exemplar dictionary for each labeled unit (in this case half-digits) rather than a single dictionary of all units. This approach does not only provide better classification of speech units but also models the temporal structure of speech and noise more accurately.

Since the features which will best identify the anomalies are a priori unknown, several common detection strategies are: 1) evaluating atypicality of a sample (its p-value) based on the null distribution defined on the full N-dimensional feature space; 2) considering a (combinatoric) set of low order distributions, e.g. all singletons and all feature pairs, with detections made based on the smallest p-value yielded over all such low order tests. The first approach relies on accurate estimation of the joint distribution, while the second may suffer from increased false alarm rates as N and T grow. Alternatively, inspired by greedy feature selection commonly used in supervised learning, we propose a novel sequential anomaly detection procedure with a growing number of tests. Here, new tests are (greedily) included only when they are needed, i.e., when their use (on currently undetected samples) will yield greater aggregate statistical significance of (multiple testing corrected) detections than obtainable using the existing test cadre. Our approach thus aims to maximize aggregate statistical significance of all detections made up until a finite horizon. Our method is evaluated, along with supervised methods, for a network intrusion domain, detecting Zeus bot (intrusion) packet flows embedded amongst (normal)Web flows.

In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic method for ID where it is expressed as a statistical model within a Bayesian framework. The proposed method considerably differs from other ID methods in the literature: It handles the model selection automatically and enables the construction of problem-specific interpolative decompositions. We derive the analytical solution for the normal distribution and we provide a numerical solution for the generic case. Simulation results on synthetic data are provided to illustrate that the method converges to the true decomposition, independent of the initialization; and it can successfully handle noise. In addition, we apply probabilistic ID to the problem of automatic polyphonic music transcription to extract important information from a huge dictionary of spectrum instances. We supply comparative results with the other proposed techniques in the literature and show that it performs better.

Although capable of including the sparsity information, the l<sub>1</sub>-norm penalty alone doesn't incorporate the hierarchical structure prior information when estimating brain networks. In this paper, a new l<sub>1</sub> regularization method that applies the sparsity constraint at hierarchical levels is proposed and its implementation described.

Construction of sparse spatial projections where a small subset of channels is used in feature extraction, can increase the stability and generalization capability of the CSP method. The existing ℓ<sub>0</sub> norm based sub-optimal greedy channel reduction methods are either too complex such as Backward Elimination (BE) which provided best classification accuracies or have lower accuracy rates such as Recursive Weight Elimination (RWE) and Forward Selection (FS) with reduced complexity. In this paper, we apply the Oscillating Search (OS) method which fuses all these greedy search techniques to sparsify the CSP filters.

However, in practice, the rating matrix is too sparse to find sufficiently many co-rated items, thus leading to inaccurate predictions. To address the case of sparse data, we propose an iterative CF that updates the similarity and rating matrix. The improved CF incrementally selects reliable subsets of missing ratings based on an adaptive parameter and therefore produces a more credible prediction based on similarity. Experimental results on the MovieLens dataset show that our algorithm significantly outperforms traditional CF, Default Voting, and SVD when the data is 1% sparse.

In some practical applications, they are also employed for entropy estimation. However, a histogram involves implicitly a discretization procedure because the unknown density is approximated by a piecewise constant density model. In the previous literature, the impact of the discretization procedure on the accuracy of the entropy estimate was either ignored or evaluated in the particular case of a regular histogram, in which all bins are equally wide. In this work, we provide bounds on the performance of the histogram-based entropy estimators without relying on the restrictive assumptions which have been used by other authors. The proof of our theoretical results is mainly based on concentration inequalities which have been already employed to analyze the performance of histograms as density estimators. After establishing the theoretical results, we illustrate them by numerical examples.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-1026-0; POD:978-1-4673-1024-6; USB:978-1-4673-1025-3","10.1109/MLSP.2012.6349727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6349727","Histogram;bias;concentration inequalities;entropy estimation;variance","Density measurement;Entropy;Equations;Histograms;Maximum likelihood estimation;Upper bound","entropy;piecewise constant techniques","continuous signal;discretization procedure;entropy estimation;histogram-based entropy estimators;piecewise constant density model","","0","","14","","","23-26 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
