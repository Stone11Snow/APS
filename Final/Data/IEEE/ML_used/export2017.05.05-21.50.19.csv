The first step in their development is choose a machine learning classifier as the system core. Previous works reported implementation of artificial neural networks, support vector machines, genetic algorithms, etc. as core classifiers for CDSS; however, these works do not report the parameters considered or the selection process for their implemented classifier. This paper is focus on the selection of a classifier to develop a CDSS. The options were reduced by reviewing advantages and disadvantages of each classifier, comparing them and considering the project parameters. The results of the analysis that take into consideration the project parameters show that some classifiers could be affected negatively in their performance, leaving support vector machines as the more suitable classifier to develop the CDSS by concluding that SVM disadvantages do not affect the accuracy and its advantages are not affected negatively by the project parameters.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7839-0; POD:978-1-4673-7840-6","10.1109/ICEEE.2015.7357960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7357960","clinical decision support system;machine learning;neural network;support vector machine","Artificial neural networks;Biological neural networks;Databases;Decision trees;Genetic algorithms;Support vector machines;Training","decision support systems;learning (artificial intelligence);medical administrative data processing;medical computing;neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","CDSS tools;artificial neural networks;clinical decision support system;computational classifier;core classifiers;genetic algorithms;machine learning classifier;reliable clinical decisions;support vector machines;system core","","1","","17","","","28-30 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, machine learning can be seen as a powerful approach to achieve intelligent data mining. In practice, machine learning is also an intelligent approach for predictive modelling. A special type of machine learning methods, which are known as rule based methods such as decision trees, can be used to build a rule based system as a special type of expert systems for both knowledge discovery and predictive modelling. A rule based system may be represented through different structures. The techniques for representing rules are known as rule representation, which is significant for knowledge discovery in relation to the interpretability of the model, as well as for predictive modelling with regard to efficiency in predicting unseen instances. This paper justifies the significance of rule representation. Some networked topologies for rule representation are introduced against existing techniques. The network topologies are validated using complexity analysis in order to show their advantages comparing with the existing techniques in terms of model interpretability and computational efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7428-6; POD:978-1-4673-7429-3","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2015.7337807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337807","Data Mining;If-Then Rules;Knowledge Discovery;Knowledge Representation;Machine Learning;Predictive Modelling;Rule Based Classification","Computational modeling;Data mining;Decision trees;Expert systems;Knowledge discovery;Predictive models","computational complexity;data mining;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);topology","complexity analysis;computational efficiency;decision trees;intelligent data mining;knowledge discovery;machine learning;model interpretability;network based rule representation;networked topologies;predictive modelling;rule based system;unseen instances","","3","","20","","","2-5 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since changes in temperature distribution depend on physical properties of the data center such as equipment locations and server types, model parameters (connection weights in the network) that characterize relationship of nodes are determined by a machine learning technique using actual data center operation data. The proposed method provides prediction results in a shorter time than traditional methods such as model based on computational fluid dynamics and potential flow model, while maintaining prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of the proposed model through comparison with actual data from our experimental data center.

However, food recognition is challenging because 1) the same type of food can differ in shape when prepared differently. 2) the wide variety of food leads to a large number of food categories. Machine learning based food classification has been proposed but its accuracy depends on the types of visual features used. In this work, we compare the accuracy of SIFT to GLCM features for recognition of 4 different categories of foods (apples, burgers, bread and prepared dishes).

Computational approaches become important to help identifying potential candidates for laboratory experiments. However, they usually involve solving optimization problems or assuming statistical distribution based on prior knowledge, and may require estimating tunable parameters. This paper is motivated by the concepts behind “follow-on” drugs. They are the drugs developed by drug companies to substitute the pioneering drug which was firstly discovered and patented for a specific target and determined a new therapeutic class. There are three observations from “follow-on” drugs. The first observation has been used by many existing methods: drugs interacting with a common target usually have higher similar scores (e.g. the similarity score in terms of chemical structure). The second one is that a drug candidate for a specific target gains more attention if it is more similar to those drugs interacting with the target than other known drugs, even though the similarity score is low. Lastly, people intuitively tend to design a “follow-on” drug for the targets already having more drugs because of less cost and less risk. In our approach, the above observations are translated into more evidences for predicted drug-target interaction. Designing an interaction tendency index to characterize these observations, we propose the similarity-rank-based predictor (SRP). Unlike other models, SRP is a non-parametric model and requires neither solving an optimization problem nor prior statistical knowledge. Based on real benchmark datasets, we show that our model is able to achieve higher accuracy than the two most recent models and our approach is able to cope with two real predicting scenario of missing interactions.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6799-8; POD:978-1-4673-6800-1","10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359921","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359921","drug-target interaction;follow-on;machine learning;missing interactions","Benchmark testing;Chemicals;Drugs;Integrated circuits","drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;parameter estimation;pharmaceutical technology;statistical distributions","SRP;concise nonparametric similarity-rank-based model;drug-target interaction identification;drug-target interaction prediction;follow-on drugs;interaction tendency index;laboratory experiments;machine learning;nonparametric model;optimization problems;similarity-rank-based predictor;statistical distribution;therapeutic class;tunable parameter estimation","","","","19","","","9-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Anticipating Human Activities Using Object Affordances for Reactive Robotic Response","H. S. Koppula; A.

Anticipating which activities will a human do next (and how) can enable an assistive robot to plan ahead for reactive responses. Furthermore, anticipation can even improve the detection accuracy of past activities. The challenge, however, is two-fold: We need to capture the rich context for modeling the activities and object affordances, and we need to anticipate the distribution over a large space of future human activities. In this work, we represent each possible future using an anticipatory temporal conditional random field (ATCRF) that models the rich spatial-temporal relations through object affordances. We then consider each ATCRF as a particle and represent the distribution over the potential futures using a set of particles. In extensive evaluation on CAD-120 human activity RGB-D dataset, we first show that anticipation improves the state-of-the-art detection results. We then show that for new subjects (not seen in the training set), we obtain an activity anticipation accuracy (defined as whether one of top three predictions actually happened) of 84.1, 74.4 and 62.2 percent for an anticipation time of 1, 3 and 10 seconds respectively.

The isolated outliers can serve as biomarkers in analyzing different stages/sub-stages. This paper suggests that the combination of proper clustering, distance function and index validation for clusters are suitable model to find a pattern of trending for transcript abundance throughout different prostate cancer stages/sub-stages.

Thread granularity, number of parallel threads as well as partition postions are crucial to the performance improvement in SpMT, for they determine the amount of resources (CPU, memory, cache, or waiting cycles, etc), and affect the efficiency of every PE (Processing Element). In conventional way, these three parameters are determined by heuristic rules. Although it is simple to partition threads with them, they are a type of one-size-fits-all strategy and can not guarantee to get the optimal solution of thread partitioning. This paper proposes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based approach to learn and determine the thread partition strategy. Using the ANN-based thread partition approach, an unseen irregular program can obtain a stable, much higher speedup than the Heuristic Rules (HR) based approach. On Prophet, which is a generic SpMT processor to evaluate the performance of multithreaded programs, the novel thread partitioning policy is evaluated and reaches an average speedup of 1.80 on 4-core processor. Experiments show that our proposed approach can obtain a significant increase in speedup and Olden benchmarks deliver a better performance improvement of 2.36% than the traditional heuristic rules based approach.

The seam location of the previous frame is further considered to preserve the interframe consistency. Secondly, along the double seams, 1-D feature detection and matching is performed to capture the structural relationship between the two adjacent views. Thirdly, after feature matching, we propose an efficient algorithm to linearly propagate the deformation vectors to eliminate structure misalignment. At last, image intensity misalignment is corrected by rapid gradient fusion based on the successive over relaxation iteration (SORI) solver. A principled solution to the initialization of the SORI significantly reduced the number of iterations required.

For many reasons, including household air pollution and a shortage of trained doctors, this burden is concentrated in the developing world. The standard diagnostic pathway for pulmonary diseases is prohibitively expensive in developing countries, so these diseases are often misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. To assist doctors and health workers, there is a need to create tools that can automatically recognize specific lung sounds and provide diagnostic guidance. As a first step towards this long-term goal, we have created a low-cost stethoscope and smartphone application to record lung sounds. We discuss problems we encountered with the initial design and demonstrate an improved design that is currently being used in the field. We also demonstrate an algorithm capable of automatic detection of wheeze sounds. The automatic wheeze detection algorithm uses time-frequency analysis and the Short Time Fourier Transform to identify sections of wheezing in recorded lung sound files. Unlike most published sound classification studies, we trained and tested our algorithms using sound data collected from 38 actual patients at a pulmonary clinic in Pune, India. Despite variability in the quality of the data, our algorithm demonstrated an accuracy of 86% for successfully detecting the presence of wheeze in a sound file. This mobile platform and detection algorithm demonstrates an important step in creating an automated platform for the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases in a real-world setting.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6561-1; POD:978-1-4673-6562-8; USB:978-1-4673-6560-4","10.1109/GHTC.2015.7344001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344001","algorithms;auscultation;diagnostics;intelligence;lung;machine learning;mobile;phone;pulmonary;sounds;stethoscope;time-frequency","Classification algorithms;Diseases;Lungs;Mobile communication;Signal processing algorithms;Stethoscope","Fourier transforms;acoustic signal processing;bioacoustics;diseases;lung;medical signal processing;signal classification;smart phones;time-frequency analysis","automatic wheeze detection algorithm;automatically recognize specific lung sounds;data quality;diagnostic guidance;household air pollution;low-cost stethoscope;lung sound recording;mobile stethoscope;morbidity;mortality;published sound classification studies;pulmonary clinic;pulmonary diagnostics;pulmonary diseases;pulmonary screening;real-world setting;short-time Fourier transform;signal processing algorithms;smartphone application;sound data collection;standard diagnostic pathway;time-frequency analysis;trained doctors","","3","","18","","","8-11 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Designers, however, lack ways to ensure challenges are suitably tailored to the abilities of each game player, often resulting in player boredom or frustration. Challenge tailoring refers to the general problem of matching designer-intended challenges to player abilities. We present an approach to predict temporal player performance and select appropriate content to solve the challenge tailoring problem. Our temporal collaborative filtering approach-tensor factorization-captures similarities among players and the challenges they face to predict player performance on unseen, future challenges. Tensor factorization accounts for varying player abilities over time and is a generic approach capable of modeling many kinds of players. We use constraint solving to optimize content selection to match player skills to a designer-specified level of performance and present a model-performance curves-for designers to specify desired, temporally changing player behavior. We evaluate our approach in a role-playing game through two empirical studies of humans and one study using simulated agents. Our studies show tensor factorization scales in multiple game-relevant data dimensions, can be used for modestly effective game adaptation, and can predict divergent player learning trends.","1943-068X;1943068X","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2342934","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6863627","Artificial intelligence;constraint programming;game adaptation;games;machine learning;player modeling;procedural content generation;recommender systems","Adaptation models;Collaboration;Computational modeling;Games;Optimization;Recommender systems;Tensile stress","collaborative filtering;computer games;constraint handling;learning (artificial intelligence);tensors","constraint solving;content selection optimization;designer-intended challenges;digital games;divergent player learning trend prediction;multiple game-relevant data dimensions;role-playing game;temporal collaborative filtering approach;temporal game challenge tailoring;tensor factorization","","0","","38","","20140724","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Currently, output images are evaluated by domain experts such as medical experts, which involves manual inspection of output images at each step of software development. In this paper, we have proposed a mechanism to automate the test oracle using support vector machine.

Inductive logic programming (ILP), that can express common features of each data in a qualitative, is one of the machine learning methods. The advantage of ILP is that the classification model is clear compared with other machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) because ILP classifies inhibitors using generated rules. ILP is allowed to learn structure of the compounds so that we can draw the common structure of the ligands from the generated rules. In this method, the data of ligands and decoys are collected from “A Database of Useful Decoys: Enhanced” (DUD-E). ILP provides classification model called a rule by learning these data. This study applies the ILP algorithm to the virtual screening of inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase II (CAH2). We demonstrate its performance by classifying ligands and decoys which aren't included in DUD-E. Our results show that ILP has the performance equivalent to SVM which is known for its high classification performance. In addition, this paper shows that ILP can derive rules explaining structural features of CAH2 ligands. Several of these rules are consistent with known property of CAH2 ligand. This paper demonstrate that ILP has high classification performance and clear classification model.

Software testing, including functional testing and structural testing, remains a common method for uncovering faults and assessing dependability of software systems. To enhance testing effectiveness, the developed artifacts (requirements, code) must be designed to be testable. Prior work has developed many approaches to address the testability of code when applied to structural testing, but to date no work has considered approaches for assessing and predicting testability of requirements to aid functional testing. In this work, we address requirement testability from the perspective of requirement understandability and quality using a machine learning and statistical analysis approach. We first use requirement measures to empirically investigate the relevant relationship between each measure and requirement testability. We then assess relevant requirement measures for predicting requirement testability. We examined two datasets, each consisting of requirement and code artifacts. We found that several measures assist in delineating between the testable and non-testable requirements, and found anecdotal evidence that a learned model of testability can be used to guide evaluation of requirements for other (non-trained) systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0125-5; POD:978-1-5090-0126-2","10.1109/AIRE.2015.7337622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337622","code testability;correlation analysis;human analyst;machine learning;requirement testability;statistical analysis;subjective assessment;supervised classification learning","Browsers;Correlation;Indexes;Logistics;Software;Statistical analysis;Testing","formal verification;learning (artificial intelligence);program debugging;program testing;software quality;statistical analysis","code testability;functional testing;machine learning;ownership cost;requirement quality measurement;requirement testability;requirement understandability;software bugs;software system dependability assessment;software system fault;software testing;software-driven society;statistical analysis approach;structural testing;testability prediction","","1","","23","","","24-24 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We assume that the available information on the external dataset is only the error rate of a presented classifier. No other information is available such as the number of patterns, attribute values of each pattern, and its class label. Thus, the external dataset can be viewed as a black-box model where the error rate is calculated as an output for an input classifier. In this paper, we discuss how such a black-box type dataset can be utilized in fuzzy genetics-based machine leaning (GBML). We use a hybrid fuzzy GBML algorithm where its Michigan-style part is applied to each individual of a Pittsburgh-style part. Since a fuzzy rule-based classifier is an individual in the Pittsburgh-style part, a black-box type dataset can be utilized for fitness evaluation.

This evolution brought new challenges to the affective computing domain, such as designing artificial agents with personalities to the benefits of the user. Endowing artificial agents with personality could help to increase the agent's believability, hence easing the interaction. This paper touches on two questions pertaining to computational personality modeling: 1/ how to produce artificial personalities which can inform personality researchers, whether from computer sciences or psychology and 2/ will behaviors produced by artificial agents be perceived by users as putting the programmed personality across as such. We propose to use a data-driven approach to endow artificial agents with personality, using the regulatory focus theory as a framework. We used machine-learned game strategies, in the form of alternative decision trees computed from human data, to convey the personality of artificial agents. We then tested whether these personalities can be perceived by users after playing a game against these agents. We used two artificial agents as controls: one randomly playing and one with an “average / depersonalized” strategy. On the one hand, our results show that agents' regulatory focus, when programmed, can be accurately perceived by users. On the other hand, our results also point out that personality will be perceived by users even if the agent's design does not intend to transmit one.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9953-8; POD:978-1-4799-9954-5; USB:978-1-4799-9952-1","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344628","affective computing;artificial agents;machine-learning;personality;regulatory focus;user study","Affective computing;Computational modeling;Computers;Data models;Games;Neural networks;Psychology","behavioural sciences computing;cognition;decision trees;game theory;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;social sciences computing;software agents","affective computing domain;agent believability;alternative decision trees;artificial agents;computational personality modeling;data-driven approach;machine-learned game strategies;regulatory focus cues;socio-cognitive approach","","","","37","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed approach converts raw acceleration data into relevant spectral distances parameters. A 2D colored illustration of these parameters provides efficient visual representation as to the similarity and the variation among activities. For a further validation in terms of recognition performance, the `dist-colorimetrics' model was trained and tested by implementing three classification techniques, namely the Naïve Bayes, the K-nearest neighbors and the decision tree. The results showed that the system reached up to 98.12% of overall recognition accuracy.

Pervasive computing technologies via biopotential and behavioral parameters may represent a solution of robust pain recognition in clinical context and everyday life. In this work, multi-modal fusion of video and biopotential signals is used to recognize pain in a person-independent scenario. For this purpose, participants were recruited to subject to painful heat stimuli under controlled conditions. Subsequently, a multitude of features via biopotentials and behavior signals has been extracted and selected from the available modalities. Biopotential and video features were fused with an early and late fusion, we could show that the classification between baseline vs. tolerance threshold has an accuracy of 80 % via late fusion.

When the motion of target is large or abrupt, modeling target motion is crucial for robust object tracking, however, recent advanced trackers ignore this component. In our proposed approach, we represent target motion as a random stochastic process. We use Kernelized Harmonic Means to predict the next state of target motion using few prior state vectors, and then utilize Particle filter to further optimize the predicted state. Because SVMs possess good generalization ability, while being robust against noise, we adopt online ker-nelized SVMs to the tracking problem. Our approach learns the appearance of the target during tracking, and thus the proposed method is able to adapt online to target appearance changes and its surrounding background. In addition, we incorporate our motion model within the online kernelized SVMs framework as an energy map to assign higher energy for the support vectors that are closer to the location predicted by the proposed motion model. This allows reliably maintaining smooth trajectories without unnatural jittering artifacts, which is important for long-term object tracking in the presence of occlusion and noise. Taking the dynamic model into account also improves the computational efficiency as it reduces the dense search space required for localizing the target candidate. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on particularly challenging standard datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8339-1; POD:978-1-4799-8340-7","10.1109/ICIP.2015.7350978","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7350978","Particle filter;Support vector machines;machine learning;motion modeling;object tracking","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Object tracking;Support vector machines;Target tracking","image motion analysis;image representation;object tracking;particle filtering (numerical methods);stochastic processes;support vector machines","SVM;adaptive motion modeling;dynamic motion model;kernelized harmonic means;object tracking;particle filter;random stochastic process;support vector machines;target motion representation","","","","29","","","27-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate diagnosis of pneumonia relies on expensive human expertise and requires the evaluation of multiple clinical characteristics, measured using advanced diagnostic tools. The shortage of clinical experts and appropriate diagnostic tools in many low and middle income countries impedes timely and accurate diagnosis. We demonstrate that the diagnostic process can be automated using machine learning techniques, processing several clinical measurements that could be obtained with affordable and easy-to-operate point-of-care tools. We evaluated our findings on a dataset of 1093 children, comprising 777 diagnosed with pneumonia and 316 healthy controls, on the basis of 47 clinical characteristics. Seven feature selection techniques were used to identify robust, parsimonious subsets of clinical characteristics, which could be measured reliably and affordably. Standard machine learning techniques, such as support vector machines and random forests, were used to develop a predictive algorithm based on the four jointly most predictive characteristics (temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen saturation); this approach led to 96.6% sensitivity, 96.4% specificity, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97.8%.

In view of this issue, we have developed a model based on text mining techniques using machine learning method namely, Radial Basis Function of neural network. We apply text mining techniques to identify the relevant attributes from defect reports and relate these relevant attributes to software maintenance effort prediction. The proposed model is validated using `Browser' application package of Android Operating System. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis is done to interpret the results obtained from model prediction by using the value of Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity and a suitable threshold criterion known as the cut-off point.

Many algorithms have been developed with a small number of pairwise constraints to achieve performances comparable to those of fully supervised methods. However, one challenging problem with semi-supervised approaches is the appropriate choice of the constraint set, including the cardinality and the composition of the constraint set, which to a large extent, affects the performance of the resulting algorithm. In this work, we address the problem by incorporating ensemble subspace and active learning into dimensionality reduction and propose a new algorithm, termed as global and local scatter based SSDR with active pairwise constraints selection in ensemble subspaces (SSGL-ESA). Unlike traditional methods that select the supervised information in one subspace, we pick up pairwise constraints in ensemble subspace, where a novel active learning algorithm is designed with both exploration and filtering to generate informative pairwise constraints. The automatic constraint selection approach proposed in this paper can be generalized to be used with all constraint-based semi-supervised learning algorithms. Comparative experiments are conducted on two face database and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7347869","active learning;ensemble subspace;machine learning;semi-supervised dimensionality reduction (SSDR)","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Machine learning;Semisupervised learning;Training;Uncertainty","","","","","","","","","Oct. 2015","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we propose a scheme for retrieving relevant information to detect steps and to estimate the correct step length from raw inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. This approach uses Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (BLSTM-RNNs). Designed to take contextual information into account, the network can process data gathered from different positions, resulting in a system, which is invariant with respect to transformation and distortions of the input patterns. An experimental evaluation on a dataset produced from 10 individuals demonstrates that this new approach achieves significant improvements over previous attempts and increase the current state-of-the-art results even in the presence of variations and degradations. We achieved a mean classification rate of 98.5% and a standard deviation of 0.70 for 10000 different test sequences and an average error of 1.45% regarding the step length. Thus is the best result on the task gathered in the experiments compared with competing techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8402-5; POD:978-1-4673-8403-2","10.1109/IPIN.2015.7346954","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346954","Indoor positioning;dead reckoning;deep learning;inertial tracking;machine learning","Detectors;Estimation;Legged locomotion;Logic gates;Sensor fusion;Yttrium","indoor navigation;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pedestrians;recurrent neural nets;smart phones","BLSTM-RNN;IMU;bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural networks;correct step length estimation;deep learning;heading estimation;indoor positioning;inertial measurement unit data;location estimation;location navigation;machine learning;pedestrian dead reckoning;relevant information retrieval;smartphones;step detection;step length approximation","","2","","24","","","13-16 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Biomedical Named Entity Recognition with less Supervision","O. Ghiasvand; R. J. Kate","Univ. of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA","2015 International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","20151210","2015","","","495","495","Summary form only given: Annotating clinical notes manually is very labor-intensive and needs expertise in the area of annotation. Thus annotation is a highly expensive task not only in human resource but also in financial aspects. Moreover mistakes, missed tags, and inconsistency are the common problems with manual annotations. The purpose of this research is to reduce humans as annotation effort for clinical notes, to improve consistency, and to decrease cost of annotation. The aim of this research is to annotate clinical texts to extract biomedical names and terms. In our research Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is the reference meta thesaurus of names and terms used in biomedical and clinical domains. In this research we have done unsupervised and semi-supervised Named Entity Recognition (NER) through exact matching in UMLS. The data sets that have been used were provided by SemEval 2015 (task 14) natural language processing competition, including 199 clinical notes in training set and 133 notes in test set. The analysis that has been done so far can be divided into two steps: mapping and learning. The first step is to map all terms into UMLS that includes not only unigrams but also n-grams, usually n is 5. To achieve the best results of exact matching, we extracted UMLS terms of diseases and disorders based on semantic groups and mapped each n-gram to that part of UMLS. If there is a match, that is assumed to be a disease or disorder. When there is no match for n-grams (n>=2), to avoid low precisions, we supposed that unigrams must be noun phrases to be nominated as a disease/disorder. With this method we got 60% of f-score, and training files for next process (training CRFs) were generated. The second step involves using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). The results generated in the first step were used to train the CRF. CRFs learn from training data the general contexts in which named entities occur. Also because of different levels of correctness - n training files, we decided to modify training files before using them to train CRFs and to test on test data. Level of correctness means different accuracies of tagging in the data set. Because exact matching is not very accurate, the accuracy in different notes is variable. In some data it is very high and in some of them it is low. This results in an inconsistency in training files. To solve this problem we divided training files into ten groups. The CRF used only one group to be trained and to tag other groups, and results of exact matches and CRFs were combined (logic OR between results of CRF and exact match) together to get the final results. This was done for all other groups as well, and finally applied on test data. These two steps together are known as unsupervised disease named entity recognition, and the results show a difference of 10.3 percent between unsupervised and supervised approaches. By supervised learning we got 73% F-score while we got 62.7% by the proposed unsupervised approach. Another approach that was developed is semi supervised disease named entity recognition that used annotated files generated by unsupervised method and annotated files by human or gold standards. By this method we could improve 73% of F-score, that we got in supervised approach, to 74.2%. In the future some other refinements and extra tasks are going to be done. To improve the results, we are planning to use approximate matching by the process that is called normalization. Normalization means mapping a term in clinical notes to a preferred term in UMLS. These kinds of terms do not have exact matches, thus the way to find exact matches is to use normalization. Moreover we are going to do exact/approximate matching over discontinuous mentions in clinical texts. In these texts there are mentions including disconnected words in a sentence that together form a named entity. This essential step will extract those mentions that could not be extracted by exact match and nor","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9548-9; POD:978-1-4673-9549-6","10.1109/ICHI.2015.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349747","Conditional random fields;Exact matching;Machine learning;Named entity recognition;Natural language processing;Supervised learning;UMLS;Unsupervised learning","Diseases;Manuals;Semantics;Tagging;Training;Unified modeling language","Unified Modeling Language;computational linguistics;diseases;text detection;unsupervised learning","BNER;CRF;F-score;SemEval 2015;UMLS;biomedical NER;biomedical named entity recognition;clinical text extraction;conditional random field;human resource;manual tagging;natural language processing competition;normalization;semisupervised disease named entity recognition;supervised learning;unified medical language system;unsupervised disease named entity recognition","","","","","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A Systematic Prediction of Adverse Drug Reactions Using Pre-clinical Drug Characteristics and Spontaneous Reports","C. Ngufor; J. Wojtusiak; J. Pathak","Dept. of Health Sci. Res., Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA","2015 International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","20151210","2015","","","76","81","Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major global health concern accounting for more than two million injuries, hospitalization and deaths each year in the U.S. Alone. A reduction in both the harm to patients and cost can be archived if at prescription time, effective and accurate methods are available to predict the likelihood for a patient to develop known or potentially new adverse reactions. This can be based on known properties of drugs and patient characteristics. The detection or assessment of potential ADRs is traditionally done during the early stages of drug development. However, despite the methodological rigor of clinical trials, it is generally not possible to identify all ADRs of a drug primarily due to cost and efficiency. The size and characteristics of patient population, drug doses and duration of use, and other realistic variables frequently observed at the post-marketing phase can be impossible to model at the clinical trial phase. Thus, it is important to incorporate information on drugs observed at the post-marketing phase for more accurate identification of ADRs. This work presents a systematic and structured predictive model for ADRs generated from pre-clinical characteristics of drugs and spontaneous reports of ADRs in a distributed high performance computing (HPC) framework. The presented framework improves predictive accuracy by making use of a recent computationally efficient Bayesian graphical ensemble learning technique that incorporates hidden information transferred from distributed heterogeneous spontaneous reporting databases to improve accuracy. Implemented on HPC cloud machines, the graphical ensemble method outperformed other compared methods on a total of 800 known side-effects in terms of AUC and G-mean.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9548-9; POD:978-1-4673-9549-6","10.1109/ICHI.2015.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7349677","Adverse drug reactions;Classification;Clustering;Healthcare;High Performance Computing;Machine Learning","Bayes methods;Biology;Chemicals;Clinical trials;Drugs;Integrated circuits;Predictive models","belief networks;cloud computing;distributed databases;drugs;health care;medical information systems;parallel processing","ADR identification;Bayesian graphical ensemble learning technique;HPC cloud machines;HPC framework;adverse drug reactions;clinical trial phase;clinical trials;distributed heterogeneous spontaneous reporting databases;distributed high performance computing;drug development;drug doses;drugs characteristics;hospitalization;patient characteristics;patient population characteristics;patient population size;post-marketing phase;preclinical characteristics;preclinical drug characteristics;predictive accuracy;prescription time;spontaneous reports;structured predictive model;systematic prediction;systematic predictive model","","","","18","","","21-23 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present FeatureInsight, an interactive visual analytics tool for building new dictionary features (semantically related groups of words) for text classification problems. FeatureInsight supports an error-driven feature ideation process and provides interactive visual summaries of sets of misclassified documents. We conducted a controlled experiment evaluating both visual summaries and sets of errors in FeatureInsight. Our results show that visual summaries significantly improve feature ideation, especially in combination with sets of errors. Users preferred visual summaries over viewing raw data, and only preferred examining sets when visual summaries were provided.

This paper introduces a novel simplified subspaced regression framework for the accurate and efficient identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps.

The present study describes a methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N) deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging, which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum. Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The performance of 84.2% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed leaves.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9994-1; POD:978-1-4799-9995-8; USB:978-1-4799-9993-4","10.1109/IROS.2015.7354309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354309","Machine Learning;Precision Agriculture;UAV","Fertilizers;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Imaging;Sensors;Soil","agriculture;autonomous aerial vehicles;crops;fertilisers;image resolution;nitrogen","RGB sensor;UAV;automation solution;computer vision algorithm;corn field;crop;fertilizer;food;high resolution RGB image;nitrogen deficiency;plant health evaluation;precision agriculture system;recommendation algorithm;small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles;visual spectrum;water supply","","3","","17","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurate coronary segmentation and realistic physiologic modeling of boundary conditions are important steps to ensure a high diagnostic performance. Segmentation of the coronary arteries can be constructed by a combination of automated algorithms with human review and editing. However, blood pressure and flow are not impacted equally by different local sections of the coronary artery tree. Focusing human review and editing towards regions that will most affect the subsequent simulations can significantly accelerate the review process. We define geometric sensitivity as the standard deviation in hemodynamics-derived metrics due to uncertainty in lumen segmentation. We develop a machine learning framework for estimating the geometric sensitivity in real time. Features used include geometric and clinical variables, and reduced-order models. We develop an anisotropic kernel regression method for assessment of lumen narrowing score, which is used as a feature in the machine learning algorithm. A multi-resolution sensitivity algorithm is introduced to hierarchically refine regions of high sensitivity so that we can quantify sensitivities to a desired spatial resolution. We show that the mean absolute error of the machine learning algorithm compared to 3D simulations is less than 0.01. We further demonstrate that sensitivity is not predicted simply by anatomic reduction but also encodes information about hemodynamics which in turn depends on downstream boundary conditions.

Although many machine learning algorithms are proposed to identify disease-related genes, they often either have poor performance to identify locus heterogeneity cancer-related genes or are not applicable to predict individual-disease-related genes due to the lack of positive instances (imbalanced classification). To overcome these two issues, a two-step logistic regression (LR) based algorithm is proposed in this study for identifying individual-cancer-related genes. A set of high potential cancer-class-related genes is first generated in step 1, followed by a second round of LR-based algorithm conducted on this smaller dataset for identifying individual-cancer-related genes. Numerical experiments show that the proposed two-step LR-based algorithm not only works well for locus heterogeneity data, but also has good performance to handle the imbalanced classification problem. The individual-cancer-related gene identification experiments achieve AUC values of around 0.85 when the threshold of posterior probability is chosen between 0.3 and 0.6. All evaluations are conducted by using the leave-one-out cross validation method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6799-8; POD:978-1-4673-6800-1","10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359680","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7359680","cancer-related gene;imbalanced classification;logistic regression;machining learning","Cancer","cancer;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","LR-based algorithm;cancer-class-related genes;complex genetic diseases;individual-cancer-related genes;leave-one-out cross validation method;locus heterogeneity cancer-related genes;locus heterogeneity data;machine learning algorithms;posterior probability;two-step logistic regression algorithm","","1","","32","","","9-12 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While there is an agreement on the existence of a relationship between various favorable intermolecular interactions (e.g., Van der Waals, electrostatic, desolvation forces, etc.) and the similarity of a conformation to its native structure, the exact nature of this relationship is not clear. Different docking algorithms often formulate this relationship as a weighted sum of selected terms and calibrate their weights against a training set to evaluate and rank candidate complexes. Despite improvement in the predictive abilities of recent docking methods, even state-of-the-art methods often fail to predict the binding of many complexes and still output a large number of false positive complexes. We propose a novel machine learning approach that not only ranks candidate structures relative to each other, but also predicts how similar each candidate is to the native conformation. We trained a two-layer neural network, a deep neural network and a network of Restricted Boltzmann Machines against extensive datasets of unbound complexes. We tested these methods with a set of candidate structures.

The efficiency of existing feature selection algorithms significantly downgrades, if not totally inapplicable, when data size exceeds hundreds of gigabytes, because most feature selection algorithms are designed for centralized computing architecture. For that distributed computing techniques, such as MapReduce can be applied to handle very large data. Our approach is to scale the existing method for feature selection, Kmeans clustering and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) combined with optimization technique as Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). The proposed method is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we have used parallel Kmeans on MapReduce for clustering features, and then we have applied iterative MapReduce that implement parallel SNR ranking for each cluster, after we have selected the top ranked feature from each cluster. The top scored features from each cluster are gathered and a new feature subset is generated. In the second stage the new feature subset is used as input to the novel BPSO proposed based on MapReduce and optimized feature subset is being produced. The proposed method is implemented in a distributed environment, and its efficiency is illustrated through analyzing practical problems such as biomarker discovery.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7186-2; POD:978-1-4799-7187-9","10.1109/ICCVIA.2015.7351888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351888","Big Data;Bioinformatics;Biomarker Discovery;Feature selection;Scale Machine Learning","Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Data models;Signal to noise ratio;Support vector machines;Systems architecture","Big Data;bioinformatics;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;particle swarm optimisation","BPSO;Big data domain;K-means clustering;MapReduce;SNR;binary particle swarm optimization;biomarker discovery;centralized computing architecture;distributed computing technique;feature selection algorithm;optimization technique;parallel Kmeans clustering features;parallel SNR ranking;signal-to-noise ratio","","","","24","","","18-20 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional approaches are frustrated by two drawbacks. First, psychophysical experiments show that an object-level interpretation of scenes influences eye movements significantly. Most of the existing saliency models rely on object detectors, and therefore, only a few prespecified categories can be discovered. Second, the relative displacement of objects influences their saliency remarkably, but current models cannot describe them explicitly. To solve these problems, this paper proposes weakly supervised fixations prediction, which leverages image labels to improve accuracy of human fixations prediction. The proposed model hierarchically discovers objects as well as their spatial configurations. Starting from the raw image pixels, we sample superpixels in an image, thereby seamless object descriptors termed object-level graphlets (oGLs) are generated by random walking on the superpixel mosaic. Then, a manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to encode image labels into oGLs, and the response map of each prespecified object is computed accordingly. On the basis of the object-level response map, we propose spatial-level graphlets (sGLs) to model the relative positions among objects. Afterward, eye tracking data is employed to integrate these sGLs for predicting human eye fixations.

Although many ADEs are detected during pharmaceutical drug development and the FDA approval process, all of the possible reactions cannot be identified during this period. Currently, post-consumer drug surveillance relies on voluntary reporting systems, such as the FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS). With an increase in availability of medical resources and health related data online, interest in medical data mining has grown rapidly. This information coupled with online conversations of people which involve discussions about their health provide a substantial resource for the identification of ADEs. In this work, we propose a method to identify adverse drug effects from tweets by modeling it as a link classification problem in graphs. Drug and symptom mentions are extracted from the tweet history of each user and a drug-symptom graph is built, where nodes represent either drugs or symptoms and edges are labelled positive or negative, for desired or adverse drug effects respectively. A link classification model is then used to identify negative edges i.e. adverse drug effects. We test our model on 864 users using 10-fold cross validation with Sider's dataset as ground truth.

They are often connected to a wireless local area network (IEEE 802.11 WLANs) and rely on encryption protocols to maintain their security and privacy. In this paper, we show that even in presence of encryption, an attacker without access to encryption keys is able to determine the users' behavior, in particular, their app usage. We perform this attack using packet-level traffic analysis in which we use side-channel information leaks to identify specific patterns in packets regardless of whether they are encrypted or not. We show that just by collecting and analyzing small amounts of wireless traffic, one can determine what apps each individual smartphone user in the vicinity is using. Furthermore, and more worrying, we show that by using these apps the privacy of the user is more at risk compared to using online services through browsers on mobile devices. This is due to the fact that apps generate more identifiable traffic patterns. Using random forests to classify the apps we show that we are able to identify individual apps, even in presence of noise, with great accuracy. Given that most online services now provide native apps that may be identified by this method, these attacks represent a serious threat to users' privacy.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7876-5; POD:978-1-4673-7877-2","10.1109/CNS.2015.7346855","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7346855","Wireless;machine learning;privacy;random forest;side-channel attack;smartphone applications","Encryption;Feature extraction;Privacy;Wireless LAN;Wireless communication","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;data privacy;smart phones;wireless LAN","IEEE 802.11 WLAN privacy;IEEE 802.11 WLAN security;app usage;encrypted data traffic;encryption protocols;mobile devices;online services;packet-level traffic analysis;random forests;side-channel information;smartphone;tablets;user behavior;user privacy;wireless local area network;wireless traffic","","1","","26","","","28-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Usually, such systems lack of models, or are expressed with models that are not up to date. Without any model, the testing process is often done by hand, and tends to be an heavy and tedious task. This paper contributes to this issue by proposing a framework called Autofunk, which combines different fields such as model inference, expert systems, and machine learning. This framework, designed with the collaboration of our industrial partner Michelin, infers formal models that can be used as specifications to perform offline passive testing. Given a large set of production messages, it infers exact models that only capture the functional behaviours of a system under analysis. Thereafter, inferred models are used as input by a passive tester, which checks whether a system under test conforms to these models. Since inferred models do not express all the possible behaviours that should happen, we define conformance with two implementation relations. We evaluate our framework on real production systems and show that it can be used in practice.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0237-5; POD:978-1-4673-7668-6; USB:978-1-5090-0238-2","10.1109/MEMCOD.2015.7340480","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340480","Model inference;STS;conformance;machine learning;passive testing;production system","Context;Engines;Production systems;Sensors;Testing;Tires","expert systems;formal specification;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);program testing","Autofunk;Michelin;expert system;formal model;functional behaviour;industrial environment;industrial partner;machine learning;model inference;offline passive testing;passive tester;production message;production system","","","","","","","21-23 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two neural networks (one with a log-sigmoid, and one with a symmetric Elliott activation function) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The SVM was chosen for implementation primarily because of its high accuracy of 99% and its superior robustness. The mobile application is developed for Android and allows the user to connect to a Bluetooth glove, display and dictate the classification output and calibrate the connected glove.

We present our interactive animated agent model with controllable affective movements. We have recorded a corpus of affect-expressive motion capture data of two actors, performing various movements, and annotated based on their arousal and valence levels. We train a Factored, Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine (FCRBM) with this corpus in order to capture and control the valence and arousal qualities of movement patterns. The agents are then able to control the emotional qualities of their movements through the FCRBM for any given combination of the valence and arousal. Our results show that the model is capable of controlling the arousal level of the synthesized movements, and to some extent their valence, through manually defining the level of valence and arousal of the agent, as well as making transitions from one state to the other. We validate the expressive abilities of the model through conducting an experiment where participants were asked to rate their perceived affective state for both the generated and recorded movements.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9953-8; POD:978-1-4799-9954-5; USB:978-1-4799-9952-1","10.1109/ACII.2015.7344608","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344608","affective movement;artificial agents;full-body movement generation;machine learning","Animation;Context;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Legged locomotion;Media;Training data","Boltzmann machines;computer animation;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence)","FCRBM;factored conditional restricted Boltzmann machine;interactive animated agent model;movement generation;open research problem","","","","25","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper aims to resolve issues of limited quantity and quality of training data sets and investigates the impact of features selection process on the classification performance. It introduces a novel framework to extract efficient real “ground-truth” training data sets from the network traffic for supervised machine learning algorithms. We support this claim by performing the evaluation of results on a Naive Bayesian classifier.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8386-8; POD:978-1-4673-8387-5","10.1109/NOF.2015.7333298","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7333298","Attack Detection;Pattern-Matching;Security rules;machine learning","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Engines;Intrusion detection;Pattern matching;Training;Training data","Bayes methods;computer network security;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","NIDS;Naive Bayesian classifier;anomaly detection;anomaly detection systems;detection engines;ground-truth training data sets;machine learning approach;malicious traffic inspection;misuse detection;network intrusion detection system;operational settings;random feature selection;security issues;security services;supervised machine learning algorithms;training data extraction framework","","","","19","","","Sept. 30 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For practical applications, WSN deployments can be time consuming and error prone since they have the utmost challenge of guaranteeing connectivity and proper area coverage upon deployment. This creates an unmet demand for decision-support systems that help manage this complex process. This paper presents research to develop a system for predicting optimal deployments of WSN. Specifically, it presents results of image processing algorithms for terrain classification, results of modeling WSN signal propagation under different terrain conditions, results of optimization and visualization techniques for high-dimensional deployments, and system architecture for efficient integration and future deployment. Results show a feasible approach that can be used to automatically determine areas of high signal obstruction-which is essential to estimate obstruction parameters in simulations-and mapping of accurate WSN path-loss models to enhance the overall decision-making process during predeployment of large-scale WSN.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2014.2320324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6823082","Decision-making;image processing;machine learning;modeling and simulation;radio frequency (RF) propagation;systems engineering;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Computer architecture;Image color analysis;Modeling;Optimization;Servers;Unified modeling language;Wireless sensor networks","wireless sensor networks","WSN path-loss models;complex process;decision-making process;decision-support systems;error prone;image processing algorithms;ondemand deployments;optimal deployments;signal obstruction;terrain classification;wireless sensor networks analytics system","","7","","25","","20140529","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We provide a detailed review of the different multistep-ahead strategies. Subsequently, we perform a theoretical study that derives the bias and variance for a number of forecasting strategies. Finally, we conduct a Monte Carlo experimental study that compares and evaluates the bias and variance performance of the different strategies. From the theoretical and the simulation studies, we analyze the effect of different factors, such as the forecast horizon and the time series length, on the bias and variance components, and on the different multistep-ahead strategies.

Using the image quality ruler method, an average score per stimulus can be easily obtained in the unit of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs). However, it requires a large number of subjects, since pure averaging does not consider the different judging quality of different subjects. In this paper, we propose an image quality evaluation framework using the image quality ruler method with a statistical model. By incorporating this model, we consider the quality score, the expertise of the subjects, and the difficulty of image rating task as three hidden variables. Then we use expectation-maximization (EM) to estimate these hidden variables. From our experimental results, we show that our method provides reliable results without using a large number of subjects. Preliminary results also demonstrate that the estimates of the parameters can guide us to better distribute the valuable human resources used to conduct psychophysical experiments.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8339-1; POD:978-1-4799-8340-7","10.1109/ICIP.2015.7351203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7351203","graphical model;image/print quality;machine learning;psychophysical experiment;quality ruler","Correlation;Estimation;Graphical models;Image quality;Labeling;Reliability;Standards","expectation-maximisation algorithm;image processing;psychology;statistical analysis","EM method;JND unit;expectation-maximization method;graphical model;hidden variable estimation;human resources;image quality evaluation;image quality ruler method;image rating task;just-noticeable difference unit;psychophysical experiments;quality score;statistical model;subjective evaluation","","1","","","","","27-30 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To exploit value one must focus on extracting knowledge from Big Data sources. In this paper we present a new simple but highly scalable process to automatically learn the label hierarchy from huge sets of unstructured text. We aim to extract knowledge from these sources using a Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification process called Semantic HMC. Five steps compose the Semantic HMC: Indexation, Vectorization, Hierarchization, Resolution and Realization. The first three steps construct the label hierarchy from data sources. The last two steps classify new items according to the hierarchy labels. To perform the classification without heavily relying on the user, the process is unsupervised, where no thesaurus or label examples are required. The process is implemented in a scalable and distributed platform to process Big Data.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7952-6; POD:978-1-4673-7953-3","10.1109/Trustcom.2015.578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7345491","Big Data;classification;machine learning;multi-classify;ontology;semantic technologies","Big data;Data mining;Indexes;Ontologies;Pragmatics;Semantics;Taxonomy","Big Data;knowledge acquisition;pattern classification;semantic networks;unsupervised learning","Big Data;Semantic HMC;hierarchization;indexation;knowledge extraction;multilabel classification process;predictive model;realization;resolution;unsupervised process;vectorization","","1","","27","","","20-22 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The central idea of our work, is to consider the process of matching as a complex adaptive system and model it using the approach of agent-based modeling and simulation. The aim being the exploitation of the intrinsic properties of the agent-based models, such as emergence, stochasticity and self-organization, to help provide answers to better manage complexity and uncertainty of Schema Matching.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0220-7; POD:978-1-5090-0221-4","10.1109/SITA.2015.7358442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358442","agent-based modelling and simulation;bayesian networks;complex adaptive systems;machine learning;schema mapping;schema matching","Adaptation models;Adaptive systems;Agent-based modeling;Complexity theory;Sociology;Statistics;Uncertainty","database management systems;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;uncertainty handling","agent-based modeling;agent-based simulation;automatic schema mapping;automatic schema matching;bio-inspired emerging paradigm;complex adaptive system;complexity management;emergence property;intrinsic properties;process uncertainty;self-organization property;stochasticity property;uncertainty management","","","","31","","","20-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To rapidly and efficiently analyze these logs makes great sense in terms of security and reliability. However, it is a challenging task due to the fact that a huge amount of data might be generated for being analyzed in very short time. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying complex analytics and modern in-memory database technology on the large amount of log data. Logs from different kinds of devices are collected, normalized, and stored in the In-Memory database. Machine learning approaches are then implemented to analyze the centralized big data to identify attacks and anomalies which are not easy to be detected from the individual log event. The proposed method is implemented on the In-Memory platform, i.e., SAP HANA Platform, and the experimental results show that it has the expected capabilities as well as the high performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8937-9; POD:978-1-4799-8938-6","10.1109/HPCC-CSS-ICESS.2015.284","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7336358","Active Directory;Brute Force;K-Means;Machine Learning;SIEM","Data mining;Databases;Libraries;Real-time systems;Security;Servers;Testing","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);storage management","boundary device logs;centralized Big Data;complex analytics;in-memory database technology;machine learning approaches","","","","9","","","24-26 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we aim at detecting at the earliest opportunity the several occurrences of this scene. The objective in early detection is then to build a decision function that is able to go off as soon as possible from the onset of a scene occurrence. This implies making a decision with an incomplete information. This paper proposes a novel framework in this area that i) can guarantee the decision made with a partial observation to be the same as the one with the full observation; ii) incorporates in a non-confusing manner the lack of knowledge about the minimal amount of information needed to make a decision. The proposed detector is based on mapping the temporal sequences to a landmarking space thanks to appropriately designed similarity functions. As a by-product, the built framework benefits from a scalable learning problem.

This tool is based on next modules: Preprocessing, Segmentation, Feature Extraction and Classification. Preprocessing involves the removal of hairs. Segmentation is to isolate the lesion. Feature extraction is considering the ABCD dermoscopy rule. The classification is performed by the Support Vector Machine. Experimental evidence indicates that the proposal has 90.63 % accuracy, 95 % sensitivity and 83.33 % specificity on a dataset of 104 dermatoscopy images.
