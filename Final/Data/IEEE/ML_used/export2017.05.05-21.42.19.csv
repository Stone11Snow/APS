Many proposed methods for monitoring cognitive workload in this population rely on measuring physiological responses to externally delivered probe stimuli and/or use traditional gel-based electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. Here we develop passive, probe-independent algorithms for classifying three levels of flight task complexity based on 4-channel, gel-free EEG during simulated flight. Using a library of 168 input features drawn from different data science application domains, we evaluated 13 different classifiers, using a nested 10-fold cross-validation procedure to estimate generalization performance. The best subsets of features yielded a median classification accuracy of 90.17% across subjects, with perfect accuracy in 1 subject and greater than 75% in 16 of 21 subjects. Though EEG line length and linear discriminant analysis were generally among the most effective features and classifiers, respectively, we find that to maximize prediction accuracy, feature set-classifier combinations should be individualized. No single channel proved more valuable than another in predicting flight task complexity, but combining EEG features across channels maintained or improved performance in 81% of subjects.","2379-8920;23798920","","10.1109/TCDS.2016.2628702","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7744547","Cognitive Workload;electroencephalography;machine learning;pilots","Biomedical monitoring;Classification algorithms;Complexity theory;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Monitoring;Sensors","","","","","","","","20161115","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Consequently, Anti-Virus companies and researchers have developed new approaches for dealing with discovering and classifying malware. Among these, machine learning and Big Data technologies have been used for feature extraction, detection, and clustering of cyber threats. In this paper, we created and analyzed a dataset of malware and clean files (goodware) from the static and dynamic features provided by the online framework VirusTotal. The purpose is to select the smallest number of features that keep the classification accuracy as high as possible given that the training execution time increase in polynomial time with respect to the number of features. In this research, we found that ""9"" features are enough to distinguish malware from ""goodware"" files within an accuracy of 99.60%. Selecting the most representative features for malware detection relies on the possibility of creating an embedded program that monitors the processes executed by the OS looking for the characteristics that match malware behavior. Thus, feature selection was made taking the most important features that keep the accuracy high and allows the creation of monitoring malware detection programs with a low overhead cost. In addition, classification algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) were used in a novel combination that not only showed an increase in accuracy, but also in the training speed from hours to just minutes.","","","10.1109/BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom.2016.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723741","Big Data Analytics;Feature selection;Machine Learning;Malware detection;Neural Networks;Random Forest;Support Vector Machine;improving accuracy","Big data;Cloud computing;Conferences;Social computing","feature selection;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","Big Data technologies;NN;RF;SVM;VirusTotal framework;classification performance;cyber attacks;cyber threats;feature clustering;feature detection;feature extraction;feature selection;machine learning;malware classification;malware detection;malware discovery;neural networks;random forest;support vector machine","","","","","","","8-10 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automated dynamic malware analysis systems are one of the latest weapons used by security researchers to counter them. To counter dynamic analysis, malware authors are using various evasion techniques. Challenge now lies in finding a generic and efficient technique which can detectpotentially malicious file. This article is a survey of dynamic analysis techniques proposed or implemented in the context of Linux systems. The survey classifies these approaches into five types: System-call base approach, Process Control Block based approach, ELF based approach, Linux kernel based approach and Hybrid approach.

EM is a non-discriminative training algorithm. The performance of a GMM trained with the EM algorithm can often fall short of other discriminative pattern classification techniques such as support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) architectures such as deep networks and extreme learning machines (ELM). In this paper a discriminative training method based on the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse, often used in the ELM, is applied to the GMM classifier first trained with the EM algorithm. It is shown that on a number of benchmark pattern classification problems the proposed method improves accuracy of the GMM classifier significantly and produces results that are comparable to the SVM or ELM. The advantages of the proposed method are that there are no tunable parameters and the training is straightforward and fast.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727399","Gaussian mixture models;artificial neural networks;extreme learning machines;pattern recognition","Classification algorithms;Gaussian mixture model;Pattern classification;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","Gaussian processes;expectation-maximisation algorithm;mixture models;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","ANN architectures;Bayesian framework;ELM;EM algorithm;GMM classifier;Gaussian mixture model classifiers;Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse;SVM;artificial neural network architectures;deep networks;discriminative pattern classification;discriminative training;expectation maximization;extreme learning machines;machine learning;support vector machines;unsupervised training","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The research objective was therefore to compare the performance of six MLAs across a time-series of Landsat imagery (1979, 1992, 2003, 2014), all processed in the same manner. Here Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Random Forests (RF), Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ), Recursive Partitioning, Regression Trees (RPART) and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (GBM) were evaluated. The results demonstrated that SVM achieved higher overall accuracies and kappa coefficients, and a slightly improved fit at individual class level, than the second best classifier RF. Both classifiers clearly outperformed the other algorithms. These results suggest that SVMs (or RFs) should be prioritised when classifying time-series imagery for LULC change detection.","","","10.1109/IGARSS.2016.7730346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7730346","LULC classification;Landsat;machine learning algorithm;time-series imagery","Classification algorithms;Earth;Radio frequency;Remote sensing;Satellites;Sensors;Support vector machines","land cover;land use;regression analysis;remote sensing","K-nearest neighbours;LULC change detection;Landsat imagery;Landsat time-series;MLAs performance;kappa coefficients;land cover;land use;learning vector quantization;machine learning algorithms;random forests;stochastic gradient boosting;support vector machines","","","","","","","10-15 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SMA is unique among data reduction and classification methods because it determines the degree of “diagnosticity” or classification potential of each of the dimensions in a multidimensional dataset up to a pre-specified discrimination resolution threshold. We compared SMA to five classical and recent dimensionality reductions methods using supervised and unsupervised classification techniques on 304 actual and simulated datasets.

Input vectors to the experiment were generated from tone pattern alignments of Ibibio (Benue-Congo, Nigeria) corpus. The corpus used for the experiment contained 16,905 words/phrases. The proposed system design is novel, and integrates two unsupervised tools - k-means clustering and self organizing map (SOM) model, into a methodological workflow, that evaluates and selects the optimal number of clusters with the subsequent association of each clustering point to the input data points. In order to reduce data dimensionality for effective visualization, a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was introduced to rid the k-means clusters of noisy attributes. The k-means cluster points generated by the optimum clusters (two in this case) were evaluated by the Silhouette algorithm and finally fed into the SOM, to improve the efficiency of features classification. Results obtained validate existing research claims and demonstrates the importance of vowel-only features in the recognition of tone patterns. A SOM visualization of the input vectors revealed that vowel-only feature correlates better with other input vectors such as syllable and phoneme, compared to consonant-only features. Furthermore, clustering the input datasets into the optimal number of clusters enabled proper and timely visualization of the map.

Machine learning techniques are applied to predict software change-proneness with code smells as predictor variables. The results of this paper indicate that codes smells are more accurate predictors of change-proneness than static code metrics for all machine learning methods.

Dias","EW Simulation Technology, United Kingdom","2nd IET International Conference on Intelligent Signal Processing 2015 (ISP)","20161117","2015","","","1","6","In addition to proposing two novel ensemble learning methods, a novel method of using a learning paradigm for the calibration of nonlinear systems is also proposed in this paper. With this it addresses the non-existent use of learning systems to provide corrective measures in calibration. In this method the learned system provides corrections directly to the nonlinear device to linearize the system output without the need for an additional calculation to produce the corrections. In many calibration tasks a model of the nonlinear system is created and with its help corrections are calculated to linearize the system output. The proposed method makes these two steps transparent by learning the corrective step instead. Therefore the learned system is able to then directly linearize the nonlinear system output. By taking into consideration both the training and pruning aspects of ensemble neural network predictors, two dynamic ensemble methods have been proposed in this paper, one involving pruning and the other a hybrid approach. To enhance diversity the pruning or selection of predictors, and the training of predictors are performed in succession for every pattern in the training set. By ordering the predictors based on their performance on a training pattern, the first method trains only the most divers predictors, while the second method splits the ensemble into two sub-ensembles and applies the hybrid method of training the first sub-ensemble using Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) while the second sub-ensemble independently. During the test phase of these methods a subset of the trained predictors are chosen differently depending on their performance on the test sample. Therefore the ensemble selection is dynamic during predicting the output, which improves the prediction accuracy.","","Paper|Electronic:978-1-78561-136-0|978-1-78561-137-7","10.1049/cp.2015.1792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7745792","Calibration;Ensemble Learning;Machine Learning;Neural Networks","","calibration;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;signal processing","NCL;direct signal calibration;dynamic ensemble methods;ensemble learning methods;ensemble neural network predictors;negative correlation learning;nonlinear device;nonlinear systems;pruning approach;training pattern","","","","","","","1-2 Dec. 2015","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Speed of information processing, spatial ability, dexterity, and working memory were all seen to be significant predictors of task performance. For time on task, linear and polynomial models showed roughly similar predictive performance on unseen test data achieving root-mean-square percentage error of about 7.3%; for number of moves per minute, a polynomial model was best with 9.1% error; and for number of moves, a linear model was best with 12.8% error.","2168-2291;21682291","","10.1109/THMS.2016.2604366","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7569020","Assistive robotics;human factors;human–robot interaction;machine learning;modeling","Human factors;Human-robot interaction;Machine learning;Manipulators;Modeling;Predictive models;Rehabilitation robotics;Robot sensing systems","dexterous manipulators;human factors;predictive control;statistical analysis","assistive robotic manipulator;depth perception;dexterity;find-and-fetch tasks;general population;human factors;information processing;linear models;pick-and-place tasks;polynomial models;predictive model;reaction time;retrieval tasks;root-mean-square;spatial abilities;statistical models;user performance prediction;visual acuity;visual perception;working memory","","","","","","20160915","Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by insiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward Snowden incident, have greatly harmed the U.S. government's relationship with other governments and with its own citizens. Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a solution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an organization's network. However, state-of-art DLP detection models are only able to detect very limited types of sensitive information, and research in the field has been hindered due to the lack of available sensitive texts. Many researchers have focused on document-based detection with artificially labeled “confidential documents” for which security labels are assigned to the entire document, when in reality only a portion of the document is sensitive. This type of whole-document based security labeling increases the chances of preventing authorized users from accessing non-sensitive information within sensitive documents. In this paper, we introduce Automated Classification Enabled by Security Similarity (ACESS), a new and innovative detection model that penetrates the complexity of big text security classification/detection. To analyze the ACESS system, we constructed a novel dataset, containing formerly classified paragraphs from diplomatic cables made public by the WikiLeaks organization.

In this paper, a novel industrial condition monitoring approach based on the combination of Self Organizing Maps for operating point codification and Recurrent Neural Networks for critical signal modeling is proposed. The combination of both methods presents a strong synergy, the information of the operating condition given by the interpretation of the maps helps the model to improve generalization, one of the drawbacks of recurrent networks, while assuring high accuracy and precision rates.

The recommendation algorithms employed in these systems usually compute similarity score or build up a model offline using training data for producing online recommendations. As training in proactive recommender systems when the availability of items changes often and rapidly is very time consuming, existing recommendation algorithms are less effective in such application domains. To address this problem, we present a proactive recommender system that generates real time recommendations using the proposed Extreme Learning Machine based Imputation-Boosted Collaborative Filtering (ELMICF) algorithm. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a machine learning algorithm which considerably reduces the time required for training the system due to the very fast learning process of ELM. It has been used in literature for numerous classification, generalization and prediction applications. ELMICF first employs an imputation technique to handle data sparseness in the input rating matrix and then uses the ELM as a classifier to predict the novel ratings. A prototype of the system has been implemented for restaurant recommendations to show the feasibility of our proposed approach. The performance of ELMICF is compared with MLP/ANN and naïve based classification techniques using normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG), average precision, training time and mean prediction time metrics.","","","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732027","Machine Learning;MultiAgent Systems;Personalization and User-Modeling;Recommender Systems","Collaboration;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Neurons;Recommender systems;Training","collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern classification;recommender systems","ELM based imputation-boosted proactive recommender systems;MLP-ANN;Naive based classification techniques;data training;extreme learning machine based imputation-boosted collaborative filtering;generalization applications;input rating matrix;intelligent systems;mean prediction time metrics;nDCG;normalized discounted cumulative gain;online recommendation systems;prediction applications;real time recommendations;restaurant recommendations;similarity score;training time","","","","","","","21-24 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The pre-classification steps required are feature extraction and feature reduction. A Gaussian membership function was used for the former and principal component analysis for the latter. After testing the algorithm with various grid sizes, an optimum of 2×2 was chosen for the study. For classification, support vector machine with a quadratic kernel was used. An equal number of healthy and unhealthy post-contrast T1 weighted (radiological) images were used for training and test purposes (n=384). Accuracy as high as 87.5% was reported with this method.

Music lovers create music playlists for various contexts and activities they are engaged in, and this is done manually by updating and loading new playlist each time a user changes activity or context. This does not make music listening enjoyable as much time and effort is spent on searching for songs that befit the current context and activity. This paper proposes a personalized context-aware music recommendation system, called MPlist, that dynamically and automatically creates a music playlist for music lovers based on their context (i.e., current location and activity), listening preference, nearby users listening profiles, other users listening preferences and music from labels and tags mined from music experts and the web. MPlist collects data from multiple sensors in a user's smart mobile device and uses them to infer the user's context and activity, thereby generating a playlist based on contextual preference. This approach has the advantage of solving the well-known cold start problem yet giving music lovers a personalized anywhere anytime music listening experience. MPlist classifier is built using both kNN and rule-based learning algorithms using sensor datasets and context-aware listening profile dataset. The context-analytic engine infers basic user activities and sends all the inferred content to the content provider so that the server can learn the music preferences given a particular context. The system exhibit performance as follows: accuracy is 0.944, F-measure is 0.945, and RMSE is 0.0978.

The ability to model how a user interacts with a specific visualization technique and what difficulties they face are paramount in supporting individuals with discovering new patterns within their complex datasets. This paper introduces the notion of visualization systems understanding and modeling user interactions with the intent of guiding a user through a task thereby enhancing visual data exploration. The challenges faced and the necessary future steps to take are discussed; and to provide a working example, a grammar-based model is presented that can learn from user interactions, determine the common patterns among a number of subjects using a K-Reversible algorithm, build a set of rules, and apply those rules in the form of suggestions to new users with the goal of guiding them along their visual analytic process.

As standard classifiers will be biased towards the majority class there exist a need for specific methods than can overcome this single-class dominance. Most of works concentrated on binary problems, where majority and minority class can be distinguished. But a more challenging problem arises when imbalance is present within multi-class datasets, as relations between classes tend to complicate. One class can be a minority class for some, while a majority for others. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for handling such scenarios, that combines the problem decomposition with cost-sensitive learning. According to divide-and-conquer rule, we decompose our multi-class data into a number of binary subproblems using one-versus-one approach. To each simplified task we delegate a cost-sensitive neural network with moving threshold. It relies on scaling the output of the classifier with a given cost function. This way, we adjust our support functions towards the minority class. We propose a novel method for automatically determining the cost, based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This way we can estimate the cost matrix for each class pair independently. Then using a dedicated classifier fusion approach, we reconstruct the original multi-class problem. Experimental analysis backed-up with statistical testing clearly proves that such an approach is superior to state-of-the art ad-hoc and decomposition methods used in the literature.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727503","cost-sensitive;decision templates;imbalanced classification;machine learning;multi-class imbalance;neural networks","Biological neural networks;Computational modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Standards;Training;Tuning","data analysis;divide and conquer methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","ROC curve analysis;ad-hoc methods;cost function;cost-sensitive learning;decomposition methods;dedicated classifier fusion approach;divide-and-conquer rule;machine learning algorithms;multiclass datasets;multiclass imbalanced data;receiver operating characteristic curve analysis;statistical testing;training set","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The past few years have seen major advances in many perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework, which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This paper proposes a general framework for Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, and control.

In this work, we aim at improving the accuracy of transrectal dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (DCE-US) for PCa localization by combining local perfusion and dispersion parameters. To this end, ten of these parameters were extracted pixel-by-pixel from 45 DCE-US recordings distributed over 19 patients that were scheduled for radical prostatectomy. Based on 43 benign and 42 malignant histologically-confirmed regions of interest, we produced multiparametric maps using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm. All possible combinations of one to four parameters were evaluated to select the most suitable subset of parameters. We also tested the GMM algorithm's ability to determine the classification confidence for each pixel and the impact of excluding low-confidence pixels from the images. An accuracy and negative predictive value of 81% and 83%, respectively, are obtained, which improved after pixel exclusion. Even though extended validation on a larger patient group is recommended, multiparametric DCE-US shows high potential in localizing PCa and might become an important tool for guiding targeted biopsy or planning of focal treatment.","","","10.1109/ULTSYM.2016.7728403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7728403","dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound;machine learning;multiparametric classification;prostate cancer","Biopsy;Cancer;Dispersion;Imaging;Principal component analysis;Systematics;Ultrasonic imaging","Gaussian processes;biomedical ultrasonics;cancer;haemorheology;image classification;image enhancement;medical image processing;mixture models;tumours","DCE-US;GMM;Gaussian mixture model algorithm;PCa localization;benign tissues;diagnostic imaging methods;dispersion parameters;focal treatment planning;image classification;local perfusion;malignant tissues;multiparametric dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound classification;negative predictive value;pixel exclusion;prostate cancer;radical prostatectomy;systematic biopsy;targeted biopsy;transrectal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography","","","","","","","18-21 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A flexible means of separating ships from sea is ideal and can be accomplished using machine learning. Newer, advanced deep learning techniques offer a unique solution but traditionally require a large dataset to train effectively. Highway Networks allow for very deep networks that can be trained using the smaller datasets typical in SAR-based ship detection. A flexible network configuration is possible within Highway Networks due to an adaptive gating mechanism which prevents gradient decay across many layers. This paper presents a very deep High Network configuration as a ship discrimination stage for SAR ship detection. It also presents a three-class SAR dataset that allows for more meaningful analysis of ship discrimination performances. The proposed method was tested on a this SAR dataset and had the highest mean accuracy of all methods tested at 96.67%.

With the correlation analysis of heavy metal content and pretreatment spectral band, the models are constructed to predict the content of heavy metal in soil. The results show that the prediction results of machine learning methods are better than PLS, and ELM and RF are better than SVM. Analyzing the stability of the model, it can be found that the concentration of heavy metal samples will affect the prediction of ELM.

A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a biggest threat to cyber security in SDN network. The attack will occur at the network layer or the application layer of the compromised systems that are connected to the network. In this paper we discuss the DDoS attacks from the traces of the traffic flow. We use different machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest neighbour, K-means and K-medoids to classify the traffic as normal and abnormal. Then these algorithms are measured using parameters such as detection rate and efficiency. The algorithm having more accuracy is chosen to implement Signature IDS and results of it are then processed by Advanced IDS which detects anomalous behaviour based on open connections and provides accurate results of the hosts specifying which hosts is involved in the DDOS attack.","","","10.1109/ICACCI.2016.7732445","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7732445","DDoS;IDS;Machine learning algorithms;SDN","Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Computer crime;Machine learning algorithms;Servers;Software;Training","Bayes methods;computer network security;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;software defined networking","DDoS attack;K-means algorithm;K-medoids algorithm;K-nearest neighbour algorithm;Naive Bayes algorithm;SDN architecture;anomalous behaviour detection;cyber security;distributed denial of service attack;distributed denial of service attack detection;machine learning algorithms;network management;software defined networks;traffic flow","","","","","","","21-24 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Herein, we demonstrate the use of a new Genetic Programming (GP) based Symbolic Regression (SR) approach for predicting PPIs related to a disease. In a case study, a dataset consisting of one hundred and thirty five PPI complexes related to cancer was used to construct a generic PPI predicting model with good PPI prediction accuracy and generalization ability. A high correlation coefficient(CC) of 0.893, low root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values of 478.221 and 0.239, respectively were achieved for both the training and test set outputs. To validate the discriminatory nature of the model, it was applied on a dataset of diabetes complexes where it yielded significantly low CC values. Thus, the GP model developed here serves a dual purpose: (a)a predictor of the binding energy of cancer related PPI complexes, and (b)a classifier for discriminating PPI complexes related to cancer from those of other diseases.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2016.2621042","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7707365","Binding energy;Cancer;Disease;Genetic Programming;Machine learning;Protein-protein interactions;Symbolic Regression","Cancer;Hidden Markov models;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Proteins;Support vector machines","","","","","","","","20161026","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Among these techniques, online reinforcement learning methods have been proposed that learn how to adapt at run-time the throughput and resources allocated to the various streaming tasks depending on dynamically changing data stream characteristics and the desired applications performance (e.g., accuracy). However, most of state-of-the-art techniques consider only one single stream input in its application model input and assume that the system knows the amount of resources to allocate to each task to achieve a desired performance. To address these limitations, in this paper we propose a new systematic and efficient methodology and associated algorithms for online learning and energy-efficient scheduling of Big-Data streaming applications with multiple streams on many core systems with resource constraints. We formalize the problem of multi-stream scheduling as a staged decision problem in which the performance obtained for various resource allocations is unknown. The proposed scheduling methodology uses a novel class of online adaptive learning techniques which we refer to as staged multi-armed bandits (S-MAB). Our scheduler is able to learn online which processing method to assign to each stream and how to allocate its resources over time in order to maximize the performance on the fly, at run-time, without having access to any offline information. The proposed scheduler, applied on a face detection streaming application and without using any offline information, is able to achieve similar performance compared to an optimal semi-online solution that has full knowledge of the input stream where the differences in throughput, observed quality, resource usage and energy efficiency are less than 1, 0.3, 0.2 and 4 percent respectively.","0018-9340;00189340","","10.1109/TC.2016.2550454","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7447706","Scheduling;big-data;concept drift;data mining;machine learning;many-core platforms;multiple streams processing","Adaptation models;Big data;Complexity theory;Data mining;Machine learning;Quality of service;Resource management;Throughput","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;scheduling","Big-Data streaming;S-MAB;data stream characteristics;energy-efficient scheduling;many core systems;multistream scheduling;online adaptive learning;online reinforcement learning;resource allocations;staged multiarmed bandits","","","","","","20160405","Dec. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A home-based non-contact sleep/wake monitoring system may be used as a guide for treatment potentially stratifying patients by clinical need or highlighting longitudinal changes in sleep and nocturnal patterns. This paper presents the evaluation of an under-mattress sleep monitoring system for non-contact sleep/wake discrimination. A large dataset of sensor data with concomitant sleep/wake state was collected from both younger and older adults participating in a circadian sleep study. A thorough training/testing/validation procedure was configured and optimised feature extraction and sleep/wake discrimination algorithms evaluated both within and across the two cohorts. An accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 74.3%, 95.5%, and 53.2% is reported over all subjects using an external validation dataset (71.9%, 87.9% and 56%, and 77.5%, 98% and 57% is reported for younger and older subjects respectively). These results compare favourably with similar research, however this system provides an ambient alternative suitable for long term continuous sleep monitoring, particularly amongst vulnerable populations.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2621066","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7676363","Sleep;actigraphy;ambient intelligence;feature extraction;machine learning;polysomnography","Feature extraction;Monitoring;Receivers;Sleep;Sociology;Statistics;Wrist","","","","","","","","20161025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
"Social-Aware Data Collection Scheme Through Opportunistic Communication in Vehicular Mobile Networks","Z. Tang; A. Liu; C. Huang","School of Information Science and Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, China","IEEE Access","20161107","2016","4","","6480","6502","To enable the intelligent management of Smart City and improve overall social welfare, it is desirable for the status of infrastructures detected and reported by intelligent devices embedded in them to be forwarded to the data centers. Using “SCmules” such as taxis, to opportunistically communicate with intelligent devices and collect data from the sparse networks formed by them in the process of moving is an economical and effective way to achieve this goal. In this paper, the social welfare data collection paradigm SWDCP-SCmules data collection framework is proposed to collect data generated by intelligent devices and forward them to data centers, in which “SCmules” are data transmitters picking up data from nearby intelligent devices and then store-carry-forwarding them to nearby data centers via short-range wireless connections in the process of moving. Because of the storage limitations, “SCmules” need to weigh the value of data and select some less valuable data to discard when necessary. To quantify the value of data and find a well-performed selection strategy, the concept of priority is introduced to the SWDCP-SCmules scheme, and then, the simulated annealing for priority assignment SA-PA algorithm is proposed to guide the priority assignment. The SA-PA algorithm is a universal algorithm that can improve the performance of SWDCP-SCmules scheme by finding better priority assignment with respect to various optimization targets, such as maximizing collection rate or minimizing redundancy rate, in which priority assignment problem is converted into an optimization problem and simulated annealing is used to optimize the priority assignment. From the perspective of machine learning, the process of optimization is equal to automatically learn social-aware patterns from past GPS trajectory data. Experiments based on real GPS trajectory data of taxis in- Beijing are conducted to show the effectiveness and efficiency of SWDCP-SCmules scheme and SA-PA algorithm.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2611863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7572984","Vehicular mobile networks;data collection;machine learning;oblivious data mules;opportunistic communication;simulated annealing;social welfare","Data collection;Global Positioning System;Optimization;Public transportation;Smart cities;Trajectory;Transmitters","computer centres;mobile radio;simulated annealing","GPS trajectory;SA-PA algorithm;SWDCP-SCmules;data centers;intelligent devices;intelligent management;opportunistic communication;simulated annealing;smart city;social-aware data collection scheme;store-carry-forwarding;vehicular mobile networks","","7","","","","20160921","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Different types of sensors, such as heart rate or skin conductivity sensors, have been previously used to measure stress related features. Estimated stress levels could be used to adapt the driver's environment to minimize distractions in high cognitive demanding situations and to promote stress-friendly driving behaviors. The way we drive has an impact on how stressors affect the perceived cognitive demands by drivers, and at the same time, the perceived stress has an impact on the actions taken by the driver. In this paper, we evaluate how effectively upcoming stress levels can be predicted considering current stress levels, current driving behavior, and the shape of the road. We use features, such as the positive kinetic energy and severity of curves on the road to estimate how stress levels will evolve in the next minute. Different machine learning techniques are evaluated and the results for both intra and inter-city driving and for both intra and inter driver data are presented. We have used data from four different drivers with three different car models and a motorbike and more than 220 test drives.

Three comparisons of different grammatical complexity were performed: (i) words versus asterisks (ii) “with diacritics versus without diacritics” and (iii) “with root versus no root”. We discuss the most difficult task and, for comparison, the easiest one. Earlier work using more standard classification techniques (machine learning and statistical) succeeded fully only in the simplest of these tasks (i), but produced only partial results on (ii) and failed completely, even on the training set on the deepest task (iii). The method performs a “best match” between pre-processed data and computing a full library of artificially generated examples. The method involves a deconvolution of the rapid events on the data and performing a convolution on the generated data. The best-match is performed over all “words” constructed by convolving the response functions of each value of each event performed in a “windowed” sequence. This is accomplished separately for all voxels and then a voting procedure defines the outcome. Using the same feature selection (ANOVA) as in the earlier methods, (i) there is a dramatic increase in the accuracy rate for the third (most difficult task) on the intra-run level (88%) as well as the first task (ii) Unlike the earlier methods training and testing over all runs (within subject) achieves a significant level of classification (64% accuracy) for the training set.

This problem may originate from poorly documented historic data, errors during data generation process or mistakes made by human experts. Inclusion of such examples during the training process will mislead the classifier by presenting a falsified class distribution and consequently lead to degradation of models' generalization abilities. This phenomenon becomes even more troublesome in multi-class scenarios that may be affected by highly complex intra-class noise. Decomposition strategies with binary classifiers were proven to alleviate this difficulty by using simplified binary subtasks that are less affected by the noise. In this paper we propose to extend this approach by using the one-class classification decomposition. In this scenario each class has assigned individual one-class classifier that aims at capturing its distinguishing characteristics. This allows to create a robust data description and then apply a dedicated classifier combination in order to reconstruct the original multi-class task. We further extend this concept by using fuzzy one-class classifiers that allow to associate membership values with each training objects. This allows us to reduce the influence of uncertain and potentially noisy samples on the shape of learned decision boundary. Experimental study backed-up with statistical analysis shows that fuzzy one-class classifier decomposition offers an excellent robustness to noise in multi-class classification.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0626-7; POD:978-1-5090-0627-4; USB:978-1-5090-0625-0","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2016.7737786","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7737786","data uncertainty;fuzzy classifiers;label noise;machine learning;multi-class decomposition;one-class classification","Complexity theory;Fuzzy logic;Noise measurement;Robustness;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","data description;fuzzy set theory;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","binary classifiers;class label noise;data-level difficulty;fuzzy one-class classifier decomposition;fuzzy one-class support vector machines;highly complex intraclass noise;learned decision boundary;multiclass classification;multiclass decomposition;one-class classification decomposition;robust data description;statistical analysis","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Among these challenges is the fundamental question of exploiting the dynamics between visual gestures and verbal messages to be able to better model sentiment. This article addresses this question in four ways: introducing the first multimodal dataset with opinion-level sentiment intensity annotations; studying the prototypical interaction patterns between facial gestures and spoken words when inferring sentiment intensity; proposing a new computational representation, called multimodal dictionary, based on a language-gesture study; and evaluating the authors' proposed approach in a speaker-independent paradigm for sentiment intensity prediction. The authors' study identifies four interaction types between facial gestures and verbal content: neutral, emphasizer, positive, and negative interactions.

The latter kind of tweets plays a vital role in decision making during a crisis situation. These types of tweets are referred as situation awareness tweets. Extraction of situation awareness information from Twitter is a non-trivial task as the vocabulary used usually is not formal and presence of short hand words for ease of writing reduces the readability of tweets. Crowdsourcing of data during such a disaster can aid in the task of decision making.

Multi-label classification is one of the actively researched machine learning paradigm that has gained much attention in the recent years due to its rapidly increasing real world applications. In contrast to traditional binary and multi-class classification, multi-label classification involves association of each of the input samples with a set of target labels simultaneously. There are no real-time online neural network based multi-label classifier available in the literature. In this paper, we exploit the inherent nature of high speed exhibited by the extreme learning machines to develop a novel online real-time classifier for multi-label data streams. The developed classifier is experimented with datasets from different application domains for consistency, performance and speed. The experimental studies show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of speed and accuracy and can classify multi-label data streams in real-time.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727422","Classification;Extreme learning machines;High speed;Multi-label;Online;Real-time","Biological neural networks;Classification algorithms;Learning systems;Mathematical model;Real-time systems;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;real-time systems","extreme learning machine;machine learning;multilabel classification;multilabel data streams;online real-time classifier","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in such cases, a targeted e-Health solution to safeguard patient long-term health could be a meaningful approach. Today's modern healthcare technologies, often built around electronic and computer-based equipment, require an access to a reliable electricity supply. Many healthcare technologies and products also presume access to the high speed internet is available, making them unsuitable for use in areas where there is no fixed-line internet connectivity, access is slow, unreliable, and expensive, yet where the most benefit to patients may be gained. In this paper, a full mobile sensor platform is presented, based around readily-purchased consumer components, to facilitate a low cost and efficient means of monitoring the health of patients with prosthetic lower limbs. This platform is designed such that it can also be operated in a standalone mode, i.e., in the absence of internet connectivity, thereby making it suitable to the developing world. Also, to counter the challenge of power supply issues in e-Health monitoring, a self-contained rechargeable solution to the platform is proposed and demonstrated. The platform works with an Android mobile device, in order to allow for the capture of data from a wireless sensor unit, and to give the clinician access to results from the sensors. The results from the analysis, carried out within the platform's Raspberry Pi Zero, are demonstrated to be of use for remote monitoring. This is specifically targeted for monitoring the tissue health of lower limb amputees. The monitoring of residual limb temperature and gait can be a useful indicator of tissue viability in lower limb amputees especially those suffering from diabetes. We describe a route wherein non-invasive monitoring of tissue health is achievable using the Gaussian process tec- nique. This knowledge will be useful in establishing biomarkers related to a possible deterioration in a patient's health or for assessing the impact of clinical interventions.","2169-3536;21693536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2622163","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7723857","Accelerometer;Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML);e-health;elastomer;extrapolation;gait;gyroscope;interpolation;lower limb prosthetics;rehabilitation;sensors;tissue health;wearable sensor platform","Androids;Biomarkers;Biomedical monitoring;Internet;Medical services;Moible communication;Prosthetics;Radiation detectors","Gaussian processes;health care;smart phones","Android mobile device;Gaussian process technique;Internet connectivity;Raspberry Pi Zero;e-health solution;full mobile sensor platform;healthcare technologies;patient long-term health;remote monitoring;wireless sensor unit","","","","","","20161027","2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The global prognosis results including KPI prediction and process monitoring are obtained from the corresponding normalized weighted means of all the local models. The statistical indicators for prognosis are enhanced as well by the design of novel KPI-related and KPI-unrelated statistics with suitable control limits for non-Gaussian data. For application-oriented purpose, the process measurements from real datasets of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell system are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of KPI prognosis.

This paper presents an approach using machine learning (ML) techniques that would enable the grid to assess its current dynamic state instantaneously. A database consisting of steady-state operating points of the power system and outputs of time-domain simulations is generated in order to train and test the algorithm. A few operating points termed as “landmarks” are identified through a ranking methodology proposed in this paper.

With the combination of SIFT and LNBNN, speech perception problem is quite highly accurate. In this approach, each speech signal is converted into an spectrogram image, then SIFT features are extracted from this image. Typically, a few thousand key-points are extracted from each image spectrogram. This approach retains all discriminative features of speech signals. However, the big limitation of this approach is that the need of memory to store all SIFT features. In order to reduce the need of memory, we quantize SIFT features from 128 bytes to 128 bits and encode them into 16 bytes for each SIFT features. We show that SIFT features perform surprisingly well even after quantizing each component to binary, when the medians are used as the quantization thresholds. Quantized features preserve both distinctiveness and matching properties. The LNBNN perform searching K-nearest neighbor in classification, thus it uses the KD-TREE structure to speed up searching in classification, however, KD-TREE cannot perform with binary SIFT. Therefore, we propose using a multi index hashing to improve the KNN search problem.","","","10.1109/NICS.2016.7725646","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7725646","binary sift;classification;feature reduction;machine learning;probability;quantized sift;speech perception","Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Indexes;Spectrogram;Speech;Training","quantisation (signal);search problems;signal classification;speech processing;transforms;trees (mathematics)","K-nearest neighbor;KD-TREE structure;KNN search problem;LNBNN classifier;binary quantized SIFT features;multi-index hashing;quantization thresholds;signal spectrogram images;speech classification;speech perception problem","","","","","","","14-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field.

Having classifiers that are of high individual quality and complementary to each other is a desirable property. Among several ways to ensure diversity feature space division deserves attention. The most popular method employed here is Random Subspace approach. However, due to its random nature one cannot consider this approach as stable one or suitable for real-life applications. Therefore, we propose a new approach called Deterministic Subspace that constructs feature subspaces in a guided and repetitive manner. We present a general framework and three dedicated measures that can be used for selecting diverse and uncorrelated features for each base learner. This way we will always obtain identical sets of features, leading to creation of stable ensembles. Experimental study backed-up with statistical analysis prove the usefulness of our method in comparison to popular randomized solution.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733220","Machine learning;deterministic methods;diversity;ensemble classification;feature subspaces","Automobiles;Complexity theory;Dermatology;Ionosphere;Sonar;Support vector machines","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis","base learners;classifier ensembles;deterministic feature subspaces;diverse features;diversity feature space division;ensemble learning;machine learning;random subspace;statistical analysis;uncorrelated features","","","","","","","11-14 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a binarized recurrent neural network whose weight parameters, input, and intermediate hidden layer output signals, are all binary-valued, and require only basic bit logic for the evaluation and training process. The proposed Binarized Long Short-Term Memory Network (B-BLSTM-RNN) is especially suitable for resource-constrained environments since it replaces either floating or fixed-point arithmetic with significantly more efficient bitwise operations. The model is based on a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM-RNN). Designed to take contextual information into account, the network can process data gathered from different positions, resulting in a system, that's invariant to transformations and distortions of the input patterns. During the forward pass, the B-BLSTM drastically reduce memory size and accesses, and replace most arithmetic operations with bit-wise operations, which is expected to substantially improve power-efficiency. The binarized network is simple, accurate, efficient, and works on challenging gesture recognition tasks using raw MEM data. To validate the effectiveness of the network we conduct three sets of experiments. We achieved a classification accuracy with a the proposed network of about 90% which only 2% less than the full-precision network. We also compare our method with recent methods and outperform these methods by large margins on the conducted datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2425-4; POD:978-1-5090-2426-1; USB:978-1-5090-2424-7","10.1109/IPIN.2016.7743581","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7743581","Indoor positioning;dead reckoning;deep learning;inertial tracking;machine learning","Biological neural networks;Context;Indoor navigation;Recurrent neural networks;Standards;Training","fixed point arithmetic;gesture recognition;recurrent neural nets","binarized long short-term memory recurrent neural network;binarized-BLSTM-RNN;computational complexity;context awareness;fine-grained localization technology;fixed-point arithmetic;gesture recognition task;human activity recognition;indoor location tracking;mobile device;power-efficiency improvement;raw MEM data;resource-constrained environment;ubiquitous health monitoring","","","","","","","4-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early detection is crucial for ensuring five-year survival (which varies between 15% and 99% depending on the melanoma stage). Melanoma severity is typically diagnosed by invasive methods (e.g. a biopsy). In this paper, we propose an alternative system combining image analysis and machine learning for detecting melanoma presence and severity. The 86 features selected consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the melanoma. As opposed to previous studies that have focused on distinguishing melanoma and non-melanoma images, our work considers a finer-grain classification problem using five categories: benign lesions and 4 different stages of melanoma. The dataset presents two main characteristics that are approached by specific machine learning methods: 1) the classes representing melanoma severity follow a natural order, and 2) the dataset is imbalanced, where benign lesions clearly outnumber melanoma ones. Different nominal and ordinal classifiers are considered, one of them being based on an ordinal cascade decomposition method. The cascade method is shown to obtain good performance for all classes, while respecting and exploiting the order information. Moreover, we explore the alternative of applying a class balancing technique, presenting good synergy with the ordinal and nominal methods.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727466","computer vision;imbalanced classification;machine learning;melanoma;ordinal classification","Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Image analysis;Image color analysis;Lesions;Malignant tumors","cancer;feature selection;image classification;image colour analysis;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;shape recognition;skin","benign lesions;biopsy;class balancing;early detection;feature selection;finer-grain classification problem;image analysis;invasive methods;machine learning;melanoma colour;melanoma detection;melanoma image classification;melanoma shape;melanoma texture;ordinal cascade decomposition method;pigment network;skin cancer","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Perceptron is commonly used in simple form of online machine learning. First, we extended it to the complex domain. The real-valued inputs are projected to points on the first quarter of unit circle on the complex plane. The real and imaginary parts of inputs are fed separately to two different Perceptrons. In each Perceptron, a real-valued weight vector is applied to the input vector. Outputs of two Perceptrons are plotted on a complex plane. The upper half of the plane is considered as the class 1 and the lower half as the class -1. If misclassified, the weight vectors are modified. We here term it the complex-valued Perceptron (CP). The results on some benchmarks showed that the identification accuracy of the online classifier with the CP was higher than that with the conventional Perceptron. Secondly, we adopted the Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm, as well as PA-I and PA-II with noise immunity. We term them CPA, CPA-I and CPA-II, respectively. For the benchmarks, the identification accuracies of the online classifier with these PA algorithms was higher than those with the conventional PA algorithms. Since the CP used here is simple in principle, complex-valued online classifiers, CP, CPA, CPA-I and CPA-II, can be applied to various practical problems.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727779","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727779","Complex values;Linear Classifier;Passive-Aggressive;Perceptron;online machine learning","Benchmark testing;Classification algorithms;Fasteners;Gaussian distribution;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;perceptrons;vectors","CP;CPA;CPA-I;CPA-II;PA-I algorithm;PA-II algorithm;binary classification;complex-valued online classifier;complex-valued online machine learning algorithms;complex-valued perceptron;identification accuracy;input vector;passive-aggressive algorithm;real-valued weight vector","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The popular posts having greater views that stay active for longer periods of time are the ones that occur commonly for many users. The objective of this paper is to predict such posts at its arrival time. Using the prediction results, the problems that will gain popularity over time can be addressed before they become very common. The posts in question and answer websites have a longer lifespan than other online content such as news articles which are short lived and have a high user activity at the beginning that decrease with time. This indicates that the user activity in question and answer websites is not an accurate measure of popularity in an early stage. In this paper, we have used the initial content in a post as the predictors of popularity rather than using conventional methods such as shares, comments etc. We used three models to predict the popularity using the dataset of android.stackexchange.com, a popular question and answer website for android developers.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724494","Classification;Linear Models;Machine learning;Popularity;Prediction;Predictive models;Question and Answer websites","Electronic mail;Niobium;Smoothing methods;Social network services;Software engineering;Support vector machines;Training","Android (operating system);Web sites;question answering (information retrieval)","android developers;android.stackexchange.com;feasibility analysis;initial content;online content;popularity prediction;question and answer Web sites;stack exchange posts","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Impact of feature selection and engineering in the classification of handwritten text","A. Kaushik; H. Gupta; D. S. Latwal","Dept. of IT, Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, Delhi, India","2016 3rd International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)","20161031","2016","","","2598","2601","Feature selection forms an important aspect of machine learning and character recognition. It is a process of selecting the most important features (attributes) from the dataset. Accurate feature selection results in significant reduction in the number of irrelevant (constant, redundant) attributes thereby, reducing the processing time and increasing the accuracy of the model without any loss of information. This paper focuses on the impact of feature selection and engineering in the classification of handwritten text by identifying and extracting those attributes of the training dataset that will contribute most towards the classification task using classifiers like J48, NaiveBayes and Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO). This results in improved accuracy of the classifiers as compared to the work reported earlier. Further, a comparative performance evaluation of the classifiers used for OCR and pattern recognition is done. Initial classification performance of all the classifiers listed above was recorded on the raw dataset. Finally, the dataset was transformed after performing relevant feature selection and engineering on its attributes. The same classifiers were again trained on the transformed dataset and their accuracy was recorded. This paper uses the widely used MNIST dataset of handwritten digits for training the classifiers.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724732","Character recognition;J-48;MNIST Dataset;Machine Learning;NaiveBayes;Optical Character Recognition (OCR);Pattern Recognition;Principal Components Analysis (PCA);Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO);WEKA","Character recognition;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Optical character recognition software;Principal component analysis;Training","Bayes methods;feature selection;handwritten character recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification;text analysis","J48;MNIST dataset;SMO;character recognition;classifiers;feature selection;handwritten digits;handwritten text;machine learning;naive Bayes;pattern recognition;sequential minimal optimization","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
