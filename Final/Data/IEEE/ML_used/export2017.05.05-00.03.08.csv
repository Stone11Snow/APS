Various features extracted from different angles are proposed. In this paper, we propose an EEG-based emotion recognition framework based on the weighted fusion of outputs from base classifiers. Threebase classifiers based on the SVM with RBF kernel using Power Spectral, Higuchi Fractal Dimension and Lempel-Ziv Complexity features are developed, respectively. The outputs of base classifiers are integrated by the weighted fusion strategy which is based on the confidence estimation on each class by each base classifier. The evaluation on the DEAP dataset shows that our proposed decision fusion based method outperforms individual base classifiers and the feature fusion based classifier integration for EEG-based emotion recognition.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340670","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340670","Decision fusion;EEG;Emotion recognition","","electroencephalography;emotion recognition;feature extraction;fractals;medical signal processing;radial basis function networks;sensor fusion;signal classification;support vector machines","DEAP dataset;EEG-based emotion recognition;Higuchi fractal dimension;Lempel-Ziv complexity features;RBF kernel;SVM;confidence estimation;decision fusion;electroencephalogram;feature extraction;feature fusion based classifier integration;power spectral;three-base classifiers;weighted fusion strategy","","","","23","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using both row and column information of data, biclustering requires the optimization of two conflicting objectives. In this study, a new multi-objective evolutionary biclustering framework using SPEA2 is proposed. A heuristic local search based on the gene and condition deletion and addition is added into SPEA2 and the best bicluster is selected using a new quantitative measure that considers both its coherence and size. The performance of our algorithm is evaluated using simulated and gene expression data and compared with several well-known biclustering methods.

The main idea is to run DBSCAN with different eps and Minpts values. We also modified the calculation of the Minpts so that DBSCAN can have better clustering results.

To alleviate this problem, many recommendation models have been proposed to transfer one domain's knowledge to another domain by using transfer learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new cross-domain recommendation algorithm which is divided into two stages. In the first stage, we apply the TrAdaBoost algorithm to select some items which are worthy of being recommended to users in the target domain. Then in the second stage, we adopt the nonparametric pairwise clustering algorithm to make a decision whether to recommend an item to a group of users or not. We not only make a classification for the target domain items but also find the recommended or not recommended customer groups for one item through the two stages. Experiments on real world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method performs better than other algorithms for the cross-domain recommendation task.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340669","Cross-domain recommendation;Item cold start problem;Nonparametric pairwise clustering algorithm;Transfer learning","","learning (artificial intelligence);recommender systems","CPS;TrAdaBoost algorithm;cold start problem;collaborative filtering;content-based technology;cyber-physical systems;nonparametric pairwise clustering algorithm;recommender systems;transfer learning algorithm;two-stage cross-domain recommendation","","","","13","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In these cases, the final partition does not have enough clusters as the initial number of clusters, called the lost cluster problem. To overcome this disadvantage, we propose a solution having two steps: (1) determine the right cluster which absorbs other clusters, (2) find the centroid which can be used to recover the lost cluster.

In addition, the meaning of the specific IT2FS is defined by the decision maker relevant to the specific parameter function. Firstly, the parametric centroid function is calculated with respect to the embedded pessimistic, modal and optimistic functionals. Then, the centroid of the IT2FS is determined by taking the average of the parametric centroid function. In this manner, the IT2FSs are defuzzified and can be ranked by sorting the average centroids.

For the foreground sequences, by comparing local sequences pairs and then summing over all the local sequences pairs of certain length, and the local alignment-free of two sequences has been tested by statistics D2, D2star, D2shepp, then from the power of the three statistics, we can find the optimal parameters.

In this paper, we propose a novel convex radius-margin based SVM model with-LogDet regularization, ie., L-S VM Our model not only takes radius into consideration, but also increases the stability by combing the individual inequality constraints into one integrated inequality constraint. In L-SVM, we introduce a-LogDet regularization term to make the model more effective and get a dosed-form solution of the transformation matrix. Furthermore, we extend the L-SVM model to kernel space for nonlinear cases with the advantages of kernel principal component analysis.

In this study, the fuzzy neural systems (FNSs) are adopted to estimate the model of robot manipulator to propose an adaptive scheme to accomplish the tracking control problem. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, the stability of the robot manipulator is guaranteed and the corresponding update laws of FNSs' parameters and stiffness coefficient of the environment can be obtained.

For the purpose of visual display, it is necessary to convert the captured CFA video into the full-color RGB video. In this paper, we propose a novel quality-efficient universal demosaicing for arbitrary CFA videos. In the proposed method, both the spatial and the temporal correlations among the CFA data are taken into account during the demosaicing. Then an effective least square-based approach is developed to fuse the spatial-based demosaiced result and the temporal-based one. Experimental results on 27 test videos with ten typical RGB CFA structures show that the demosaiced videos generated by the proposed universal demosaicing method yield better quality in terms of average color peak signal-to-noise ratio (CPSNR) and demonstrate less color artifacts in terms of visual perception in comparison with two state-of-the-art universal demosaicing methods.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340958","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340958","Arbitrary CFA videos;CPSNR;Least square-based fusion;Universal demosaicing;Visual quality","","image colour analysis;image segmentation;least mean squares methods;video signal processing","CFA video;RGB color filter array;arbitrary color filter array video;color peak signal-to-noise ratio;digital video camera;full-color RGB video;least square-based approach;mosaic video;quality-efficient universal demosaicing;red-green-blue CFA;single-sensor technology;spatial correlation;temporal correlation;visual perception","","","","12","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In 2014, Qin et al. proposed an index parity matching method to embed secret data into compression codes, i.e., vector quantization (VQ) indices. In the index parity matching method, the difference between the current embedding VQ index and its neighboring index is calculated. The original VQ index is replaced by the difference, its ID number and one secret bit. However, recoding the signal value of the difference causes more compression codes. In order to solve this problem, we skillfully use the exclusive-or (XOR) operator to calculate the difference between the two neighboring indices. The XOR operator does not generate any negative number, thus the proposed method does not record the signal value. Experimental results showed that the proposed method can embed more secret data than the previous methods. In addition, under the same hiding capacity, the bitrate of the proposed method is lower than that of the previous methods.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340945","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340945","Bitrate;Hiding capacity;Reversible data hiding;XOR operator","","data encapsulation;data protection;image coding;image matching;vector quantisation","SOC code;VQ index;XOR operator;exclusive-or operator;image compression code;index parity matching method;reversible data hiding;secret data protection;signal value recording;vector quantization","","","","19","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The automatic threshold segmentation algorithm detects defects rapidly using the threshold parameters obtained by modeling the image effectively, and the adaptive entropy-based segmentation algorithm effectively detects defects using ID information entropy.

In those scenarios where a cohort of entities have a short event history, applying existing methods will lead to an isolated or inaccurate (if not both) prediction model for each entity. To address this problem, our work learns the segmented sequences merged from consecutive temporal events of all entities. Instead of using static entropy as splitting metric in the training process, we employ feedback-directed bottom-up approach to build the decision tree. This work adopts a probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem to enhance prediction accuracy. Moreover, it supports automatic parallelization to reduce overhead.

Following the main principle of the building methods for variable selection ensembles, we propose a novel approach by adding noise to the response variable so that the selection accuracy is maximized. In order to generate multiple but slightly different importance measures for each variable, Gaussian noises are artificially added to the response. The new training set (i.e, the original design matrix together with the new response vector) is then used as the input of the genetic algorithm to perform the variable selection. By repeating this process for a number of iterations and fusing the results by simple averaging, the variables are ranked and a thresholding rule is then employed to identify the important variables. The performance of the proposed method is studied on simulated data sets.

Therefore, analyzing the spread of an epidemic by the matroid is highly efficient In this paper, we build a matroid induced by the formal context and discuss whether an epidemic spreads easily or not by this matroid. Firstly, we define a family of sets which are proved to satisfy the circuit axiom of matroids. Therefore, a matroidal structure of the formal context can be built Secondly, in order to study E-spread information systems deeply by the matroid, a graphical representation of matroids is explored. Finally, three necessary and sufficient conditions for an epidemic to spread easily are investigated from the viewpoint of connectivity of matroid induced by the formal context, connectivity of a relevant graph, and matroid approximation operators.

These genes govern cell type formation (tissue formation). However, regulatory mechanism among these genes are not clear. In this paper, we infer gene regulatory effects for tissue formation to reveal gene regulatory mechanism based on state-of-the-art single-cell resolution data. Specifically, we disdose the gene regulatory mechanism about pha-4 gene, a gene highly related to pharynx formation, in Caenorhabditis elegans. We quantify pha-4 gene expression at cellular level to supervise the process of pharynx tissue development. Two types of data, wild-type data and mutant data, are exploited in our experiment. Wild-type data is pha-4 gene expression data under normal development condition, while mutant data represents the gene expression data under abnormal development condition which means perturbation (gene knockdown) of some other genes. By comparing these two types of data based on two statistical hypothesis tests pipelines, gene regulatory effects have been investigated. In total, we have inferred gene knockdown effects of 579 genes. 74 of them possess either activating or inhibiting effect on pha-4 gene. Finally, gene regulatory networks of pharynx tissue formation in C. elegans have been constructed based on these inferred gene effect results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340936","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340936","cell fate;cell lineage tracing;gene expression;gene regulatory network;single-cell resolution data","","biology computing;cellular biophysics;genetics;statistical testing","Caenorhabditis elegans;abnormal development condition;biological process;cell differentiation;cell fate determination;cell type formation;cellular level;embryo development;gene knockdown effect;gene regulatory effects inference;gene regulatory mechanism;gene regulatory network;mutant data;perturbation;pha-4 gene expression data;pharynx formation;pharynx tissue development;pharynx tissue formation;single-cell resolution data;statistical hypothesis tests pipeline;wild-type data","","","","13","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper selects five parameters as the reference standard for image quality assessment, including effective region size, contrast, definition, geometric deviation and rotation angle. Based on the average slope of relation curve displayed about image quality versus recognition rate, this paper proposes a novel method to determine the optical weights for these five parameters.

Monitoring social media, forums, blogs and other online resources for customer reviews, product competition and survey responses to understand customer insight is of significant importance in business analytics. With the proliferation of informal user generated data online, the use of mixed language has become a common phenomenon. Mixed language arises through the use of linguistic code switching (LCS) or the practice of using more than one language in a single sentence. Such mixed language has rarely been a subject of sentiment analysis before. The lack of a clear grammatical structure renders the previous approaches to sentiment analysis ineffective for such text. In this paper, we propose a strategy to determine the sentiment of sentences written in a mixed language comprising of Hindi and English lexicons. Our technique can be used to analyze the sentiment of data belonging to any one of the source languages as well as the mixed language data. Grammatical transitions which are very common in mixed language have been taken into account during the sentiment analysis.
