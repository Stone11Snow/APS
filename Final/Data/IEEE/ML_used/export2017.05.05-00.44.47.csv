Firstly, the HPCDS can mirror the multi-CD with multi CD drives in parallel, improving the slowly - mirroring speed for a single CD drive; secondly, the HPCDS enhances the utilizing efficiency of the I/O resource and the CPU resource by a parallel mirroring and compressing algorithm, instead of mirroring and compressing to occupy the system I/O resource and CPU resource respectively which may greatly affect the system I/O performance; thirdly, the HPCDS greatly improves the file I/O speed by the direct data access (Zero Copy) between the device controller and the user-level memory.

Secondly, we try to consider scans detection problem through the eye of a network on the basis of above dataset. A 3 layers scan detection network is constructed where the node of every layer is source-IP, destination-IP and resource (the couple {destination port, protocol}), the link is the scan access connection between nodes. The scan detection network owns good features of layer and single-direction. A degree statistics method is put forward to grade the importance of nodes of the scan detection network and give proper warnings. By using a degree statistics method on honeypot dataset we can focus on the research of scan sources' behaviors and stand out what's really worthy of noticing and warning instead of staying at the procedure of identifying whether a source is a scanner or not.

The differences and similarities between TDP and PCA are also analyzed and presented. Furthermore, local-TDP approach is proposed to perform face recognition. Local-TDP aims to draw local characteristic of face images. Especially, local-TDP appears to be beneficial to weaken the side effect on face recognition of varying imaging conditions. The possible reason is that the varying imaging conditions mainly bring strong difference for parts of the image, while the influence on other parts is little. As a result, the similarity between the extracted local features of two face images of one individual may become larger in comparison with holistic features of face images.

This causes model uncertainties since those terms generally are time-variable, and system dependent. The boundary conditions set by tip-load, hub inertia, friction, rotatory inertia, and shear force also impact beam dynamics, which make the model implementation more complicated for the purpose of real-time control.

The method is motivated that the annulus is intuitively rotation invariant, then combined with the centralization and normalization of the images, the AED is variant to affine transformation (AT). The key advantage of this distance is that it is a simple and tractable way to measure the difference between images with some deformations. Some examples in optical character recognition (OCR) and texture retrieval are presented to show the power of the AED.

The neural network model predicts control (NNMPC) uses NNIM to predict future response to potential control signals of the FTGS. An optimization algorithm then computes the control signals that optimize future FTGS performance. The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train the FTNNM and the NNIM. The convergence speed of the offline training is fast and the accuracy of the model is high.
