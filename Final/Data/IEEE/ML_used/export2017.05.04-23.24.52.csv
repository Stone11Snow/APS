Currently, no intelligent system has been used in terms of managing sickle cell disease. However, this paper presents a system that facilitates a shift from manual methods to automated approach that can offer fast data collection with a reduced error rate. The system will be able to examine patient data and provide a suitable amount of Hydroxycarbamide drugs/liquid for each patient. By using a web-based system, we tend to improve patient welfare and mitigate patient illness before it gets worse over time, particularly with elderly people. The system will forward any critical concerns from the patient, it generates an automatic message to the medical doctors based on web-based platform in order to assist them with optimal decision-making. The initial case study that has been addressed in this project is how to make predictions for sickle cell disease for the amount of dose based on different architectures of machine learning in order to obtain high accuracy and performance. The most significant key for making predictions of the amount of medication is to enable healthcare organisation to provide accurate therapy recommendations based on previous data. The results using ANN showed that the proposed network produces significant improvements using the different evaluation methods. In our experiments, The MLP algorithm produced the best result in terms of the lowest error rates compare with other techniques.

The blood vessels in the retina get altered and have abnormality. Exudates are secreted, micro-aneurysms and haemorrhages occur in the retina. The appearance of these features represents the degree of severity of the disease. Early detection of diabetic retinopathy plays a major role in the success of such disease treatment. The main challenge is to extract exudates which are similar in colour property and size of the optic disk, and then micro-aneurysms are similar in colour and proximity with blood vessels. The main objective of the paper is to develop a computer aided detection system to find the abnormality of retinal imaging and detects the presence of abnormality features from retinal fundus images. There is few existing research works have been undergone by applying machine learning techniques, but existing approaches have not achieved a good accuracy of detection and they have not yielded successful performance in different datasets. The proposed methodology is to enhance the image and filter the noise, detect blood vessel and identify the optic disc, extract the exudates and micro aneurysms, extract the features and classify different stages of diabetic retinopathy into mild, moderate, severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative Diabetic retinopathy (PDR) by using proposed machine learning methods.

Killer tasks cause unnecessary resource wasting and significant increase of scheduling workloads, which can be a big concern in cloud systems. We aim to recognize killer tasks at the very early stage of their occurrence so that they can be addressed proactively instead of being rescheduled repeatedly, so as to promote reliability and save resources. To recognize killer tasks from a large amount of tasks in real time is really challenging. In this paper, we first investigate characteristics and behavior patterns of killer tasks and then develop two machine learning based methods, K-HUNTER and C-HUNTER, for online recognition of killer tasks.

Misuse detection detects intrusions by matching the network traffic with a database of stored signatures and anomaly detection looks for behavior deviating from normal or common behavior for detecting intrusions. The primary objective of this paper is to combine both these techniques. The KDD dataset is used for this purpose. Finally, the data is processed by classification algorithms to obtain the results.

In this paper, we propose a method to dynamically choose the learning rate by reducing RCERR properly.

"Machine learning anomaly detection in large systems","J. Murphree","DRS Technologies, Huntsville, AL","2016 IEEE AUTOTESTCON","20161013","2016","","","1","9","We have a need for methods to efficiently determine the health of a system. Diagnostics and prognostics determine system heath through analysis of data from sensors. Anomalies in the data can help us determine if there is a failure or a pending failure. There are common statistical methods to detect anomalies in individual measurements. For systems with many measurements, the anomalies may occur as specific combinations of values. Large systems have various associated states and modes which define the valid measurements. The amount of data to analyze grows very quickly as the system becomes more complex. In recent years techniques have been developed to address large data analysis. Machine Learning encompasses a broad selection of tools to optimize a statistical model of the data. These tools include supervised learning techniques, such as linear regression and logistic regression, in which training data exists to tune the model. Unsupervised learning, such as clustering, is used to explore data which does not have a defined output label associated with inputs data. Standard approaches to training supervised learning systems require a large sample of positive and negative outcome data. Some uses of machine learning involve data where there are very few cases of negative outcomes. There are machine learning algorithms defined as Anomaly Detection which are designed to deal with this type of data. Simple algorithms include Gaussian Distribution Analysis, which assumes independence in distributions of data. Large Systems with anomalies defined in the dependent combinations of data require either a manual creation of combinations of independent variables, or Multivariate Gaussian Distribution Analysis, which does not scale well for large systems. A further complication is the mixture of linear and discrete data. Neural Networks are a type of learning system which has been applied to each of the individual needs addressed above. This paper describes an approach to anoma- y detection using neural networks for the specific problems in large systems to efficiently determine system health.","","","10.1109/AUTEST.2016.7589589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7589589","Anomaly Detection;Large Systems;Machine Learning;Neural Networks;Sparse Autoencoder","Correlation;Data models;Neural networks;Performance evaluation;Sensors;Supervised learning;Training data","data analysis;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program diagnostics","anomaly detection;data analysis;diagnostics;failure;large systems;learning system;machine learning;neural networks;prognostics;sensors;statistical methods;system health","","","","","","","12-15 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A survey on lectures was carried out as part of FD activities and used for improving lectures based on lecture evaluation and satisfaction from students. However, it is difficult to give an objective evaluation of this text data since these subjects of evaluation are wide-ranging, such as expectations towards lectures or opinions on teachers. An aggregation of the opinions gained through surveys also has its limits for manual assessment because of the heavy artificial costs and time costs required. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate all comments given in a survey. For this reason there has been extensive research done in recent years on categorizing evaluation texts and documents through evaluation expression of words and machine learning. There has been related research estimating the sentiment polarity of the entirety of the writing using both positives and negatives that appear within, as well as research that extracts elements of evaluation information and measures its sentiment polarity. Machine learning for writing categorization has also achieved a high level of accuracy, with research existing which uses the Naive Bayes Classifier and a Support Vector Machine. This report uses actual open ended responses to surveys to describe a method for re-evaluating a comment by estimating the evaluation of words within comments from a comment evaluation done through machine learning, as well as a method that uses a dictionary of emotional words to attach a polarity value to vocabulary and estimate the evaluation of the body of a comment from that value.

The FARSEEING project has compiled a database of real life falls from elderly people, to gain new knowledge about fall events and to develop fall detection algorithms to combat the problems associated with falls. We have extracted 12 different kinematic, temporal and kinetic related features from a data-set of 89 real-world falls and 368 activities of daily living. Using the extracted features we applied machine learning techniques and produced a selection of algorithms based on different feature combinations. The best algorithm employs 10 different features and produced a sensitivity of 0.88 and a specificity of 0.87 in classifying falls correctly.

Although machine learning techniques have been utilized for vegetation parameters estimation and disease detection, the effects of disease symptoms on their performances have been less considered. Hence, this paper investigated on 1) using partial least square regression (PLSR), v support vector regression (v-SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods for wheat leaf rust disease detection, 2) evaluating the impact of training sample size on the results, 3) the influence of disease symptoms effects on the predictions performances of the above-mentioned methods, and 4) comparisons between the performances of SVIs and machine learning techniques. In this study, the spectra of the infected and non infected leaves in different disease symptoms were measured using a non imaging spectroradiometer in the electromagnetic region of 350 to 2500 nm. In order to produce a ground truth dataset, we employed photos of a digital camera to compute the disease severity and disease symptoms fractions. Then, different sample sizes of collected datasets were utilized to train each method. PLSR showed coefficient of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) values of 0.98 (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.6) and 0.92 (RMSE = 0.11) at leaf and canopy, respectively. SVR showed R<sup>2</sup> and RMSE close to PLSR at leaf (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98, RMSE = 0.05) and canopy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95, RMSE = 0.12) scales. GPR showed R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.98 (RMSE = 0.03) and 0.97 (RMSE = 0.11) at leaf and canopy scale, respectively. Moreover, GPR represents better performances than others using small training sample size. The results represent that the machine learning techniques in contrast to SVIs are not sensitive to different disease symptoms and their results are reliable.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2016.2575360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7533506","$nu$ support vector regression $(nu$-SVR);Disease severity;Gaussian process regression (GPR);PLSR;disease symptoms;hyperspectral measurement;plant disease;wheat leaf rust (WLR)","Diseases;Ground penetrating radar;Hyperspectral sensors;Support vector machines;Training;Vegetation mapping","Gaussian processes;diseases;hyperspectral imaging;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;remote sensing;vegetation","Gaussian process regression;digital camera;disease severity detection;disease stage;disease symptom;hyperspectral measurement;machine learning regression technique;partial least square regression;plant spectral characteristics;spectral vegetation index;spectroradiometer;support vector regression;vegetation parameter estimation;wheat leaf rust disease detection","","1","","","","20160804","Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Timeliness managing ELM is proposed by incorporating timeliness management scheme into ELM. When using the timeliness managing ELM scheme to predict hidden dangers, newly incremental data could be added prior to the historical data to maximize the contribution of the newly incremental training data, because the incremental data may be able to contribute reasonable weights to represent the current production situation according to practical analysis of accidents in some industrial productions.

The ability of machines to ""learn"" and do predictive analysis is very important in this era of big data and it has a wide range of application areas. For instance, banks and financial institutions are sometimes faced with the challenge of what risk factors to consider when advancing credit/loans to customers. For several features/attributes of the customers are normally taken into consideration, but most of these features have little predictive effect on the credit worthiness or otherwise of the customer. Furthermore, a robust and effective automated bank credit risk score that can aid in the prediction of customer credit worthiness very accurately is still a major challenge facing many banks. In this paper, we examine a real bank credit data and conduct several machine learning algorithms on the data for comparative analysis and to choose which algorithms are the best fit for learning bank credit data. The algorithms gave over 80% accuracy in prediction. Furthermore, the most important features that determine whether a customer will default or otherwise in paying his/her credit the next month are extracted from a total of 23 features. We then applied these most important features on some selected machine learning algorithms and compare their predictive accuracy with the other algorithms that used all the 23 features. The results show no significant di erence, signifying that these features can accurately determine the credit worthiness of the customers.

However, these descriptors are hand-crafted and require intensive human intervention with prior knowledge. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely circle convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CCRBM), for unsupervised 3D local feature learning. CCRBM is specially designed to learn from raw 3D representations. It effectively overcomes obstacles such as irregular vertex topology, orientation ambiguity on the 3D surface, and rigid or slightly non-rigid transformation invariance in the hierarchical learning of 3D data that cannot be resolved by the existing deep learning models. Specifically, by introducing the novel circle convolution, CCRBM holds a novel ring-like multi-layer structure to learn 3D local features in a structure preserving manner. Circle convolution convolves across 3D local regions via rotating a novel circular sector convolution window in a consistent circular direction. In the process of circle convolution, extra points are sampled in each 3D local region and projected onto the tangent plane of the center of the region. In this way, the projection distances in each sector window are employed to constitute a novel local raw 3D representation called projection distance distribution (PDD). In addition, to eliminate the initial location ambiguity of a sector window, the Fourier transform modulus is used to transform the PDD into the Fourier domain, which is then conveyed to CCRBM. Experiments using the learned local features are conducted on three aspects: global shape retrieval, partial shape retrieval, and shape correspondence. The experimental results show that the learned local features outperform other state-of-the-art 3D shape descriptors.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2605920","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7559748","3D shapes;Circle convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine;deep learning;fourier transform modulus;geometry processing;projection distance distribution","Convolution;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Shape;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","Boltzmann machines;Fourier transforms;convolution;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image representation;image retrieval;unsupervised learning","3D local regions;3D shape descriptors;CCRBM;Fourier transform modulus;PDD;circle convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine;consistent circular direction;deep learning model;global shape retrieval;local feature extraction;novel circular sector convolution window;novel local raw 3D representation;novel ring-like multilayer structure;partial shape retrieval;projection distance distribution;shape correspondence;unsupervised 3D local feature learning","","","","","","20160902","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for class-imbalanced FD problems. We evaluate the performance of three sampling-based algorithms, four ensemble algorithms, four instance-based algorithms, and two support vector machine algorithms. Two experiments were conducted to compare algorithm performance using etching process data and chemical vapor deposition process data.

Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) can help reduce the traffic collisions at intersections by sending warning messages to the vehicles. However, the performance of VANETs should be enhanced to guarantee delivery of the messages, particularly safety messages to the destination. Data congestion control is an efficient way to decrease packet loss and delay and increase the reliability of VANETs. In this paper, a centralized and localized data congestion control strategy is proposed to control data congestion using roadside units (RSUs) at intersections. The proposed strategy consists of three units for detecting congestion, clustering messages, and controlling data congestion. In this strategy, the channel usage level is measured to detect data congestion in the channels. The messages are gathered, filtered, and then clustered by machine learning algorithms. K-means algorithm clusters the messages based on message size, validity of messages, and type of messages. The data congestion control unit determines appropriate values of transmission range and rate, contention window size, and arbitration interframe spacing for each cluster. Finally, RSUs at the intersections send the determined communication parameters to the vehicles stopped before the red traffic lights to reduce communication collisions. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves the delay, throughput, and packet loss ratio in comparison with other congestion control strategies using the proposed congestion control strategy.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2546555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458837","$K$-means algorithm;Congestion control;machine learning algorithms;quality of service;vehicular ad hoc networks","Delays;Machine learning algorithms;Quality of service;Reliability;Roads;Safety;Vehicles","control engineering computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;vehicular ad hoc networks","K-means algorithm;RSU;VANET;centralized data congestion control strategy;channel usage level;congestion control strategy;data congestion detection;localized data congestion control strategy;machine learning clustering algorithm;roadside units;vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","20160425","Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Among aging mechanisms, Negative-Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is the main limiting factor of circuits lifetime. Estimating the effect of aging-related degradation, before it actually occurs, is crucial for developing aging prevention/mitigations actions to avoid circuit failures. In this paper, we propose a general-purpose IC aging prognosis approach by considering a comprehensive set of IC operating conditions including workload, usage time and operating temperature. In addition, our model considers process variation by using a calibration technique applied at the time of manufacturing. Experimental results confirms that our model is able to accurately predict the NBTI-related path delay degradation under various operating conditions.

Firstly, we extract the five hardware-Trojan features in each net in a netlist. Secondly, since we cannot effectively give the simple and fixed threshold values to them to detect hardware Trojans, we represent them to be a five-dimensional vector and learn them by using SVM. Finally, we can successfully classify a set of all the nets in an unknown netlist into Trojan ones and normal ones based on the learned SVM classifier. We have applied our SVM-based hardware-Trojan classification method to Trust-HUB benchmarks and the results demonstrate that our method can much increase the true positive rate compared to the existing state-of-the-art results in most of the cases. In some cases, our method can achieve the true positive rate of 100%, which shows that all the Trojan nets in a netlist are completely detected by our method.","","","10.1109/IOLTS.2016.7604700","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7604700","gate-level netlist;hardware Trojan;machine learning;static detection;support vector machine (SVM)","Benchmark testing;Feature extraction;Hardware;Integrated circuits;Logic gates;Support vector machines;Trojan horses","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","IC products;SVM-based hardware-Trojan classification;five-dimensional vector;gate-level netlists;hardware Trojans classification;hardware-Trojan infected nets;learned SVM classifier;machine learning;malicious third-party vendors;support vector machine;trust-HUB benchmarks","","","","","","","4-6 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the objective of this research is to predict whether the patient has teeth periapical lesion or not and its type using machine learning techniques.

Moreover, the relationships between the features of the original and the target spaces are more difficult to uncover. Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) are used for approximating nonlinear manifold learning methods in two ways: as a functional representation for implicit methods, and as simpler surrogate models for explicit mapping techniques. In the context of Haptic handwritten signatures, five implicit and explicit nonlinear transformation methods are investigated. In all cases it was found that ELM approximations to the mappings obtained with the original methods exhibit very good behavior and can be used either as functional representations for the implicit methods or as simpler surrogate models for explicit techniques.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2016.7727568","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7727568","","Aerospace electronics;Data visualization;Electronic mail;Haptic interfaces;Manifolds;Mobile handsets;Neural networks","data mining;data reduction;formal verification;handwriting recognition;haptic interfaces;identification technology;learning (artificial intelligence)","ELM approximations;complex computation;data mining;dimensional data generation;dimensionality reduction techniques;explicit mapping techniques;extreme learning machines;haptic handwritten signatures;haptics devices;implicit method functional representation;kinesthetic feedback;machine learning;mobile devices;nonlinear dimensionality reduction mappings approximation;nonlinear manifold learning method approximation;nonlinear transformations;surrogate models;tactile feedback;user identification;user verification;visualization","","","","","","","24-29 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that random forest (RF) and CSRF are useful methods for identifying patients likely to have a positive head CT scan. The proposed algorithm has superior diagnostic accuracy in comparison to the Canadian head CT algorithm, which is currently the most accurate and widely used algorithm for determining which TBI patients need a head CT scan. In the highest sensitivity (i.e. 100%), our method outperforms the Canadian rule in terms of specificity, accuracy and area under ROC curve using cost sensitive classifier.

Many data mining and machine learning methods do not handle heterogeneity well, requiring variables of the same type, information completeness (or imputation), also assuming no imprecision. Extreme learning machines (ELM) are very interesting computational algorithms because of their structural simplicity, their good performance and their speed. Accordingly, extending their scope by making them capable of processing heterogeneous information may increase their attractiveness as a modeling tool for addressing complex problems. ELMs are discussed in the context of heterogeneous data and approaches to build ELMs capable of performing classification and regression tasks in such cases are presented.

Given an AS graph derived from publicly available data source, we use the Gentle AdaBoost machine learning algorithm to train a classifier that classifies the edge types (p2c and p2p) based on a set of node features. We use our method to train classifiers for three AS graphs derived from different data sources-a BGP graph, a traceroute graph, and an IRR graph.

The purpose of on-line condition monitoring of cables or any electrical equipment is to predict possible failures before they actually occur. With phenomenal growth of distribution network even to remote areas, the traditional methods of inspecting the lines by foot-patrolling and pole-climbing to check them in close proximity do not seem to be viable. Since the damaged insulators of the distribution system affects the performance of distribution system significantly in terms of reduction in voltage, aerial patrolling has been adopted in developed countries for the purpose of insulator monitoring.

Firstly, a few features are extracted and divided into three sets for every application. Then, these three feature sets are embedded in the corresponding joint vector spaces and we can get apps's feature vectors. After that, feature vectors of every vector space are classified using a machine learning algorithm. Finally, the three classification results are considered as a group and embedded in a new space and classified again. We evaluate our detection with 3427 malicious samples and 1550 benign applications.

This offers very high flexibility for the geometrical design of the sheet metal workpieces. One of the major drawbacks of incremental sheet forming processes is the low geometrical accuracy, which limits the widespread industrial application of these. Responding to these constraints, the authors propose the application of machine learning techniques to increase the geometric accuracy in incremental sheet forming processes.

Off-grid electrification (such as solar home systems and micro-grids) are particularly applicable to the rural African context, where little infrastructure exists and in many regions grid extension is prohibitively expensive. To be economically viable, these systems must maximize the power delivered while ensuring the health of energy storage devices. Batteries in particular are a key weakness and typically the first major component to fail. In this paper we present an improved and simplified method for simulating the state of charge (SoC) and state of health (SoH) of lithium-ion batteries. SoC and SoH are predicted using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) algorithm.

To develop effective SGA prediction models, we conducted four groups of experiments that considered basic ML methods, imbalanced data, feature selection and the time characteristics of variables, respectively. Infants with SGA data collected from 2010 to 2013 with gestational weeks between 24 and 42 were detected. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR) and Sparse LR models were trained on 10-fold cross validation. Precision and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve were evaluated. For each group, the performance of SVM and Sparse LR was similarly well. LR without any sparsity penalties performed worst, possibly caused by the overfitting problem. With the combination of handling imbalanced data and feature selection, the RF ensemble classifier performed best, which even obtained the highest AUC value (0.8547) with the help of expert knowledge.

The volume of images and the altitude from which they are taken makes manually identifying potential items of interest, like clothing or other man-made material, a difficult task. For this reason, we created a program that automatically detects unusually-colored objects in aerial imagery in order to assist responders in locating signs of missing persons. The program uses the Reed-Xiaoli (RX) spectral anomaly detection algorithm to determine which pixels in an image are anomalous and then generates an ""anomaly map"" where brighter pixels signify greater abnormality. While the RX algorithm has previously been proposed for search and rescue missions, up until now it has not been evaluated in a high-fidelity setting with real responders and real equipment. We tested the program on 150 aerial images taken over the Blanco River area in Hays County, Texas after the May 2015 flooding and demonstrated the results at a workshop on flooding hosted by Texas A&M's Center for Emergency Informatics.

Despite being common, its diagnosis is extremely difficult and requires extensive experience in the domain. In this research paper, we provide an approach to detect various kinds of these diseases. We use a dual stage approach which effectively combines Computer Vision and Machine Learning on clinically evaluated histopathological attributes to accurately identify the disease. In the first stage, the image of the skin disease is subject to various kinds of pre-processing techniques followed by feature extraction. The second stage involves the use of Machine learning algorithms to identify diseases based on the histopathological attributes observed on analysing of the skin.

But the recommendations from these systems do not change on inputs beyond user and item profile and transaction data. There have been some attempts in the past to optimize on more varied data in recommenders, example of which is the location based recommenders. But location is just one dimension of the state that a user could have shared with GPS/GLONASS/BaiDeu sensor available in most Smartphones. With an upcoming era of Smart-wears and pervasive IoTs, there are a lot many other dimensions of a user state which can be utilized to optimize upon the concept of Optimal State Recommender Solutions. This paper suggests upgrading from conventional recommendations that are based on user/ item preferences alone with systems that provide the best recommendation at the most optimal state when the user is most receptive to accept the recommendation, the “optimal state recommendation solution” and proposes solutions and architectures to overcome the challenges of dealing with real time, distributed machine learning on IoT scale data in implementing this solution. The paper leverages some of the advance distributed machine learning algorithms like variants of Distributed Kalman Filters, Distributed Alternating Least Square Recommenders, Distributed Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based Classifiers, and highly scalable distributed computation and machine learning platforms like Apache Spark, (Apache) Spark MLlib, Spark Streaming, Python/PySpark, R/SparkR, Apache Kafka in an high performance, distributed, fault tolerant architecture.

In this paper, we propose a new symbolic execution tool MLB to handle such problem. Instead of relying on the classical constraint solving, in MLB, the feasibility problems of the path conditions are transformed into optimization problems, by minimizing some dissatisfaction degree. The optimization problems are then handled by the underlying optimization solver through machine learning guided sampling and validation. MLB is implemented on the basis of Symbolic PathFinder and encodes not only the simple linear path conditions, but also nonlinear arithmetic operations, and even black-box function calls of library methods, into symbolic path conditions. Experiment results show that MLB can achieve much better coverage on complex real-world programs.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7582790","Complicated Path Condition;Constraint Solving;Machine Learning;Symbolic Execution","Algorithm design and analysis;Engines;Java;Libraries;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization;Transforms","arithmetic;constraint handling;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;program diagnostics","MLB;black-box function calls;complex path conditions;complex program;constraint solvers;constraint solving;dissatisfaction degree;library methods;linear path conditions;machine learning;nonlinear arithmetic operations;nonlinear constraints;optimization problems;optimization solver;program analysis;symbolic PathFinder;symbolic execution tool;symbolic path conditions","","","","","","","3-7 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The differences of the model performances among different kernel functions were found to be small for areas with simple planting structure. For areas where multiple crop types have similar phenology cycles, the non-linear model of ANN was found to perform the best.

The critical issue here is to monitor the health of the plants and detection of the respective diseases. Studies show that most of the plant disease can be diagnosed from the properties of the leaf. Thus leaf based disease analysis for plants is an exciting new domain. The technique proposed for identification of plant disease through the leaf texture analysis and pattern recognition. In this work we focus on Grapes plant leaf disease detection system. The system takes a single leaf of a plant as an input and segmentation is performed after background removal. The segmented leaf image is then analyzed through high pass filter to detect the diseased part of the leaf. The segmented leaf texture is retrieved using unique fractal based texture feature. Fractal based features are locally invariant in nature and therefore provides a good texture model. The texture of every independent disease will be different. The extracted texture pattern is then classified using multiclass SVM. The work classifies focus on major diseases commonly observed in Grapes plant which are downy mildew & black rot.

Using Big Data analytics, machine learning and recommender system on the student data and activity would provide them with useful information and suggestions which would help them gain knowledge and make proper decisions to make their future in right direction. This can be implemented by creating a social-cum-educational portal with recommender systems, also data can be generated and displayed on the same place after analysis through recommenders. There is large amount of social, educational information generated on a rapid basis on the web which can be analysed and used for the betterment of the students and also the analysed information can be provided to the students based on their interests. Specific information to specific student can be provided. Use of such technology can reduce the gap between students and the information which can lead to their inherent development and success!

The innovative approach in this paper is to build and simulate an accelerator that reduces learning to find the exact minimum expression of all 3n Kronecker Reed Muller (KRO) forms of a Boolean function with n input variables. This is in contrast to the previously studied quantum algorithm for the Fixed Polarity Reed-Muller forms (FPRM) which only selects from 2n possible forms. The algorithm, based on repeated application of a ternary Grover's Quantum Search algorithm, was simulated to find the minimum KRO form using a hybrid ternary/binary quantum oracle.

Fault modes in system DRAM are a frequently-investigated key aspect of memory reliability. While current schemes require offline analysis for proper classification, current state-of-the-art mitigation techniques require accurate online prediction for optimal performance. In this work, we explore the predictive performance of an online machine learning-based approach in classifying DRAM fault modes from two leadership-class supercomputing facilities. Our results compare the predictive performance of this online approach with the current rule-based approach based on expert knowledge, finding a 12% predictive performance improvement. We also investigate the universality of our classifiers by evaluating predictive performance using training data from disparate computing systems to achieve a 7% improvement in predictive performance. Our work provides a critical analysis of this online learning technique and can benefit system designers to help inform best practices for dealing with reliability on future systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3688-2; POD:978-1-5090-3689-9","10.1109/DSN-W.2016.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575388","fault characterization;fault models;machine learning;supervised classification","Error correction codes;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Random access memory;Reliability engineering;Supercomputers","DRAM chips;electronic engineering computing;fault tolerant computing;integrated circuit reliability;learning (artificial intelligence);mainframes;parallel processing;pattern classification;performance evaluation","DRAM fault characterization;DRAM fault mode classification;high-performance computing systems;memory reliability;online machine learning-based approach;online optimal performance prediction;predictive performance evaluation;predictive performance improvement;supercomputing facilities","","","","","","","June 28 2016-July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our scheme uses a server-managed challenge/response pair (CRP) lockdown protocol: unlike prior approaches, an adaptive chosen-challenge adversary with machine learning capabilities cannot obtain new CRPs without the server's implicit permission. The adversary is faced with the problem of deriving a PUF model with a limited amount of machine learning training data. Our system-level approach allows a so-called strong PUF to be used for lightweight authentication in a manner that is heuristically secure against today's best machine learning methods through a worst-case CRP exposure algorithmic validation. We also present a degenerate instantiation using a weak PUF that is secure against computationally unrestricted adversaries, which includes any learning adversary, for practical device lifetimes and read-out rates. We validate our approach using silicon PUF data, and demonstrate the feasibility of supporting 10, 1,000, and 1M authentications, including practical configurations that are not learnable with polynomial resources, e.g., the number of CRPs and the attack runtime, using recent results based on the probably-approximately-correct (PAC) complexity-theoretic framework.","","","10.1109/TMSCS.2016.2553027","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7450665","Physical unclonable function;authentication;computationally unrestricted adversary;heuristic security;machine learning;probably approximately correct (PAC) learning","Authentication;Cryptography;Manufacturing;Protocols;Servers;Silicon","computational complexity;cryptographic protocols","PAC complexity-theoretic framework;adaptive chosen-challenge adversary;challenge-response pair lockdown protocol;computationally unrestricted adversaries;lightweight PUF-based authentication;physically unclonable functions;probably-approximately-correct complexity-theoretic framework;server-managed CRP lockdown protocol;worst-case CRP exposure algorithmic validation","","","","","","20160411","July-Sept. 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, we will propose a Machine Learning (ML) based approach to estimate the length of the CPU-bursts for processes. The proposed approach aims to select the most significant attributes of the process using feature selection techniques and then predicts the CPU-burst for the process in the grid. ML techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Decision Trees (DT) are used to test and evaluate the proposed approach using a grid workload dataset named ""GWA-T-4 Auver Grid"". The experimental results show that there is a strength linear relationship between the process attributes and the burst CPU time. Moreover, K-NN performs better in nearly all approaches in terms of CC and RAE.

Machine-learning researchers themselves acknowledge that the progress observed in the past 10 years has been largely due to rapid increase in computing performance, allowing to tackle larger neural networks and larger training sets. So the computer systems and circuits communities can play a very significant role in enabling future progress. While GPUs have been a major driver of this recent progress, both the slowing rate of improvement of standard CMOS technology and the need for even faster progress suggest to at least explore alternative approaches.

To achieve this, we need to search the web for existing data pertaining location. A web crawler (Google search engine) generates the web pages based on the location keyword given by the user and maintaining the index of the web pages and the proposed system passes it to the Hadoop environment. For further simplification, the name node transfers the index group of web pages to different data nodes for extraction of spatial information from the dynamic web documents that we gather using machine learning process. Each data node is then utilized for the generation of a common template. The common template allows the extraction of location based spatial information from the dynamic web documents and media services. Resultant information from the data node is further merged using map reduce algorithms and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is produced which is then converted to Geo-Java Script Object Notation (JSON) format, thus aiding in the task of visualizing the extracted information on the GIS client.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7724541","Geographical Information Systems;HDFS;Hadoop;JSCON;Web Mining","Crawlers;Data mining;Data visualization;File systems;Hospitals;Spatial databases;Web pages","Big Data;Java;data handling;data mining;document handling;geographic information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;social networking (online)","Facebook;Flickr;GIS;HDFS;Hadoop distributed file system;JSON;Twitter;Web crawler;Web documents;data pertaining location;gazetteers;geo big data;geo-Java script object notation format;geographical information system client;location keyword;machine learning technique;media services;rich volunteered information mining;spatial information","","","","","","","16-18 March 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Internet of things, digitization and globalization are pushing continuous growth in the integration market. However, setting up integration systems today is still largely a manual endeavor. Most probably, future integration will need to leverage more automation in order to keep up with demand. This paper presents a first version of a system that uses tools from artificial intelligence and machine learning to ease the integration of information systems, aiming to automate parts of it. Three models are presented and evaluated for precision and recall using data from real, past, integration projects. The results show that it is possible to obtain F<sub>0.5</sub> scores in the order of 80% for models trained on a particular kind of data, and in the order of 60%-70% for less specific models trained on a several kinds of data. Such models would be valuable enablers for integration brokers to keep up with demand, and obtain a competitive advantage. Future work includes fusing the results from the different models, and enabling continuous learning from an operational production system.","","","10.1109/EDOCW.2016.7584357","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7584357","","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data integration;Data models;Semantics;Training data","Internet of Things;data integration;groupware;information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);project management","Internet of things;artificial intelligence;continuous learning;cross-enterprise collaboration;data integration;digitization;enterprise integration;globalization;information system integration;integration brokers;integration market;integration projects;machine learning;operational production system","","1","","","","","5-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Implementation of a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform for quantifying reduced arm swing in hemiplegie gait with machine learning classification by multilayer perceptron neural network","R.

People with hemiplegia can experience reduced arm swing, which can negatively impact the quality of gait. Wearable and wireless sensors, such as through a smartphone, have demonstrated the ability to quantify various features of gait. With a software application the smartphone (iPhone) can function as a wireless gyroscope platform capable of conveying a gyroscope signal recording as an email attachment by wireless connectivity to the Internet. The gyroscope signal recordings of the affected hemiplegic arm with reduced arm swing arm and the unaffected arm are post-processed into a feature set for machine learning. Using a multilayer perceptron neural network a considerable degree of classification accuracy is attained to distinguish between the affected hemiplegic arm with reduced arm swing arm and the unaffected arm.","1557-170X;1557170X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8","10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7591269","arm swing;feature set;hemiplegic gait;iPhone;machine learning;multilayer perceptron neural network;reduced arm swing;smartphone;wireless gyroscope","Biological neural networks;Gyroscopes;Multilayer perceptrons;Sensors;Software;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;body sensor networks;gait analysis;gyroscopes;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;multilayer perceptrons;neurophysiology;smart phones;telemedicine","Internet;gyroscope signal recording;hemiplegic arm;hemiplegie gait analysis;lower limb;machine learning classification;multilayer perceptron neural network;reduced arm swing quantification;rhythmic patterns;smartphone;synchronous patterns;upper limb;wearable sensors;wireless gyroscope platform;wireless sensors","","","","","","","16-20 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evolving Android malware behaves benign once it identifies Goldfish emulator, often used for app development and malware analysis. Once a malware identifies the Goldfish virtual device, it behaves benign or prevents malicious code execution. The exponential increase of such stealth malware necessitates a detection approach which coerces the malicious apps to reveal the hidden behavior. To detect malicious apps and characterize their association we propose MimeoDroid (enriched replica of real Android device), a modified virtual clone to coerce the malware to believe being executed on an actual device. We automate relevant feature extraction and classification of Processor, memory usage, Binder IPC transfers, network interaction, battery charging status and manifest permission(s) to detect malicious behavior using Tree based machine learning classifiers. MimeoDroid is a lightweight machine learning based malware analysis and characterization to detect malicious apps that would evade the existing analyzers.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3688-2; POD:978-1-5090-3689-9","10.1109/DSN-W.2016.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575351","","Androids;Cloning;Feature extraction;Humanoid robots;Malware;Proposals;Training","Android (operating system);learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","Android applications;Android malware;Binder IPC transfers;Goldfish emulator;Goldfish virtual device;MimeoDroid;actual device;battery charging status;cloned devices;exponential adoption;feature extraction;large scale dynamic App analysis;machine learning classifiers;malicious code execution;malware authors;manifest permission;network interaction;processor classification","","","","","","","June 28 2016-July 1 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Especially, using low-power cameras we can design interesting applications that provide us with previously difficult-to-capture information from the real-world. While cameras hold privacy threats in human-residing environments, they can be actively used in natural world analyzing applications. However, the disadvantage of using cameras is that the samples themselves (e.g., images) have large sizes, forcing the system to exchange more data, and in turn, decreasing energy efficiency. Given that camera-based sensor networks are usually deployed in remote locations, the lifetime of individual devices become a major concern. In this work, we target to utilize machine-learning algorithms to characterize the context of images captured from a real-world deployments. Specifically, using images from the James Reserve bird nest deployment [1], we utilize and optimize machine learning algorithms to operate on embedded low-power, resource-limited platforms. Using both a systematic and algorithmic approach, our proposed systems architecture and algorithms hold the potential to reduce the amount of data to be transmitted by as much a eight-fold.","","","10.1109/RTCSA.2016.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579939","Image classification;Wireless Camera Sensor Networks","Birds;Cameras;Histograms;Machine learning algorithms;Servers;Systems architecture;Wireless sensor networks","cameras;embedded systems;energy conservation;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics;wireless sensor networks","James Reserve bird nest deployment;embedded low-power resource-limited platforms;energy efficiency;low-power cameras;machine learning-based image classification;privacy threats;wireless camera sensor networks","","","","","","","17-19 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
