In this model-free control system, the PID controller is designed to control a multi-model plant and the adaptive neuron is used to regulate the parameters of the PID controller on line. By self-learning and associative searching, the adaptive neuron can modify the PID controller parameters according to the dynamic characteristics of the plant.

During the expansion of the planning graph, each operator and each way of instantiating the preconditions of the operator to propositions in the previous level do not insert an action node if any two of its preconditions are labeled as mutex propositions. So the amount of nodes created is reduced. The algorithm is implemented in C.

In a word, our algorithm has very good performances as follows: (1) automatically selects the number of components, (2) avoids converging the boundary of the parameter space, (3) is less sensitive to initialization, (4) can fulfil simultaneously the parameters estimation and model selection in one algorithm, therefore, the computation efficiency is higher.

Now parsing languages other than English is an intensive research area. Head-driven model is one of the best English parsing models. It has been successfully applied to Czech but failed to outperform a base-line model in parsing German. This paper attempts to parse Chinese with head-driven model. Promising experimental results demonstrate that head-driven model works well for Chinese. We propose a hybrid parsing strategy, which combines head-driven model with a Chinese base phrases parsing model. The combined model not only improves the performance but also makes the parser space and time efficient.

An efficient multi-keyword spotting method based on the speech feature space trace matching is proposed. Let each template do the moving matching along test speech trace and take down each step's matched score. If the score is lower than the template threshold, write the matched score to the distance matrix. In consideration during the spotting, once some template matched successfully the next matching template is on the left part or the right part of the previous matched template, so the bi-tree recursively-created algorithm is adopted. Using this algorithm, each time find a lowest matched score in the distance matrix to create the bi-tree node, and then output the bi-tree, which is the spotting result. Compared to other methods, this method can greatly reduce the computation in spotting. Experiment shows the recognition rate for speaker-independent is 90.8% and for speaker-dependent is 97.8%, having considerable practicability.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380403","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380403","","Background noise;Computer science;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Mathematics;Monitoring;Neural networks;Speech recognition;Testing;Vocabulary","iterative methods;speech recognition;word processing","bitree recursively created algorithm;distance matrix;multikeyword spotting;speech feature space trace matching;template matched","","0","2","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Wilie in 1982, the equivalence relations to the intension of concepts and relative reduced intension [Hu Xuegang, 2000] was introduced to improve concept lattice to relative reduced extended concept lattice (RRECL). Due to the completeness of the RRECL, the cost of time and space is much larger in the construction of the RRECL. An EN-RRECL algorithm is presented in This work, which applies entropy theory to the RRECL to extract classification rules. The algorithm can simplify the RRECL's construction. From the simplified RRECL, we can extract classification rules which approximate to the one extracted from the not simplified the RRECL. The algorithm can cut the branches of the RRECL that are redundant for extracting classification rules, so the cost of time and space is reduced greatly.

It is of great importance in both theory and applications. First, a new and simple encoding scheme is designed. For TSP with (n+1) cities, the encoding scheme is to use an integer in [0,n!-1] to represent a valid tour and each integer is corresponding to unique valid tour, and vice versa. Thus, TSP can be transformed into a problem in which we shall look for an integer in [0,n!-1] such that the length of the corresponding tour is shortest. The most obvious advantage is that it is very easy to design easy-executed and efficient crossover and mutation operators. Second, a novel local search scheme is integrated into the crossover and mutation operators to enhance their ability of exploration. Based on these, a novel and effective evolutionary algorithm for TSP is proposed and its convergence to global optimal solution with probability one is proved. At last, the numerical experiments are made for five standard test problems. The best solutions found by the proposed algorithm are better than or equal to those found by the compared algorithms. These results indicate the proposed algorithm is efficient.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382221","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382221","","Biological cells;Cities and towns;Encoding;Evolutionary computation;Genetic mutations;Machine learning algorithms;Manufacturing;Research and development management;Testing;Traveling salesman problems","computational complexity;convergence;evolutionary computation;search problems;travelling salesman problems","NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem;evolutionary computation;global convergent hybrid evolutionary algorithm;global optimal solution;local search scheme;mutation operator;traveling salesman problem","","0","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, histograms of R, G, B component colors are segmented by adaptive threshold segmentation algorithm for gray image. Secondly, some possible colors of original image are specified through combining those components' segmented areas and false colors not appearing in image are removed. Finally those possible colors are converged to the main actual colors of original image by RPCL. Then original image is segmented by those learned centers. In the end the result of experiment on mobile robot CASIA-1 shows that the approach can adaptively segment a color image into several classes without specifying the number of initial classes in advance.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382235","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Color;Face recognition;Histograms;Image converters;Image recognition;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Merging","image colour analysis;image segmentation;mobile robots;pattern clustering;robot vision;unsupervised learning","CASIA-1;RGB space;color image adaptive segmentation;mobile robot;rival penalized competitive learning","","1","","14","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

EM algorithm is a normal method for parameter learning in incomplete data. The traditional EM algorithm has some shortages such as that could not deal with large data sets, convergence is slow and easily results in local maximum. This paper is based on E step and M step respectively. It divides large data set into several small blocks and optimizes them in the small ones. An improved simulating anneal algorithm is used in E step. Policy of dynamic iteration, starting temperature for simulating anneal and ending condition is proposed.

The set of frequent closed itemsets uniquely determines the exact frequency of all itemsets, yet it can be orders of magnitude smaller than the set of all frequent itemsets. An algorithm Closearcher based on formal concept analysis for closed itemset searching is proposed. This algorithm divides the whole search space of closed itemsets into several subspaces in accordance with criterions prescribed ahead, and introduces an efficient scheme to recognize the valid ones, in which the search for closed itemsets is bounded. An intermediate structure is employed to judge the validity of a subspace and search closed itemsets more efficiently. The algorithm is experimental evaluated and compared with the famous NextClosure algorithm proposed by Ganter for random generated data, as well as for real application data.

The empirical evidence shows that the CIR0 model, and CKLS0 model fit the interest rate data quite well. The CKLS0 model is the best among them to fit the data.

On the other hand, two concepts of case coverage and case reachability in CBR are used in selecting the representative documents. The main contribution of this paper is that both the number of features and the documents are reduced with minimal loss of useful information.

This paper presents a spatial outlier detection algorithm to overcome the disadvantages.
