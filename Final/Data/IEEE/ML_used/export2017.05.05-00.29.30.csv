Obviously, stand-alone system is unappeasable, we must use the cluster as the server that operate those services especially the important ones. At present, the major work-styles to improve HA (High Availability) are Hot Standby and Dual Active which can basically satisfy the demands of SMEs. But for the others like large servers what could provide many crucial services like Mail Service and database service, neither can well satisfy the demands, because a single minor failure may lead to many major losses in this case. A fast failure detection and failover HA system has been proposed, the system here is multi-active.

In contrast, it is difficult for a MLP to form closed circular or elliptic classification borders, and for RBFN to form open plane classification borders. Hence, MLP and RBFN have their own advantages and disadvantages in dealing with various classification problems. To combine their advantages, in this paper, we proposed a novel neural network, Hybrid Transfer Function Network (HTFN), whose hidden layer contains sigmoid and Gaussian units at the same time. Although there are two kinds of processing units in HTFN, in this study, we used the principle of minimizing error sum of squares to derive the supervised learning rules for all the network parameters. When HTFN contains only either sigmoid units or Gaussian units in its hidden layer, HTFN can be transferred into MLP and RBFN, respectively. Hence, MLP and RBFN can be considered as a special case of HTFN. To verify that HTFN is superior to MLP and RBFN, this study employed three man-made examples to test the three networks. The results showed that HTFN is more accurate than MLP and RBFN, confirming that combining sigmoid and Gaussian units into hidden layer can combine advantages of MLP and RBFN.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581096","Gaussian function;MLP;RBFN;Sigmoid function;Transform function","Artificial neural networks;Cybernetics;Input variables;Kernel;Machine learning;Testing;Transfer functions","Gaussian processes;boundary layers;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;radial basis function networks;transfer functions","Gaussian unit;MLP;RBF network;elliptic classification;hybrid transfer function network;multilayered perception;radial basis function network;sigmoid unit;supervised learning rules","","0","","8","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is necessary to represent human knowledge and modeling its uncertainty when developing an intelligent system. There are various types of uncertainty in the real world, and randomness and fuzziness are of two basic kinds. How to handle these two kinds of uncertainties appearing simultaneously in a system is a main task of intelligent system development. The Knowware System (KWS) has been developed as an intelligent tool for modeling and development of knowledge-based system (KBS). It is to support application developers in constructing customized hybrid intelligent system without the necessity of being familiar with relevant AI techniques. Modeling and processing uncertainty of different types has its significance for further enhancement of KWS mechanism to better support real applications.

Then, it generates the weights of the attributes “effect of accuracy rate”, “effect of time rate”, “importance” and “complexity”, respectively. Then, it generates the importance degrees of the attributes of questions based on the weights of the attributes. Then, it calculates the learning achievement indices of the students having the same total score.

The uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded. The transition of the jumping parameters is governed by a finite-state Markov process. The purpose is to design a linear state feedback controller which guarantees that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and has the different performance constraint corresponding to the different output channel. A sufficient condition for the existence of robust L<sub>1</sub>/H<sub>∞</sub> controller is given in terms of a group of LMIs. It is showed that this condition is equivalent to the feasible solution problem of LMI. Its solutions provide a parameterized representation of the controller. Furthermore, the controller design problem is converted into a convex optimization problem subject to LMI constraints, which can easily solved by standard numerical software.

Based on H-UCF, a probability frequency histogram is proposed to track the statistics of categorical attributes; the algorithm initially creates n clusters by k-prototypes algorithm. In order to improve clustering quality, a two phase streams clustering selection process is applied to HU-Clustering algorithm. Firstly, the candidate clustering is selected through the new similarity measure; secondly, the most similar cluster for each new arriving tuple is selected through clustering uncertainty in candidate clustering set.

We improve the common agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm based on average-link method, which is then used to implement the retrospective topic detection and the online topic detection of news stories of the stocks. Additionally, the improved single pass clustering algorithm is employed to accomplish topic tracking. We consider that the feature terms which occur in the title of a news story contribute more during the similarity calculation and increase their corresponding weights. Experiments are performed on two datasets which are annotated by human judgment.

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm named DATAR with a new ranking strategy, which improves the diversification ability of GRASSHOPPER. Also, we make a discussion on the reason why DATAR is better. We evaluated the proposed algorithm with a public dataset ODP239 and a real search result dataset collected from Google.

They also dramatically affect learning accuracy and computational complexities. Recently, two co-occurrence methods, Co-occurrence Distance based on Power Set (CDPS) and Co-occurrence Distance based on Universal Set (CDUS), have been proposed to calculate distances for categorical attribute values with significantly improved clustering accuracy by taking advantage of co-occurrences of attributes. However, their computational load is high enough to restrict their applications in unsupervised learning. This paper proposes two new enhanced co-occurrence approaches, i.e. Co-occurrence Distance based on Join Set (CDJS) and Co-occurrence Distance based on Intersection Set (CDIS), to calculate the distance between two values of a categorical attribute by considering its relationships to other attributes. Theoretical analysis reveals the equivalent accuracy of CDJS and CDIS to CDPS and CDUS, while CDJS and CDIS can significantly reduce computational complexity. Substantial experiments on ten benchmark and real-world data sets have evidenced that our proposed approaches are equivalently accurate but with a much higher efficiency than CDPS and CDUS, in particular for large scale data sets.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580500","Categorical data;Co-occurrence distances;Unsupervised learning;clustering","Accuracy;Computational complexity;Cybernetics;Iterative closest point algorithm;Machine learning;Measurement;Unsupervised learning","pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","categorical attribute values;categorical data;co-occurrence distance metrics;data clustering;intersection set co-occurrence distance method;join set co-occurrence distance method;power set co-occurrence distance method;universal set co-occurrence distance method;unsupervised learning","","0","","11","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The major disadvantage of PNN is that it requires one node or neuron for each training sample. Various clustering techniques have been proposed to reduce this requirement to one node per cluster center. A new fast optimization of PNN is investigated here using iteratively computing the centers of each class samples unrecognized and add their nearest neighbors to pattern layer. For fast constructing the classification model, weight and incremental technique is introduced to improve the learning speed. To further decrease the structure of PNN, KL transform is adopted to compress feature dimension. The approach proposed here decreases redundancy not only in samples using nearest neighbor but also in features using KL transformation.

We need to select important attributes to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction correctly. A fuzzy measure is a good candidate to do that. This study uses Shannon interaction information as fuzzy measure to study how the joint attributes affect the overall customer satisfaction. First, identify the important attributes that would evaluate the overall customer satisfaction by Shannon interaction information. Then, use them to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction. In this study, four methods (i.e., the weighted arithmetic mean method with all attributes, the regression method with all attributes, the weighted arithmetic mean method with important attributes, and the regression method with important attributes) were used to evaluate the overall customer satisfaction.

In this work, we present an efficient face recognition method which can solve the above two problems with single training sample. At first, the effect of the lighting variation is effectively eliminated by the Multi-Scale Retinex algorithm. The Active Appearance Model is adopted to extract the facial block feature to establish the component-based face recognition system. Different from other methods which construct the various classifiers corresponding to the specific facial expression, the proposed method decreases the weights of some dominated facial features which are affected by the severe facial expression. By learning a block weighting support vector machine, the component based approach is achieved. The proposed algorithm has two advantages: (1) only single one face training image is needed to train the classifier; (2) by using the facial block features with lower data dimensions, the proposed system is more computational efficiency. In particular, the proposed method achieves 97.94% face recognition accuracy when only using one training sample on the Yale B database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has reliable recognition rate when face images are under illumination and facial expression variations.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580693","","Accuracy;Databases;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Lighting;Training","face recognition;support vector machines","Yale B database;active appearance model;block weighting support vector machine;component-based face recognition system;face training image;facial block feature;facial expression variations;illumination;lighting variation;multi-scale retinex algorithm;one training sample","","3","","24","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Cost of inspection and sort is relatively high, it is urgently needed to improve sort efficiency and reduce sort time. This is a problem needs comprehensive consideration. Sort performance is influenced by acts such as feeding, ejecting, transporting, placing, recycle bin positioning, and so on. Stochastic Petri net model of concurrent control of multi-shafts scheduling is built to analyze the performance and its influenced factors. It can be revealed that positioning of recycle bins is the major influence factor. Because of this, a path planning method according grade, the diodes with same grade should get priority to be sorted first, is put forward.

In this paper we take arbitrary number of similar case distances as the input of the Choquet integral to flexibly represent the interaction among the cases. Consequently, our proposed approach has the ability to approximate the more general relation described by a CBR system. Because of the application of the Choquet integral and the fact that the existing CBR system can be regarded as a special case of our proposed approach, we largely generalize the application scope of traditional CBR techniques.

According to the above energy waste problem, an effective filtering mechanism is proposed in the paper to enhance the energy-efficiency of data-gathering. Many current researches adopt clustering method and aggregation technology to lower energy cost during the process in data transmission, while our proposed filtering framework mainly puts emphasis on inhibiting the production of redundant loads at the gathering source to greatly reduce energy cost using self-adaptive filtering scheme, which is constructed by prediction module for mining the time domain association, self-learning module for modifying model and driving module for executing filtering operation. We can prove the above filter components combined with the running of error-driving rule and threshold-distributing rule can effectively decrease the quantity of data transmission in networks based on QoS requirement. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed filtering mechanism can do better than some classical data gathering approaches on the aspect of energy-saving effect.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581088","Data-gathering;Energy-saving;Filtering mechanism;Sensor networks","Data communication;Energy consumption;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Machine learning;Predictive models;Quality of service","data communication;filtering theory;quality of service;wireless sensor networks","QoS requirement;data gathering;design;energy-saving filtering;error-driving rule;massive highly related data transmission;self-adaptive filtering;sensor networks;threshold-distributing rule","","1","","17","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To predicate value in every point in spaces, we use GP models for value function and reward function separately. Our contribution is threefold: First, we extend the existing IRL algorithm to the case of continuous spaces. Second, reward GP provides not only the reward function with flexible forms, but also uncertainty about rewards, which helps the learner make a tradeoff between exploitation and exploration. Third, by introducing the kernel function, our approach takes sample points in the demonstration as learning features. It prevents manually designating features.

However, in reality, usually only a few labeled data are obtained, since obtaining class labels is expensive but many unlabeled data can be easily gotten. For this case, directly using the existing supervised feature selection algorithms may be failed because the data distribution may not be accurately estimated only by using a few labeled data. So, in this paper, we introduce a semi-supervised method for feature selection, called Semi_Fisher Score, the new model attempts to effectively simultaneously utilize all labeled and unlabeled samples for improving the performance of the classical Fisher Score.
