Pushing the boundaries of concurrency and parallelism, programmers are maximizing performance demanded by stakeholders. However, multi-threaded programs are challenging to test and debug. Prone to their own set of unique faults, such as race conditions, testers need to turn to automated validation tools for assistance. This paper's main contribution is a new algorithm called multi-stage novelty filtering (MSNF) that can aid in the discovery of software faults. MSNF stresses minimal configuration, no domain specific data preprocessing or software metrics. The MSNF approach is based on a multi-layered support vector machine scheme. After experimentation with the MSNF algorithm, we observed promising results in terms of precision. However, MSNF relies on multiple iterations (i.e., stages).

Owing to these reasons, a machine learning approach is required for determining the compatibility of operating parameters related to speed stability of TWUSMs. For this purpose, an intelligent decision support tool has been designed for TWUSMs in this study.

The proposed technique consists of three stages: preprocessing, feature extraction and recognition. In the preprocessing and feature extraction stages, the wavelet decomposition is used to enhance the common features of the same class of images and the HMLBP is used to extract representative features from each avatar face image without a need for any training. In the recognition stage, the Chi-Square distance is used to achieve a robust decision and to indicate the correct class to which the input image belongs. Experiments conducted on two manually cropped avatar image datasets (Second Life and Entropia Universe) show that the proposed technique performs better than traditional (single scale) LBP, Wavelet Local Binary Pattern (WLBP) and HMLBP in terms of accuracy (78.57% and 67.50% recognition rates for Second Life and Entropia Universe datasets respectively).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146968","Avatar;HMLBP;LBP;Second Life;face recognition;wavelet transform","Avatars;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Second Life;Wavelet transforms","avatars;face recognition;feature extraction;wavelet transforms","avatar face recognition;chi-square distance;cropped avatar image datasets;feature extraction;hierarchical multiscale local binary pattern;law enforcement agencies;security experts;terrorism experts;virtual worlds;wavelet decomposition;wavelet transform","","6","","23","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Photovoltaic (PV) system, one of such technologies, has an advantage of utilizing infinite and clean energy. On the contrary, it also has a disadvantage of unreliable power supply mainly caused by unstable weather. The fluctuation of the power supply of PV systems are considerably large because of rapid insulation changes and rapid weather changes, and in some cases, it seems impossible to realize high-accuracy prediction even with sophisticated prediction models. In this paper, using recently proposed estimator for the Shannon information content, a method to output a measure of credibility for prediction is proposed. With the proposed method, it is possible to judge whether the energy supply at a certain future time is unpredictably fluctuate compared to the current value or not, and it is possible to take measures against the rapid change of solar energy generation in advance. From an experimental result using solar energy supply data, we see that the proposed measure of credibility reflects the difficulty of predicting solar energy supply.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147689","Measure of Credibility;Prediction;Shannon Information Content;Solar Energy","Data models;Energy measurement;Power measurement;Predictive models;Solar energy;Time series analysis;Voltage measurement","photovoltaic power systems;solar power stations","PV system;Shannon information content;energy problems;energy technologies;photovoltaic system;power supply;solar energy generation;solar energy supply data;solar power prediction;sophisticated prediction models;unreliable power supply;unstable weather","","0","","19","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The unlabeled data, instead of being discarded, are also used in the learning process. Motivated by a breast cancer application, in this work we address a new learning task, in-between classification and semi-supervised classification. Each example is described using two different feature sets, not necessarily both observed for a given example. If a single view is observed, then the class is only due to that feature set, if both views are present the observed class label is the maximum of the two values corresponding to the individual views.

This idea, directly applicable to data compression, has been recently exploited in pattern classification. In this setting an input pattern is projected onto a sparsity basis spanned by a number of other, pre-labeled patterns (a training set), such that expectedly only those representing the same category as the tested pattern are assigned non-zero coefficients. Label of a novel pattern is then determined by generating K signals with attenuated coefficients of the basis patterns not sharing each of K possible labels, and picking the one minimizing the reconstruction error.

Drawing inspiration from recent work in word sense disambiguation, this paper presents a gene entity normalization system based on entity relationship graphs. This system creates a concept graph from the possible entities and their relationships within a full-text document, and takes advantage of a node ranking algorithm to rank and score each potential candidate entity. This system is a prototype to represent a specific approach to gene normalization, and the results reflect this.

The focus of the algorithm is to estimate more accurately, the parameters of the elements of the mixture that are unique to a speaker. The algorithm uses an Expectation-Maximisation-like framework for estimation of parameters. It is shown that the algorithm converges with appropriate choice of a regularization parameter (Î±). Î± balances target and impostor data during each iteration of the algorithm. Fast convergence can be obtained by modifying the regularization parameter after each iteration. It is shown that incrementing Î± is a sufficient condition for convergence. Further, an impostor data selection technique for fast implementation is addressed.

We present an approach that applies clustering algorithms to forensic analysis of computers seized in police investigations. We illustrate the proposed approach by carrying out experimentation with five clustering algorithms (K-means, K-medoids, Single Link, Complete Link, and Average Link) applied to five datasets obtained from computers seized in real-world investigations. In addition, two relative validity indexes were used to automatically estimate the number of clusters. Related studies in the literature are significantly more limited than our study. Our experiments show that the Average Link and Complete Link algorithms provide the best results for our application domain. If suitably initialized, partitional algorithms (K-means and K-medoids) can also yield to very good results.

To train and test our system we use the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) dataset, which includes semantic annotations by up to four radiologists for each one of the 914 nodules. Furthermore, we evaluate our probabilistic multi-class classifications using a novel distance-threshold curve technique intended for assessing the performance of uncertain classification systems.

This paper presents a novel approach to learning-to-rank, which can natively integrate any target metric with no modifications. The target metric is optimized via maximum-likelihood estimation of a probability distribution over the ranks, which are assumed to follow a Boltzmann distribution. Unlike other approaches in the literature like BoltzRank, this approach does not rely on maximizing the expected value of the target score as a proxy of the optimization of target metric. This has both theoretical and performance advantages as the expected value can not be computed both accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, our model employs the pseudo-likelihood as an accurate surrogate of the likelihood to avoid to explicitly compute the normalization factor of the Boltzmann distribution, which is intractable in this context. The experimental results show that the approach provides state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks and on a dataset built from the logs of a commercial search engine.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147684","","Boltzmann distribution;Computational modeling;Equations;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Measurement;Training","Internet;Markov processes;information retrieval;maximum likelihood estimation;probability;random processes;search engines","BoltzRank;Boltzmann distribution;Markov random field;Web search engine;information retrieval system;learning-to-rank;maximum-likelihood estimation;normalization factor;probability distribution;pseudo-likelihood;target metric","","1","","25","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The complexity and quality of solutions depend highly on the quality of the aggregation.

Standard airfoils historically used for wind and hydrokinetic turbines had and have the maximum lift coefficients of about 1.3 at the stall angle of attack, which is about 12o. At these conditions, the minimum flow velocities to generate electric power are about 7 m/s and 3 m/s for wind turbine and hydrokinetic turbine, respectively. Using leading edge slat, the fluid dynamics governing the flow field eliminates the separation bubble by the injection of the high momentum fluid through the slat over the main airfoil-by meaning of the flow control delays the stall up to an angle of attack of 20o, with a maximum lift coefficient of 2.2. In this study, NACA 2415 was chosen as a representative of hydrofoils while NACA 22 and NACA 97, were chosen as slat profiles, respectively. This flow has been numerically simulated by FLUENT, employing the Realizable k-e turbulence model. In the design of the wind and hydrokinetic turbines, the performance of the airfoils presented by aerodynamics CL = f (Î±,Î´), CD = f (Î±,Î´) and CL/CD = f (Î±,Î´) are the basic parameters. In this paper, optimum values of the angle of attack, slat angle and clearance space between slat and main airfoil leading to maximum lift and minimum drag, and consequently to maximum CL/CD have been numerically determined. Hence, using airfoil and hydrofoil with leading edge slat in the wind and hydrokinetic turbines, minimum wind and hydrokinetic flow velocities to produce meaningful and practical mechanical power reduces to 3-4 m /s for wind turbines and 1-1.5 m/s or less for hydrokinetic turbines. Consequently, using hydrofoil with leading edge slat may re-define the potentials of wind power and hydrokinetic power potential of the countries in the positive manner.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147688","flow separation control;high performance;hydrodynamic model;hydrofoil with leading edge slat;hydrokinetic turbine","Automotive components;Blades;Fluids;Hydraulic turbines;Hydrodynamics;Rotors;Wind turbines","aerodynamics;bubbles;drag reduction;flow separation;flow simulation;hydraulic turbines;hydrodynamics;numerical analysis;turbulence;wind tunnels","FLUENT;NACA 2415;airfoils;angle-of-attack;bubbles;drag reduction;flow control;flow separation;flow velocities;fluid dynamics;high momentum fluid;hydrofoil performance analysis;hydrokinetic turbines;k-Îµ turbulence model;leading edge slats;numerical simulation;wind turbines","","0","","14","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using this new idea we develop a representation of the approximate QP-S3VM as a maximization of a sub modular set function which makes it possible to optimize using efficient greedy algorithms. We demonstrate that the proposed methods are accurate and provide significant improvement in time complexity over the state of the art in the literature.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146995","Semi-supervised Learning;Submodular Optimization;Support Vector Machines","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Kernel;Quadratic programming;Support vector machines;Upper bound","graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);quadratic programming;support vector machines","QP-S3VM;SSL;graph-based models;low density separation;quadratic programming;semisupervised learning;semisupervised support vector machines;shelf optimization packages;submodular optimization","","0","","17","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they usually do not model structured information, such as cerebral spatial and functional networking, which could improve the predictive capacity of the model and which could be more meaningful for further neuroscientific interpretation. In this study, we applied a MKL-based approach to predict prodromal stage of Alzheimer disease (i.e. early phase of the illness) with prior structured knowledges about the brain spatial neighborhood structure and the brain functional circuits linked to cognitve decline of AD.

Age, co-morbidity and activities of daily living scores (such as ability to dress and feed oneself) were the major factors in determining if a patient is likely to overstay while waiting special dispensation.

Recently, a number of approaches in the field of subspace clustering have been proposed which search for clusters in subspaces of unknown dimensions. Learning the number of clusters, the dimension of each subspace, and the correct assignments is a challenging task, and many existing algorithms often perform poorly in the presence of subspaces that have different dimensions and possibly overlap, or are otherwise computationally expensive. In this work we present a novel approach to subspace clustering that learns the numbers of clusters and the dimensionality of each subspace in an efficient way. We assume that the data points in each cluster are well represented in low-dimensions by a PCA model. We propose a measure of predictive influence of data points modelled by PCA which we minimise to drive the clustering process.

Most of them assume that the number of clusters, k, is known and fixed a priori by the user. Aimed at relaxing this assumption, which is often unrealistic in practical applications, we describe an algorithmic framework that allows estimating k automatically from data. We illustrate the potential of the proposed framework by using three state-of-the-art algorithms for clustering data streams - Stream LSearch, CluStream, and Stream KM++ - combined with two well-known algorithms for estimating the number of clusters, namely: Ordered Multiple Runs of k-Means (OMRk) and Bisecting k-Means (BkM). As an additional contribution, we experimentally compare the resulting algorithmic instantiations in both synthetic and real-world data streams. Analyses of statistical significance suggest that OMRk yields to the best data partitions, while BkM is more computationally efficient. Also, the combination of Stream KM++ with OMRk leads to the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.67","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147041","Clustering;Data Stream;Online Clustering","Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Prototypes","data handling;pattern clustering","CluStream algorithm;Stream KM++ algorithm;Stream LSearch algorithm;bisecting k-means algorithm;data partitioning;data stream clustering;evolving data stream;k-means-based algorithm;ordered multiple runs of k-means algorithm;variable cluster number","","2","","23","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper first describes principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm for obtaining sub-space grids from the projected low dimensional space. A recursive procedure is then used to obtain rules where sub-space grids form premises of rules. The extracted set of rules is evaluated on both training and testing data sets. The sub-space grids from PCA algorithm are characterized by overlapped data from different classes and use of even more than two premises in a rule does not fully address the problem of overlapped data. As such the rules obtained do not discriminate different classes accurately. To increase the effectiveness of the set of rules, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) algorithm instead of PCA algorithm is employed to obtain sub-space grids from the projected low dimensional space. These sub-space grids from MDA algorithm improve the classification accuracy of the system. However, the size of set of rules extracted is large and these rules are sensitive to local variations associated with the data. To address these issues, the paper explores using both the PCA and MDA algorithms simultaneously fo projected low dimensional space for obtaining sub-space grids. The resulting set of rules produce better classification accuracy results. The paper discusses a comprehensive evaluation of this rule based system. The system is tested on a dataset of 62 samples (40 colon tumor and 22 normal colon tissue). The results show that the use of sub-space grids that are obtained from a projected low dimensional space of combined PCA and MDA algorithms increase the accuracy of classification results of micro array data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147003","Microarray classification;machine learning algorithm;multiple discriminant analysis;principle component analysis;rule extraction;sub-space grids","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Gene expression;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines;Training data;Vectors","biology computing;data handling;knowledge based systems;pattern classification;principal component analysis","MDA algorithm;PCA algorithm;colon tumor;data sets;microarray data classification;multiple discriminant analysis algorithm;normal colon tissue;principal component analysis lgorithm;rule based system;subspace grids","","0","","12","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is particularly beneficial in medical research applications of machine learning, where getting good hand labelling of data is especially expensive. We propose application of a single-layer sparse-auto encoder to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for fully automatic classification of tissue types in a large unlabelled dataset with minimal human interference -- in a manner similar to data-mining. DCE-MRI analysis, looking at the change of the MR contrast-agent concentration over successively acquired images, is time-series analysis. We analyse the change of brightness (which is related to the contrast-agent concentration) of the DCE-MRI images over time to classify different tissue types in the images. Therefore our system is an application of an auto encoder to time-series analysis while the demonstrated result and further possible successive application areas are in computer vision. We discuss the important factors affecting performance of the system in applying the auto encoder to the time-series analysis of DCE-MRI medical image data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146980","DCE-MRI;autoencoder;deep-learning;liver;medical image analysis cancer;time-series analysis","Cancer;Kidney;Liver;Medical diagnostic imaging;Training;Training data","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;time series","DCE-MRI analysis;computer vision;contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging;fully automatic classification;large unlabelled medical image dataset;machine learning;medical research applications;single-layer sparse-autoencoder;time-series analysis;tissue types;unsupervised tissues characterisation","","3","","19","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Excessive glycemic variability contributes to oxidative stress, which has been linked to the development of long-term diabetic complications. An automated screen for excessive glycemic variability, based on the readings from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, would enable early identification of at risk patients. In this paper, we present an automatic approach for learning variability models that can routinely detect excessive glycemic variability when applied to CGM data. Naive Bayes (NB), Multilayer Perceptron (MP), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models are trained and evaluated on a dataset of CGM plots that have been manually annotated with respect to glycemic variability by two diabetes experts. In order to alleviate the impact of noise, the CGM plots are smoothed using cubic splines. Automatic feature selection is then performed on a rich set of pattern recognition features. Empirical evaluation shows that the top performing model obtains a state of the art accuracy of 93.8%, substantially outperforming a previous NB model.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147664","classification;diabetes;glycemic variability","Blood;Diabetes;Smoothing methods;Spline;Sugar;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;bioinformatics;diseases;feature extraction;multilayer perceptrons;patient care;pattern classification;sugar;support vector machines","CGM data;NB model;automatic feature selection;blood glucose level;continuous glucose monitoring system;cubic spline;diabetes management;excessive glycemic variability automatic detection;learning variability model;long-term diabetic complication;multilayer perceptron;naive Bayes model;oxidative stress;pattern recognition feature;support vector machine model","","2","","22","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method addressing the problem of learning with small sample set by generating additional virtual samples. In absence of any useful prior knowledge about the functional form of the target model, we take a closer look at the distribution patterns of available samples in low dimensional subspaces and constitute the rules that each sample, including virtual samples, must obey.

ADP addresses the problem of systems exhibiting a state space which is too large to be enumerated in the memory of a computer. Because of this, approximation schemes are used to generalize estimates over continuous state spaces. Nevertheless, RL still suffers from a lack of scalability to multidimensional continuous state spaces.

Generative (i.e. model based) kernels are well suited for handling structured data since they are able to capture their underlying structure by allowing the inclusion of prior information via specification of the source models. In this paper we focus on marginalisation kernels for variable length sequences generated by hidden Markov models. In particular, we propose a new class of generative embeddings, obtained through a nonlinear transformation of the original marginalisation mappings. This allows to embed the input data into a new feature space where a better separation can be achieved and leads to a new kernel defined as the inner product in the transformed feature space. Different nonlinear transformations are proposed and two different ways of applying these transformations to the original mappings are considered. The main contribution of this paper is the proof that the proposed nonlinear transformations increase the margin of the optimal hyper plane of an SVM classifier thus enhancing the classification performance. The proposed mappings are tested on two different sequence classification problems with really satisfying results that outperform state of the art methods.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146994","hidden Markov models;marginalisation mappings;nonlinear transformations;optimization of the kernel parameter;support vector machines","Accuracy;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Logistics;Shape;Support vector machines","data handling;data structures;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM classifier;classification performance enhancement;generative embeddings;hidden Markov models;machine learning;marginalisation kernels;marginalisation mappings;nonlinear transformations;sequence classification problems;variable length sequences;variable-size structured data handling","","0","","20","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In previous work, researchers have developed technology for extracting knowledge, in the form of relational tables, from semi-structured websites. In this paper we integrate this extraction technology with generic machine learning algorithms, showing that knowledge extracted from the Web can significantly benefit the learning process. Specifically, the knowledge can lead to better generalizations, reduce the number of samples required for supervised learning, and eliminate the need to retrain the system when the environment changes.

The inherent variability in physiological signals across subjects poses a great challenge to traditional machine learning algorithms which are used to develop generalized classification frameworks. In this paper, we propose an optimization-based domain adaptation (ODA) methodology which can provide reliable classification on a given test subject, using the available data from other subjects. The proposed ODA method selects instances from the source domain (data available from other subjects) based on a novel optimization formulation, to ensure that the selected instances are similar in distribution to the target domain (test subject data) in both marginal and conditional probability distributions. We validated the proposed framework on Surface Electromyogram (SEMG) signals collected from 8 people during a fatigue-causing repetitive gripping activity, to detect different stages of fatigue. Comprehensive experiments on our SEMG data set demonstrated that the proposed method improves the classification accuracy by 19% to 21% over traditional classification models, and by 12% to 18% over existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methodologies.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.111","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147023","Classification;Domain Adaptation;Subject based variability","Data models;Entropy;Fatigue;Kernel;Optimization;Probability distribution;Training","biosensors;electromyography;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;optimisation;pattern classification;physiology","ODA method;SEMG data;fatigue-causing repetitive gripping activity;generalized classification frameworks;human-computer interfaces;inexpensive physiological sensors;machine learning algorithms;novel optimization formulation;optimization-based domain adaptation;person-adaptive classification models;proactive health monitoring;smart environments;surface electromyogram signals;unobtrusive physiological sensors","","1","","24","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The efforts made to find robust symbol representations and learning methodologies have not found a similar quality in the learning of the dissimilarity concept. Simple Euclidean distances are often used to measure dissimilarity between different examples. However, such distances do not necessarily yield the best performance. In this paper, we propose to learn the best distance for the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The distance concept will be tuned both for the application domain and the adopted representation for the music symbols. The performance of the method is compared with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier using both real and synthetic music scores. The synthetic database includes four types of deformations inducing variability in the printed musical symbols which exist in handwritten music sheets.

Then, supervised machine learning is used to derive sets of attributional rules for predicting potential discrepancies in claims. New claims can be then classified using the created models. The method was tested on a subset of Obstetrics claims for payment submitted by one hospital to Medicaid.

Finding relations between the biological entities (e.g. proteins and genes) in text is a challenging task. To facilitate the extraction process, a relation can be decomposed into a trigger and the complementary arguments (e.g. theme, site). Several approaches have been proposed based on machine learning which generally use a common set of features for all trigger types. Here we evaluate the impact of applying a feature selection method for trigger classification. Our proposed method uses a greedy feature selection algorithm to find an optimal set of attributes for each trigger type. We show that using the customized set of features can improve classification results significantly (up to 53.96% in f-measure). In addition, we evaluated different settings for including semantic features in the classifiers. We found that using semantic features can improve classification results and found the best setting for each trigger type.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147050","Distributional Semantic;Feature selection;NLP;Relation Extraction","Feature extraction;Proteins;Semantics;Support vector machines;Testing;Training;Vectors","biology computing;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);text analysis","biological entities;biological text;biomolecular findings;distributional semantic evaluation;extraction process;greedy feature selection algorithm;machine learning;relationship extraction","","0","","19","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classification methods based on support vector machines (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) were developed to differentiate between healthy controls and IBD patients at various intestinal locations using those profiles. The results show that there exist significant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or microbial species that are differentially abundant between IBD and healthy control state at specific intestinal locations.

The mathematical optimization strategies put in place resulted in price discrimination, similar seats in a same flight being often bought at different prices, depending on the time of the transaction, the provider, etc. It is the goal of this paper to consider the design of decision-making tools in the context of varying travel prices from the customer's perspective. Based on vast streams of heterogeneous historical data collected through the internet, we describe here two approaches to forecasting travel price changes at a given horizon, taking as input variables a list of descriptive characteristics of the flight, together with possible features of the past evolution of the related price series. Though heterogeneous in many respects ( e.g. sampling, scale), the collection of historical prices series is here represented in a unified manner, by marked point processes (MPP).

"Relational Classifiers in a Non-relational World: Using Homophily to Create Relations","S. A.

Even models built using only relations often perform comparably to models built using sophisticated relational learning methods. However, many data sets - such as those in the UCI machine learning repository - contain no relations. In fact, many data sets either do not contain relations or have relations which are not helpful to a specific classification task. The question we investigate in this paper is whether it is possible to construct relations such that relational inference results in better classification performance than non-relational inference. Using simple similarity-based rules to create relations and weighting the strength of these relations using homophily on instance labels, we test whether relational inference techniques are applicable - in other words, do they perform comparably to standard machine learning algorithms. We show, in an experimental study on 31 UCI benchmark data sets, that relational inference wins more than any of the 6 classifiers we compare against, including a transductive SVM, and that it wins the majority of the time when compared against any one of them.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147006","feature construction;machine learning;statistical relational learning;supervised learning","Accuracy;Labeling;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","UCI machine learning repository;nonrelational inference;nonrelational world;relational classifiers;relational data;similarity based rules;sophisticated relational learning methods;statistical relational learning;transductive SVM","","1","","25","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider a set of functions that project each input point onto a minimum entropy configuration (code). The encoding functions are modeled by kernel machines and the resulting code collects the cluster membership probabilities. Two regularizers are included to balance the distribution of the output features and favor smooth solutions, respectively, thus leading to an unconstrained optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by conjugate gradient or concave-convex procedures. The relationships with Maximum Margin Clustering algorithms are investigated, which show that MEEs overcomes some of the critical issues, such as the lack of a multi-class extension and the need to face problems with a large number of constraints.

For high-dimensional data, feature extraction problem usually comes down to exploit the intrinsic pattern information with dimensionality reduction. Since nonparametric approaches are applicable without parameter installation, they are more preferred in many real-world applications. In this work, a novel approach to direct maximum margin alignment (DMMA), is proposed for nonparametric feature reduction and extraction. Though there has been the straightforward solution for the discriminative ratio based subspace selection, such type of solution is still unavailable for maximum margin alignment. In terms of the kernel-view idea, DMMA can be performed by bringing in sample kernel, while the computational efficiency is achievable. Experiments on pattern recognition show that the proposed method is able to obtain comparable performance with several state-of-the-art algorithms.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146958","Nonparametric feature extraction;dimensionality reduction;direct maximum margin alignment;kernel-view;subspace selection","Buildings;Databases;Face;Feature extraction;Matrix decomposition;Optimization;Principal component analysis","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence)","DMMA;direct maximum margin alignment;high-dimensional data;information processing;machine learning;nonparametric feature extraction;pattern information;pattern recognition","","0","","22","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Volatility is a quantification of how much a value moves in a time series. It is now customary to assume that volatility of foreign exchange markets is time-varying. Intuitively we observe that there are at least two states or regimes: one is with low volatility and the other is with high volatility. Under high volatility regime, there are chances of high returns but with very high risks. For many nonprofessional traders, the high volatility regimes are periods that they loose with high probability. We believe that giving an early alert of starts of high volatility regimes is beneficial for many nonprofessional traders and for the foreign exchange markets. There are many studies to predict volatility of foreign exchange market by using ARCH or GARCH model with possibly hidden Markov model to represent regimes. We, though, focused on prediction of volatility levels by using machine learning techniques so that we get a good prediction. We particularly focused on support vector machine that learns sequences of volatility levels estimated by hidden Markov model and makes prediction of the level. We performed numerical experiments on real data and obtained good performance.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146993","Foreign exchange;hidden markov model;machine learning;prediction;support vector machine;volatility","Accuracy;Equations;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Training","foreign exchange trading;hidden Markov models;support vector machines;time series","GARCH model;foreign exchange market states;hidden Markov model;machine learning;support vector machine;time series;volatility","","2","","8","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to its potential benefits, financially or otherwise, researchers have focused on modeling human behavior from recommending items in an online store to predicting the behavior of an entire ecosystem. In this paper, we make an attempt to predict human preference towards natural speech. The proposed approach makes use of extracted user features from the dataset using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), features extracted from the wave signal using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and Radial Basis Function to map the two feature-spaces. The proposed approach was able to reach a Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.92 and a 0.258 MAE when compared to the original average scores. The main contribution of the presented work is the fact that mapping the signal-features (MFCC) into an intermediate feature space (SVD) is far more effective than mapping the signal features directly into the desired output. The proposed algorithm outperformed Support Vector Machines (SVM) in all measures, precisely by 88.14% in terms of correlation and by 48.62% in terms of error.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6146937","cold-start problem;collaborative filtering;recommendation system","Correlation;Feature extraction;Matrix decomposition;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Prediction algorithms;Speech;Support vector machines","behavioural sciences computing;cepstral analysis;correlation methods;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;singular value decomposition;speech processing;support vector machines","Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;Pearson correlation coefficient;feature extraction;feature space mapping;human behavior modeling;human behavior prediction;machine learning;online store;radial basis function;singular value decomposition;speech rating system;support vector machines;wave signal","","1","","15","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
