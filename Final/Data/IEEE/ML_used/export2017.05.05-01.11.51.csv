In this paper, we propose a localized generalization error model which bounds above the generalization error within a neighborhood of the training samples using stochastic sensitivity measure (expectation of the squared output perturbations). It is then used to develop a model selection technique for a classifier with maximal coverage of unseen samples by specifying a generalization error threshold.

LSI can resolve the problems of polysemy and synonymy, and can reduce noise in the raw document-term matrix. But LSI is not an optimal approach to text classification.

On the other hand, the two mapping functions between the low-level parameter space and the high-level users' psychological space can be built during interactions. An instance of this frame, which uses support vector machine (SVM) as the machine learning method in RF, is also provided. The effectiveness of our approach is first evaluated through simulation tests using two benchmark functions. The experimental results show that the convergence speed of the proposal is much faster than that of normal IGA. Then, the approach is applied to retrieve images with emotion semantics queries.

In order to facilitate the identification of individual synapses from microscope images, we have introduced a wavelet-based approach for the automated recognition of axonal synaptic varicosities. The proposed differential wavelets are specifically designed for the recognition of peaks, which correspond to the axonal synaptic varicosities of parallel fibers. The 2D image of an axon together with its synaptic varicosities is first transformed into a 1D profile in which the axonal varicosities are represented by peaks in the signal. Next, by decomposing the 1D profile in the differential wavelet domain, we employ the multiscale point-wise product to distinguish between peaks and noises in the multiscale domain. The ability to separate the peaks (due to synaptic varicosities) from noise makes possible a reliable and accurate recognition of axonal synaptic varicosities. The performance of the algorithms has been systematically evaluated. The results indicate that they are satisfactory for practical use","1551-2541;15512541","POD:0-7803-9517-4","10.1109/MLSP.2005.1532901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532901","","Biology computing;Circuits;Cities and towns;Data visualization;Electron microscopy;Image recognition;Nerve fibers;Optical microscopy;Optical noise;Pattern analysis","blood vessels;brain;data visualisation;electron microscopy;image recognition;image representation;medical image processing;optical microscopy;wavelet transforms","axon 2D image;axon microscope images;axonal synaptic varicosity recognition;differential wavelet domain;multiscale point-wise product;parallel fibers;spatial distribution pattern;synapse visualization;synaptic circuitry;synaptic systems;wavelet-based recognition","","0","","9","","","28-28 Sept. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general, there are two types of decision tree induction, i.e., crisp decision trees and fuzzy decision trees. Both decision tree inductions based on real-world data are unlikely to find the entirely accurate training set. This means noise existing in the training set. It should be noted that the noise can either cause attributes to become inadequate, or make the decision tree more complicated. It is necessary to further investigate decision trees where the influence of noise data is considered. Experimentally, the paper analyzes the effect of three types of noises, compares the tolerance capability of noise between fuzzy decision trees and crisp decision trees, discusses the modified degree of pruning methods in both fuzzy and crisp decision trees, and addresses the adjustable capability on noise by using different fuzzy reasoning operators in the fuzzy decision tree.

The target state vector is the target positions and velocities in the 2D plane. Our approach can determine the state vector distribution even if the individual sensors are not capable of observing it.

Augmented statistical models can be trained using a maximum margin criterion, which may be implemented using an SVM with a generative kernel. Calculating derivatives of the base distribution, in particular higher-order derivatives, to form the generative kernel requires complex dynamic programming algorithms.

This allows elements of the generative kernel, including those based on higher-order derivatives, to be computed using standard forms of transducer within a rational kernel framework.

To be able to obtain an accurate estimate from a particle filter a large number of particles is usually necessary. A crucial step in the design of a particle filter is the choice of the proposal distribution. A common choice for the proposal distribution is to use the transition distribution which models the dynamics of the system but takes no account of the current measurements. We present a particle filter for tracking rigid objects in video sequences that makes use of image gradients in the current frame to improve the proposal distribution. The gradient information is efficiently incorporated in the filter to minimise the computational cost.

In nearly all prior work on IIS, one considers discrete-valued feature functions, depending on the data observations and class label, and encodes statistical constraints on these discrete-valued random variables. Moreover, most significantly for our purposes, the (ground-truth) constraints are measured from frequency counts, based on hard (0-1) training set instances of feature values. Here, we extend IIS for the case where the training (and test) set consists of instances of probability mass functions on the features, rather than instances of hard feature values. We show that the IIS methodology extends in a natural way for this case. This extension has applications 1) to ME aggregation of soft classifier outputs in ensemble classification and 2) to ME classification on mixed discrete-continuous feature spaces. Moreover, we combine these methods, yielding an ME method that jointly performs (soft) decision-level fusion and feature-level fusion in making ensemble decisions.

But it is difficult to make its two global parameters (σ, ξ) be globally effective. A new algorithm based on KNN and DENCLUE is proposed in this paper, which offers DENCLUE the appropriate and globally effective parameters based on KNN and DENCLUE. At the first, the window-width (WW) of each data point is determined and the whole data set is partitioned into some fuzzy cluster (FC) by KNN based on KDE. Then, the local σ of each FC is unsupervised determined according to the entropy theory. At the last, each local σ is mapped to the global σ and each FC is independently clustered, which makes the global σ and ξ have the global validity.

In essence, fault diagnosis is a pattern classification and recognition problem of judging whether the operation status of the system is normal or not. Support vector machines (SVMs), well motivated theoretically, have been introduced as effective methods for solving classification problems. However, the generalization performance of SVMs is sometimes far from the expected level due to their limitations in practical applications. Ensemble learning of SVMs provides a promising way for such cases. In this paper, a new ensemble learning method based on genetic algorithm is presented. Genetic algorithm is introduced into ensemble learning so as to search for accurate and diverse classifiers to construct a good ensemble. The presented method works on a higher level and is more direct than other search based ensemble learning methods. Different strategies of constructing diverse base classifiers are also studied. Experimental results on a steam turbine fault diagnosis problem show that the presented method can achieve much better generalization performance than other methods including single SVM, Bagging and Adaboost.M1 if the strategies used are appropriate for the practical problem.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527514","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527514","Fault diagnosis;ensemble learning;genetic algorithm;support vector machine","Automation;Computer aided instruction;Fault diagnosis;Genetic algorithms;Learning systems;Machine learning;Pattern classification;Pattern recognition;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","fault diagnosis;genetic algorithms;support vector machines","economic meaning;ensemble learning method;fault diagnosis problem;genetic algorithm;support vector machine","","6","","20","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many practical situations in inductive learning algorithms, it is often expected to further improve the generalization capability after the learning process has been completed if new data are available. One of the common approaches is to add training data to the learning algorithm and retrain it, but retraining for each new data point or data set can be very expensive. In view of the learning methods of human beings, it seems natural to build posterior learning results upon prior results. In this paper, we proposed an updating method for support vector machine (SVM). If initial concept would be built up by inductive algorithm, then concept updated is the normal solution corresponding to the initial concept learned. It was shown that concept learned would not change if the new available data located in error-insensitive zone. Especially, concept initially learned and updated by SVR induces an incremental SVR approximately learning method for large scale data. We tested our method on toys data sets and 7 regression bench mark data set.

In order to avoid training of a large number of SVM classifier, the least square based SVM estimation is adopted. Initially, the SVM is trained based on grid search method to obtain discrimination function using the training data based on all features available. Then the feature subset produced during the ACO search process is evaluated based on their abilities to reconstruct the reference discriminative function using linear least square estimation. Finally SVM is retrained using the train data based on the obtained optimal feature subset to obtain intrusion detection model.

We introduce clustering based segmentation approaches such as fuzzy c-means clustering for this purpose. The red and green intensity values from the cy3 and Cy5 hybridization images are used as features to cluster each pixel into foreground and background.

A problem with diagnostic techniques is that they require constant human interpretation of the results. Fuzzy neural networks show good ability of self-adaption and self-learning, wavelet transformation or analysis shows the time frequency location characteristic and multi-scale ability. Inspired by these advantages, a wavelet fuzzy neural network (WFNN) is proposed for fault diagnosis in this paper. This fuzzy neural network uses wavelet basis function as membership function whose shape can be adjusted on line so that the networks have better learning and adaptive ability. An on-line learning algorithm is applied to automatically construct the wavelet fuzzy neural network. There are no rules initially in the wavelet fuzzy neural network. They are created and adapted as on-line learning proceeds via simultaneous structure and parameter learning. The advantages of this learning algorithm are that it converges quickly and the obtained fuzzy rules are more precise. The results of simulation show that this SWFNN network method has the advantage of faster learning rate and higher diagnosing precision.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527673","Fuzzy neural networks;fault diagnosis;machine condition monitoring;wavelet transformation","Condition monitoring;Fault detection;Fault diagnosis;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Intelligent networks;Machinery;Signal processing algorithms;Wavelet analysis","condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;machine testing;mechanical engineering computing;time-frequency analysis;unsupervised learning;wavelet transforms","fault diagnosis;machine condition monitoring;machinery problem diagnosis;membership function;online self-constructing wavelet fuzzy neural network;parameter learning;self adaption;self learning;time frequency location characteristic;wavelet analysis;wavelet basis function;wavelet transform","","2","","22","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be done by applying a biclustering procedure to gene expression data. Given a microarray data set with M genes and TV conditions, we define a bicluster with coherent evolution as a subset of genes with expression levels that are non-decreasing as a function of a particular ordered subset of conditions. We propose a new biclustering procedure that identifies all biclusters with a specified number of A conditions in parallel with O(MK) complexity. Unlike almost all prior biclustering techniques, the proposed approach is guaranteed to find all biclusters with a specified minimum numbers of genes and conditions in the data set. All of the biclusters it identifies have no imperfection, i.e., the evolutions of the genes in each bicluster will be coherent across all conditions in the bicluster.

Therefore machine learning methods are used to identify PNs automatically. In the framework of MaxEnt model, semantic and lexical information of surrounding words and word itself acting as atomic features comprises feature templates and forms feature without requiring extra expert knowledge. The test on WSJ of Penn Treebank II shows that this method guarantees high precision and recall, and at the same time it can reduce the quantity of features dramatically, downsize system space consumption, and decrease the time of training and testing, so as to improve the efficiency considerably.

This paper proposes a training algorithm of incremental SVM with recombining method. Considering the differences of data distribution and the impact of new training data on history data, the history training dataset and the new training one are divided into independent groups and are recombined to train a classifier. In fact, this method can be implemented in a parallel structure for the actions of dividing may decrease the computation complexity of training a SVM. Meanwhile, the actions of recombining may weaken the potential impact caused by the difference of data distribution. The experiment results on a text dataset show that this training algorithm is effective and the classification accuracy of proposed incremental algorithm is superior to that using batch SVM model.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527690","Incremental learning;Support Vector Machine;data distribution;dataset recombining","History;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Risk management;Space technology;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing;Training data","computational complexity;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","classifier training;computation complexity;data distribution;history training dataset;incremental learning;incremental supprot vector machine;parallel structure;pattern recognition;recombining method","","1","","14","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many popular TC models use simple occurrence of words in a document as features. They also commonly assume word occurrences to be statistically independent in their design. Although it is obvious that such assumption does not hold in general, these TC models have been robust and efficient in their task. Some recent studies have shown context-sensitive TC approaches, which take into consideration contexts in the form of word co-occurrences, have been able to perform better in general. On the other hand, there have been many studies in the use of complex linguistic or semantic features instead of simple word occurrences as features for information retrieval and classification tasks. While these complex features may intuitively have more relevance to the tasks concerned, results of these studies on their effectiveness have been mixed and not been conclusive.
