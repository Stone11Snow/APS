Symptom of fever is one of the symptoms that can interfere with human health. The symptoms are common in human, but for handling errors sometimes occur diagnosis that can lead to death. Such errors can occur due to lack of expertise or reluctance of patients to check themselves since the symptom fever is common. By considering the issues, we conduct a study to design an application that can help patients with the fever symptom. The research was conducted by combining two following concepts: expert systems (i.e., Dempster Shafer) and machine learning (i.e., Naïve bayes). By combining the methods, we can obtain a single solution considering knowledge formulated by human experts and extracted from data training. Moreover, the application is implemented by an R package connecting R language with PHP, which is RShinny. A case study was taken by using medical records from the hospital Muhammadiyah, Bandung, West Java, Indonesia. To determine the level of accuracy of the system, we carried out two experimental stages, namely the fitting and testing steps. For the fitting step, we obtained the accuracy of 70.67 percent while 56.25 percent is the accuracy of the testing stage.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1721-8; POD:978-1-5090-1722-5; USB:978-1-5090-1720-1","10.1109/ICSITech.2016.7852664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7852664","Dempster Shafer;Naive Bayes;expert systems;machine learning;medical informatics","Diseases;Expert systems;Flowcharts;Heating;Hospitals;Information technology;Medical diagnostic imaging","Bayes methods;diseases;expert systems;hospitals;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;uncertainty handling","Bandung;Dempster Shafer;Indonesia;Naïve bayes;PHP;R language;R package;RShinny;West Java;data training;expert systems;fever disease prediction;fever symptom;hospital Muhammadiyah;human experts;human health;human life;machine learning;medical records","","","","","","","26-27 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the deciphering of specific thinking styles of an online user has suffered setbacks due to the limited exposition on the probability of online thinking style signature of users. This study explored this limitation with the assumption that human daily behavioral pattern can be translated into the electronic media of communication frequently used. To ascertain this assumption, server-side web data of 43-respondents were collected for 10-months as well as a self-report thinking style measurement instrument for each respondent. Cluster dichotomies from two thinking styles were extracted. Various supervised machine learning techniques were then applied to distinguish individuals on each dichotomy. The result showed that thinking styles of individuals on different dichotomies can be reliably distinguished on the internet using Logistic model tree with Bagging technique. The result demonstrates a high probability of the existence of digital thinking style. The findings from this study find relevance and application in human-centered graphical user interface design for recommender system as well as in e-commerce services. It also finds application in online profiling processes especially in e-learning systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2631-9; POD:978-1-5090-2632-6; USB:978-1-5090-2630-2","10.1109/IUSER.2016.7857933","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7857933","Cognitive digital signature;Individual difference;Sternberg thinking style;digital behavioral signature;supervised machine learning approach","Correlation;Education;Feature extraction;Human computer interaction;Instruments;Internet;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;computer aided instruction;electronic commerce;graphical user interfaces;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;probability;recommender systems","HCI systems;Internet;Logistic model;bagging technique;cluster dichotomy extraction;digital thinking style;e-commerce services;e-learning systems;electronic communication media;human computer interaction;human daily behavioral pattern;human-centered graphical user interface design;online education;online interaction;online profiling processes;online thinking style signature probability;recommender system;server-side web data;supervised machine learning techniques","","","","","","","23-25 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, smartphones are becoming an ad hoc tool to collect road data, while the user is at the steering wheel. In this paper, for the first time, sensed data are represented with a novel technique inspired in the bag of words representation. New results suggest that segments of accelerometer readings play a key role to characterize different classes of events, boosting classification performance. A novel data collection process was conducted in real-life environments, where the smartphones were freely placed at five user-surveyed locations, within a fleet of cars and trucks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest and most heterogenous data set for RSDs, and we make it publicly available. We approach the problem of identifying RSDs as one of supervised learning, where we contrast representative classifiers, most of them not previously reported. We exhaustively evaluated the performance of all classifiers in six data sets, most of them resembling actual data sets used in similar projects. We found that in all cases, the best classifier outperforms the best results reported so far. The proposed methodology was extensively evaluated through a sensitivity analysis to determine the relevance of the parameters. Experimental results reveal that the representation technique boosts considerably the classification performance when compared with the state of the art solutions, reducing in one order of magnitude the false-positives/negatives rate and surpassing the classification accuracy for about 10% in a multiclass data set.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2017.2662483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859473","Roadway surface disruptions;accelerometer;bag of words representation;machine learning.","Accelerometers;Automobiles;Data collection;Roads;Sensors;Smart phones;Urban areas","","","","","","","","20170221","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

This paper focuses on popularity prediction of online news by predicting whether users share an article or not, and how many users share the news adopting before publication approach. This paper proposes the gradient boosting machine for popularity prediction using features that are known before publication of articles.

Typically, the transfer process uses a combination of fine-tuning and training of adaptation layers, however, both tasks are susceptible to problems with data shortage and high computational complexity. This work proposes an improvement to the well-known AlexNet feature extraction technique. The proposed approach applies a Recursive Neural Network (RNN) structure on features extracted by a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on a large data set.

The system consists of modules of head-shoulder detection, face detection, eye detection, eye openness estimation, fusion, drowsiness measure percentage of eyelid closure (PERCLOS) estimation, and fatigue level classification. The core innovative techniques are as follows: 1) an approach to estimate the continuous level of eye openness based on spectral regression; and 2) a fusion algorithm to estimate the eye state based on adaptive integration on the multimodel detections of both eyes. A robust measure of PERCLOS on the continuous level of eye openness is defined, and the driver states are classified on it. In experiments, systematic evaluations and analysis of proposed algorithms, as well as comparison with ground truth on PERCLOS measurements, are performed.

Big Data analysis can be instrumental in realizing this potential and enhancing the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs). We study the causes of road accidents using big real-time accidents data obtained from Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) - District 4. The ultimate goal is to prevent or at least decrease traffic accidents and congestions. Our approach is based on dividing the roadway into segments, based on the infrastructure availability and the secondary accidents factors. We design a real-time Big Data system that receives online streamed data from vehicles on the road in addition to real-time average speed data from vehicles detectors on the road side to (1) Provide accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) using a Linear Regression (LR) model (2) Predict accidents and congestions before they happen using Naive Bayes (NB) and Distributed Random Forest (DRF) classifiers (3) Update ETA if an accident or a congestion takes place by predicting accurate clearance time. To make this system fast, accurate, and reliable we have implemented Lambda Architecture (LA) in our framework because of its speed, scalability, and fault tolerance.

Based on the assumption that the artistry of a text stems from its sound factors as well as its meanings, we first constructed two types of vector models, a word-based model and a syllable-based model, converted from Haiku texts. Next, we conducted machine learning for these two models using a convolutional neural network to construct a Haiku quality estimation function. We then evaluated the precision of quality estimation for 40,000 Japanese Haiku poems obtained from a Haiku community site, assuming that the number of “likes” given from viewers to a Haiku corresponds to its artistic quality. Through the experiment, we confirmed that by conducting a quality estimation based on the consensus between different models, we can improve the precision of quality estimation up to 0.64. We also found that if we evaluate Haiku poems for which we have high confidence in quality estimation certainty, the F-measure of the estimation improved from 0.57 to 0.64.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4240-1; POD:978-1-5090-4241-8","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850030","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850030","Haiku;machine learning;neural network;sentiment analysis;text mining","Computers;Convolution;Dictionaries;Estimation;Indexes;Neural networks;Sentiment analysis","art;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);literature;natural language processing;neural nets;text analysis;vectors","Japanese Haiku poem;artistic quality estimation;machine learning;neural network;syllable-based model;texts mining;vector model;word-based model","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Network traffic classification represents an essential task in the whole chain of network security. Some of the most important and widely spread applications of traffic classification are the ability to classify encrypted traffic, the identification of malicious traffic flows, and the enforcement of security policies on the use of different applications. Passively monitoring a network utilizing low-cost and low-complexity wireless local area network (WLAN) devices is desirable. Mobile devices can be used or existing office desktops can be temporarily utilized when their computational load is low. This reduces the burden on existing network hardware. The aim of this paper is to investigate traffic classification techniques for wireless communications. To aid with intrusion detection, the key goal is to passively monitor and classify different traffic types over WLAN to ensure that network security policies are adhered to. The classification of encrypted WLAN data poses some unique challenges not normally encountered in wired traffic. WLAN traffic is analyzed for features that are then used as an input to six different machine learning (ML) algorithms for traffic classification. One of these algorithms (a Gaussian mixture model incorporating a universal background model) has not been applied to wired or wireless network classification before. The authors also propose a ML algorithm that makes use of the well-known vector quantization algorithm in conjunction with a decision tree-referred to as a TRee Adaptive Parallel Vector Quantiser. This algorithm has a number of advantages over the other ML algorithms tested and is suited to wireless traffic classification. An average F-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) > 0.84 was achieved when training and testing on the same day across six distinct traffic type- .","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2562259","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7475937","Traffic classification;WI-Fi;WLAN;machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Cryptography;Feature extraction;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Wireless LAN","Gaussian processes;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN","Gaussian mixture model;ML algorithm;WLAN traffic;decision tree;intrusion detection;machine learning algorithms;network security policies;radio frequency traffic classification;tree adaptive parallel vector quantiser;wireless local area network","","","","","","20160520","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

User profiling can be used to analyze user's behavior and predict what kind of advertisement should be served to the website user. Data mining approach can be harnessed to help with user profiling process. With data mining technique, user's trace can be used as data source for behavior analysis. This research is used to do user profiling based on their browsing history stored on proxy server. Their browsing history serves as the basis of content crawling for content analysis using Multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier based text classification. The result of profiling then will be used as the basis for serving advertisement to user.

In order to improve the reliability of this form of control, in this work we propose on-the-fly knowledge composition, thereby reducing the burden of matching several patterns at the same time, and simplifying the task of the system. In particular, we show that using our method it is possible to dynamically compose a model by juxtaposing subsets of previously gathered (sample,target) pairs in real-time, rather than composing a single model in the beginning and then hoping it can reliably distinguish all patterns. Fourteen intact subjects participated in an experiment, where repetitive daily-life tasks (e.g. ironing a cloth) were performed using a commercially available dexterous prosthetic hand mounted on a splint and wirelessly controlled using a machine learning method. During the experiment, the subjects performed these tasks using myocontrol with and without knowledge composition and the results demonstrate that employing knowledge composition allowed better performance, i.e. reducing the overall task completion time by 30%.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2676467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7867869","hand prosthetics;human-machine interfaces;knowledge composition;machine learning","Indexes;Mathematical model;Prosthetics;Reliability;Sensors;Thumb;Training","","","","","","","","20170301","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, there still exist some hints to find and locate zombies even though their stealthiness and variability. To this end, one of the main concerns in designing a botnet detection system is how and which discriminating features to get. Hence, the feature extraction becomes a key issue for the purpose of developing a powerful botnet detection system.

Individuals and/or organizations are faced with increased security threats on the Internet. Many organizations prioritize on handling external security threats over internal security threats and for this reason, internal security threats are often missed or worst ignored. Domain Name System (DNS) is one of major Internet services that resolve user's request on domain name to an IP address. Since all of the user query to domain name utilize DNS to resolve the domain name or vice versa, including malicious intended user's query. Thus, DNS is a great source of information for detecting potential insider threat to detect unknown insider threats. This research aims to detect insider threats using DNS based features and these potential insider threats are clustered based on the DNS traffic features.

An agent based host sensor is developed that continuously gathers and extracts network profile of all the host processes and the modules spawned by each process of a Microsoft Windows 7 operating system. The main contributions of this paper are that a malware testing sandbox is developed using Microsoft native APIs and an information fractal (cognitive) based AdaBoost algorithm is designed and developed.

The main problem that arises to the point of view of users/customers is that, it is practically in-feasible to read all those online reviews one by one, because some of the products might have tens of thousand reviews. In this paper, reviews are collected from the sources like Amazon, Flipkart, and then used a method to combine both NLP (Natural Language Processing) and machine learning approach. Word sense disambiguation is also considered for this study. An improvised lesk algorithms is used for removing noise in the data. Different types of data have different types of properties and therefore are suited to different techniques correspondingly. This problem is closely related to the large scale nature of social networks and the necessity to perform aggregation operations, which results in the form of Pie-Chart.

To minimize economic and network instability risks, flexibility characteristics such as shiftable capacity must be known. This is traditionally done using lower level, end user, device specifications. However, with these large numbers, having lower level information, has both privacy and computational limitations. Previous studies have shown that black box forecasting of shiftable capacity, using machine learning techniques, can be done accurately for a homogeneous cluster of heating devices. This paper validates the machine learning model for a heterogeneous virtual power plant. Further it applies this model to a control strategy to offer flexibility on an imbalance market while maintaining day ahead market obligations profitably.

Moreover, the ambient conditions contribute heavily to varying temporal and spectral characteristics of the source. Further, the characteristic features of a source lie within its spectrum whereas pure spectral contents are more robust to variations along the time and frequency axis. In this work, performance of two different class of learning approaches i.e. linear and multi-linear subspace learning, have been evaluated. Moreover, spectral features are used as inputs to both the said approaches. Two linear subspace learning techniques, namely, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) along with one multi-linear subspace learning (MSL) technique, namely, multi-linear principal component analysis (MPCA) have been used. Performance of the system was evaluated using two sets of data i.e. raw acoustic dataset having samples belonging to 4 distinct classes of ships and a synthetic dataset downloaded from DOSITS, having acoustic samples belonging to 20 distinct classes of underwater objects i.e. sea species and man-made objects. For raw acoustic database, ships signatures were collected in the Indian ocean. Further, two-pass split window (TPSW) method was used to remove background noise from the processed raw acoustic samples. For classification, two neural classifiers were used, namely, robust variable learning rate feed-forward neural network (RVLR-NN) and convolution neural network (CNN). All simulations have been conducted in MATLAB. Further, the system was evaluated under the effect of noise i.e. additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) at different levels of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In addition, dimensions of the feature set were also varied and effects of dimensionality reduction on classification accuracies were observed. Simulation results observed have shown that the combinati- n of MPCA-CNN produced best classification results with an accuracy of up to 99.4%.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9073-6; POD:978-1-4673-9074-3","10.1109/IBCAST.2017.7868124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868124","Acoustic signal processing;computational complexity;dimensionality reduction;machine learning;pattern analysis;sound navigation and ranging (sonar) detection;underwater acoustics","AWGN;Acoustics;Artificial neural networks;Convolution;Databases;MATLAB;Principal component analysis","AWGN;acoustic signal processing;feedforward neural nets;object detection;principal component analysis;ships;spectral analysis;underwater sound","AWGN;DOSITS synthetic dataset;Indian ocean;Matlab;TPSW method;acoustic database;acoustic dataset;acoustic sequence;additive white Gaussian noise;convolution neural network;linear discriminant analysis;man-made objects;multilinear principal component analysis;multilinear subspace learning techniques;neural classifiers;object classification;performance evaluation;robust variable learning rate feed-forward neural network;sea species;ships signatures;signal-to-noise ratio;spectral characteristics;spectral features;temporal characteristics;two-pass split window method;underwater acoustics;underwater environment;underwater object identification","","","","","","","10-14 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study presents a method to monitor state transitions of a wind turbine based on the online inference on residuals. In a Bayesian framework the state transitions are based on a hidden variable relevant for the predictor, namely the information of the current state. Given an underlying predictive model based on a Student's t-distribution for the samples and a conditional prior on the state transition, it is shown that state transitions can be abstracted from generated data. Two models are presented, (i) assuming independence, and (ii) assuming dependence between states. In order to select the right models, machine learning is utilized to update hyper-parameters on the conditional probabilities. Comparing fixed to learned hyper-parameters points out the impact machine learning concepts have on the predictive performance of the presented models. In conclusion a study on model residuals is performed to highlight the contribution to wind turbine monitoring. The presented algorithm can consistently detect the state transition under various configurations. Comparing to heuristic interpretations of the residuals both models can qualitatively inform about the time when a state transition occurs.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2017.2674580","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862874","Bayes Procedures;Classification;Data Driven;Fault Detection;Machine Learning;Wind Turbines","Bayes methods;Data models;Fault detection;Monitoring;Time series analysis;Wind turbines","","","","","","","","20170223","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Two complementary standpoints are considered: a station-oriented operational point of view and a passenger-focused one. The first approach clusters stations based on when their activity occurs, i.e., how trips made at the stations are distributed over time. The second approach makes it possible to identify groups of passengers that have similar boarding times aggregated into weekly profiles. By applying our approaches to a real data set issued from the metropolitan area of Rennes, France, we illustrate how they can help reveal valuable insights about urban mobility, such as the presence of different station key roles, including residential stations used mostly in the mornings and work stations used only in the evening and almost exclusively during weekdays, as well as different passenger behaviors ranging from the sporadic and diffuse usage to typical commute practices. By cross comparing passenger clusters with fare types, we also highlight how certain usages are more specific to particular types of passengers.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2600515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558221","Smart cards;clustering methods;generative models;machine learning;public transport;unsupervised learning","Data mining;Planning;Predictive models;Public transportation;Smart cards;Urban areas","pattern clustering;public transport;smart cards;social sciences computing","France;Rennes;passenger behaviors;public transportation system;residential stations;smart card data clustering;urban mobility analysis;work stations","","","","","","20160901","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work we directly classify dengue molecules using their primary sequences. Thus, we have compared different methods for data classification to classify sequences of dengue molecules.

Significant efforts have been made to make smartphones rich in terms of processing capabilities and reduction on energy consumption. Despite the improvements in provision of computational, memory and energy resources with smart phones, Smart phones are still characterized as resource constrained devices. It is believed that increasing resource capabilities in smart phones cannot handle exponential increase in smart phone applications and the resultant network traffic. Cloud computing has emerged as viable solution to address the user's increasing resource requirements. To achieve computational efficiency in terms of speed, recent researches have recommended that programming codes that require intensive computational resources can be offloaded to the cloud servers. However, the accuracy of decision to offload code to cloud server can largely impact the performance of the overall system. In this paper, we propose an accurate decision making system for adaptive and dynamic nature of mobile systems by using Support Vector machine learning technique for making offloading decision locally or remotely. Proposed system is evaluated with Android-based prototype component for experiments considering different internal and external conditions (network characteristics).

Among these methods, Neural Networks (NN), or Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), recently received a great interest from researchers due to their representation capability of complex internal structures in a low dimensional subspace. However, MLPs employ document representations based on basic word level or topic-based features. Therefore, these basic representations reveal little in way of document statistical structure by only considering words or topics contained in the document as a “bag-of-words”, ignoring relations between them. We propose to remedy this weakness by extending the complex features based on Quaternion algebra presented in [1] to neural networks called QMLP. This original QMLP approach is based on hyper-complex algebra to take into consideration features dependencies in documents. New document features, based on the document structure itself, used as input of the QMLP, are also investigated in this paper, in comparison to those initially proposed in [1]. Experiments made on a SLU task from a real framework of human spoken dialogues showed that our QMLP approach associated with the proposed document features outperforms other approaches, with an accuracy gain of 2% with respect to the MLP based on real numbers and more than 3% with respect to the first Quaternion-based features proposed in [1]. We finally demonstrated that less iterations are needed by our QMLP architecture to be efficient and to reach promising accuracies.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4903-5; POD:978-1-5090-4904-2; USB:978-1-5090-4902-8","10.1109/SLT.2016.7846290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846290","Machine Learning;Neural Network;Quaternion;Spoken Language Understanding","Algebra;Artificial neural networks;Computational modeling;Natural language processing;Neurons;Quaternions","algebra;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;natural language processing","MLP;SLU;document representations;document statistical structure;machine learning;multilayer perceptron;quaternion algebra;quaternion neural networks;spoken language understanding","","","","","","","13-16 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, it is not always clear which codes will benefit from getting ported to GPU. Therefore, having a tool to estimate GPU performance for a piece of code before writing a GPU implementation is highly desirable. To this end, we propose Cross-Architecture Performance Prediction (XAPP), a machine-learning based technique that uses only single-threaded CPU implementation to predict GPU performance. Our paper is built on the two following insights: i) Execution time on GPU is a function of program properties and hardware characteristics. ii) By examining a vast array of previously implemented GPU codes along with their CPU counterparts, we can use established machine learning techniques to learn this correlation between program properties, hardware characteristics and GPU execution time. We use an adaptive two-level machine learning solution. Our results show that our tool is robust and accurate: we achieve 26.9% average error on a set of 24 real-world kernels.

The problem of event detection based on social media has attracted researchers' attention recently because of the enormous popularity of social media. Existing approaches focus on features that don't reflect full characteristics of the social network. For the purpose of this research, we define an event as an occurrence that has enough force and momentum that could create an observable change of the context of a social network. Such a definition provides us with a wider perspective through which we can view the big picture of the social network. In this research, we propose a novel framework for detecting events on social media. We introduce a temporal approach to detect structural change of the social network that reflects an occurrence of an event using machine learning algorithms. In this study, we show that processing temporal social networks captures the complete complexity of the social network, which results in a higher accuracy of event detection.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4228-9; POD:978-1-5090-4229-6","10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868467","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868467","Big data;Event detection;Machine learning;Social media analysis;data mining","Clustering algorithms;Event detection;Feature extraction;Media;Shape;Twitter","Big Data;data mining;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","Big data;event detection;machine learning;news channels;social media networks;temporal analysis;temporal social network processing","","","","","","","9-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The accurate prediction of protein methylation sites is fundamentally important for revealing the molecular mechanisms undergoing methylation. In recent years, computational prediction based on machine learning algorithms has emerged as a powerful and robust approach for identifying methylation sites, and much progress has been made in predictive performance improvement. However, the predictive performance of existing methods is not satisfactory in terms of overall accuracy. Motivated by this, we propose a novel random-forest-based predictor called MePred-RF, integrating several discriminative sequence-based feature descriptors and improving feature representation capability using a powerful feature selection technique. Importantly, unlike other methods based on multiple, complex information inputs, our proposed MePred-RF is based on sequence information alone. Comparative studies on benchmark datasets via vigorous jackknife tests indicate that our proposed MePred-RF method remarkably outperforms other state-of-the-art predictors, leading by a 4.5% average in terms of overall accuracy. A user-friendly webserver that implements the proposed method has been established for researchers’ convenience, and is now freely available for public use through http://server.malab.cn/MePred-­‐‑RF.

While conventional Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems provide some capability to collect, correlate, and detect certain events from structured messages, their rule-based correlation and detection algorithms fall short in utilizing the information within the unstructured messages. Our study explores the possibility of utilizing the techniques for data mining, text classification, natural language processing, and machine learning to detect security threats by extracting relevant information from various unstructured log messages collected from distributed non-homogeneous systems. The extracted features are used to run a number of experiments on the Packet Clearing House SKAION 2006 IARPA Dataset, and their prediction capability is evaluated. In comparison with the base case without feature extraction, an average of 16.73% performance gain and 84% time reduction was achieved using extracted features only, and a 23.48% performance gain was attained using both unstructured free-text messages and extracted features. The results also show a strong potential for further increase in performance by increasing size of training datasets and extracting more features from the unstructured log messages.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3065-1; POD:978-1-5090-3066-8","10.1109/CNS.2016.7860492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860492","SIEM;Security Information and Event Management;data mining;machine learning;named entity extraction;natural language processing;text classification;unstructured log messages","Classification algorithms;Correlation;Feature extraction;Natural language processing;Security;Text categorization","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;security of data;text analysis","Packet Clearing House SKAION 2006 IARPA Dataset;SIEM systems;advanced threat detection;computer systems;data mining;detection algorithms;distributed nonhomogeneous systems;event management;exponential growth;feature extraction;hidden information;machine learning;modern computing environment poses;natural language processing;performance gain;rule-based correlation;security information;security threat detection;sheer volume;structured messages;text classification;text mining;training datasets;unstructured free-text messages;unstructured log messages;well-trained security analysts","","","","","","","17-19 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Future predicted values of system reliability are highly sensitive to the choice of SVR parameters and the type of kernel SVR function. The dataset of a turbocharged diesel engine system was used as a case study. The Normalize Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) measure was used to evaluate the SVR model in predicting the reliability of the system. Many experimental attempts were done using the optimal SVR parameters and the proper kernel function. Results showed that Order 5 of the polynomial kernel outperformed both Gaussian and linear kernel functions in predicting the future reliability values with minimal NRMSE. Experimentally, choosing the proper parameters for the SVR is a hard process, and there are no guarantees that the good parameters and the best kernel function are used. Therefore, artificial intelligence must be used. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used as an AI search optimization method to optimize both the SVR parameters and the type of the kernel function by generating a GA-SVR model. The GA successfully optimized the SVR model to ensure accurate predictions. The adaptive GASVR model was used to overcome such problems as small size of the dataset, varying lifetimes of the system components, and odd behavior of the system because of external environmental causes. Results confirmed the efficiency of the adaptive model to predict precisely the reliability of the system, even with a small dataset.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4228-9; POD:978-1-5090-4229-6","10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868462","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868462","Elitism Selection;Gaussian kernel;Polynomial kernel;Rolette Wheel Selection;machine learning;prediction method","Adaptation models;Biological cells;Kernel;Reliability;Sociology;Statistics;Support vector machines","Gaussian processes;compressors;diesel engines;fuel systems;genetic algorithms;mean square error methods;mechanical engineering computing;regression analysis;reliability;search problems;support vector machines","AI search optimization method;Gaussian functions;NRMSE measures;adaptive GA-SVR model;adaptive support vector regression model;artificial intelligence;diesel engine system reliability forecasting;genetic algorithm;kernel SVR function;linear kernel functions;normalize root mean square error measures;optimal SVR parameters;system components;turbocharged diesel engine system","","","","","","","9-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, due to explosion of credit card transaction, it is inevitable to secure transactions. To detect credit card fraud, computational intelligence has been widely used and plays a vital role. The selection of the preeminent classifier algorithm for a fraud detection system is a very extensive problem. This paper analyzes and compares various popular classifier algorithms that have been most commonly using in detecting credit card fraud. Moreover, it focuses on the measure used to assess the classification performance and rank those algorithms. Performance evaluation experiments were carried out on UCSD-FICO Data Mining Contest 2009 dataset. The experimental results suggest that (1) though achieved classification accuracy rate is 98.25% but fraud detection success rate is below 50%, (2) meta and tree classifiers perform better than other group of classifiers. Eventually, overall success rate (fraud detection rate) should be taken into consideration to evaluate the performance of the classifiers in a fraud detection system.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4420-7; POD:978-1-5090-4421-4","10.1109/ICSEC.2016.7859947","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7859947","computational intelligence;credit card fraud detection;data mining;e-crime;expert system;machine learning","Bagging;Bayes methods;Computational efficiency;Measurement;Regression tree analysis","data mining;electronic commerce;pattern classification;security of data","UCSD-FICO Data Mining Contest;classification accuracy rate;computational intelligence;credit card fraud detection;e-commerce","","","","","","","14-17 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Visual quality assessment (VQA) aims to find an estimate of the impact of such alterations to be used, e.g., during algorithm/system design, optimization and comparisons (which employ benchmarking), or in quality monitoring. A wide variety of VQA approaches have been developed that seek agreement with the response of the human visual system to visual signal stimuli, which is very difficult to model, and hence, quite a challenge to predict. In the particular case of benchmarking and monitoring SLAs, VQA can have a big impact on the product or service under study or the parties involved, hence, one should be very cautious in trying to model the accordance with the human perception. Moreover, it is important to take the disagreement and sometimes conflicting opinions of subjects into account. Integrating machine learning (ML) modules can lead to faster and more accurate objective quality measures, but the available ML algorithms are not necessarily suitable for the task of objective quality assessment. This paper gives examples of data-driven modules in the context of benchmarking and SLAs. To this end, we continue on the work of Hemami and Reibman in this area and elaborate in particular on VQA employing so-called probabilistic pairwise preference and objective quality thresholds to enable real-life visual quality benchmarking and monitoring.","1932-4553;19324553","","10.1109/JSTSP.2016.2637164","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776805","Benchmarking;machine learning;service level agreements;visual quality assessment","Benchmark testing;Distortion;Estimation;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Quality assessment;Visualization","learning (artificial intelligence);video signal processing","SLA;VQA approach;data-driven module;human perception;human visual system;machine learning module;objective visual quality assessment;visual quality benchmarking;visual quality monitoring;visual signal stimuli","","","","","","20161207","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This is such a laborious task that high-profile compilers, supporting many architectures, cannot keep up with hardware innovation and are actually out-of-date. Iterative compilation driven by machine learning has been shown to be efficient at generating portable optimization models automatically. However, good quality models require costly, repetitive, and extensive training which greatly hinders the wide adoption of this powerful technique. In this work, we show that much of this cost is spent collecting training data, runtime measurements for different optimization decisions, which contribute little to the final heuristic. Current implementations evaluate randomly chosen, often redundant, training examples a pre-configured, almost always excessive, number of times - a large source of wasted effort. Our approach optimizes not only the selection of training examples but also the number of samples per example, independently. To evaluate, we construct 11 high-quality models which use a combination of optimization settings to predict the runtime of benchmarks from the SPAPT suite. Our novel, broadly applicable, methodology is able to reduce the training overhead by up to 26x compared to an approach with a fixed number of sample runs, transforming what is potentially months of work into days.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4931-8; POD:978-1-5090-4932-5","10.1109/CGO.2017.7863744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7863744","Active Learning;Compilers;Iterative Compilation;Machine Learning;Sequential Analysis","Hardware;Layout;Noise measurement;Optimization;Runtime;Training;Tuning","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;performance evaluation","active learning;cost minimisation;fine-tune heuristics;high-profile compilers;iterative compilation;machine learning;optimization decisions;portable optimization models;processor","","","","","","","4-8 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, we measure the classification performance of each protocol, and determine the unique features between operating systems. We utilize a genetic algorithm to determine the relevant packet header features. Then, we use several machine learning algorithms to generate set of rules that can differentiate operating systems. Overall, with IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, SSL, SSH, and FTP, protocol header information, on average, operating system classification can be performed at a rate of 68.0%, 51.6%, 98.4%, 71.1%, 78.7%, 29.2%, 25.0%, 22.5%, and 14.0%, respectively.

Computationally, chunking has been proposed as a process for compressing information also has been identified in neural processes in the brain and used in models of these processes. Our purpose in this paper is to expand understanding of how chunking impacts both learning and performance using the Computational-Unified Learning Model (C-ULM) a multi-agent computational model. Chunks in C-ULM long-term memory result from the updating of concept connection weights via statistical learning. Concept connection weight values move toward the accurate weight value needed for a task and a confusion interval reflecting certainty in the weight value is shortened each time a concept is attended in working memory and each time a task is solved, and the confusion interval is lengthened when a chunk is not retrieved over a number of cycles and each time a task solution attempt fails. The dynamic tension between these updating mechanisms allows chunks to come to represent the history of relative frequency of co-occurrence for the concept connections present in the environment; thereby encoding the statistical regularities in the environment in the long-term memory chunk network. In this paper, the computational formulation of chunking in the C-ULM is described, followed by results of simulation studies examining impacts of chunking versus no chunking on agent learning and agent effectiveness. Then, conclusions and implications of the work both for understanding human learning and for applications within cognitive informatics, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing are discussed.","","CD:978-1-5090-3845-9; Electronic:978-1-5090-3846-6; POD:978-1-5090-3847-3","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2016.7862098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7862098","Chunking;Cognitive Computing;Cognitive machine learning;Cognitive process models;Cognitive processes of the brain;Multiagent Systems;Statistical Learning;Unified Learning Model","Brain modeling;Buildings;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Education;Knowledge engineering;Statistical learning","cognition;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems","C-ULM long-term memory;chunking effects;computational-unified learning model;concept connection weight values;confusion interval;multiagent cognitive process model;statistical learning","","","","","","","22-23 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even if a server has antivirus and CPU overload checking programs, it may occasionally be broken or slowed down. Hypothetically, there are possible indications of the problems under specific external situations such as high temperature, low fan speed, and extreme main board vibration. In order to recognize the correlation between external conditions and the overloaded problems, a monitoring computer collects data from external sensors. By using an accelerometer, an anemometer, and a temperature sensor, the monitoring algorithm is able to predict the target computer's status. A web application has been developed to help server managers to remotely know how server computers are operating. This paper proposes a monitoring algorithm to diagnose server overload for a target computer, based on the Fast Fourier Transform, multivariate linear regression, and learning algorithms. As a result, this paper suggests that a monitoring algorithm can be implemented with an artificial neural network that warns of possible malfunction cases.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4228-9; POD:978-1-5090-4229-6","10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868359","Anemometer;Artificial Neural Network;Back Propagation;Classification;Computer Stress;Fast Fourier Transform;Machine Learning;Multivariate Linear Regression;Prediction Algorithm;Server Overloaded;Temperature Sensor;Tri-axis accelerometer;Warning Algorithm","Classification algorithms;Computers;Linear regression;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Servers;Temperature sensors","Internet;accelerometers;anemometers;backpropagation;fast Fourier transforms;network servers;neural nets;regression analysis;system monitoring;temperature sensors","CPU overload checking program;Web application;accelerometer;anemometer;antivirus;back propagation artificial neural network;computer status;downtime problem;extreme main board vibration;fan speed;fast Fourier transform;information loss problem;learning algorithm;malfunction;monitoring computer;multivariate linear regression;real-time server overloaded monitoring algorithm;server computer operation;server management;server overload diagnosis;temperature sensor","","","","","","","9-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a programmable accelerator for this workload domain. To architect the accelerator, we profile five representative workloads, and find that their computationally intensive portions can be formulated as matrix or vector operations generating large amounts of intermediate data, which are then reduced by a secondary operation such as array ranking, finding max/min and aggregation. The proposed accelerator, called MAPLE, has hundreds of simple processing elements (PEs) laid out in a two-dimensional grid, with two key features. First, it uses in-memory processing where on-chip memory blocks perform the secondary reduction operations. By doing so, the intermediate data are dynamically processed and never stored or sent off-chip. Second, MAPLE uses banked off-chip memory, and organizes its PEs into independent groups each with its own off-chip memory bank. These two features together allow MAPLE to scale its performance with data size. This paper describes the MAPLE architecture, explores its design space with a simulator, and illustrates how to automatically map application kernels to the hardware. We also implement a 512-PE FPGA prototype of MAPLE and find that it is 1.5-10× faster than a 2.5 GHz quad-core Xeon processor despite running at a modest 125 MHz.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-0178-7; POD:978-1-5090-5032-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7851527","Accelerator-based systems;heterogeneous computing;machine learning;parallel computing","Classification algorithms;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Kernel;Semantics;Space exploration;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;pattern classification","512-PE FPGA prototype;MAPLE architecture;application kernel mapping;classification workloads;data size;general purpose processor performance;in-memory processing;intermediate data;learning workloads;massively parallel learning-classification engine;matrix operations;off-chip memory bank;on-chip memory blocks;performance constraints;processing elements;programmable parallel accelerator;secondary reduction operations;two-dimensional grid;vector operations","","","","","","","11-15 Sept. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This research involved 25 respondents, 15 samples were used for training data, and 10 samples for the test data. The system uses the accelerometer sensor on a smartphone and smartwatch that is placed on the left hand of the user. Time series data from accelerometer value will be process by sliding window method with k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and Dynamic Time Warping as a main classification algorithm. In the feature extraction process, walking activity is not entered into the system since it has random pattern. Thus, only push up, sit up, and squat jump activities are classified into the system. On the value of k = 3, the accuracy of push up motion is 76.67%, then 80% for sit up, and 96.67% for squat jump activity.

Two aspects of vulnerability prediction models have a profound impact on their performance: 1) the features (i.e., the characteristics of the software) that are used as predictors and 2) the way those features are used in the setup of the statistical learning machinery. In a previous work, we compared models based on two different types of features: software metrics and term frequencies (text mining features). In this paper, we broaden the set of models we compare by investigating an array of techniques for the manipulation of said features. These techniques fall under the umbrella of dimensionality reduction and have the potential to improve the ability of a prediction model to localize vulnerabilities. We explore the role of dimensionality reduction through a series of cross-validation and cross-project prediction experiments. Our results show that in the case of software metrics, a dimensionality reduction technique based on confirmatory factor analysis provided an advantage when performing cross-project prediction, yielding the best F-measure for the predictions in five out of six cases. In the case of text mining, feature selection can make the prediction computationally faster, but no dimensionality reduction technique provided any other notable advantage.","0018-9529;00189529","","10.1109/TR.2016.2630503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7779151","Computer security;machine learning;software metrics;text mining","Open source software;Predictive models;Principal component analysis;Security;Software metrics;Text mining","data mining;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);software metrics;text analysis","confirmatory factor analysis;cross-project prediction experiments;cross-validation;dimensionality reduction technique;feature selection;large software projects;software metrics;statistical learning machinery;statistical prediction models;term frequencies;text mining features;vulnerability prediction models;vulnerable components","","","","","","20161209","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

McKinley","University of Texas at Austin, USA","2008 International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT)","20170213","2008","","","32","42","Communication overheads are one of the fundamental challenges in a multiprocessor system. As the number of processors on a chip increases, communication overheads and the distribution of computation and data become increasingly important performance factors. Explicit Dataflow Graph Execution (EDGE) processors, in which instructions communicate with one another directly on a distributed substrate, give the compiler control over communication overheads at a fine granularity. Prior work shows that compilers can effectively reduce fine-grained communication overheads in EDGE architectures using a spatial instruction placement algorithm with a heuristic-based cost function. While this algorithm is effective, the cost function must be painstakingly tuned. Heuristics tuned to perform well across a variety of applications leave users with little ability to tune performance-critical applications, yet we find that the best placement heuristics vary significantly with the application. First, we suggest a systematic feature selection method that reduces the feature set size based on the extent to which features affect performance. To automatically discover placement heuristics, we then use these features as input to a reinforcement learning technique, called Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), that uses a genetic algorithm to evolve neural networks. We show that NEAT outperforms simulated annealing, the most commonly used optimization technique for instruction placement. We use NEAT to learn general heuristics that are as effective as hand-tuned heuristics, but we find that improving over highly hand-tuned general heuristics is difficult. We then suggest a hierarchical approach to machine learning that classifies segments of code with similar characteristics and learns heuristics for these classes. This approach performs closer to the specialized heuristics. Together, these results suggest that learning compiler heuristics may benefit from both improved feature se- ection and classification.","","Electronic:978-1-60558-282-5; POD:978-1-5090-3021-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7849428","Compiler Heuristics;Genetic Algorithms;Instruction Scheduling;Machine Learning;Neural Networks","Benchmark testing;Learning (artificial intelligence);Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Organisms;Program processors;Registers","","","","","","","","","25-29 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Self-assembly also provides several advantages to swarm robotics. Some of these include versatility, scalability, re-configurability, cost-effectiveness, extended reliability, and capability for emergent phenomena. This work investigates the effect of self-assembly in evolutionary swarm robotics. Because of the lack of research literature within this paradigm, there are few comparisons of the different implementations of self-assembly mechanisms. This paper reports the influence of connection port configuration on evolutionary self-assembling swarm robots. The port configuration consists of the number and the relative positioning of the connection ports on each of the robot. Experimental results suggest that configuration of the connection ports can significantly impact the emergence of selfassembly in evolutionary swarm robotics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4240-1; POD:978-1-5090-4241-8","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850181","Evolutionary robotics;connection port configuration;docking mechanism;machine learning;self-assembly","Collision avoidance;Mobile robots;Ports (Computers);Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Self-assembly","evolutionary computation;multi-robot systems","connection port configuration;evolutionary swarm robotics;self-assembly mechanisms;self-assembly ports","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It consists of an electrode array inserted (implanted) in the cochlea of the ear and an external device that wirelessly connects to the electrodes. Each electrode stimulates different areas of the auditory nerve based of what frequency they represent. The sensitivity of auditory nerve fibers varies from patient to patient so upper and lower limits for each electrode must be set for each patient. Currently, this is undertaken by an operator adjusting the levels while the patient gives oral feedback. This process is both time consuming and challenging in that many patients are young children who are only partly able to provide feedback. At Oslo University Hospital, data has been collected on adjustment levels and response measurements from a number of former patients (158 have been used in this project). In this paper, we consider to what extent it is possible to predict values for new patients by using various machine learning techniques on data from previous patients. Although it is not possible to achieve fully automatic adjustments, the experiments show that a good starting point can be provided for manual adjustment. Further, the work has also shown which electrodes are most important to measure to automatically predict levels of other electrodes.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4240-1; POD:978-1-5090-4241-8","10.1109/SSCI.2016.7850063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7850063","cochlear implant;learning and adaptive control;machine learning;medical application","Auditory system;Cochlear implants;Correlation;Electrodes;Predictive models;Programming;Surgery","cochlear implants;data handling;handicapped aids;hearing;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;patient care","Oslo University Hospital;auditory nerve fibers;cochlear implant technology;deaf people;electrode array;machine learning;oral feedback;patients data;sound;speech","","","","","","","6-9 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The independence and linear restrictions are relaxed using several ICA mixture models (ICAMMs) obtaining a two-layer artificial neural network structure. This allows for dependence between sources of different classes, and thus, a myriad of multidimensional probability density functions can be accurate modeled. This paper proposes a new probabilistic distance (PDI) between the parameters learned for two ICAMMs. The PDI is computed explicitly, unlike the popular Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and other similar metrics, removing the need for numerical integration. Furthermore, the PDI is symmetric and bounded within 0 and 1, which enables its use as a posterior probability in fusion approaches. In this paper, the PDI is employed for change detection by measuring the distance between two ICAMMs learned in consecutive time windows. The changes might be associated with relevant states from a process under analysis that are explicitly reflected in the learned ICAMM parameters. The proposed distance was tested in two challenging applications using simulated and real data: 1) detecting flaws in materials using ultrasounds and 2) detecting changes in electroencephalography signals from humans performing neuropsychological tests. The results demonstrate that the PDI outperforms the KLD in change-detection capabilities.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2017.2663843","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7864437","Change detection;electroencephalographic (EEG);independent component analysis (ICA);machine learning;probabilistic distance.","Adaptation models;Brain modeling;Data models;Independent component analysis;Mixture models;Probabilistic logic;Probability density function","","","","","","","","20170224","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In particular, we address the exploration-exploitation tradeoff that faces the carrier who is unaware of users demand profiles and seeks to maximize its expected profit by applying smart pricing to incentivize users to use proactive caching. We formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem where the carrier minimizes the regret defined as the difference between the profit obtained by a genie who knows the demand profile of all users and that obtained by the given policy over a finite horizon D. Users, on the other hand, harness their predictable demands in proactively caching peak time demand to minimize their expected payments. We show that the carrier needs only to know the distribution of users demand profile in order to converge to the same profit of the case when it has an access to the demand profile, hence preserving users privacy. An iterative gradient-based policy is proposed to minimize the regret.

However, it has been fraught with decreasing nominal operating voltage and increasing manufacturing process variability that makes it harder to scale the minimum operating voltage (VMIN). In this paper, we first present a resource and core scaling (RCS) technique that jointly scales (i) the resources of a processor and (ii) the number of operating cores to maximize the performance of power-constrained multi-core processors. More specifically, we uniformly scale the resources that are both associated with each core (e.g., L1 caches and execution units (EUs)) and shared by all the cores (e.g., last-level cache (LLC)) as a means to compensate for lack of a V/F scaling range. Under the maximum power constraint, disabling some resources allows us to increase the number of operating cores, and vice versa. We demonstrate that the best RCS configuration for a given application can improve the geometric-mean performance by 21%. Second, we propose a runtime system that predicts the best RCS configuration for a given application and adapts the processor configuration accordingly at runtime. The runtime system only needs to examine a small fraction of runtime to predict the best RCS configuration with accuracy well over 90%, whereas the runtime overhead of prediction and adaptation is small. Finally, we propose to selectively scale the resources in RCS (dubbed sRCS) depending on application's characteristics and demonstrate that sRCS can offer 6% higher geometric-mean performance than RCS that uniformly scales the resources.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-2809-8; POD:978-1-5090-6607-0","10.1145/2628071.2628095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7855904","Power-constrained multi-core processor;machine learning;resource and core scaling;voltage/frequency scaling","Decoding;Dynamic scheduling;Microarchitecture;Multicore processing;Power demand;Radiation detectors;Runtime","multiprocessing systems;power aware computing","EU;RCS configuration;V/F scaling range;VMIN;core scaling;dubbed sRCS;execution units;geometric-mean performance;manufacturing process variability;maximum power constraint;minimum operating voltage;power management;power-constrained multicore processors;processor configuration;runtime resource;runtime system;voltage/frequency scaling range","","","","","","","23-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Formal concepts are autonomously generated based on collective intention of attributes and collective extension of objects elicited from informal definitions in dictionaries. A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base.

Usually a tri-static configuration is used, whereby a transmitter transmits energy with a specified polarization (horizontal or vertical) and two separate receivers receive the reflected energy. One of the receivers is co-polarized (CO) and the other is cross-polarized (X). The ratio of the CO and X signals will be high when the person is not carrying any weapon (no-threat) and that the ratio will be low in case of any concealed weapon (threat). One of the challenging tasks in such a system is to find the threshold for this ratio; a fixed threshold usually generates excessive false negatives and false positives depending on whether it is high or low enough. This paper presents a learning based approach and evaluates different classifiers to determine this decision.

To be an assistant, a robot needs to interact with human as a human. For this reason robot needs to understand the human gender, facial expression, facial gesture in real time. Ribo - A humanoid robot build in RoboSUST lab which has the ability to communicate in Bangla with the people speaking in Bengali. In this article the authors show the implementation of theoretical knowledge of the recognition of real time facial expression, detection of human gender and yes / no from facial gesture in Ribo. Real time facial expression and gender detection can be performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM). A prepared dataset containing the facial landmarks leveled as five different expression: sad, angry, smile, surprise and normal, is given to SVM to construct a classifier. For the prediction of any expression, facial images are taken in real time and provided the facial landmarks data to SVM. Local Binary Pattern(LBP) algorithm is used for extracting features from face images. These features leveled as male and female are responsible to build the classifier. The face gesture for detecting `yes/no' is performed by tracking the movement of face in a certain time. After those implementations the principal results will make a framework that will be used in Ribo to recognize human facial expression, facial gesture movement and detect human gender.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4090-2; POD:978-1-5090-4091-9","10.1109/ICCITECHN.2016.7860248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860248","Facial gesture;Human robot interaction;LBP;Landmarks;Machine Learning;Real time facial expression;Ribo;SVM","Computers;Face;Face detection;Face recognition;Real-time systems;Support vector machines","face recognition;gesture recognition;human-robot interaction;humanoid robots;robot vision;speech processing;support vector machines","Bangla;Bengali;LBP;Ribo;RoboSUST lab;SVM;face images;facial expression;facial gesture;gender detection;human gender;humanoid robot;humanoid robots;local binary pattern algorithm;personal assistant;real time vision based human robot interaction;support vector machine approach","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These algorithms analyze reviews from a group of people to find correlations between users and/or items in order to suggest top items to a querying user. The main issues with collaborative filtering are scalability and sparsity. Data sparsity creates a problem in scenarios where, a new location or activity that has not been reviewed by enough users is less likely to turn up as a recommendation. Also, users with unique interests do not benefit from such a model since the recommendations are irrespective of how relevant they may be to the user. There is also no system known to the authors, which recommends activities taking into consideration the time available with the user. Hence, a content based approach to generate a time-bound, relevant, personalized feed of `activities' in the nearby area is proposed in this paper. If the user is a die-hard trekker, into indie bands, or dislikes pub hopping, the system will always take that into consideration. Similarly, if someone only wants to spend a couple of hours and is interested in outdoor activities, he/she would be recommended ice-skating instead of hiking.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4228-9; POD:978-1-5090-4229-6","10.1109/CCWC.2017.7868485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7868485","Automatic Travel Guide;Clustering;Feature Extraction;Information Retrieval;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Personalization;Recommendation System;Sentiment Analysis;Time Estimation","Couplings;Facebook;Feature extraction;Filtering;Measurement;Mood","collaborative filtering;data handling;query processing;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Facebook;Foursquare;TripAdvisor;activity-listing services;collaborative filtering algorithm;community opinions/reviews;data sparsity;personalized time-bound activity recommendation system;user query","","","","","","","9-11 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Predictive modelling has recently emerged as a promising solution, automatically constructing heuristics from training data, however, obtaining this data can take months per platform. This is becoming an ever more critical problem as the pace of change in architecture increases. Indeed, if no solution is found we shall be left with out of date heuristics which cannot extract the best performance from modern machines. In this work, we present a low-cost predictive modelling approach for automatic heuristic construction which significantly reduces this training overhead. Typically in supervised learning the training instances are randomly selected to evaluate regardless of how much useful information they carry, but this wastes effort on parts of the space that contribute little to the quality of the produced heuristic. Our approach, on the other hand, uses active learning to select and only focus on the most useful training examples and thus reduces the training overhead. We demonstrate this technique by automatically creating a model to determine on which device to execute four parallel programs at differing problem dimensions for a representative CPU-GPU based system. Our methodology is remarkably simple and yet effective, making it a strong candidate for wide adoption. At high levels of classification accuracy the average learning speed-up is 3×, as compared to the state-of-the-art.","","Electronic:978-1-4503-2809-8; POD:978-1-5090-6607-0","10.1145/2628071.2628128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7855929","Active Learning;Compilers;Machine Learning","Acceleration;Benchmark testing;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Training","heuristic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel programming","CPU-GPU based system;active learning;active learning accelerated automatic heuristic construction;automatic heuristic construction;optimization heuristics;parallel program mapping;predictive modelling;supervised learning;training data","","","","","","","23-27 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Quality based classification of these products is being carried out manually in the industry which is tedious and expensive. Computer Vision systems can be used to automate the classification process. Automation can reduce the production cost and improve the overall quality. A computer vision system captures the image of the underlying object and transmits it to an image processor. The processor, after processing the image, presents it to a pattern recognizer. The recognizer performs the quality assessments and classifies the underlying object into pre-specified quality classes. Previous studies in this regard used minimal features to perform classification which reduces the accuracy. In the proposed approach more features are used which significantly improves the automation process. Automation process faces several challenges like identifying appropriate features and the best classifier. This study tries to grade cashew nuts based on external features like color, texture, shape and size. The effect of various pre-processing operations on the grading process is also studied. Five different classifiers were used and their performance in terms of accuracy is observed. Among the classifiers, Back Propagation Neural Network proved to be the most optimal.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0870-4; POD:978-1-5090-0871-1","10.1109/ICNGIS.2016.7854063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7854063","Automation;Image Processing;Machine Learning","Automation;Color;Computer vision;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Kernel;Shape","agricultural products;backpropagation;computer vision;feature extraction;food products;image classification;neural nets;product quality;production engineering computing","agricultural product quality;automated cashew kernel grading;back propagation neural network;classification process automation;computer vision systems;feature identification;food product quality;image processor;machine vision;pattern recognizer;prespecified quality classes;production cost reduction;quality assessments;quality based classification","","","","","","","1-3 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a framework of OFS using the characteristics of multi-agent systems (MAS) to overcome this challenge. We propose firstly a new OFS model; Agent-Learner based OFS (ALOFS) which represents each agent in our MAS. ALOFS is a generalization of first-order and second-order online learning methods based feature selection. Secondly, we propose the Multi Agent-Learner based OFS (MALOFS) system which is our MAS. MALOFS uses two levels of selection: the first level aims to select the more confident learners and the second level has as object to select the relevant features using a proposed negotiation method (MANOFS).

The main purpose is to automatically assess the quality of image in agreement with human visual perception. The used attributes (quality metrics) and evaluation criteria (human rating mean opinion score MOS) are extracted from image quality database TID2013. The fuzzy model design starts by selecting the most independent attributes, by applying Pearson's correlation approach and seeking the most correlated metrics with the corresponding MOS. Then, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is applied in order to construct an objective fuzzy model able to efficiently predict the image quality correlated with the subjective MOS. In this paper, different fuzzy models are produced by modifying certain ANFIS configurations. After that, we select the appropriate ANFIS model that provides high prediction accuracy and stability with taking into account its implementation complexity. The overall architecture of the selected FL model consists of four input metrics, two bell-shaped membership functions associated to each input metric, two fuzzy if-then rules, two linear combination equations and one output which gives the image adequate quality score. Finally the performance of the proposed fuzzy model is compared with other IQA models produced by different machine learning methods, the simulation results demonstrate that the fuzzy logic model has a high stable behavior with the best agreement with human visual perception.","","Electronic:979-1-0922-7915-3; POD:978-1-5090-3085-9","10.1109/DASIP.2016.7853803","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7853803","ANFIS;Fuzzy Inference System;Fuzzy Logic;Image Quality Assessment;Machine Learning","Correlation;Fuzzy logic;Image quality;Mathematical model;Measurement;Predictive models;Training","correlation methods;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);linear algebra","ANFIS;FL modeling;MOS;Pearson correlation approach;adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system;bell-shaped membership functions;correlated metrics;fuzzy if-then rules;fuzzy logic modeling;fuzzy model design;human rating mean opinion score;human visual perception;image quality database TID2013;linear combination equations;machine learning methods;objective IQA;objective image quality assessment","","","","","","","12-14 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design, develop and evaluate an application that able to determine whether targeted website is malicious or not by utilizing available detection APIs. These APIs are able to communicate with several public scanners and Malware repositories. While the availability of many public scanners can help utilize those public services, however due to the fact that in most cases, they produce conflicting decisions, the process to make a final detection inference is not a trivial task.
