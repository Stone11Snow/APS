Based on the analysis of structural transitions, we derive a new incremental pairwise clustering method which increases the number of clusters until a certain value of a Lagrange multiplier is reached. In addition, the calculation of phase transitions is used for speed-up. The incremental duplication of clusters helps to avoid local optima, and the stopping criterion automatically determines the number of clusters.

Emphasis is placed on ranking problems in question answering, where the frequency of correct candidates is very low but a single correct answer at one of the top ranks is often sufficient. Since existing tree learners handle this task poorly, decision tree induction is reformulated in such a way that it directly optimizes a given measure of ranking quality (such as mean reciprocal rank or mean average precision). This change also makes it possible to incorporate a priori knowledge about the positive or negative effect of an attribute on ranking quality. Results are further improved by applying a stratified form of bagging. In a passage reranking task using factoid questions from the QA.CLEF evaluations, the new method outperforms existing tree induction techniques by a large margin.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381836","focused retrieval;learning to rank;mean reciprocal rank (MRR);probability estimation tree (PET);question answering (QA)","Bagging;Current measurement;Decision trees;Frequency estimation;Induction generators;Information retrieval;Learning systems;Machine learning;Positron emission tomography;Training data","decision trees;information retrieval;probability","answer passages;decision tree induction;mean average precision;mean reciprocal rank;passage reranking task;probability-based ranking;question answering system","","0","","17","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Estimating an Optimal Correlation Structure from Replicated Molecular Profiling Data Using Finite Mixture Models","L. R. Acharya; D. Zhu","Dept. of Comput.

However, the commonly used Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) approaches, do not automatically accommodate replicated measurements. Often, an ad hoc step of preprocessing e.g. averaging, either weighted, un-weighted or something in between is needed, which might wipe out important patterns of low magnitude and/or cancel out patterns of similar magnitude. We treat each replicate individually as a random variable and design a finite mixture model to estimate an optimal correlation structure from replicated molecular profiling data. Assuming that the measurements are independently, identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from a mixture of two multivariate normal distributions, one with a constrained set of parameters and the other with an unconstrained parameter structure, we employ an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate component parameters. We carry out a comparative study, including both simulations and real-world data analysis, to assess the estimation of correlation structure using the proposed model and the constrained model given by the first component of the mixture. The two models were further tested for their performances in clustering real-world data. The mixture model approach is shown to have an overall better performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.53","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381811","","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Data analysis;Gaussian distribution;Machine learning;Maximum likelihood estimation;Pattern analysis;Random variables;Robustness","biology computing;expectation-maximisation algorithm;genetics;molecular biophysics;normal distribution;parameter estimation","component parameters estimation;expectation-maximization algorithm;finite mixture models;gene set;maximum likelihood estimates;multivariate normal distributions;optimal correlation structure;pattern analysis;replicated molecular profiling data;ubiquitous problem;unconstrained parameter structure","","0","","17","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"An Instance-Based Learning Approach for Available-Memory Non-minimal Cost-Bounded Search","S. K. Namilikonda; N. R. Mahapatra","Dept. of Electr. & Comput.

But, such limited-memory cost-bounded search algorithms can bear a huge overhead relative to BFBB due to re-expanding nodes with cost less than C* (essential nodes), equal to C* (boundary nodes) and/or exceeding C* (non-essential nodes) where C* denotes the cost of an optimal solution. Our contributions in this paper are two fold. First, we propose a novel available-memory non-minimal cost-bounded search method (AM-NCBS KBEST) that tries to minimize the search overhead on a single problem instance by striking a trade-off between essential node re-expansion and non-essential node expansion depending upon the value of a cost bound choice parameter ' K'. We show that this new strategy reduces the search overhead of the previous best available-memory costbounded search strategy by at least half even for the most conservative values of ' K'. Next, we present a learning-based approach (AM-NCBS KLEARN) to intelligently predict nonminimal cost-bounds for solving a new problem instance by analyzing various cost bound choices that when used over the course of the search, on a number of previously solved instances, result in the least cumulative overhead on an average. We demonstrate on a set of 100 problem instances that the learning based approach further reduces AM-NCBS KBEST's overhead that may ensue due to bad choices of 'K'.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381835","branch-and-bound;heuristic search;instance-based learning;limited-memory search","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computational modeling;Cost function;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Neural networks;Runtime;Search methods;Upper bound","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;tree searching","available-memory nonminimal cost-bounded search;best-first branch-and-bound;discrete optimization problems;instance-based learning;iterative-deepening cost-bounded tree search algorithms;limited-memory cost-bounded search algorithms;search tree depth","","0","","16","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method is based on a localized dimension reduction penalty added to the objective function for training a hyper basis function (hyper BF or generalized RBF) neural network. The localized dimension reduction in a hyper BF network is motivated by the fact that many patterns are recognized to belong to one class due to the co-occurrence of specific values along a specific set of dimensions. Furthermore, one class is very likely to be composed of multiple sub-models that are different in their characteristics. The proposed method is applied at multiple iterations. Features are ranked each iteration and a smaller subset is passed to the next iteration. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to evaluate the remaining dimensions in a ten-fold cross validation setting. Experimental results show the proposed method effectively reduces the number of dimensions from 54,613 to 65 while increasing the cross-validation classification accuracy from 92.3% to 96.4%.

Our researches proved that the potential of electricity from biogas is 1/5-1/3 of total electricity consume in TRNC. In addition, when biogas is used to produce electricity, there is the added potential for harvesting hot water and steam from the engine's exhaust and cooling systems. Combining hot water and steam recovery with electricity generation may provide an overall conversion efficiency of 80% or more. Following the methane gas extraction from the manure and farm waste, the remaining fermented manure turns out to be a lot more suitable for use as a fertilizer in the farm, and as a matter of fact its productivity efficiency in comparison to its original form is enhanced by at least 20% - 25%.

We present a multi-region tracking algorithm to follow lung tumors on CT projections and in-treatment portal image movies before and during external beam radiotherapy, respectively. Finding suitable landmarks for tracking is challenging due to low contrast in the images. We begin by defining a large set of landmark candidates and a sequence of training images representing the range of tumor motion. Each landmark is found automatically by seeking regions of maximum variance in the image gray values. Small, square templates are centered around each landmark to be used for tracking in sequential MV images. An iterative learning algorithm is employed to select the most suitable templates among the large collection of candidates for the training data set. This subset of templates is then applied to a similar data set for testing. The results of the automatic multi-template selection and tracking compare well to those of manually selected single template tracking. The algorithm shows great promise as a technique for automatically tracking lung tumors in beam's-eye-view in-treatment images without the need for implanted radiopaque fiducials.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381452","epid;lung tumor;tumor motion","Anatomy;Biomedical imaging;Computed tomography;Image reconstruction;Lung neoplasms;Machine learning;Medical treatment;Pattern matching;Portals;Target tracking","computerised tomography;image colour analysis;image motion analysis;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;optical tracking;radiation therapy;tumours","CT projection;beam radiotherapy;eye-view MV image sequence;eye-view in-treatment image;image gray value;iterative learning;lung tumor tracking;motion assessment;multiregion tracking;tumor motion","","2","","13","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Presented in this paper is an approach to differentially expressed gene identification based on a Separability Index (SI). Features are selected by identifying the optimal number of top ranking genes which result in maximum class separability. The approach was implemented on a training dataset comprising 400 samples from three types of cancers: colon, breast and lung cancer. The top 4222 genes resulted in a maximum separability of 91%. These genes were then used to classify a testing dataset comprising 250 samples, using a K-nearest neighbour (K-NN) classifier, achieving an accuracy of 92%. This outperformed a K-NN classifier trained on features selected based on p Â¿1:8311 Ã 10<sup>-7</sup> (Bonferroni corrected p-value cut-off criterion of p Â¿0:01), which achieved an accuracy of 89.6%. The performance is attributed to the non-arbitrary nature of the maximum SI selection criterion, which is an inherent property of the data, as opposed to the arbitrary assignment of a p-value cut-off. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify clusters of genes, amongst the 4222 genes, with similar expression patterns for each of the three cancers.

We show that both classifiers achieve practically identical classification accuracy and generalization performance. However, SVM-L has many fewer support vectors than SVM-Q.

For a large set of time-dependent sequential data, the generalization ability can be determined based on algebraic geometry. However, there has been no theoretical analysis for the case of an infinitely long sequence. Therefore, the present paper experimentally determines a number of unique properties of the likelihood function and explains these properties theoretically.

To install a new wind energy turbine, measurement and evaluation of the meteorological data are quite important. In this paper, a novel system is developed for the installation of wind turbines. Firstly, necessary data including the speed and the direction of wind, the solar insolation, the ultraviolet radiation and the rainfall are received from a meteorology station, and then data acquired are converted into useful information using a rule-based inference mechanism. Finally, the useful information obtained are evaluated in a Naive Bayes algorithm. The power and the size of wind turbine are determined automatically using data measured.

This article explains how PSG models are learnt and how probabilities for model instances are derived. It shows how to use PSG models to perform MAP classification, and presents evaluation of learnt models in the context of image understanding. Here, we classify observable object structures in the domain of building facade images (average classification rate Â¿ 80%).

After this mapping, the most likely graph structure can be found in cubic time with respect to the number of nodes using max flow methods. Furthermore, in some instances, the combinatorial optimization problem can be solved exactly in near quadratic time by loopy belief propagation and max product updates even if the original input graph is dense.

For the data sets considered, coefficients determined using CMSA-ES were identical to coefficients generated with NR, while coefficients from PSO- and ACO-based logistic regression were only slightly different.

Techniques for fluoroscopic gating without implanted fiducial markers have been developed in a classification framework. Due to the high-dimensionality nature of the images, dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) were used to preprocess the data. In this work, we have applied generalized linear discriminant analysis (GLDA) to the respiratory gating problem. The fundamental difference from conventional dimensionality reduction techniques is that GLDA explicitly takes into account the label information available in the training set and therefore is efficient for discrimination among classes. On average, GLDA was demonstrated to perform similarly with PCA trained with SVM at high nominal duty cycles and outperform PCA in terms of classification accuracy (CA) and target coverage (TC) at lower nominal duty cycle (20%). A major advantage of GLDA is its robustness, while CA and TC using PCA can be reduced by up to 10% depending on the data dimensionality. With only 1-dimensional feature vectors, GLDA is much more computationally efficient than PCA. Therefore, GLDA is an effective and efficient method for respiratory gating with markerless fluoroscopic images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381464","","Cancer;Feature extraction;Linear discriminant analysis;Lung neoplasms;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Windows","cancer;diagnostic radiography;image motion analysis;lung;medical image processing;pneumodynamics;principal component analysis;radiation therapy;tumours","SVM;classification accuracy;dimensionality reduction;generalized linear discriminant analysis;implanted fiducial markers;lung cancer;markerless fluoroscopic gating;principal component analysis;radiation dose;respiratory gated radiotherapy;target coverage;tumor","","0","","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Common applications includes speech recognition, language processing (tagging, chunking) and bioinformatics. Many solutions have been proposed to partially cope with this problem. These include probabilistic models (HMMs, CRFs) and machine learning algorithm (SVM, Neural nets). In practice, the best results have been obtained by combining several of these methods. However, fusing different signal segmentation methods is not straightforward, particularly when integrating prior information. In this paper the sequence labeling problem is viewed as a multi objective optimization task. Each objective targets a different aspect of sequence labelling such as good classification, temporal stability and change detection. The resulting optimization problem turns out to be non convex and plagued with numerous local minima. A region growing algorithm is proposed as a method for finding a solution to this multi functional optimization task.

While there have been studies relating such measurement-while-drilling (MWD) parameters to rock properties, none of them has attempted to model context, that is, to associate local measurements with measurements obtained in neighbouring regions. This paper proposes a novel approach to infer geology from drill measurements by incorporating spatial relationships through a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework. A boosting algorithm is used as a local classifier mapping drill measurements to corresponding geological categories. The CRF then uses this local information in conjunction with neighbouring measurements to jointly reason about their categories. Model parameters are learned from training data by maximizing the pseudo-likelihood. The probability distribution of classified borehole sections is calculated using belief propagation. We present experimental results of applying the method to MWD data collected from a semi-autonomous drill rig at an iron ore mine in Western Australia.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381511","Conditional random fields;boosting;measurement-while-drilling;mining automation","Belief propagation;Boosting;Context modeling;Geologic measurements;Geology;Iron;Ores;Performance analysis;Probability distribution;Training data","belief maintenance;drilling (geotechnical);geology;mining industry;production engineering computing;rocks;statistical distributions","belief propagation;boosting algorithm;classified borehole sections;conditional random fields;drill measurements;drill performance data;geological categories;iron ore mine;local classifier mapping;measurement-while-drilling parameters;probability distribution;pseudolikelihood;rock characterization;rock properties;semiautonomous drill rig;spatial relationship;subsurface geology","","2","","17","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method incorporates the underlying statistical framework of biological evolutionary models into the generic context of evolutionary algorithms. By using such model, besides adapting the mutation rate, this method aims to wisely determine the types of replacing genes in the mutation procedure. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, the method is evaluated using a wide array of test functions and the outcome is compared with a state-of-the-art adaptive mutation evolutionary algorithm.

Because of the properties of radial basis function (RBF) interpolators, they are good candidates for use in BEMD. However, only one or two of the RBF interpolators have been utilized for BEMD so far. This paper employs seven RBF interpolators for BEMD, compares their performances, and finds out the useful ones for BEMD. The analysis is done using synthetic and real texture images. Simulations are made to focus mainly on the effect of interpolation methods by providing less or negligible control on the other parameters of the BEMD process.

Our approach effectively combines the advantages of standard semisupervised mixtures, which achieve label extrapolation over a mixture component when there are few labeled samples, and nearest-neighbor (NN) classification, which achieves accurate classification in the local vicinity of labeled samples. Toward this end, we propose a two-stage stochastic data generation mechanism, with the unlabeled samples first produced and then the labeled samples generated conditioned on both the unlabeled data and on their components of origin. This nested data generation entails a more complicated (albeit still closed-form) E-step evaluation than that for standard mixtures. Our model is advantageous, compared with previous semisupervised mixtures, when mixture components model data from more than one class and when within-component class proportions are not constant over the feature space region ldquoownedrdquo by a component.

Currently most of the hard drive vendors support self-monitoring, analysis and reporting technology (SMART) which are often considered unreliable for such tasks. The problem of finding alternatives to SMART for predicting disk failure is an area of active research. In this paper, we consider events recorded from live disks and show that it is possible to construct decision support systems which can detect such failures. It is desired that any such prediction methodology should have high accuracy and ease of interpretability. Black box models can deliver highly accurate solutions but do not provide an understanding of events which explains the decision given by it. To this end we explore rule based classifiers for predicting hard disk failures from various disk events.

We use a wrapper-based attribute ranking technique to select a subset of attributes, and the random undersampling technique (RUS) on the majority class to alleviate the negative effects of imbalanced data on the prediction models. The datasets used in the empirical study were collected from numerous software projects. Five data preprocessing scenarios were explored in these experiments, including: (1) training on the original, unaltered fit dataset, (2) training on a sampled version of the fit dataset, (3) training on an unsampled version of the fit dataset using only the attributes chosen by feature selection based on the unsampled fit dataset, (4) training on an unsampled version of the fit dataset using only the attributes chosen by feature selection based on a sampled version of the fit dataset, and (5) training on a sampled version of the fit dataset using only the attributes chosen by feature selection based on the sampled version of the fit dataset. We compared the performances of the classification models constructed over these five different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the classification models constructed on the sampled fit data with or without feature selection (case 2 and case 5) significantly outperformed the classification models built with the other cases (unsampled fit data). Moreover, the two scenarios using sampled data (case 2 and case 5) showed very similar performances, but the subset of attributes (case 5) is only around 15% or 30% of the complete set of attributes (case 2).","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381844","feature selection;imbalanced data;software defect prediction;wrapper-based attribute ranking","Application software;Data engineering;Data mining;Data preprocessing;Machine learning;Predictive models;Project management;Sampling methods;Software measurement;Software quality","fault diagnosis;software fault tolerance;software quality","attribute selection;binary class imbalanced data;classification model;data sampling;feature selection;learning impact;random undersampling technique;software defect prediction;software quality engineering;wrapper-based attribute ranking","","6","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most tempo estimation systems focus mainly on detecting the temporal repetition and periodicity present within a signal, and represent tempo as a count of beats-per-minute (BPM). However, in real-world music retrieval applications such as music navigation and playlist generation, a rough perceptual representation of tempo may be more appropriate than a BPM representation. In this paper, the problem of tempo estimation is presented as a statistical classification problem. Four perceptual tempo classes are defined which correspond to rough semantic terms that average users may use to describe tempo. Statistical models of each class are built using low-level audio features. Experimental results show that the perceptual tempo class representation outperforms several conventional BPM-based tempo estimation systems when applied to the tasks of music navigation and playlist generation.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.54","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381398","music classification;music information retrieval;music navigation;music similarity;perceptual tempo;playlist generation;tempo estimation","Acoustic distortion;Humans;Instruments;Machine learning;Mood;Music information retrieval;Navigation;Testing","audio signal processing;classification;information retrieval;music;statistical analysis","automatic tempo estimation;beats-per-minute;class-based representation;low-level audio features;music categorization;music navigation;music retrieval;perceptual tempo;playlist generation;rough semantic terms;statistical classification problem;statistical models","","1","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Odometry modeling is one of the main approaches to solving the localization problem, the other being a sensor based correspondence solver. Currently few robot positioning systems support calibration of odometry errors in both feature rich indoor and landmark poor outdoor environments. To achieve good performance in various environments, the mobile robot has to be able to learn to localize in unknown environments, and reuse previously computed environment specific localization models. This paper presents a method combining the standard Back-Propagation technique and a feed-forward neural network model for odometry calibration for both synchronous and differential drive mobile robots. This novel method is compared with a generic localization module and an optimization based approach, and found to minimize odometry error because of its nonlinear input-output mapping ability.

However, these linear representation methods are not optimal in general. Sphere factor analysis (SFA) is a recently proposed method which provides a general framework for optimization problems. In term of object recognition, SFA seeks to optimize the discriminant ability of the nearest neighbor classifier for data classification and labeling. Based on the geometry structure of the search space, a gradient search algorithms have been applied to obtain an optimal basis. A detail presentation of these algorithm is given in this paper. Furthermore, to speed up the search procedure of SFA, a two-stage strategy is proposed, which we called two-stage SFA.

There are five variants that use forward/backward search, single/multiple operators, and depth-first/breadth-first search. On four hand gesture data sets, we compare the performance of MSUMO with the optimal parameter set found by exhaustive search in terms of expected error and computational complexity.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381824","Hidden Markov model;cross-validation;model selection","Application software;Bayesian methods;Computational complexity;Computer architecture;Data engineering;Graphical models;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;State-space methods","computational complexity;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;tree searching","computational complexity;cross-validation;depth-first/breadth-first search;forward/backward search;hand gesture data sets;hidden Markov model;incremental model selection algorithm;multiparameter learning problem;single/multiple operators;state space search","","0","","16","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been well-studied in the past research that the most widely used performance measure, the overall accuracy of the model, can lead to sub-optimal classification models when learning from imbalanced datasets. In order to overcome this problem, other performance measures, such as the geometric-mean (Gm) and F-measure (Fm), have been used for imbalanced dataset learning. Training a classifier system with an imbalanced dataset (where the positive class is the minority class) would usually produce sub-optimal models having a higher specificity (SP) and a lower sensitivity (SE). By applying class imbalance learning methods, we would often be able to increase the SE by sacrificing some amount of SP. In some type of real world imbalanced classification problems, such as the gene finding Bioinformatics problems, it is important to improve the SE as much as possible by keeping the reduction of SP to the minimum. In this paper, we show that with respect to this type of classification problems the existing performance measures used in class imbalance learning (Gm and Fm) can still result in sub-optimal classification models. In order to circumvent these problems, we introduced a new performance measure, called adjusted geometric-mean (AGm). We show, both analytically and empirically on two real-world Bioinformatics datasets, that AGm can perform better than Gm and Fm metrics.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381421","Bioinformatics;Class Imbalance Learning;Model Selection;Performance Measures;SVMs","Bioinformatics;Costs;Data processing;Electronic mail;Laboratories;Learning systems;Machine learning;Performance analysis;Predictive models;Proteins","bioinformatics;classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","adjusted geometric-mean;bioinformatics;class imbalance learning;imbalanced dataset learning;suboptimal classification models","","10","","17","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The strong independence assumption inherent in the bag-of-features representation is not realistic however: patches often overlap and share underlying image structures. Moreover, important information with respect to relative scales of the features is completely ignored, for the sake of scale invariance. Considering both spatial and scale-based constraints one can derive spatially constrained natural feature hierarchies within images. We explore the use of topic models that build such spatially constrained scale-induced hierarchies of the features in an unsupervised fashion. Our model uses standard topic models as a starting point. We then incorporate information about the hierarchical and spatial relations of the features into the model.

A conventional approach to video hashing is to apply image hashing techniques to either every frame or to the selected key frames of a video sequence. Both approaches ignore the temporal information contained in a video sequence. This study proposes an approach for generating representative images of a video sequence that carry the temporal as well as the spatial information. These images are denoted as TIRIs, Temporally Informative Representative Images. Performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying a simple image hashing technique on TIRIs of a video database. It is shown that the resulted video hashing algorithm is highly robust to noise, frame dropping, changes in brightness and contrast, as well as a range of geometric attacks. An average true positive rate of 99.2% and false positive rate of 0.4% of the proposed approach demonstrate the robustness and uniqueness of the generated hashes. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach is easy to implement and computationally more efficient than another state-of-the-art video hashing method.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.32","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381796","content-based fingerprinting;robust hashing;video copy detection","Application software;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Machine learning;Noise robustness;Spatial databases;Video sequences;Video sharing;Videoconference;Watermarking","cryptography;video databases;video signal processing","content-based video hashing;image hashing technique;temporally informative representative image;video copy detection;video database","","7","","10","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this approach suffers from a huge mass of generated rules which leads to a waste of time and space. In this work, we propose a new associative classification method. This method is based on FCP-Growth-P, an algorithm which generates only class itemsets and integrates for pruning the specialization condition of Li. Thus one saves both execution time and storage space. The phase of classification is based on a reduced base of the most significant rules leading to each class, which ensures the speed of the method.

These data are often used to build models that explain relationships between the measured variables, and are eventually used for planning and control purposes. However, these measurements cannot always be exact, systems can change over time, and discovering these facts or fixing these problems is not always feasible. Therefore it is important to formally describe the degree to which the model can tolerate noise, in order to keep near optimal behavior. The problem of finding tolerance bounds has been the focus of many studies for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) due to their usefulness in practical applications. In this paper, we consider Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs), which is a more realistic extension of MDPs with a wider scope of applications. We address two types of perturbations in POMDP model parameters, namely additive and multiplicative, and provide theoretical bounds for the impact of these changes in the value function.

We assume that the information in Local Network (cellular network) can be freely exchanged with Global IP Network (NGN) and the information can be gathered in a database. Location Based Services (LBS) in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) also provide location information for the data sets. Statistic classification methods are applied to the data sets in the database. We distinguish two cases: (a) Learning the geographic regions in which certain events happen. Depending on the information provided by the users, they are divided into different user groups (event classes) using Type Filters (TF). Then discriminant analysis is applied to the position information offered by LBS in IMS to determine the geographic regions of the different classes. (b) Learning events that happen inside certain geographic regions. The observed area is divided into different geographic regions (location classes) using Location Filter (LF).

It automatically controls the generation on which it exchanges ACO for EAX by observing diversity and convergence of chromosomes generated by ACO with both lengths and their variance. It uses ACO in early stage of generations to create variable local optimum solutions and it uses EAX in later stage of generations efficiently to generate global optimum solutions using chromosomes generated by ACO. If it cannot find the optimum solution in this trial it makes ACO regenerate new chromosomes to merge with the last best solution searched through EAX in order to maintain diversity of chromosomes, before it makes EAX reproduce better solutions with the merged chromosomes.

The relevance weights are set local and depend on the symbols and the states. In particular, we associate a partial probability with each symbol in each subspace. The overall observation state probability is then computed as an aggregation of the partial probabilities and their objective relevance weights based on a linear combination. The minimum classification error (MCE) objective based on the gradient probabilistic descent (GPD) optimization algorithm is reformulated to derive the update equations for the relevance weights and the partial state probabilities.

It has been demonstrated that the fusion of dimensionality reduction methods, either by fusing classifiers obtained from each set of reduced features, or by fusing all reduced features are better than using any single dimensionality reduction method. However, none of the fusion methods consistently outperform the use of a single dimensionality reduction method. Therefore, a new way of fusing features and classifiers is proposed, which is based on searching for the optimal number of dimensions for each considered dimensionality reduction method. An empirical evaluation on microarray classification is presented, comparing classifier and feature fusion with and without the proposed method, in conjunction with three dimensionality reduction methods; principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares (PLS) and information gain (IG). The new classifier fusion method outperforms the previous in 4 out of 8 cases, and is on par with the best single dimensionality reduction method. The novel feature fusion method is however outperformed by the previous method, which selects the same number of features from each dimensionality reduction method. Hence, it is concluded that the idea of optimizing the number of features separately for each dimensionality reduction method can only be recommended for classifier fusion.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5382108","classifier fusion;dimensionality reduction;feature fusion;microarrays;nearest neighbor classification","Application software;Cancer;Gene expression;High performance computing;Least squares methods;Machine learning;Medical treatment;Nearest neighbor searches;Optimization methods;Principal component analysis","data reduction;pattern classification;principal component analysis","dimensionality reduction methods;feature fusion method;high dimensional data;information gain;microarray classification;nearest neighbor classification;partial least squares;principal component analysis","","1","","19","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Actions are considered similar if they, with high probability, lead to future results with sufficient commonality.

Both experiments perform perfectly on all tests.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.97","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5382100","","Biological system modeling;Content addressable storage;Equations;Fatigue;Fires;Grounding;Hebbian theory;Labeling;Natural languages;Neurons","Hebbian learning;natural language processing;virtual reality","Hebbian learning rule;fLIF neuron;labelling;natural language command;pronoun resolution;symbol grounding problem;virtual world;visual item;visual representation","","0","","22","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Contextual Analysis Processing Able to Interpret Coherence of Knowledge Representations Related to Reputation","M. Itoh","Keio Univ., Yokohama, Japan","2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20100115","2009","","","528","535","A processing technique of interpretation able to capture coherence of contents of multiple foci among sequential concepts and phenomena, disambiguating contextual knowledge representations, is described in this paper. The proposed system can capture cohesion of expressive but simultaneously complicated sentence structures, utilizing the construction of four novel sentence pattern - any Japanese sentence being classifiable into one of these - which clarify role relations between words related with an absolute expression, of unchangeable meaning, called CEE within the predicate. For instance, having a ""big heart"", a tolerant mind, and, ""pretty girl"", are both usually understood as a quality; whereas the expressions Â¿big words"" and ""pretty boy"", or effeminate boy, have rather a pejorative connotation. To resolve such contextual ambiguity, the system achieves an accurate contextual analysis, by identifying the overall role relationships between semantic representations. For the determination of the evaluation polarity, in a corpus composed of 2500 customer reviews, the correct answer rate reached 75.0%.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.88","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381427","A more realistic natural language application;Coherence of contents of multiple foci;Disambiguating contextual knowledge representations;Representations of unchangeable meaning called CEE;Reputation","Brightness;Heart;Internet;Knowledge representation;Machine learning;Mood;Natural languages;Object detection","knowledge representation;natural language processing","Japanese sentence;contextual ambiguity;contextual analysis processing;contextual knowledge representation;evaluation polarity;pejorative connotation;reputation;sentence pattern;sentence structures;sequential concept","","0","","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Mining Interesting Ratio Patterns over a Stream Sliding Window","W. Fan; T. Watanabe; K. Asakura","Nagoya Univ., Nagoya, Japan","2009 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20100115","2009","","","731","734","In this paper, we aim to capture dependency among high correlated attributes in a sliding window of data streams at any time. Naive solutions cannot address combinatorial explosion problems. In order to generate highly correlated sets, we propose a candidate-generation rule based on Jaccard distance, and a generation method based on min-hashing functions to estimate the Jaccard distance without requiring to count supports explicitly. For mining frequent ratios, we introduce a concept of ratio range to reduce the candidate ratio sets efficiently. Additionally, the downward closure property of ratio patterns is also available to prune candidate sets. Our extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets verify the efficiency of our algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381325","Ratio pattern;correlation mining;data stream","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Explosions;Machine learning;Mutual information;Time factors;Transaction databases","data mining;file organisation","Jaccard distance;candidate ratio sets;candidate-generation rule;data stream sliding window;downward closure property;frequent ratio mining;highly correlated sets;min-hashing functions;ratio pattern mining","","0","","5","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
