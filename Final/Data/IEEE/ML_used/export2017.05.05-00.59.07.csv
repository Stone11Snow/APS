In this paper, some critical factors influencing retail supply chains were investigated. In the beginning, most shelf replenishment policies using in retail stores were investigated. We would then look at those policies which cause shelf replenishment delays and sales lost. There are two basic shelf replenishment policies, namely, the push and pull styles operations. The policypsilas impacts to the efficiency of retail supply chain were analyzed and compared. In the second part of the paper, RFID hardware devices installed in retail store is assumed. Based on a real case study, the devices setup is transferred to model in simulation software. By using simulation analysis, we hoped to estimate RFIDpsilas impacts to different shelf replenishment policies in retail store.

Since the patterns of daily load are treated precedingly, the rule of the historical data sequence is more obvious. Accordingly, we need not input pattern characters when establishing ANN load forecasting model. The model has many advantages: first, since the training data has similar pattern to the forecasting day, the odel reflects the rule of daily load accurately and improves forecasting precision accordingly; second, as the pattern variables need not to be input into model, the mapping of the categorical variables is solved; third, as inputs are reduced, the model is simplified and the runtime is lessened.

As noise values do exist in all microarray data even after microarray data preprocessing stage, robustness is therefore another very important criteria in addition to accuracy for evaluating reliable microarray classification algorithms. In this paper, we conduct experimental comparison of our newly developed MDMT with C4.5, BaggingC4.5, Ad-aBoostingC4.5, Random Forest and CS4 on four microarray cancer data sets. We test and evaluate how well a given single or ensemble classifier can tolerate noise data in unseen test datasets, particularly with increasing levels of noise. The experimental results show that MDMT tolerates the noise values in unseen test data sets better than other compared methods do, particularly with increasing levels of noise data. We observe that a random forests is comparable to MDMT in term of resistance to noise. The experimental results also show that ensemble decision tree methods tolerate the noise values better than single tree C4.5 does. We conclude that avoiding overlapping genes exist among the ensemble trees is an intuitive, simple and effective way to achieve higher degree of diversity for ensemble decision tree methods.

To simulate images recognition and understanding procedure implemented in the human vision system, ordinary Kriging algorithm is introduced to create grey-scale based grids.

And a novel face reconstruction method is proposed. The method firstly decomposes the face image by multi-level wavelet, and projects the low-frequency approximation coefficients onto the subspace, which is made from the normal face samples by PCA. Then it selects the illumination unrelated coefficients to rebuild the low-frequency approximation coefficients to replace the original ones. After wavelet construction, we can get the illumination unrelated face. The followed experiments which based on the classic eigenface algorithm show it can not only decrease the illumination and expression impacts on face image and improve the recognition rate greatly (28.9%), but also make the results robust to the change of eigenspace dimension.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620922","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620922","Face Recognition;Image Processing;PCA;Wavelet","Face recognition;Image analysis;Image recognition;Image reconstruction;Lighting;Principal component analysis;Probes;Reconstruction algorithms;Robustness;Wavelet analysis","face recognition;image reconstruction;wavelet transforms","eigenface algorithm;eigenspace dimension;expression variations;face recognition algorithms;face reconstruction method;facial image;low-frequency decomposition approximation;multi-level wavelet decomposition;probe images;wavelet reconstruction face","","0","","10","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed system consists of two main steps. First, potential microcalcification pixels in the mammograms are segmented out by using 4 mixed features consisting of two wavelet features and two gray level statistical features and then the potential microcalcification pixels are labeled into potential individual microcalcification objects by their spatial connectivity. Second, MCs are detected by using a set of 17 features extracted from the potential individual microcalcification objects. The classifier which is used in the first step is a multilayer feedforward neural network (NN) classifier but for the second step we have used three different classifier which are multilayer feedforward neural network (NN), SVM with polynomial kernel and SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel and the result of each classifier is obtained separately. The method is applied to a database of 40 mammograms (Nijmegen database) containing 105 clusters of MCs. A free-response operating characteristics (FROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance of CAD system with each classifier. Results show that the proposed system gives quite satisfactory detection performance.

In this paper we propose a secure cipher index with great efficiency over the encrypted character data to improve the performance of the encrypted database. The radical idea is to map the character data in the database into its index value, and translate the SQL clauses into a usable form to execute over the index attribute. Hash key and confuse number are introduced to make the cipher index in security in our scheme. In this schema, the same character data in different rows has different index value and the index value has no statistical characteristic, so it can alleviate the problem of statistical attack and plain attack.

The different learning velocity and neuron proportion of self-adaptive neuron PID control are simulated to analyze the control performance. It is found that the neuron proportion in self-adaptive neuron PID control is the most sensitive parameter, the learning velocities of proportion and integrator affect the rapidity of response, overshoot and static error, while the learning velocity of differentiator affects relatively little to the control performance.

Successful implementation of ITS depends upon complete and accurate vehicle information. An image fusion algorithm based on lifting wavelet transform (LWT) is presented in this paper to combine an infrared image and a visible light image into a single composite image. A new image fusion method is proposed in this paper: after lifting wavelet transform, mean gradient are used to determine the coefficients in fusion formula for low frequency component. Local deviation rules are applied to merge the high frequency coefficients. Experimental results have shown that most of the final composite images have better quality than either of the source images.

A new approach is presented to describe the dynamics of the left ventricle (LV) remodeling process post myocardial infarction (MI) in terms of the experimental measurements. MI is a leading cause of congestive heart failure, and currently there is a lack of biomarkers to predict how the left ventricle (LV) will respond to injury. The objective of this study is to measure extracellular matrix (ECM) gene levels in the LV post-MI to identify candidate factors that are predictive of remodeling post MI. Left ventricle from unoperated control mice (n=6) and the remote and infarct regions from 7 day post-MI mice (n=7) were studied. Of the 84 genes evaluated, 51 were differentially expressed in the post-MI LV. Significantly up regulated genes included alpha1 collagen I and Spp1 (osteopontin; all pLt0.05). In the plasma, matrix metalloproteinase-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and Spp1 (osteopontin) levels increased post-MI (all p<0.05). Data analysis illustrated those changes in expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), osteopontin (Spp1), and collagen correlated with each other. Mathematical simulation further illustrated the interaction among these factors and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). In conclusion, the 5 proteins identified may be useful macrophage-dependent biomarkers for predicting changes in LV remodeling post-MI. The novelty of this study lies in the combination of experimental results with mathematical model.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621104","Modeling;estimation;left ventricular;post myocardial infarction","Biological system modeling;Biomarkers;Extracellular;Heart;Inhibitors;Injuries;Mathematical model;Measurement standards;Mice;Myocardium","biochemistry;blood vessels;cellular biophysics;enzymes;genetics;molecular biophysics;physiological models","collagen;congestive heart MI failure;extracellular matrix gene levels;left ventricle remodeling;macrophage;metalloproteinase-9;myocardial infarction;osteopontin","","0","","20","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed scheme consists of 3f+1 tightly coupled replicas per name server and guarantees safety and liveness properties of the system assuming no more than f replicas are faulty. By adding authentication of client and using symmetric key cryptography, the system guarantees a secure communication mechanism by providing a way to detect whether DNS data has been corrupted during communication over the Internet.

Secondly, each image was converted into seven wavelet sub-bands images by wavelet pyramidal decomposition at second level. Then statistic textural features such as contrast, homogeneity, energy, correlation and entropy were calculated from grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) of wavelet sub-bands image. 105 textural features were obtained by feature extraction way combined by wavelet transform and GLCM. Thirdly, statistical feature selection was used to optimize the number of textural feature. 11 characteristic features were selected from 105 original features through STEPDISC of SAS with high statistic significance.

This is followed by the application of edge detection algorithms on these binary images and a fusion of the individual edge maps. A novel polynomial based binarization method is also presented. An evolutionary approach to the fusion of edgemaps renders the algorithm adaptive. Experimental results have shown that this new concept has several advantages.

Two numerical results indicate that the proposed neural network is an efficient technique and stable independent of the starting point.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620499","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620499","Asymptotically stable;Differential equation;Linear programming;Neural network","Artificial neural networks;Asymptotic stability;Differential equations;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;H infinity control;Linear programming;Machine learning;Neural networks;Operations research","asymptotic stability;linear programming;neural nets","equilibrium point asymptotic stability;linear programming problems;neural dynamics;neural network","","4","","9","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The traditional 3D reconstruction technology involves the self-calibration method basing on dual absolute quadric. However, some drawbacks in this method cause this technology less robust. First, usually the solution of the dual quadric matrix can not satisfy the positive-definiteness condition caused by loud noise in data; second, if the motion of the camera is too restricted, the calibration degeneracy will turn up causing the reconstruction failed. To these questions, we design a new method for calibrating the camera using the camera pure rotating calibration and decomposing the essential matrix. So, the metric structure can be got directly avoiding the less robustness caused by self-calibration. Experiments show that, using this method the reconstruction has an efficient result and the procedure is convenient.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620869","3D Reconstruction;Bundle Adjustment;Camera Rotating Calibration;Camera Self-calibration;Computer Vision;Essential Matrix;L-M Algorithm;Metric Structure","Calibration;Cameras;Computer vision;Cybernetics;Image reconstruction;Image sequences;Layout;Machine learning;Matrix decomposition;Robustness","cameras;computer vision;image reconstruction;image sequences;matrix algebra","3D reconstruction;calibration degeneracy;computer vision;dual absolute quadric;dual quadric matrix;hand-hold camera;image sequence;self-calibration method","","0","","15","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper puts forward a novel algorithm to fuse mid-wave and long-wave infrared images and detect targets. Firstly, the source images are decomposed by wavelet transformation. In usual, targets in infrared images are man-made, and their fractal dimension is different comparing with natural background. In wavelet transformation domain high-frequency part, we calculate local fractal dimension and set up fusion rule to merge corresponding sub-images of two matching source images. In low-frequency, we extract local maximum gray level to fuse them. Then reconstruct image by wavelet inverse transformation and obtain fused result image. In fusion results, the contrast between targets and background has obvious changes. And targets can be detected using contrast threshold. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper using wavelet transformation fractal dimension to fuse dual band infrared images, and then detect targets is better than using mid-wave or long -wave infrared images detect targets alone.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620373","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620373","Detection;Fractal;Image Fusion;Wavelet","Discrete wavelet transforms;Fractals;Fuses;Image fusion;Image reconstruction;Infrared detectors;Infrared imaging;Machine learning;Object detection;Wavelet domain","feature extraction;fractals;image fusion;image reconstruction;infrared imaging;wavelet transforms","dim small target fusion detection;fractal dimension;image reconstruction;infrared image;maximum gray level extraction;wavelet inverse transformation","","0","","13","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Universal steganalysis is especially useful due to its independence of prior knowledge of the embedding procedure. However, the detection results from the majority of universal methods are largely determined by the training procedure on a mixture of clean-images and stego-images, and therefore not practically feasible. Moreover, many color steganalysis methods do not take color coefficients into special consideration and thus they can be viewed as a simple extension of the analysis for grayscale images. To capture the distinct features of the clean images, we propose a novel predictor based on the intra- and inter- color correlations of wavelet coefficients.
