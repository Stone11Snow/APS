A LOS reconstruction filter for strap-down seeker is proposed. An exact LOS dynamic model of strap-down seeker is constructed by applying fully the output information of rate gyro and measurement information of the seeker. Compared with conventional LOS dynamic models, the relative distance and its rate between the missile and its target, which are unobservable to imaging seekers, together with the unknown maneuver models of the target are unnecessary. As a result, the model is convenient to use. Based on the proposed model, the reconstruction filter is designed to obtain more precise LOS angle, where the theory of unscented transformation (UT) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied to treat the nonlinearity in the proposed model. The results of computer simulations justify the validity of the LOS reconstruction filter, which can be used to improve the accuracy of LOS rate estimation.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527323","LOS rate estimation;LOS reconstruction;Strap-down imaging seeker;Unscented Kalman filter;Unscented Transform","Computer simulation;Filtering theory;Geometry;Goniometers;Image reconstruction;Kinematics;Low pass filters;Missiles;Navigation;Reconstruction algorithms","Kalman filters;computational geometry;image reconstruction;missiles;target tracking","LOS rate reconstruction filter;line-of-sight;maneuver models;strap-down imaging seeker system;unscented Kalman filter;unscented transformation","","1","","6","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After classifying, we utilize the competitive rule to thin the thick edge image in order to get the fine edge image.

The key problem for building RFTCS is to separate the rigid body angle signal and different order elastic oscillation caused angle signals (RSADS) from the output signals of inertia sensors (OSOIS). Firstly, the accurate location characteristics of FFT in frequency domain are used. OSOIS are transformed by FFT. The frequencies at extrema of frequency response obtained via FFT are the frequencies of RSADS. Secondly, an elliptical filter is designed to let the signals of the frequencies go through and the test signal is designed with combined sine signals whose initial phases are zero and whose frequencies are the frequencies at extrema. The test signal is filtered by the elliptical filter. The phase lag of each sine signal in the test signal is the initial phase of each filtered sine signal. OSOIS are also filtered by the elliptical filter. The filtered signal separated from inertia sensors are adjusted with the phase lags test by the test signal. Finally, RSADS are obtained in real-time.

This paper proposes new scheme for transductive inference, which we call MDL transduction. It labels the given examples so that the stochastic complexity of the whole data is minimized. In the sense of minimum description length, MDL transduction outperforms induction in both generative and discriminative methods. A key property of MDL transduction is that it learns nothing about the model. This highly agrees with the afore-mentioned philosophy. Relation to transductive SVM (TSVM) is also discussed.

By means of the formula and the algorithm, the sensitivity tendency is analyzed with regard to the variation of some parameters, such as the dimension of input, the number of Adalines in a layer and the number of layers. The analysis results show that the dimension of input has little effect on the sensitivity as long as the dimension is sufficient large, while the increases in the number of Adalines in a layer and the number of layers will lead the sensitivity to increase under an upper bound.

Huge as the face database is, the recognition processes in ordinary ways meets with great difficulties: the identification rate of most algorithms may decline significantly; meanwhile, querying on a large-scale database may be quite time-consuming. In our system, a special distributed parallel architecture is proposed to speed up the computation. Furthermore, a multimodal part face recognition method based on principal component analysis (MMP-PCA) is adopted to perform the recognition task, and the MMX technology is introduced to accelerate the matching procedure. Practical results prove that this system has an excellent performance in recognition: when searching among 2,560,000 faces on 6 PC servers with Xeon 2.4 GHz CPU, the querying time is only 1.094 s and the identification rate is above 85% in most cases.

Its application in load forecasting is based on periodical similarity of electric load, where the input variables, output variables and rules are the key point. In this paper, a new related coefficient comparison method is introduced to categorize the variables that have influence on electric load into some clustering groups, and their membership functions are set as input variables in the form of natural language using fuzzy set theory. The history data are clustered into output variables through the adaptive neuron-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) so as to ensure the minimal errors of their member functions. The rules that link the input variables with output variables are set on the basis of practice data and expert knowledge. This method is an effective tool to deal with some special variables such as weekends efficiently and closed to the actual load forecasting in practice.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527390","Clustering analysis;Fuzzy set;Load forecasting;Related coefficient comparison method","Artificial intelligence;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Input variables;Load forecasting;Natural languages;Power system planning;Weather forecasting","fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms;load (electric);load forecasting;power engineering computing","adaptive neuron-fuzzy inference system;artificial intelligence;clustering analysis;coefficient comparison;electric load;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;load forecasting;membership function","","0","","8","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel hybrid genetic algorithm with quasi-simplex techniques is proposed to handle the FDELD problem. The algorithm creates offspring by using generic operation and quasi-simplex techniques in parallel. The quasi-simplex techniques consider two potential optimal search directions in generating prospective offspring. One direction is the worst-opposite direction, which is used in the conventional simplex techniques, and the other is the best-forward direction, which is a ray from the centroid of a polyhedron whose vertexes are all the points but the best one towards the best point of the simplex. In addition, in order to reserve more fuzzy information, the fuzzy number ranking method is used to optimize the cost function, avoiding the lost some useful information by getting λ-level set.

Fast motion estimation algorithms often assume monotonic error surface in order to speed up the computations involved in motion estimation. But search may trap into local minima resulting in motion estimates. In this paper, we propose a new fast motion estimation algorithm based on an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO). The method can overcome the weakness of being liable to local minima resulting through particle swarm sharing optimized information during searching. Thus, the estimation speed is prompted. By applying spatial correlation to particle initialization, the performance of search is also improved. Some experiments presented demonstrate the efficiency of proposed approach.

The performance of the k-nearest neighbor rule relies on the locally constant a posteriori probability assumption. This assumption, however, becomes problematic in high dimensional spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we introduce a locally adaptive nearest neighbor rule. Instead of using the Euclidean distance to locate the nearest neighbors, the proposed method takes into account the effective influence size of each training example and the statistical confidence with which the label of each training example can be trusted.

Without more sophisticated cooperation and dynamic formation in an agile supply chain, it cannot achieved for mass customization, rapid response and high quality services. Because of its great potential in supporting cooperation for the supply chain management, agent technology can carry out the cooperative work by inter-operation across networked human, organization and machines at the abstractive level in a computational system. A major challenge in building such a system is to coordinate the behavior of individual agent or a group of agents to achieve the individual and shared goals of the participants. In this paper, the agent technology is used to support modeling and coordinating of supply chain management. Because two types of agents, namely cooperated agents and self-interested agents, are used in the supply chain, their characteristics are analyzed and then two different methods are put forward for the solutions, that is the distributed scheduling and centered making decision(DSCM) for cooperated agents and the hierarchical distributed coordination (HDC) for self-interested agents.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526939","Supply chain management;cooperation;coordination;multi-agent system","Automation;Collaborative work;Engineering management;Intelligent agent;Manufacturing;Mass customization;Multiagent systems;Supply chain management;Supply chains;Technology management","","Supply chain management;cooperation;coordination;multi-agent system","","2","","7","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The combination of multiple critics applies on the controller as fitness function of genetic learning in order to generate numerical rules to achieve multi-objective genetic process. Moreover, this paper apply an experimental design method which add a 'King strategy' to crossover operator of the standard GA in order to reduce the blindness of GA search processes and raise the convergence speed.

A fuzzy neural network (FNN) is used to model MCFCS. FNN structure and parameters are easier to comprehend than artificial neural network. After self-learning of structure and parameters of FNN, the fuzzy relational model (FRM) of MCFCS can be deduced from FNN model.
