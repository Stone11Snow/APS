Attackers are hence producing a large number of malware applications for Android (the most spread mobile platform), often by slightly modifying existing applications, which results in malware being organized in families. Some works in the literature showed that opcodes are informative for detecting malware, not only in the Android platform. In this paper, we investigate if frequencies of ngrams of opcodes are effective in detecting Android malware and if there is some significant malware family for which they are more or less effective. To this end, we designed a method based on state-of-the-art classifiers applied to frequencies of opcodes ngrams. Then, we experimentally evaluated it on a recent dataset composed of 11120 applications, 5560 of which are malware belonging to several different families. Results show that an accuracy of 97% can be obtained on the average, whereas perfect detection rate is achieved for more than one malware family.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6590-1; POD:978-1-4673-6591-8","10.1109/ARES.2015.57","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7299934","android;machine learning;malware","Androids;Humanoid robots;Malware;Mobile communication;Payloads;Servers;Smart phones","computational linguistics;invasive software;mobile computing","classifiers;multifamily Android malware detection;opcodes ngrams","","11","","41","","","24-27 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To this end, several sparsity measures have been proposed in the literature to quantify sparse dictionaries and constructing relevant ones, the most prolific ones being the distance, the approximation, the coherence and the Babel measures. In this paper, we analyze sparse dictionaries based on these measures. By conducting an eigenvalue analysis, we show that these sparsity measures share many properties, including the linear independence condition and inducing a well-posed optimization problem.

While this paradigm has led to numerous empirical successes in various fields ranging from image to audio processing, there have only been a few theoretical arguments supporting these evidences. In particular, sparse coding, or sparse dictionary learning, relies on a non-convex procedure whose local minima have not been fully analyzed yet. In this paper, we consider a probabilistic model of sparse signals, and show that, with high probability, sparse coding admits a local minimum around the reference dictionary generating the signals. This paper considers the case of over-complete dictionaries, noisy signals, and possible outliers, thus extending the previous work limited to noiseless settings and/or undercomplete dictionaries. The analysis we conduct is non-asymptotic and makes it possible to understand how the key quantities of the problem, such as the coherence or the level of noise, can scale with respect to the dimension of the signals, the number of atoms, the sparsity, and the number of observations.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2015.2472522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7222421","Dictionary learning;dictionaries;machine learning;sample complexity;signal representations;sparse coding;sparse matrices;structured learning","Clustering algorithms;Complexity theory;Encoding;Image coding;Noise measurement","concave programming;learning (artificial intelligence);linear codes;signal processing","audio processing;image processing;machine learning community;nonconvex procedure;signal processing;sparse coding;sparse dictionary learning;sparse signal probabilistic model","","9","","48","","20150825","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, cloud security is a grand obstacle for full deployment and utilization of cloud services. In this paper, we address the security of the DNS protocol that is widely used to translate the cloud domain names to correct IP addresses. The DNS protocol is prone to attacks like cache poisoning attacks and DNS hijacking attacks that can lead to compromising user's cloud accounts and stored information. We present an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for the DNS protocol (DNS-IDS) that models the normal operations of the DNS protocol and accurately detects any abnormal behavior or exploitation of the protocol. The DNS-IDS system operates in two phases, the training phase and the operational phase. In the training phase, we model the normal behavior of the DNS protocol as a finite state machine and we derive the normal temporal statistics of how normal DNS traffic transition within that state machine and store them in a database. To bound the normal event space, we also apply few known DNS attacks (e.g. Cache poisoning) and store the temporal statistics of the abnormal DNS traffic transition in a separate database. Then we develop an anomaly metric for the DNS protocol that is a function of the temporal statistics for both the normal and abnormal transitions of the DNS by applying classification algorithms like the Bagging algorithm. During the operational phase, the anomaly metric is used to detect DNS attacks (both known and novel attacks). We have evaluated our approach against a wide range of DNS attacks (DNS hijacking, Kaminsky attack, amplification attack, Birthday attack, DNS Rebinding attack). Our results show attack detection rate of 97% with very low false positive alarm rate (0.01397%), and round 3% false negatives.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9566-3; POD:978-1-4673-9567-0","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312172","Anomaly detection;DNS;Data mining;Intrusion detection system;Machine learning;Supervised training","Cloud computing","cache storage;cloud computing;computer network security;finite state machines;pattern classification;protocols","DNS hijacking attacks;DNS protocol;DNS security;DNS traffic transition;DNS-IDS;IP addresses;anomaly metric;attack detection rate;bagging algorithm;cache poisoning attacks;classification algorithms;cloud computing;cloud era;cloud security;cloud services;finite state machine;intrusion detection system;normal temporal statistics;operational costs;operational phase;state machine;training phase","","","","19","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is part of the ongoing construct of an intelligent mobile music player application that will adjudicate one's activity, environmental context, and physiological state. The study was structured so as to acquire emotional information by giving each participant a discrete affect word including `happy', `excited', `angry', `afraid', `miserable', `sad', `tired', and `relaxed'. Each affect word that was selected for a given song was corroborated by a degree of intensity using 5-point scale. The fundamental objective of this study was to measure as to how each song could be described emotionally, and how each song made them feel emotionally. Pearson's Chi-Squared concluded that 95% of the ratings for both `described' and `induced' emotions were statistically significant. The corresponding results were scaled to the proposed circular-based emotional model based on Russell's Circumplex model of emotion, by converting both the emotional ratings to polar coordinates. Further analysis of the data subsequently showed that the affect words that represent music could be given some granularity around the perimeter of the circle by expanding upon particular properties of Russell's circular ordering of affect words. Lastly, this paper concludes with a Section that outlines the future work for this research.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9557-1; POD:978-1-4799-8037-6","10.1109/ITechA.2015.7317402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7317402","affective computing;audio feature extraction;automatic playlist generation;machine learning;music and emotion","Fires;Physiology;Psychology;Rocks;Sleep","mobile computing;music;psychology","Pearsons chi-square;affect words;circular-based emotional model;emotional ratings;intelligent mobile music player application;music induced emotion;music perceived emotion","","","","26","","","8-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new means of transport for application to such cities. The system is based on small electric vehicles with mechanical couplers that are designed to attach to devices installed at each home. Unfortunately, this system incurs an issue of enhancing the operability for drivers of the coupled EVs. Therefore, this study set out to develop a distributed driving system that ensures that a group of vehicles maintains the same driving characteristics as those of a single vehicle, regardless of the number of coupled vehicles. This system suppresses fluctuations in the driving characteristics by means of online learning by the vehicle model using a neural network and by feedback control using a force gauge.

The conventional feature based identification schemes suffer from the problem of unknown models, that is, some images are captured by the camera models previously unknown to the identification system. To address this problem, we propose a new scheme: Source Camera Identification with Unknown models (SCIU). It has the capability of identifying images of the unknown models as well as distinguishing images of the known models. The new SCIU scheme consists of three stages: 1) unknown detection; 2) unknown expansion; and 3) (K+1 )-class classification. Unknown detection applies a k -nearest neighbours method to recognize a few sample images of unknown models from the unlabeled images. Unknown expansion further extends the set of unknown sample images using a self-training strategy. Then, we address a specific (K+1)-class classification, in which the sample images of unknown (1-class) and known models (K-class) are combined to train a classifier. In addition, we develop a parameter optimization method for unknown detection, and investigate the stopping criterion for unknown expansion. The experiments carried out on the Dresden image collection confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SCIU scheme. When unknown models present, the identification accuracy of SCIU is significantly better than the four state-of-art methods: 1) multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM); 2) binary SVM; 3) combined classification framework; and 4) decision boundary carving.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2015.2474836","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7229324","Camera model identification;digital forensics;machine learning;unknown models","Accuracy;Cameras;Feature extraction;Nickel;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","cameras;feature extraction;image classification;image forensics;optimisation;support vector machines","(K+1)-class classification;Dresden image collection;SCIU scheme;binary SVM;forensics investigation;k-nearest neighbours method;multiclass SVM;multiclass support vector machine;parameter optimization method;source camera identification-with-unknown model;unknown detection;unknown expansion","","1","","45","","20150828","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

There are various features related to the essentiality of proteins, such as biological and topological features. Many computational methods have been developed to identify essential proteins by using these features. However, it is still a big challenge to design an effective method that is able to select suitable features and integrate them to predict essential proteins. In this work, we first collect 26 features, and use SVM-RFE to select some of them to create a feature space for predicting essential proteins, and then remove the features that share the biological meaning with other features in the feature space according to their Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC). The experiments are carried out on S. cerevisiae data. Six features are determined as the best subset of features. To assess the prediction performance of our method, we further compare it with some machine learning methods, such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Bayes Network, and NBTree when inputting the different number of features. The results show that those methods using the 6 features outperform that using other features, which confirms the effectiveness of our feature selection method for essential protein prediction.","","","10.1109/TST.2015.7297748","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7297748","Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI);centrality algorithm;essential protein;feature selection;machine learning","Correlation;Gene expression;Learning systems;Mathematical model;Proteins;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;bioinformatics;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);proteins;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Bayes network;NBTree;PCC;Pearson correlation coefficients;S. cerevisiae data;SVM;SVM-RFE;biological features;essential protein prediction;feature selection method;feature space;machine learning methods;naive Bayes method;prediction performance assessment;topological features","","","","","","","Oct. 2015","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

Quantum computers promise to make this practical for O (2<sup>n</sup>) problems or less, but have yet to deliver a solution to a single NP-hard problem. The question addressed by this paper is whether domain transference and reuse of problem-solving knowledge can be mediated through the reuse of heuristics, and, if so, the extent to which such transference may occur in the solution of NP-hard problems. Neural networks have zero domain transference on account of their inability to represent modus ponens. Similarly, CBR, deep learning, EP, GAs, SVMs, the predicate calculus, learning via conventional expert systems, and all other machine learning technologies are unable to theoretically or practically mediate domain transference because they don't respect randomization as the core underpinning technology. The paper offers a constructive proof of the unbounded density of knowledge in support of the Semantic Randomization Theorem (SRT).

Bubble formation is affected by DNA duplex stability and thermally induced duplex destabilization (TIDD). Although prediction of duplex stability with the nearest neighbor (NN) method is much faster than prediction of TIDD with the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model, PBD predicted TIDD defines regulatory DNA regions with higher accuracy and detail. Here, we considered that PBD predicted TIDD is inherently related to the intrinsic duplex stabilities of destabilization regions. We show by regression modeling that NN duplex stabilities can be used to predict TIDD almost as accurately as is predicted with PBD. Predicted TIDD is in fact ascribed to non-linear transformation of NN duplex stabilities in destabilization regions as well as effects of neighboring regions relative to destabilization size. Since the prediction time of our models is over six orders of magnitude shorter than that of PBD, the models present an accessible tool for researchers.

A fingerprint-based DFL method collects a training database of measurement fingerprints and uses a machine learning classifier to determine a person's location from a new fingerprint. However, as the environment changes over time due to furniture or other objects being moved, the fingerprints diverge from those in the database. This paper addresses, for DFL methods that use received signal strength as measurements, the degradation caused as a result of environmental changes. We perform experiments to quantify how changes in an environment affect accuracy, through a repetitive process of randomly moving an item in a residential home and then conducting a localization experiment, and then repeating. We quantify the degradation and consider ways to be more robust to environmental change. We find that the localization error rate doubles, on average, for every six random changes in the environment. We find that the random forests classifier has the lowest error rate among four tested. We present a correlation method for selecting channels, which decreases the localization error rate from 4.8% to 1.6%.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2015.2430515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7102680","Experimental performance evaluation;localization;machine learning;radio propagation;received signal strength","Databases;Error analysis;Frequency measurement;Support vector machines;Training;Training data;Vegetation","correlation methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);radio tracking;sensor placement;signal classification;wireless sensor networks","channel selection;correlation method;fingerprint based device free localization;fingerprint classification;machine learning classifier;random forests classifier;received signal strength","","4","","35","","20150506","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A fundamental question in demand response is how to conduct a baseline estimation to deal with increasing uncertainties in power systems. Unfortunately, traditional baseline estimation lacks the ability to characterize uncertainties due to their deterministic modeling. This deficiency often results in erroneous system operations and miscalculated payments that discourage participating customers. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process-based approach to mitigate the problem. It features the ability to use all historical data as a prior knowledge, and adjust the estimation according to similar daily patterns in the past. To characterize the uncertainties, this method provides a probabilistic estimate that can be used to not only increase estimation confidence for system operators but also to fairer treatment to customers. Finally, simulation results from Pacific Gas and Electric Company data show that this new method can produce a highly accurate estimate, which dramatically reduces the uncertainties inherent in the distribution power grid. Such a work opens the door for power system operation based on probabilistic estimate.","1932-5517;19325517","Electronic:978-1-4673-8040-9; POD:978-1-4673-8041-6","10.1109/PESGM.2015.7285756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7285756","Baseline estimation;aggregation;demand response;gaussian process;machine learning;probabilistic estimation","Estimation;Gaussian processes;Load management;Load modeling;Power systems;Probabilistic logic;Uncertainty","Gaussian processes;demand side management;estimation theory;power grids;probability","Gaussian process;Pacific gas and electric company;demand response;deterministic modeling;distribution power grid;power system operation;probabilistic baseline estimation","","3","","13","","","26-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though, most of the studied methods in this field, including Rule-based expert systems, are not able to successfully identify the attacks which have different patterns from expected ones. By using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), it is possible to identify the attacks and classify the data, even when the dataset is nonlinear, limited, or incomplete.

The GP classifier is evaluated by using protein sequences and the sequence information obtained from the k-means clustering. The GP prediction model's performance is compared with those of feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs). The prediction methods are examined with two protein datasets RS126 and CB513. The performance of the three classification models are measured according to Q<sub>3</sub> and segment overlap (SOV) scores.

People often visit places and take pictures to remember their visits. We believe that the seasonal travel patterns of people to specific locations will create a correlation between a location and the season of the images taken in that location. For example, fewer people visit Bear Valley, California during the summer than during the winter as it is a popular Ski Resort. Therefore, we believe we will find more pictures of Bear Valley taken during winter when compared to any other seasons. Today, most of the photographs have geo-location (Latitude and Longitude) and time when the photograph was taken included in their metadata. Given the distribution of photographs, correlations between locations and seasons found using this metadata could potentially be used to develop a system to predict the best time of year to visit particular locations or number of people who may visit a tourist destination in the next season allowing business establishments to prepare appropriately. In this work we evaluate the efficacy of using this metadata to predict the season given the location. In our work, using a dataset comprised of photograph metadata, we focused on approximately 1.1 million photographs taken in California. Using variations of the nearest neighbor algorithm, we were able to predict the season of a photograph with a maximum correctness of 80.9% with a sufficiently large training set. We experimented with both weighted K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Fixed Radius Nearest Neighbor (FRNN) using no-weight, inverse, logarithmic, and gaussian weight calculators. Using the K-NN model, we found that logarithmic weighted K-NN performed the best at 79.55% correctness.

Modeled after our own human visual system, as it is intended to inherit humanlike judgment, a manifold regularized deep architecture is proposed for scene recognition. The proposed deep architecture exploits the structural information of the data, making for a mapping between visible layer and hidden layer.

The first issue is whether the accurate segmentation of the iris region is required in order to achieve the accurate detection of textured contact lenses. Our experimental results suggest that accurate iris segmentation is not required. The second issue is whether an algorithm trained on the images acquired from one sensor will well generalize to the images acquired from a different sensor. Our results suggest that using a novel iris sensor can significantly degrade the correct classification rate of a detection algorithm trained with the images from a different sensor. The third issue is how well a detector generalizes to a brand of textured contact lenses, not seen in the training data.

ALOJA is part of a long-term collaboration between BSC and Microsoft to automate the characterization of cost-effectiveness on Big Data deployments, currently focusing on Hadoop. Hadoop presents a complex run-time environment, where costs and performance depend on a large number of configuration choices. The ALOJA project has created an open, vendor-neutral repository, featuring over 40,000 Hadoop job executions and their performance details. The repository is accompanied by a test-bed and tools to deploy and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different hardware configurations, parameters and Cloud services. Despite early success within ALOJA, a comprehensive study requires automation of modeling procedures to allow an analysis of large and resource-constrained search spaces. The predictive analytics extension, ALOJA-ML, provides an automated system allowing knowledge discovery by modeling environments from observed executions. The resulting models can forecast execution behaviors, predicting execution times for new configurations and hardware choices. That also enables model-based anomaly detection or efficient benchmark guidance by prioritizing executions. In addition, the community can benefit from ALOJA data-sets and framework to improve the design and deployment of Big Data applications.","2168-6750;21686750","","10.1109/TETC.2015.2496504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312954","Benchmarks;Data-Center Management;Execution Experiences;Hadoop;Machine Learning;Modeling and Prediction","Analytical models;Benchmark testing;Big data;Hardware;Licenses;Predictive models;Software","","","","","","","","20151030","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Several studies have been conducted to enhance facial attractiveness in images. While some researchers suggest changes in geometrical shape, others advocate modifying the appearance of the facial skin, however, there have been few attempts to explore the possibility of combining both techniques. This paper sets out a novel method of doing this: facial geometry and skin texture modifications. Our method, which is based on supervised machine learning techniques, is able to improve the attractiveness of faces in images while preserving the original features of the picture. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this combination by carrying out two different evaluations. Accordingly, we analyze the significance of each change that is designed to improve attractiveness by comparing the original image with a) the image in which only the facial geometry has been modified, b) the image in which only the texture skin has been modified and finally c) the image with both modifications. Our results reveal that the combination of geometric and skin texture modifications results in the most significant enhancement. It also demonstrates that modifications to the skin texture can be regarded as more important to obtain an attractive face than changes to the facial geometry. Additionally, evaluations are provided to quantify the gain in facial attractiveness and it should be pointed out that our method is the first to employ these, since there are no references to such tests in the literature.","1530-1834;15301834","Electronic:978-1-4673-7962-5; POD:978-1-4673-7963-2","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314566","facial attractiveness;facial geometry;machine learning;skin texture","Feature extraction;Geometry;Hair;Image color analysis;Machine learning algorithms;Skin;Training","face recognition;feature extraction;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);shape recognition","attractive faces;face image attractiveness;facial attractiveness;facial geometry;facial skin appearance;geometric modifications;geometrical shape;image modifications;image texture skin;picture features preservation;skin texture modifications;supervised machine learning techniques","","","","16","","","26-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We used built-in smartphone sensors (accelerometer and barometer sensor), sampled at low frequency, to accurately estimate EE. Using a barometer sensor, in addition to an accelerometer sensor, greatly increases the accuracy of EE estimation. Using bagged regression trees, a machine learning technique, we developed a generic regression model for EE estimation that yields upto 96% correlation with actual EE. We compare our results against the state-of-the-art calorimetry equations and consumer electronics devices (Fitbit and Nike+ FuelBand).

We apply a hierarchical clustering model suited to dealing with datasets of mixed data types to stratify children with ASD into more homogeneous subgroups in line with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 model. The results of this cluster analysis will provide a better understanding the complex issue of ASD phenotypic heterogeneity and identify subgroups useful for further ASD genetic studies. Our goal is to provide insight into viable phenotypic and genotypic markers that would guide further cluster analysis of ASD genetic data.

Software traceability approaches use varied measures to build models that automatically recover links between pairs of natural language documents. Thus far, most of the approaches use a single-step model, such as logistic regression, to identify new trace links. However, such approaches require a large enough training set of both true and false trace links. Yet, the former are by far in the minority, which reduces the performance of such models. Therefore, this paper formulates the problem of identifying trace links as the problem of finding, for a given logistic regression model, the subsets of links in the training set giving the best accuracy (in terms of G-metric) on a test set. Using hill climbing with random restart for subset selection, we found that, for the ChangeStyle dataset, we can classify links with a precision of up to 40% and a recall of up to 66% using a training set as small as one true candidate link (out of 33) and 41 false links. To get better performance and learn the best possible logistic regression classifier, we must “discard” links in the trace dataset that increase noise to avoid learning with links that are not representative. This preliminary work is promising because it shows that few correct examples may perform better than several poor ones. It also shows which inherent characteristics of the artifacts make them good candidates to learn efficient traceability models automatically, i.e., it reveals their traceability.","1090-705X;1090705X","Electronic:978-1-4673-6905-3; POD:978-1-4673-6906-0","10.1109/RE.2015.7320422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7320422","Traceability;artifact characteristics;logistic regression;machine learning;model","Indexes;Logistics;Manuals;Object oriented modeling;Software;Software measurement;Training","pattern classification;program diagnostics;regression analysis","ChangeStyle dataset;hill climbing;logistic regression classifier;logistic regression model;natural language documents;random restart;single-step model;software traceability approaches;subset selection;textual artifact;trace dataset;trace links;traceability artifact characteristics","","","","17","","","24-28 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A guard is defined as a high-assurance device used to control the information flow, typically from a domain with a ""high"" level of confidentiality, such as a corporate or military network, to a domain with a ""low"" level, such as the Internet or a network of a subcontractor. It often uses simple classification lists (a.k.a. ""Dirty Word Lists"") to automatically assess the security classification (e.g. ""Public"" vs. ""Confidential"") of information objects, such as documents or text messages. The object is released into the ""low"" domain, only if the policy allows for information objects of that classification level to be released. Otherwise, it will be blocked and possibly quarantined for human inspection and intervention. The classification lists today are usually simple and configured manually. This paper demonstrates the use of machine learning to create more advanced classification lists automatically. A major obstacle for machine learning to be used is that they would create long lists that are difficult to inspect, analyze and control by humans. In addition, some of the most efficient machine learning techniques, particularly SVM and Neural Networks, are ""black-box"" classifiers, meaning that they do not posses an explanatory nature. In this paper, we explore the use of massive/strict dimensionality reduction in order to create a sparse solution that results in a brief classification list that is easier for humans to analyze.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9200-6; POD:978-1-4673-9201-3","10.1109/CyberC.2015.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307785","Security;classification;cross-domain information exchange;dirty word list;feature selection;lasso;machine learning","Accuracy;Internet;Learning systems;Organizations;Security;Support vector machines;Training","e-mail filters;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines;unsolicited e-mail","SVM;automatic security classification;black-box classifier;classification level;classification list;data leakage;dirty word list;high-assurance device;human inspection;human intervention;information flow;information guard;information object;machine learning technique;massive/strict dimensionality reduction;neural network;spam filter;sparse solution","","5","","20","","","17-19 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8439-1; POD:978-1-4673-8440-7","10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306574","Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;DNS;Wi-Fi;data mining;machine learning","Conferences;Cross layer design;Databases;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Intrusion detection;Open systems;Protocols","data mining;protocols;security of data;statistical analysis","DNS protocols;IDS;IP protocols;OSI model;TCP protocols;UDP protocols;Wi-Fi protocols;anomaly behavior analysis modules;communications protocols;computer networks;cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;data mining;false alarms;mobile devices;network capacity;partial attack model;smart devices;smart phones;statistical techniques;tablet computers;wearable computing","","","","7","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For each request, i.e., in an event-driven manner, the application can execute some optional code that is not required for correct operation but desirable for user experience, and does so only if the number of pending client requests is below a given threshold. We propose several autonomic algorithms, based on control theory and machine learning, to automatically tune this threshold based on measured application 95th percentile response times. We evaluate our approach using the RUBiS benchmark which shows a 11-fold improvement in maintaining response-time close to a set-point at high utilization compared to competing approaches.

Internet traffic classification has increased in relevance in recent years because of its potential applications in the business world. Information about network traffic has many benefits in network design, security, management and accounting. Internet traffic classification is especially important to the adaptive networks often used in cloud computing, which must use data gleaned from the network to adjust to network conditions on-the-fly. This information is most easily collated from the huge amount of information going through a modern network with machine learning algorithms, which adjust themselves to the conditions of the network. In previous research, Artificial Immune System (AIS) algorithms have been used to classify malicious and benign network traffic in support of Intrusion Detection Systems [1]. Because of their versatility and their low sensitivity to the values of the input parameters, we are motivated to explore the value of using AIS inspired algorithms in support of flow-based traffic classification. In this paper, we propose an AIS inspired algorithm for flow-based traffic classification, and evaluate its performance with and without the use of kernel functions. We utilize a publicly-available dataset to compare our results with other approaches that have been proposed in the recent literature. We provide several measures of the classification performance of the algorithm, as well as share our experience on the best features of the algorithm for this particular application. We also evaluate the proposed algorithm, comparing it with two other classification algorithms, and draw conclusions based on our findings. The algorithm generalizes well and gives high accuracy even with a small training set when compared to other algorithms, although the training and classification times were higher. The algorithm is also ins- nsitive to the values of the input parameters, which makes it attractive for embedded and Internet of Things applications.

We address the challenges associated with both rare class problems and large scale learning, by 1) optimizing area under curve of the receiver of operator characteristic in the training process, instead of classification accuracy and 2) using a rare class kernel representation to achieve an efficient time and space algorithm.

In this paper, we present a novel wearable inertial sensor framework to accurately distinguish between symmetrical and asymmetrical running patterns in an unconstrained environment. The framework can automatically classify symmetry/asymmetry using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and other time domain features in conjunction with a customized Random Forest classifier. The accuracy of the designed framework is up to 94% using 3-D accelerometer and 3-D gyroscope data from a sensor node attached on the upper back of a subject. The upper back inertial sensors data were then down-sampled by a factor of 4 to simulate utilizing low-cost inertial sensors whilst also facilitating a decrease of the computational cost to achieve near real-time application.

The aim of this study was twofold. First, to use a multiple regression normalization strategy that accounts for subject age, height, body mass, gender, and self-selected walking speed to identify differences in spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning strategies in classifying PD gait after gait normalization. Spatial-temporal gait data during self-selected walking were obtained from 23 PD patients and 26 aged-matched controls. Data were normalized using standard dimensionless equations and multiple regression normalization. Machine learning strategies were then employed to classify PD gait using the raw gait data, data normalized using dimensionless equations, and data normalized using the multiple regression approach. After normalizing data using the dimensionless equations, only stride length, step length, and double support time were significantly different between PD patients and controls (p <; 0.05); however, normalizing data using the multiple regression method revealed significant differences in stride length, cadence, stance time, and double support time. Random Forest resulted in a PD classification accuracy of 92.6% after normalizing gait data using the multiple regression approach, compared to 80.4% (support vector machine) and 86.2% (kernel Fisher discriminant) using raw data and data normalized using dimensionless equations, respectively.

Large computer systems in general, and data centers in particular, will ultimately be managed using predictive computational and executable models obtained through data-science tools, and at that point, the intervention of humans will be limited to setting high-level goals and policies rather than performing low-level operations. Data-driven autonomics, where management and control are based on holistic predictive models that are built and updated using generated data, opens one possible path towards limiting the role of operators in data centers. In this paper, we present a data-science study of a public Google dataset collected in a 12K-node cluster with the goal of building and evaluating a predictive model for node failures. We use BigQuery, the big data SQL platform from the Google Cloud suite, to process massive amounts of data and generate a rich feature set characterizing machine state over time. We describe how an ensemble classifier can be built out of many Random Forest classifiers each trained on these features, to predict if machines will fail in a future 24-hour window. Our evaluation reveals that if we limit false positive rates to 5%, we can achieve true positive rates between 27% and 88% with precision varying between 50% and 72%. We discuss the practicality of including our predictive model as the central component of a data-driven autonomic manager and operating it on-line with live data streams (rather than off-line on data logs).

The recognition of facial expressions is not an easy problem for machine learning methods, since different people can vary in the way that they show their expressions. And even an image of the same person in one expression can vary in brightness, background and position. Therefore, facial expression recognition is still a challenging problem in computer vision. In this work, we propose a simple solution for facial expression recognition that uses a combination of standard methods, like Convolutional Network and specific image pre-processing steps. Convolutional networks, and the most machine learning methods, achieve better accuracy depending on a given feature set. Therefore, a study of some image pre-processing operations that extract only expression specific features of a face image is also presented. The experiments were carried out using a largely used public database for this problem. A study of the impact of each image pre-processing operation in the accuracy rate is presented.

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) aim to assist drivers during lane change maneuvers. A system that is developed for an average driver or all drivers will have to be conservative for safety reasons to cover all driver/vehicle types. Such a conservative system may not be acceptable to aggressive drivers and could be perceived as too aggressive by the more passive drivers. An ADAS that takes into account the dynamics and characteristics of each individual vehicle/driver system during lane change maneuvers will be more effective and more acceptable to drivers without sacrificing safety. In this paper, we develop a methodology that learns the characteristics of an individual driver/vehicle response before and during lane changes and under different driving environments. These characteristics are captured by a set of models whose parameters are adjusted online to fit the individual vehicle/driver response during lane changes. We develop a two-layer model to describe the maneuver kinematics. The lower layer describes lane change as a kinematic model. The higher layer model establishes the kinematic model parameter values for the particular driver and represents their dependence on the configuration of the surrounding vehicles. The proposed modeling framework can be used as a kernel component of ADAS to provide more personalized recommendations to the driver, increasing the potential for more widespread acceptance and use of ADAS. We evaluated the proposed methodology using an actual vehicle and three different drivers. We demonstrated that the method is effective in modeling individual driver/vehicle responses during lane change by showing consistency of matching between the model outputs and raw data.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2014.2369522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6953271","Adaptation models;intelligent vehicles;machine learning;man machine systems","Acceleration;Adaptation models;Hidden Markov models;Kinematics;Stochastic processes;Trajectory;Vehicles","driver information systems;learning (artificial intelligence);road vehicles","ADAS;advanced driver-assistance system;conservative system;driver lane change;driver response;high-speed traffic flow;kinematic model parameter value;machine learning;vehicle lane change;vehicle response","","7","","48","","20141111","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The use of neural networks to solve SAR image classification problems is well known. A typical architecture consists of a shallow feed-forward neural network with an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. This type of neural network, combined with back-propagation and a gradient-based training algorithm, is able to solve complex problems in SAR image analysis.

The developed novelty detection method begins with the assumption that only data corresponding to a healthy operation of the machine is available, and the objective is to detect anomalies in the behavior of the machine. To monitor the packing machine, first, the current signals acquired from the main motor are processed by means of a normalized time-frequency map. Next, a set of features are calculated from the frequency maps. Then a set of novelty models are trained. When abnormal data is detected, an alarm will be activated to be confirmed by the user. The proposed methodology includes the re-training of the novelty detection models to include such behaviors.

The experiments we performed on a popular data set show that our instance based learning algorithms lead to much better results than the current state of the art. While the methods we propose are computationally expensive by nature, we consider that cost to be irrelevant for the problem at hand, which, according to the existing literature, only ever deals with a few thousand instances at most.

To this end, we show the effectiveness of machine learning models in accurately predicting user workload intensities, essentially by suggesting the most opportune time to co-schedule data analytics work. Yet, machine learning models cannot predict the effects of performance interference when co-scheduling is employed, as this constitutes a ""new"" observation. Specifically, in tiered storage systems, their hierarchical design makes performance interference even more complex, thus accurate performance prediction is more challenging. Here, we quantify the unknown performance effects of workload co-scheduling by enhancing machine learning models with queuing theory ones to develop a hybrid approach that can accurately predict performance and guide scheduling decisions in a tiered storage system. Using traces from commercial systems we illustrate that queuing theory and machine learning models can be used in synergy to surpass their respective weaknesses and deliver robust co-scheduling solutions that achieve high performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9566-3; POD:978-1-4673-9567-0","10.1109/ICCAC.2015.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7312148","data analytics work;hybrid approach;machine learning;performance prediction;queuing theory;scheduling","Biological neural networks;Correlation;Data analysis;Data models;Predictive models;Time factors","data analysis;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;scheduling","data analytics;hybrid analytic technique;machine learning model;multitiered storage system;neural network;resource utilization;scheduling decision;system proactive management","","1","","33","","","21-25 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, a classical ANFIS forecasting scheme is enhanced by the proposal of a dynamics boosting strategy. First, the objective signal is decomposed by means of the Empirical Mode to highlight the main characteristics functions. Next, the dynamics of the functions in regard to the performance of the ANFIS is analyzed. Thus, the functions are separated into different sets. Then, the forecasting is faced with the employment of multiple ANFIS models focused on different dynamics modes. The performance of the proposed system is validated experimentally. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach outperforms the classical methods and represents a reliable and feasible methodology suitable to multiple applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7743-7; POD:978-1-4799-7744-4","10.1109/DEMPED.2015.7303692","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7303692","Artificial intelligence;Condition monitoring;Fuzzy neural networks;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prognosis;Time series analysis","Adaptive systems;Analytical models;Copper;Forecasting;Fuzzy logic;Manufacturing;Predictive models","forecasting theory;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;process monitoring;production engineering computing;time series","ANFIS forecasting scheme;characteristics functions;dynamics boosting strategy;dynamics modes;enhanced time series forecasting;industrial process monitoring;manufacturing processes","","","","9","","","1-4 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Improving Spatial Feature Representation from Aerial Scenes by Using Convolutional Networks","K. Nogueira; W. O. Miranda; J. A. D. Santos","Dept. of Comput. Sci., Univ. Fed. de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil","2015 28th SIBGRAPI Conference on Graphics, Patterns and Images","20151102","2015","","","289","296","The performance of image classification is highly dependent on the quality of extracted features. Concerning high resolution remote image images, encoding the spatial features in an efficient and robust fashion is the key to generating discriminatory models to classify them. Even though many visual descriptors have been proposed or successfully used to encode spatial features of remote sensing images, some applications, using this sort of images, demand more specific description techniques. Deep Learning, an emergent machine learning approach based on neural networks, is capable of learning specific features and classifiers at the same time and adjust at each step, in real time, to better fit the need of each problem. For several task, such image classification, it has achieved very good results, mainly boosted by the feature learning performed which allows the method to extract specific and adaptable visual features depending on the data. In this paper, we propose a novel network capable of learning specific spatial features from remote sensing images, with any pre-processing step or descriptor evaluation, and classify them. Specifically, automatic feature learning task aims at discovering hierarchical structures from the raw data, leading to a more representative information. This task not only poses interesting challenges for existing vision and recognition algorithms, but also brings huge opportunities for urban planning, crop and forest management and climate modelling. The propose convolutional neural network has six layers: three convolutional, two fully-connected and one classifier layer. So, the five first layers are responsible to extract visual features while the last one is responsible to classify the images. We conducted a systematic evaluation of the proposed method using two datasets: (i) the popular aerial image dataset UCMerced Land-use and, (ii) a multispectral high-resolution scenes of the Brazilian Coffee Scenes. The experiments show that the pr- posed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of overall accuracy.","1530-1834;15301834","Electronic:978-1-4673-7962-5; POD:978-1-4673-7963-2","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2015.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7314576","Deep Learning;Feature Learning;High-resolution Images;Image Classification;Machine Learning;Remote Sensing","Biological neural networks;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Neurons;Remote sensing;Robustness;Visualization","feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;neural nets;remote sensing","Brazilian Coffee Scenes;UCMerced Land-use;aerial scenes;automatic feature learning task;classifier layer;convolutional layer;convolutional neural network;fully-connected layer;image classification;multispectral high-resolution scenes;remote sensing images;spatial feature representation;visual feature extraction","","4","","35","","","26-29 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Category-Aware API Clustering and Distributed Recommendation for Automatic Mashup Creation","B. Xia; Y. Fan; W. Tan; K. Huang; J. Zhang; C. Wu","Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, China","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","20151005","2015","8","5","674","687","Mashup has emeraged as a promising way to allow developers to compose existed APIs (services) to create new or value-added services. With the rapid increasing number of services published on the Internet, service recommendation for automatic mashup creation gains a lot of momentum. Since mashup inherently requires services with different functions, the recommendation result should contain services from various categories. However, most existing recommendation approaches only rank all candidate services in a single list, which has two deficiencies. First, ranking services without considering to which categories they belong may lead to meaningless service ranking and affect the recommendation accuracy. Second, mashup developers are not always clear about which service categories they need and services in which categories cooperate better for mashup creation. Without explicitly recommending which service categories are relevant for mashup creation, it remains difficult for mashup developers to select proper services in a mixed ranking list, which lower the user friendliness of recommendation. To overcome these deficiencies, a novel category-aware service clustering and distributed recommending method is proposed for automatic mashup creation. First, a Kmeans variant(vKmeans) method based on topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation is introduced for enhancing service categorization and providing a basis for recommendation. Second, on top of vKmeans, a service category relevance ranking (SCRR) model, which combines machine learning and collaborative filtering, is developed to decompose mashup requirements and explicitly predict relevant service categories. Finally, a category-aware distributed service recommendation (CDSR) model, which is based on a distributed machine learning framework, is developed for predicting service ranking order within each category. Experiments on a real-world dataset have proved that the proposed approach not only gains significant improvement- at precision rate but also enhances the diversity of recommendation results.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2014.2379251","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6980473","Mashup;extreme learning machine;probabilistic topic model;service clustering;service recommendation","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Engines;Google;Mashups;Predictive models;Vectors","Internet;application program interfaces;category theory;collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;recommender systems;service-oriented architecture;statistical analysis","CDSR model;Internet;Kmeans variant;Latent Dirichlet allocation;SCRR model;SOC;automatic mashup creation;category-aware API clustering;category-aware distributed service recommendation;collaborative filtering;machine learning;service category relevance ranking;service-oriented computing;vKmeans method;value-added service","","5","","32","","20141210","Sept.-Oct. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
