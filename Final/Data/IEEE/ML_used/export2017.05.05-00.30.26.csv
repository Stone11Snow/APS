Therefore, video text recognition is crucial to the research in all video indexing and summarization. In the processing of video text recognition, in the extraction step, background in the text rows is removed so only the text pixels are left for recognition. Although many efforts have been made for video text extraction, there are still many research works to do. Text extraction from images remains a challenging problem for character recognition applications, due to complex background, unknown text color, degraded text quality caused by the lossy compression, and different language characteristics. In this paper, we present an efficient approach of text extraction based on multiple frame integration and stroke filter. Firstly text block filtering and integration are used to obtain the clean background and clear text with high contrast for the effective recognition. Secondly the character of the stroke-like structure is adequately considered, the stroke filter is applied to get most step-like edges, and at the same time, the text parts are enhanced well. Lastly the missed text pixels in former steps are recalled by local region growing.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580492","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580492","Multiple frame integration;OCR;Stroke filter;Text Extraction","Character recognition;Filtering;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Optical character recognition software;Pixel;Text recognition","feature extraction;image recognition;optical character recognition;text analysis;video retrieval;video signals","integration text extraction;text block filtering;text block integration;video content analysis;video content retrieval;video frame;video text recognition","","1","","21","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Influenza epidemics detection attracts much attention from governments, organizations, and research institutes, and recently, a novel method using search engine query data to detect influenza activities was presented by Google. In this paper, a data mining based framework using Web data is introduced for influenza epidemics detection. Under the framework, a neural network based approach using search engine query data is developed to detect influenza activities. In the proposed method, an automated feature selection model is firstly constructed to reduce the dimension of the query data. Secondly, various neural networks are employed to model the relationship between influenza-like illness data and query data. Thirdly, an optimal neural network is selected as the detector by using the cross-validation method. Finally, the selective neural network detector with the best feature subset is used to detect influenza activities. Experimental results show that the proposed method can outperform traditional statistical models and other models used in the experiments in terms of accuracy. These findings imply that data mining, such as neural network method, can be used as a promising tool to detect influenza activities.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580851","Data mining;Detection;Influenza epidemics;Neural networks;Query data","Artificial neural networks;Data mining;Feature extraction;Influenza;Mathematical model;Search engines;Surveillance","data mining;neural nets;search engines","Google;Influenza epidemics detection;Web data;automated feature selection model;data mining;optimal neural network;search engine query data","","2","","21","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While anti-counterfeiting in RFID occurs when a duplicated tag is used in the goods, and the reader will not be able to discover that it is a fake tag. Anti-collision and anti-counterfeiting mechanisms are usually operated separately in the past, but they may have to perform at the same time in some cases. For example, when RFID-based exhibition tickets are used for entrance purpose both mechanisms will be needed simultaneously. To counter forgery attack, it is important that we have to meet not only anti-collision but also anti-counterfeiting requirement. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a suitable communication protocol of RFID tag with the function of anticollision and anti-counterfeiting called A Combined Active RFID Tag Collision Resolution Protocol Against Counterfeiting (CRPAC). In our proposed scheme, when the anti-collision mechanism is in progress, the anti-counterfeiting scheme is working along with it.

In this paper, we present a concept of cluster integrity and propose an enhanced conditional FCM, itgFCM, based on both cluster integrity and cluster size. For objects classified to a cluster of high integrity after defuzzification, itgFCM assigns their condition values predominantly depending on the size of that cluster. If an object is assigned to a cluster of low integrity, itgFCM adjusts the size-dependent condition value with a multiplicative weight that grows with both the complement of cluster integrity and the object's purity. Experimental results demonstrate that itgFCM can partition numerical datasets as well as synthetic and real images of various number of classes to clusters that are more conforming to human perception than csiFCM can, regardless of both initial cluster centers and data distribution of the datasets.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580944","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580944","Clustering;Conditional fuzzy c-means;Fuzzy c-means;Integrity-based fuzzy c-means;Unequal cluster size","Clustering algorithms;Cybernetics;Dispersion;Humans;Machine learning;Pixel;Sensitivity","data integrity;fuzzy set theory;image classification;pattern clustering","FCM;cluster integrity;cluster size sensitivity problem;data distribution;defuzzification;fuzzy c-means method;human perception;object classification","","0","","9","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The discrete Choquet integral respect to a fuzzy measure is proved to be an adequate aggregation operator by further taking into accounts the interactions among criteria. A signed fuzzy measure is needed when the gain and loss must be considered in the same time. In this study, we propose a signed fuzzy measure based on the complexity method to construct a signed fuzzy measure needed by the discrete generalized Choquet integral and a real questionnaire data is analyzed. The advantage of the complexity-based method is that no population probability is to be estimated such that the error of estimating the population probability is reduced and it is easily to construct a signed fuzzy measure based on the complexity method. Four methods, including the discrete Choquet integral with fuzzy measure based on the entropy method, the discrete Choquet integral with fuzzy measure based on the complexity method, the discrete generalized Choquet integral with signed fuzzy measure based on the cardinality method, and our proposed discrete generalized Choquet integral with signed fuzzy measure based on the complexity method, are used in this study to evaluate the overall satisfaction of the patients.

According to this useful theorem, we know that if a totally partial order is operation-invariant for Atanassov's addition operation and scalar multiplication on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, then it is also operation-invariant for Choquet integral operation on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Moreover, if a totally partial order is operation-invariant for Liu's generalized addition operation and scalar multiplication on Liu's generalized intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, then it is also operation-invariant for Choquet integral operation on Liu's generalized intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Most of all, it is pointed out that although Xu's order is a totally partial order but not a operation-invariant partial order for Choquet integral operation on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. Up to now, only Liu's order which proposed by author's previous work is an operation-invariant partial order for Choquet integral operation not only on intuitionistic fuzzy numbers but also on Liu's generalized intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, which can be used to handle intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria fuzzy decision making problems and Liu's generalized intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria fuzzy decision making problems.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580686","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580686","Generalized addition operation;Generalized intuitionistic fuzzy number;Generalized scalar multiplication operation;Intuitionistic fuzzy number;Operation-invariant partial order","Cybernetics;Decision making;Density functional theory;Fuzzy sets;Lead;Logic programming;Machine learning","decision making;formal logic;fuzzy set theory;integral equations;optimisation","Choquet integral;Liu generalized intuitionistic fuzzy number;addition operation;aggregation operation;intuitionistic fuzzy multicriteria fuzzy decision making;operation-invariant partial order;scalar multiplication operation","","3","","15","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared to other wireless technologies, e.g. GPS and WLAN, RFID is particularly suitable for indoor positioning. Existing methods usually assume a constant environment for the application field. However, this may not be true in many cases. For example, warehouse may have different goods yielding different interference to RFID signal in different days. This paper proposes a new method to estimate locations of objects based on RFID. The indoor positioning with RFID reader based on the received signal strength and passive UHF tags as reference tags. A Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained via a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM) is adopted to learn the object location based on received RFID signals. The L-GEM provides an estimate on the generalization capability of the RBFNN which is important to locate future unseen samples correctly in different yet similar environments. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing RFID based indoor positioning method.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580925","Indoor Positioning;L-GEM;RBFNN;RFID","Accuracy;Estimation error;Machine learning;Neurons;Radiofrequency identification;Training;Wireless LAN","Global Positioning System;indoor radio;radial basis function networks;radiofrequency identification;ubiquitous computing","L-GEM;RBFNN;RFID indoor positioning;RFID reader;context-aware pervasive application;localized generalization error;passive UHF tag;pervasive computing;radial basis function neural network;received signal strength;reference tag;wireless positioning","","3","","18","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study proposes a support vector machine approach for clustering images. To help determine the number of clusters, a greedy strategy is designed which extends or condenses the number of clusters by evaluating the clustering results from support vector machines.

In this study, the concept of the all-in-focus image is employed to develop a smart camera, so the user is not necessary to consider the focusing in the time of taking a picture. It allows the user to adjust the focusing situation on the computer later. First, the method to separate the texture edge and the occluded edge in the space-focus color map (SFCM) is designed based on the texture and range information of the scene. Next, collecting the proper focus and color of each pixel establishes the all-in-focus image. The proposed method can also recover the color of the pixel near the occluded edge. To break optical limitation, multiple objects located in different ranges can be all in-focus.

In chip multiprocessors connected by network on chip, submesh allocation is also used to allocate processors. Existing research mainly focuses on fragmentation, system performance and algorithmic complexity. The processors are assumed to be homogeneous, and the representation of them only reflects the state of processors usage, free or allocated. However, heterogeneous cores have been widely adopted in modern chip multiprocessors to better support the different computation needs. Therefore, the submesh allocation should be re-designed to reflect the difference between cores in heterogeneous chip multiprocessors. In this paper, a simple submesh allocation strategy based on processor array is presented. The strategy represents the heterogeneous processors by computing power array and usage bitmap. The jobs are represented by needed computing power array.

However, there may be many frequent itemsets existing in a transaction database, such that it is difficult to make a decision for a decision maker. Recently, mining frequent closed itemsets becomes a major research issue, since all frequent itemsets can be derived from frequent closed itemsets. In addition, the transactions in a database will be increased and removed constantly. It is a challenge that how to update the previous frequent closed itemsets from the increased and removed transactions. In our previous researches, we have proposed an algorithm MRFI to maintain the frequent closed itemsets when the transactions are added into a transaction database. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for maintaining frequent closed itemsets when the transactions are deleted from a transaction database without scanning original database. Our algorithm updates closed itemsets by some rules without taking a lot of time to search the previous closed itemsets. The experimental results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the previous approaches which need to take a lot of time to search the previous closed itemsets.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580928","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580928","Closed itemsets;Data mining;Data stream;Frequent itemsets","Algorithm design and analysis;Cybernetics;Data mining;Itemsets;Machine learning","data mining;database management systems","frequent closed itemsets mining;transaction database","","0","","16","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there are two problems in multiple nearest neighbor classifiers system based on feature perturbation: (i) how to determine the number of component classifiers, and (ii) how to select features for each component classifier. In this paper, the proposed method by mutual information is able to solve the two problems. (i) The number of component classifiers is set to be the number of classes, and (ii) the selected features for each component classifier are automatically determined by mutual information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, three UCI datasets are selected. And the proposed method is compared with: (i) NNC, (ii) NNC after feature selection by mutual information, (iii) multiple nearest neighbor classifiers system based on feature perturbation by attribute bagging. The experimental results show that multiple classifiers system is superior to single classifier.
