It can be employed in many fields such as speech and signal processing, data compression, syntactic pattern recognition, string processing, and genetic engineering. Usually, lengths of both input sequences are very long, resulting in long processing time. Many previous algorithms have been proposed to reduce the processing time. Previous systolic algorithms can achieve linear time complexity with linear number of processing elements. However, each processing element needs linear memory-space to store intermediate results and then the system needs too large memory-space in total, resulting in being not suitable for being implemented on VLSI. Hence, to design an efficient and hardware-implementable algorithm is an important issue. This paper proposes a hardware-implementable and efficient systolic algorithm for the longest common subsequence problem. At first, we investigate the property of overlapped-contours. By employing ldquodivide and conquerrdquo technique, we can find a longest common subsequence from the overlapped-contours. It needs a little more time complexity with only linear memory-space in total. Furthermore, the number of physical processing elements can be fixed by employing the concept of virtual processing elements.

The algorithm adopts a balanced spatial data partitioning strategy for distributed spatial databases. According to the characteristics of data partitioning, it builds a packing R-tree as its index. The strategy also considers the problem of computing distribution. By replicating index to every site, each site can access different entry in the same index node at the same time. Based on the organization of spatial data, the algorithm can simultaneously execute query operation at different site in both filtration phase and refinery phase. So it obviously improves spatial query performances. In order to solve multiple paths search problem caused by R-tree index, the algorithm brings in globe stack to buffer temporary index nodes.

When some training cluster size is small than its dimensionality, it induces the singular problem of the inverse covariance matrix. It is an important issue.

The algorithm classifies volume data into the foreground voxels and background voxels, and the former voxels are resampled using the similar LOD (Layer of Detail) technique, then optical attribute of the resampling points is determined by a new method. This method is reasonably associated with the distance between the object and the viewpoint, as well as the object and the light source.

The hard-thresholding methods may lead to oscillation of the reconstructed signal, and the soft-thresholding methods may cause constant deviations between the estimated wavelet and original wavelet coefficients. The improved threshhoding method can overcome these defects, which was better in keeping trade-off between smoothness and remaining edge of the original signal. A coefficient beta which is flexible was set up in the improved thresholding method, how to find the appropriate beta is important for the improved thresholding de-noising, furthermore, the improved thresholding methods were combined with some parameters such as wavelet function, decomposition scales etc., the effectiveness of signal de-noising is quite different. Now, most of researchers are usually selected semi-empirically or empirically these parameters, which cannot ensure that the de-noising performance is optimal in some sense.

By aggregating LDA learning through the boosting framework, this algorithm can deal with complicated binary classification problems, especially problems such as churn prediction with extremely imbalanced dataset. LD-Boosting is efficient since the most discriminative feature is computed in closed form in each iteration, with neither time-consuming numerical optimization nor exhaustive search. Furthermore, because of the computational simplicity of LDA learning, the method is able to utilize huge amount of training samples efficiently. In addition, boosting technique is employed in this algorithm to put heavier penalties on misclassification of the minority class, therefore directly reduces error cases and achieves more precise prediction results. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated by churn prediction experiments on a real bank customer churn data set.

Month-old babies already have the initial experience of invariance recognition of 3D objects. There is a slight lack of precision in the interpretation of biological vision. However, the small cost and the fast speed in calculation meet the requirements of invariance recognition, the rich visual experience in which play an important role. But what is the experience, how to acquire and how to use, these problems have never been satisfactorily resolved. In this paper we simulate the learning of visual experience in children, and solve a view angle estimated problem by using self-organizing network, which make the hidden experience clarified. Compared to the Classic camera calibration, which a large number of parameters need to be estimated, this method needs only one image and does not aim to 3D reconstruction. By avoiding the complex calibration and registration process, an amount of computation has been reduced. Visual experiences are all obtained from the most ordinary examples, and the characterization based on the geometric feature. Therefore, this method has strong expansibility and good generalization ability.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621083","","Biological system modeling;Calibration;Cameras;Computer science;Computer vision;Cybernetics;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pediatrics;Self-organizing networks","calibration;image recognition;image reconstruction;image registration","3D monocular image;3D reconstruction;biological vision;complex calibration;invariance recognition;registration process;self-organizing network;stereopsis experience;view angle estimation;visual experience acquisition","","0","","9","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we investigate the important papers in this direction; the cons and pros of the recent-proposed framework and algorithms for ranking are analyzed, and the relationships among them are discussed.
