During pre-process, important attributes are added to each SPP for the purpose of ray tracing.

In this paper, by establishing both upper and lower bound estimations on degree of approximation, the essential approximation ability of a class of FNNs is clarified in terms of the modulus of smoothness of functions to be approximated. The involved FNNs can not only approximate any continuous functions arbitrarily well, but also provide an explicit lower bound on number of hidden units required.

In this paper, the divide-conquer approach is proposed and applied in the identification of English phrases. This strategy divides the task of chunking into several sub-tasks according to sensitive features of each phrase and identifies different phrases in parallel. Then, a two-stage decreasing conflict strategy is used to synthesize each sub-task's answer.

In order to make this difficult task tractable, how the participant museums are linked conceptually must be looked at first before any implementation issues for links of more a physical nature can be considered. One promising avenue to this end seems to characterize what we call 'informational relationship' between participant museums, which are seen within a (notional) distributed system. And this characterization including reasoning about this relationship should be carried out in both a meaningful and a principled way. In this paper, we describe how to derive semantics in legacy relational database to form local ontology, and present an information flow based approach to mathematically model the relationship among multiple distributed local ontologies in terms of an information channel construction, which involves the construction of classifications and local logics and infomorphisms between them, thus global ontology construction and token connection discovery, To help the establishment of semantic correspondences between various components of the distributed system, which is necessary for the task, the cultural heritage domain ontology CIDOC conceptual reference model (CRM) is deployed as a bridge ontology.

Unlike in conventional network systems, the services and resources in grid are heterogeneous and dynamic, they also belong to different domains. So the intrusion detection system (IDS) for grid should be a system which could rapidly and dynamically integrate the related node detection resources of a grid computing application according to the dynamic detection demand and ensure the security of grid computing. Conventional network IDS lack the necessary flexibility needed by grid environment and could not dynamically adjust their structure to the dynamic grid computing applications. This paper provides a new flexible multi-agent approach to intrusion detection for grid (MAIDG). MAIDG not only takes advantage of the flexibility and autonomy of agent technology, but also makes good use of the Globus Toolkit4.0 (GT4)'s data management components which provide the virtual interfaces for all the (heterogeneous or homogeneous) detection resources and realize the publication, location, and high performance transfer of detection data.
