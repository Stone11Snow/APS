"Reliable face recognition by random subspace Support Vector Machine ensemble","B. Zhang","Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China","2012 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20121124","2012","1","","415","420","Though many progresses have been made, face recognition is still a challenging topic in computer vision. Most of the published works focused on accurate classifiers design to produce identity predictions for query faces without suggesting how reliable the predictions are. These classifiers may not be applicable in some critical situations where the incorrect predictions have serious consequences. Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper proposes a highly reliable face recognition scheme by Random Subspace Support Vector Machine (SVM) ensemble which provides a reject option. Being different with previous classifier ensembles which purpose to increase the classification accuracy only, the objective of the proposed SVM ensemble is to supply classification confidence to accommodate the situations where no decision should be made if the confidence is low. The ensemble is created using Random Subspace (RS) method, together with four different feature descriptions to comprehensively characterize face images, including Local Binary Pattern (LBP), Pyramid Histogram of Oriented Gradient (PHOG), Gabor filtering and wavelet transform. The consensus from the ensemble's voting conforms to the confidence measure and the rejection option is accomplished accordingly when the confidence falls below a threshold. The reliable recognition scheme is empirically evaluated using a realistic face database created by the author, showing that pre-defined 100% accuracy can be reached with a rejection rate 7%.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358950","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358950","Classification confidence;Random Subspace;Rejection option;Reliable face recognition;SVM ensemble","Abstracts;Face;Reliability","Gabor filters;computer vision;face recognition;image classification;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","Gabor filtering;LBP;PHOG;RS method;SVM;accurate classifiers design;classification accuracy;computer vision;face images;feature descriptions;local binary pattern;pyramid histogram of oriented Gradient;random subspace method;random subspace support vector machine ensemble;realistic face database;reject option;reliable face recognition;wavelet transform","","0","","20","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conceptually, this reachability should be able to help us expand our social networks to some extent because we can make friends without any physical interaction (but with cyber interactions only). There are no physical constraints in social media. While we agree with the above concept, we are curious of how this reachability property shapes our online social networks. Specifically, if physical location is no longer a barrier and physical interaction can be ignored when making friends online, then our online social networks should at least have the following two characteristics: (1) a certain number of friends are from different places in the world, and (2) a certain number of friends are not from our physical social circles (i.e., they are not our colleagues, not our high school friends, etc). In this paper, we aim at analyzing the role of physical location in online social networks. To conduct the analysis, we use Facebook, one of the largest social media sites to-date, as our data source. We crawl more than 2 million user profiles and study them in detail. To our surprise, we found that physical location still plays a critical role in our online social networks.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359544","Social network;physical location;reachability","Abstracts;Blogs;Cities and towns;Social network services","mobile computing;social networking (online)","Facebook;cyber interactions;data source;online friend making;online social networks;physical constraints;physical interaction;physical social circles;reachability property;social media network;social media sites;user physical location","","1","","27","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To ensure consistent performance under unconstrained environments, we propose a novel method to precisely locate fingertips by combing both statistical information of palm edge distribution and structure information of convex null analysis on palm contour. Briefly, first SVM (support vector machine) with a statistical nine-bin based HOG (histogram of oriented gradient) features is introduced for robust hand detection from video stream.

The basic idea is to first partition the unknown function according to the sorted input data whose corresponding output are the extremes, and the input data is treated as the centers of the fuzzy sets used in the fuzzy system. After the division, each of the small pieces of the unknown function will be a monotonic function. Then, a fuzzy set with easily adjustable slopes is introduced where two adjacent fuzzy sets will form a small piece of the fuzzy system. By adjusting the slopes of the fuzzy sets, each small piece will become a monotonic function. Each small piece of unknown function will be approximated by a corresponding small piece of fuzzy system. Thus, by dividing the unknown function into a number of monotonic functions, it serves as a guideline for using the least requirement of fuzzy sets. Finally, GA technique is used to improve the accuracy of function approximation in each small piece simultaneously. The approach is a proper way to construct the GA-based fuzzy system without incurring any extra information; one example is given to illustrate the simple but powerful method.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359672","Combinatorial explosion;Function approximation;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms","Abstracts;Approximation methods;Equations;Fuzzy systems;Xenon","function approximation;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;genetic algorithms;nonlinear functions","GA-based fuzzy systems;adjacent fuzzy sets;function approximation;input-output data pairs;monotonic functions;nonlinear functions","","0","","10","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ultimate goal of automated theorem finding in NBG set theory is to find new and interesting theorems. As the first step, this case study tries to do “rediscovery” in NBG set theory, i.e., to deduce already proved theorems from axioms, definitions and /or other theorems of NBG set theory. However, from the viewpoint of the mechanism of deducing theorems, “re-discovery” is as same as “discovery”. The paper shows several known theorems rediscovered successfully by the approach.

As a supervised dimensionality reduction method, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) performs well in classification applications, but is not the case for ranking tasks. Firstly, it does not take the relevance degrees into consideration, which is important for ranking problem. Secondly, owing to the supervised nature of LDA, a plenty of labeled samples are required, which are often costly and difficult to obtain. Therefore, based on LDA, we propose an improved method named Ranking Linear Discriminant Analysis (RLDA) by using the relevance degrees as labels.

The variance parameters of the linear gaussian state space are estimated by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Given the estimated parameters, the linear gaussian state space is used to forecast the electricity load on two hours SAM and 14PM respectively. The result shows that this model has higher forecasting precision than the one to four days ahead forecasting, and the state space model estimated by Gibbs sampling algorithm has better performance than the model based on the MH algorithm.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359017","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359017","Gibbs sampling;Inverted Gamma distribution;Kalman filter;Markov chain Momte Carlo;State space","Abstracts;Heating;Parameter estimation","Gaussian processes;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;load forecasting;parameter estimation;sampling methods;state-space methods","Gibbs sampling algorithm;Markov chain Monte Carlo method;electricity demand;explanatory variables;forecasting model;forecasting precision;hourly electricity load;hourly load forecasting;linear Gaussian state space model;parameter estimation;variance parameters;weather variables","","0","","13","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to solve the problem, the paper proposes a new approach to enhance the distinguishing capability of texture features for palm print recognition. It uses classical results on Riemannian geometry to obtain the information of palm lines and construct direction fields of palm lines. The direction fields become a part of the textures of the palmprint image to enhance the distinguishing capability of texture features. Finally, the dual-tree complex wavelet transform-based local binary pattern weighted histogram method (DT -CWT based LBPWH) is used to extract enhanced texture features.

In this algorithm, the histogram of each prediction mode is directly calculated based on the relationship between the pixels and coding modes. Then, the several most possible coding modes are selected from all prediction modes by using histogram.

The original voiceprint is transformed with random matrix based on the similarity-preserving of random projection. Chaff points are added to the codebook and matching is also performed in the transformed domain. Random projection improves the cancelability while chaff points conceal the genuine codeword to enhance the security. Binary indexes help identify the genuine codeword accurately.

Second, the idea to keep the critical value invariant before and after reduction is selected. Third, the structure of reduction rule is completely studied by using the discernibility vector approach.

To reduce the time required for people in rural areas to reach emergency care services and prevent the above tragedies, an “Emergency Medical Service Support System for Patients in Rural Areas” was developed. This system is aimed at support the current emergency and rescue command center (119 units). During emergencies in rural areas, the command center can authorize nearby vehicles with the rights to perform as an ambulance to transport emergency patients to hospitals promptly. This prevents treatment delays caused by waiting for an ambulance to arrive from a distant location. Additionally, the emergency and rescue command center can coordinate with the units responsible for the sections of road under construction to assist emergency vehicles in traveling through these areas smoothly. Finally, an ambulance can be sent to a relay station to transport patients to a hospital rapidly.
