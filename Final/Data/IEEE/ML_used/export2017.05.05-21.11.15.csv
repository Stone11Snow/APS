We incarnate motion engine with a new model NPHHMM, a hierarchical hidden Markov model with non-parametric output densities. Our work contributes in three aspects: (1) NPHHMM models both temporal and spatial characteristics of human motion precisely so to support recreation of new motion; (2) compared with first-order hidden Markov model, NPHHMM has longer memory for more accurate prediction; (3) the EM learning algorithm of NPHHMM incorporates output densities in non-parametric form, which provides a compact representation of prototypical poses without requirements of explicit compression or losing accuracy of body model by extracting the most significant dependencies between body joints. NPHHMM learned from captured 3D human motion can be used to generate a variety of realistic new motions, thus is useful for data-driven motion editing and synthesis, which is recently an active research area to relieve animators from intensive labor of manual work and to automate the production of character animation.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527515","EM algorithm;Motion synthesis;hidden Markov model;hierarchical hidden Markov model;motion capture","Animation;Biological system modeling;Character generation;Engines;Hidden Markov models;Humans;Joints;Predictive models;Production;Prototypes","computer animation;expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;image motion analysis;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","EM learning algorithm;character animation;data-driven motion editing;hierarchical hidden Markov model;human motion;motion engine;motion synthesis;nonparametric output density","","2","","29","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

BSOFMs has the ability to convert the vector from different input spaces with heterogeneous representation into one in a unique feature space and enable us to get the same description. In the training process, the raw data produced by different gloves work as input and ideal output alternately. Then the device-dependent description of the hand shape is converted to the compact feature output in the device independent feature space. Based on these models, the incorporation of BSOFMs and the existing recognition framework is introduced and it is crucial to creating a useful device-independent system.

Rough sets theory offers new approaches to acquiring a set of classification rules from a decision table and reasoning under uncertainty.

The key element of the method is mining the correlation between wavelet coefficients in a short-duration (about 20ms) in each subband. This is done by performing a four-level 1D wavelet decomposition of the audio signals, using a linear predictor for the magnitude of wavelet subband coefficients to extract significant statistics features, and employing support vector machines to detect the existence of hidden messages.

With the integration of global planning and local planning, this path planning approach is based on polar coordinates in which the desirable direction angle is taken into consideration as an optimization index. Detecting unknown obstacles with local feedback information by robotâ€™s sensor system, this approach orients the desirable direction of mobile robot so as to generate local sub-goal in every planning window. As a result, the difference between real direction angle and desirable direction angle of robot motion steers the mobile robot to detour collisions and advance toward the target without stopping to re-plan a path when new sensor data become available. This approach is not only simple and flexible, but also overcomes flaws of global planning and local planning. The effectiveness, feasibility, real-time performance, optimization capability, high precision and perfect stability are demonstrated by means of simulation examples.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527001","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527001","Mobile robot;desirable direction angle;real-time path planning","Collision avoidance;Mobile robots;Motion planning;Navigation;Path planning;Robot kinematics;Robot motion;Robot sensing systems;Robotics and automation;Sensor systems","","Mobile robot;desirable direction angle;real-time path planning","","1","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Two simple rules for composition of kernels are used to produce the hybrid kernels. The experimental results show that the SVR with different scale kernels of the same type has different performance. The SVR using the polynomial kernel with lower degree are more robust than that using RBF kernel with narrower parameter. The hybrid of different types or scales of kernels can improve the robustness to some extent.

It is also a main technical challenge due to the similarity of different fonts. The reconstruction quality of layout depends on the accuracy of font recognition. However, the prevalent method of font recognition is predominant font recognition based on the fact that the most layouts are printed in a single font, which makes it impossible to reconstruct the original layout. In this paper, an improved font recognition method of individual character is proposed. The approach consists of three steps. In the first step, the guidance fonts are acquired based on Gabor filter optimized with genetic algorithm (GA). Then a single font recognizer is applied to get the matching results with the help of the guidance fonts and the layout knowledge of font typesetting. Finally, the post-processing of font recognition is fulfilled according to the layout knowledge.

Different from the model-based approaches, the limb angle information is extracted by analyzing the variation of silhouette width without needing the human body model.

This paper presents a new simple face tracking method which is based on a stereo vision camera system. All cameras in this stereo vision camera system are pre-calibrated and the system can provide accurate depth information of the scene. The proposed tracking method adopts KLT and template matching to track 2D facial features. Then the stereo vision camera system is used to obtain corresponding depth information of these features.

However, due to several reasons such as misconfiguration on the routers, it often occurs that one AS (say AS1) propagates the prefix that has been already assigned to another AS (say AS2) and other peers receive its routing prefix update from AS2 and inject the misconfigured AS information to their peering routers. Since the routing information associated with AS1 is over written by AS2, AS1 loses the network reachability. This problem is known as the conflict origin AS prefix or the multiple origin AS (MOAS). We recognize that this is a severe problem, which degrades the quality of Internet backbone infrastructure. This paper presents an approach to detected conflict origin AS prefix based on rough set classification.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527488","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527488","Autonomous System;Border Gateway Protocol;Conflict Origin AS prefix;Rough Set classification","Classification algorithms;Convergence;Degradation;Delay;Electronic mail;IP networks;Information science;Internet;Routing protocols;Spine","Internet;internetworking;pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing;rough set theory;routing protocols","Internet;autonomous system;border gateway protocol;conflict origin;interdomain routing protocol;network reachability;peering router;rough set classification;router misconfiguration;routing information;routing prefix update","","0","","17","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But the computing complexity is relatively high so that it is not fitted to solve large amount of sample calculation problems. K-means method has high efficiency while it is affected easily by the choice of the center of initial clustering. So to the irregular distributed samples, the clustering effect is usually not good. The paper focuses on the distribution features and complexities of samples in Web page classification and puts forward a classification method - to combine the layered clustering and plane partition. Firstly we use the algorithm of layered clustering in a few of samples to generate original clustering centers of sample set. Secondly, K-means method is used to classify the whole samples set. This strategy not only takes full advantage of the high efficiency of the K-means algorithm but also makes good use of the high precision and reliability of layered clustering method.

The immune genetic algorithm is treated as an optimization technique to find the optimal solution. The presented algorithm recommends the use of adaptive probabilities of crossover, mutation and immune operation. Furthermore, it effectively exploits some prior knowledge of pending problem and the information of evolved individual's past history to make vaccines. The segmentation algorithm based on the AIGA is implemented and tested on several gray-scale images. The satisfactory experimental results are obtained.
