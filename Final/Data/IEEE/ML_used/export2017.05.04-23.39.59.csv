There is a correlation to health and the level of activity of an individual, which has captured interest in this field in computing science to determine the level of activity of an individual. The focus of the study is the classification of younger and older gait patterns climbing up and down a set of 13 stairs. From using acceleration data from an accelerometer placed on the lumbro-sacral joint; 14 gait features are extracted and analysed. The machine learning algorithms focused in this study are Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), KStar and Support Vector Machine (SVM). An evaluation of performance among three machine learning algorithms was carried out. MLP was found to provide the highest in accuracy for classification. Accuracy of 95.7% was found for classifying a subject walking either up or down the stairs and an accuracy of 80.6% for classifying whether the subject was younger or older. An evaluation of individual features showed poor performance of classification for young and older subjects climbing up and down stairs, and at most cases failed to distinguish between the two classes. However, subsets of features were created using a sequential feature selection algorithm based on feature ranking and individual feature performance. The performance of each subset was recorded and a subset of the top four features achieved an accuracy of 81.7% for classification between young and older subjects. In comparison, 13 features were required to obtain the best performance of 95.7% to distinguish between up and down classes.","2157-9555;21579555","Electronic:978-1-4244-9953-3; POD:978-1-4244-9950-2","10.1109/ICNC.2011.6022097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6022097","activity recognition;classification;gait patterns;machine learning;statistical analysis","Accelerometers;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Machine learning;Predictive models;Support vector machines","accelerometers;feature extraction;gait analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","KStar;activity recognition;gait feature extraction;gait pattern assessment statistical approach;healthy adult climbing stairs;lumbro-sacral joint;machine learning algorithms;multilayer perceptron;sequential feature selection algorithm;support vector machine","","4","","21","","","26-28 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The additional data, the support vectors and the samples, of which the angle between subtraction additional sample and the historical separation plane is minmum, are retained in MAISVM 1.

The performance of MAISVM 2 is better than MAISVM 1. Its accuracy is no less than LISVM and its speed is faster than SVM-INC.

Nevertheless, analyzing RRATE behavior while dealing with complex and big (in terms of nodes and link number) networks, has been shown that are possible more enhancements if changes are made to the core function that evaluates the “goodness” of a path over other paths. That function takes into account the critical links and the residual bandwidths available on the network. More specifically, changes have been made to the way those values are computed taking into account no more the scalar value of residual bandwidths and critical links but a ranking of the first values and an appropriate weighting of the second parameters.

Unfortunately, cheating behaviors are rather difficult to detect and existing approaches generally require human supervision. In this work we introduce a novel framework to automatically detect cheating behaviors in Unreal Tournament III by exploiting supervised learning techniques. Our framework consists of three main components: (i) an extended game-server responsible for collecting the game data; (ii) a processing backend in charge of preprocessing data and detecting the cheating behaviors; (iii) an analysis frontend. We validated our framework with an experimental analysis which involved three human players, three game maps and five different supervised learning techniques, i.e., decision trees, Naive Bayes, random forest, neural networks, support vector machines. The results show that all the supervised learning techniques are able to classify correctly almost 90% of the test examples.","2325-4270;23254270","Electronic:978-1-4577-0011-8; POD:978-1-4577-0010-1; USB:978-1-4577-0009-5","10.1109/CIG.2011.6032016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032016","","Engines;Games;Humans;Radar;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Weapons","Bayes methods;computer games;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;support vector machines","cheating behavior;cheating detection framework;decision tree;game data preprocessing;game server;human player;human supervision;machine learning;multiplayer online game;neural network;random forest;supervised learning technique;support vector machine;unfair competitive advantage;unreal tournament III","","2","","21","","","Aug. 31 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much effort has been put into the development of methodology for predicting PPIs and the construction of PPIs networks. Though a high accurate rate those methods have achieved, it was found that the accurate rate strongly depends on the balance of datasets. Compare to negative datasets, positive datasets contain some proteins which are called hub protein intact more proteins. And the unbalance between datasets leads to an excellent performance of PPIs prediction. But when one used balance datasets, the performance is disappointed. Different Biological functions are supported by different local PPIs network. Does it mean that local PPIs network has its own feature? In this paper, we managed to catch features of local networks in three species on the condition that there is no unbalance between positive dataset and negative dataset. Features of local PPIs network fades as the network extended. The associate rules method is used to analyze features of local PPI network.

Now days, traditional IP traffic classification techniques such as port number based and payload based direct packet inspection techniques are seldom used because of use of dynamic port number instead of well-known port number in packet headers and various encryption techniques which inhibit inspection of packet payload. Current trends are use of machine learning (ML) techniques for this classification. In this research paper, real time internet traffic dataset has been developed using packet capturing tool and then using attribute selection algorithms, a reduced feature dataset has been developed. After that, five ML algorithms MLP, RBF, C4.5, Bayes Net and Naïve Bayes are used for IP traffic classification with these datasets.

The efficacy of a monitoring and forecasting system relies on the performance of HAB detection. We propose a machine learning based spatio-temporal data mining approach for the detection of HAB events in the region of the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, a spatio-temporal cubical neighborhood around the training sample is introduced to retrieve relevant spectral information of both HAB and non-HAB classes. The feature relevance is studied through mutual information criterion to understand the important features in classifying HABs from non-HABs. Kernel based support vector machine is used as a classifier in the detection of HABs. This approach gives a significant performance improvement by reducing the false alarm rate. Further, with the achieved classification accuracy, the seasonal variations and sequential occurrence of algal blooms are predicted from spatio-temporal datasets. New variability visualization is introduced to illustrate the dynamic behavior of HABs across space and time.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2010.2103927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5701668","Data mining;harmful algal bloom;machine learning;spatio-temporal","Data mining;Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Sea measurements;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Gulf of Mexico;coastal waters;harmful algal blooms;machine learning based spatio-temporal data mining;seasonal variations;spatio-temporal cubical neighborhood;spatio-temporal datasets;support vector machine;training sample","","20","","50","","20110124","Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Anomalous SIP requests can be used to remotely launch malicious activity. Furthermore, anomalous messages are capable of crashing - sometimes with one message only - servers and end points. Recently, it is shown that a malicious SIP message ""INVITE of Death"" crash a server or gain unfettered access to it. In contrast, little research is done to protect IMS against such anomalous messages. In this paper, we propose an anomalous message detection framework that extracts novel syntactical features from SIP messages at the P-CSCF of an IMS. Our framework operates in four steps: (1) analyzes the byte-level distribution of SIP message, (2) extracts spatial features from IMS messages in form of byte transition probabilities, (3) uses well-known feature selection scheme to remove redundancy in the features set, and (4) uses standard machine learning algorithms to raise the final alarm. The benefit of our framework is that it is lightweight requiring less processing and memory resources and provides high detection accuracy. We have evaluated our system on a real-world IMS dataset consisting of more than 10, 000 benign and malicious SIP messages. The results of our experiments demonstrate that using machine learning algorithms, our framework achieves detection accuracy of more than 99%. Last but not least, its testing time is 152μ seconds per packet, as a result, it can be easily deployed on IMS core.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4367-3; POD:978-1-61284-427-5","10.1109/ITNG.2011.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945297","IMS Security;INVITE of Death;Machine Learning;SIP Security;VoIP Security","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Protocols;Security;Servers;Testing","Internet telephony;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia communication;security of data;signalling protocols","IP-multimedia subsystem;P-CSCF;SIP;Voice over IP;anomalous message;byte-level distribution;feature extraction;machine learning;malicious activity;proxy call state control function","","1","","29","","","11-13 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However this is not always true in the real adversarial decision-making situations where the future data sets and the training data set are no longer from the same population, due to the transformations employed by the adversaries. As more and more machine learning systems are put into use, it is imperative to consider the security of the machine learning system. As a emerging problem, it is attracting more and more researchers' attention. In this article, we present a brief overview on secure machine learning and current progress on developing secure machine learning algorithms.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4454-0; POD:978-1-4577-0781-0","10.1109/SSIRI-C.2011.15","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6004498","Overview;Secure Machine Learning","Collaboration;Intrusion detection;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;USA Councils","decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","machine learning security;network intrusion detection;real adversarial decision making situation;secure machine learning;spam detection","","1","","22","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various models have been used in the past but there has been no effort to point out which model is suited best for predicting option prices. Computational time plays an important role in prediction of option prices since these time series are usually large. It is computationally expensive to employ a traditional statistical model which comprises of two phases namely model identification and prediction. A good fitting model may not always be good for prediction due to high fluctuation in the market. Various non parametric models like Multilayer perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis function (RBF) Neural Network and Support Vector regression (SVR) have been employed in the past. MLP and RBF networks take enormous amount of time since the network is learned after a number of iterations. In this paper, prediction of American stock option prices (both call and put options) for companies belonging to various sectors and also prediction of European option prices of Nifty index futures has been attempted using GRNN which has not been attempted so far in the literature. Comparative performance evaluation of GRNN has been done with Support Vector Regression (SVR), MLP and Black Scholes Model. It has been shown that the performance of GRNN is superior to the well known Black Sholes model and other non parametric models like MLP and RBF both in terms of accuracy and time and it performs at par with SVR.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4244-9637-2; POD:978-1-4244-9635-8","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033283","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033283","","Computational modeling;Kernel;Machine learning;Neural networks;Predictive models;Pricing;Support vector machines","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;prediction theory;pricing;radial basis function networks;regression analysis;stock markets","American stock option prices;Black Scholes Model;European option prices;Nifty index;RBF networks;efficient option pricing prediction model;fitting model;machine learning techniques;multilayer perceptron;radial basis function neural network;statistical model;support vector regression","","0","","14","","","July 31 2011-Aug. 5 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through extensive simulations we show that the proposed machine-learning algorithm adapts very quickly to changes in the RTT. Our results show a considerable reduction in the number of retransmitted packets and a increase in goodput, in particular on more heavily congested scenarios.

In the field of geospatial data processing, there is a high degree of interest to find an optimal image classifier technique. Many image classification methods such as maximum likelihood, K-Nearest are being used for determining crop patterns, land use and mining other useful geospatial information. But SVM is now considered to be one of the powerful kernel based classifier that can be adopted for resolving classification problems. The objective of the study is to use SVM technique for classifying multi spectral satellite image dataset and compare the overall accuracy with the conventional image classification method.

However, most of these are not directly applicable to image segmentation problem due to heavy computational demands. Super pixels substantially reduce the computational requirements of the semi-supervised algorithms, hence, making them applicable to general image segmentation tasks.

However, the ability of ML to find transportable signatures depends mainly on the training data sets. In this paper, we explore the importance of sampling training data sets for the ML algorithms, specifically Genetic Programming, C5.0, Naive Bayesian and AdaBoost, to find transportable signatures. To this end, we employed two techniques for sampling network training data sets, namely random sampling and consecutive sampling. Results show that random sampling and 90-minute consecutive sampling have the best performance in terms of accuracy using C5.0 and SBB, respectively. In terms of complexity, the size of C5.0 solutions increases as the training size increases, whereas SBB finds simpler solutions.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4244-7835-4; POD:978-1-4244-7834-7","10.1109/CEC.2011.5949799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949799","Classification;Encryption;Machine Learning;Sampling training data sets;Security;VoIP;transportability","Bayesian methods;Cryptography;Decision trees;Payloads;Protocols;Training;Training data","Bayes methods;Internet telephony;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","AdaBoost;C5.0;VoIP traffic classification;consecutive sampling;genetic programming;machine learning;naive Bayesian;random sampling;transportable signatures;voice over IP","","1","","35","","","5-8 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, to provide the information about an object clinically in terms of its size and shape, image segmentation and classification are important tools in medical image processing. Ultrasound is a versatile imaging technique that can reveal the internal structure of organs, often with astounding clarity. Ultrasound is unique in its ability to image patient anatomy and physiology in real time, providing an important, rapid and non-invasive means of evaluation. Ultrasound continues to make significant contributions to patient care by reassuring patients and enhancing their quality of life by helping physicians understand their anatomy in ways not possible with other techniques. US imaging is thus one of the most commonly used auxiliary tools in clinical diagnosis. In this paper, an automatic system is developed that classifies the thyroid images and segments the thyroid gland using machine learning algorithms. The classifiers such as SVM, ELM are used.

In spite of their ability to explore promising regions of the search space, they present two major drawbacks: 1) they can take a relatively long time to locate the exact optimum and 2) may sometimes not find the optimum with sufficient precision. Memetic Algorithms are evolutionary algorithms inspired by both Darwinian principles and Dawkins' notion of a meme, able not only to converge to high-quality solutions, but also search more efficiently than their conventional evolutionary counterparts. However, memetic approaches are affected by several design issues related to the different choices that can be made to implement them. This paper introduces a multiagent-based memetic algorithm which executes in a parallel way different cooperating optimization strategies in order to solve a given problem's instance in an efficient way. The algorithm adaptation is performed by jointly exploiting a knowledge extraction process together with a decision making framework based on fuzzy methodologies. The effectiveness of our approach is tested in several experiments in which our results are compared with those obtained by nonadaptive memetic algorithms. The superiority of the proposed strategy is manifest in the majority of cases.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2011.2166782","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6011691","Adaptive memetic algorithms;data mining;fuzzy logic;multiagent systems","Algorithm design and analysis;Data mining;Machine learning;Memetics;Multiagent systems","evolutionary computation;fuzzy set theory;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;optimisation;search problems","Darwinian principles;Dawkins' notion;agent based machine learning;computational model;cooperating optimization strategies;decision making;evolutionary algorithms;fuzzy methodologies;knowledge extraction process;memetic adaptability;multiagent based memetic algorithm","","18","","35","","20110905","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They either have good efficiency but highly depend on the accuracy of the equivalent circuit models, which may fail the synthesis when the frequency is high, or they fully depend on electromagnetic (EM) simulations, with a high solution quality but are too time consuming. To address the problem of combining high solution quality and good efficiency, a new method, called memetic machine learning-based differential evolution (MMLDE), is presented. The key idea of MMLDE is the proposed online surrogate model-based memetic evolutionary optimization mechanism, whose training data are generated adaptively in the optimization process. In particular, by using the differential evolution algorithm as the optimization kernel and EM simulation as the performance evaluation method, high-quality solutions can be obtained. By using Gaussian process and artificial neural network in the proposed search mechanism, surrogate models are constructed online to predict the performances, saving a lot of expensive EM simulations. Compared with available methods with the best solution quality, MMLDE can obtain comparable results, and has approximately a tenfold improvement in computational efficiency, which makes the computational time for optimized component synthesis acceptable. Moreover, unlike many available methods, MMLDE does not need any equivalent circuit models or any coarse-mesh EM models. Experiments of 60 GHz syntheses and comparisons with the state-of-art methods provide evidence of the important advantages of MMLDE.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2011.2162067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6022011","Artificial neural network;differential evolution;gaussian process;inductor synthesis;microwave components;surrogate model;transformer synthesis","Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling;Microwave circuits;Microwave integrated circuits;Optimization;Radio frequency","Gaussian processes;electronic engineering computing;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);millimetre wave integrated circuits;neural nets;search problems","Gaussian process;artificial neural network;differential evolution algorithm;electromagnetic simulation;equivalent circuit;evolutionary computation;frequency 60 GHz;high frequency RF IC;integrated passive components;machine learning techniques;memetic machine learning based differential evolution;microwave passive components;search mechanism;surrogate model based memetic evolutionary optimization mechanism","","19","","28","","","Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

It is challenging due to the underlying complexity, and the relatively limited understanding of the HVS and its intricate mechanisms. There are two important issues regarding VQA: (a) the temporal factors apart from the spatial ones also need to be considered, (b) the contribution of each factor and their interaction to the overall video quality needs to be determined. In this paper, we attempt to tackle the first issue by utilizing the variation of spatial quality along the temporal axis. The second issue is addressed by the use of machine learning; we believe this to be more convincing since the relationship between the factors and the overall quality is derived via training with substantial ground truth (i.e. subjective scores).

In the last years these threats have reached a new quality of automatization and sophistication, rendering most defenses ineffective. Conventional security measures that rely on the manual analysis of security incidents and attack development inherently fail to provide a timely protection from these threats. As a consequence, computer systems often remain unprotected over longer periods of time. The field of machine learning has been considered an ideal match for this problem, as learning methods provide the ability to automatically analyze data and support early detection of threats. However, only few research has produced practical results so far and there is notable skepticism in the community about learning-based defenses. In this paper, we reconsider the problems, challenges and advantages of combining machine learning and computer security. We identify factors that are critical for the efficacy and acceptance of learning methods in security.

The algorithms used include artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM) with the extension for regression, and kappa nearest neighbor (k-NN). Molecules were described using optimized feature sets derived from a series of scalar, two- and three-dimensional descriptors including 2-D and 3-D autocorrelation, and radial distribution function. Feature optimization was performed as a sequential forward feature selection. The data set contained over 25,000 molecules with experimentally determined logP values collected from the Reaxys and MDDR databases, as well as data mining through SciFinder. LogP, the logarithm of the equilibrium octanol-water partition coefficient for a given substance is a metric of the hydrophobicity. This property is an important metric for drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). In this work, models were built by systematically optimizing feature sets and algorithmic parameters that predict logP with a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.86 for compounds in an independent test set. This result presents a substantial improvement over XlogP, an incremental system that achieves a rmsd of 1.41 over the same dataset. The final models were 5-fold cross-validated.

The sharp onsets and offsets of light are known to induce a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) in the electroencephalogram (EEG) at low frequencies. However, it is not well-known how the brain processes visual flicker at the threshold of conscious perception and beyond. To shed more light on this, we ran an EEG study in which we asked participants (N=6) to discriminate on a behavioral level between visual stimuli in which they perceived flicker and those that they perceived as constant wave light. We found that high frequency flicker which is not perceived consciously anymore still elicits a neural response in the corresponding frequency band of EEG, con-tralateral to the stimulated hemifield. The main contribution of this paper is to show the benefit of machine learning techniques for investigating this effect of subconscious processing: Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) filtering in combination with classification based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) could be used to reveal the effect for additional participants and stimuli, with high statistical significance. We conclude that machine learning techniques are a valuable extension of conventional neurophysiological analysis that can substantially boost the sensitivity to subconscious effects, such as the processing of imperceptible flicker.","1094-687X;1094687X","Electronic:978-1-4577-1589-1; POD:978-1-4244-4121-1; USB:978-1-4244-4122-8","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090625","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6090625","","Electroencephalography;Humans;Light emitting diodes;Light sources;Machine learning;Training;Visualization","electroencephalography;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;signal classification;visual evoked potentials;visual perception","CSP filtering;EEG frequency band;LDA based classification;SSVEP;common spatial pattern filtering;constant wave light;electroencephalogram;high frequency flicker;imperceptible peripheral flicker;lighting;linear discriminant analysis;low frequency EEG;machine learning;neural response;steady state visually evoked potential;subconscious processing;visual stimuli","Adult;Artificial Intelligence;Electroencephalography;Female;Flicker Fusion;Humans;Male","2","","16","","","Aug. 30 2011-Sept. 3 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Project personnel must therefore demonstrate that an as-built system meets all relevant regulatory codes. Current methods for demonstrating compliance rely either on after-the-fact audits, which can lead to significant refactoring when regulations are not met, or else require analysts to construct and use traceability matrices to demonstrate compliance. Manual tracing can be prohibitively time-consuming; however automated trace retrieval methods are not very effective due to the vocabulary mismatches that often occur between regulatory codes and product level requirements. This paper introduces and evaluates two machine-learning methods, designed to improve the quality of traces generated between regulatory codes and product level requirements. The first approach uses manually created traceability matrices to train a trace classifier, while the second approach uses web-mining techniques to reconstruct the original trace query. The techniques were evaluated against security regulations from the USA government's Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act (HIPAA) traced against ten healthcare related requirements specifications. Results demonstrated improvements for the subset of HIPAA regulations that exhibited high fan-out behavior across the requirements datasets.","0270-5257;02705257","Electronic:978-1-60558-719-6; POD:978-1-60558-719-6","10.1145/1806799.1806825","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6062083","regulatory compliance;requirements classification;traceability","Encryption;Measurement;Medical services;Probabilistic logic;Software;Training","health care;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;security of data;software maintenance","HIPAA;Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act;healthcare;machine learning approach;product specific requirements;regulatory codes;security regulations;software intensive systems;software refactoring;traceability matrices;web-mining techniques","","37","1","31","","","2-8 May 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From the viewpoint of operational expenditure as well as the global environment, power consumption of a server cluster must be decreased. Power consumption is decreased by operating as few computers as possible to offer sufficiently good performance against changes in load. For this operation, it is necessary to decide exactly how many computers should be turned on or off for the measured load metrics. The number of computers should be determined by estimating multiple load metrics, because a single metric does not adequately represent the statuses of various bottlenecked resources. Moreover, the mapping from these metrics to the performance experienced by users is not simple. Thus, the number of computers must be calculated considering the complicated relationship among the metrics. In addition, decision rules should be appropriately updated if the service content or computer specification changes. To satisfy these requirements, this study proposes a scheme based on a machine learning technique as a method of deciding the number of server computers. This paper first presents how a machine learning technique is applied for deciding the number of computers. Then, its implementation is presented, and the effectiveness of the scheme is confirmed through experiments.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4388-8; POD:978-1-4577-0383-6","10.1109/CIT.2011.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6036827","machine learning;measurement;power management;server cluster;traffic","Bit rate;Central Processing Unit;Computers;Machine learning;Power measurement;Servers","learning (artificial intelligence);power aware computing;workstation clusters","decision rule;global environment;machine learning;multiple load metrics;network services;operational expenditure;power consumption;power management;server cluster","","2","","13","","","Aug. 31 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, a relational database model that guarantees ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties is not a good option for a wireless sensor network, since consistent connectivity or the uninterrupted operation of the sensor nodes cannot be expected. We noted that the NoSQL approach which does not rely on the ACID properties is a better match for a database abstraction for WSNs.

Here we propose a framework for autonomic scheduling of tasks and web-services on cloud environments, optimizing the profit taking into account revenue for task execution minus penalties for service-level agreement violations, minus power consumption cost. The principal contribution is the combination of consolidation and virtualization technologies, mathematical optimization methods, and machine learning techniques. The data-center infrastructure, tasks to execute, and desired profit are casted as a mathematical programming model, which can then be solved in different ways to find good task scheduling. We use an exact solver based on mixed linear programming as a proof of concept but, since it is an NP-complete problem, we show that approximate solvers provide valid alternatives for finding approximately optimal schedules. The machine learning is used to estimate the initially unknown parameters of the mathematical model. In particular, we need to predict a priori resource usage (such as CPU consumption) by different tasks under current workloads, and estimate task service-level-agreement (such as response time) given workload features, host characteristics, and contention among tasks in the same host. Experiments show that machine learning algorithms can predict system behavior with acceptable accuracy, and that their combination with the exact or approximate schedulers manages to allocate tasks to hosts striking a balance between revenue for executed tasks, quality of service, and power consumption.","2152-1085;21521085","Electronic:978-0-7695-4572-1; POD:978-1-4577-1904-2","10.1109/Grid.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6076500","Data centers;Energy;Heuristics;Machine Learning;SLA;Scheduling","Load modeling;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Power demand;Predictive models;Time factors;Web services","Web services;cloud computing;computational complexity;computer centres;economics;environmental factors;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;power aware computing;scheduling","NP complete problem;Web services;adaptive scheduling;approximate solvers;autonomic tasks scheduling;cloud environments;economic factors;energy related costs;green IT;machine learning;mathematical optimization methods;mathematical programming model;mixed linear programming;power aware managed data centers;service level agreement violations;virtualization technologies","","14","","24","","","21-23 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some vehicular network (VANET) applications in particular use broadcast communications extensively. We propose using the distance-to-mean method to facilitate these applications. The performance of this method depends heavily on the value of the decision threshold, and it is difficult to choose a value for that threshold that results in good performance across a wide range of network scenarios. Node density, spatial distribution pattern, and wireless channel conditions all affect the optimal statistical threshold value. VANETs exhibit wide ranges of these factors, so protocols designed to support these applications must be adaptive to those variations. In this work we address this design challenge by using black-box optimization algorithms based on machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to automatically discover a decision threshold value for the distance-to-mean method that is simultaneously adaptive to node density, node distribution pattern, and channel quality. The resulting decision surface is a function of the number of neighbors N, the quadrat statistic Q, and the Rician fading parameter K. The result is the Statistical Location-Assisted Broadcast (SLAB) protocol. Evaluations using JiST/SWANS show SLAB achieves high reachability and efficient bandwidth consumption in both urban and highway scenarios with varying node density.","2376-6492;23766492","Electronic:978-1-4244-9538-2; POD:978-1-4244-9539-9","10.1109/IWCMC.2011.5982799","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982799","Wireless ad-hoc networking;multi-hop broadcast;vehicular networking","Bandwidth;Fading;Mathematical model;Optimization;Protocols;Rician channels;Slabs","Rician channels;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;particle swarm optimisation;protocols;statistical analysis;vehicular ad hoc networks","JiST-SWANS;Rician fading parameter;ad hoc wireless networks;black-box optimization algorithms;broadcast communications;channel quality;decision threshold value;distance-to-mean method;genetic algorithms;machine learning techniques;multihop broadcast protocols;node density;node distribution pattern;optimal statistical threshold value;particle swarm optimization;spatial distribution pattern;statistical location-assisted broadcast protocol;vehicular network applications;wireless channel conditions","","6","","18","","","4-8 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, this paper proposes that the supper vector machine (SVM) is used to construct the switching condition. The relation between the current situation (previous input sequence and previous output sequence), applied input sequence, and output evolution is learned by a support vector machine (SVM) from the database of previous control results. As a result, the learned SVM can determine the most suitable input for the current situation and the reference output.

The fundamental task in this area is to measure and interpret complex time and condition dependent parameters such as the activity or flux of metabolites in cells, their concentration, tissues elements and other biosamples. The careful study of all these elements has led to important insights in the functioning of metabolism. Recently, however, there is a growing interest towards an intagrated approach to studying biological systems. This is the main goal in Systems Biology where a combined investigation of several components of a biological system is thought to produce a thorough understanding of such systems. Metabolic networks are not only structurally complex but behave also in a stochastic fashion. Therefore, it is necessary to express structure and handle uncertainty to construct complete dynamics of these networks. In this paper we describe how stochastic modeling and simulation can be performed in a symbolic-statistical machine learning (ML) framework. We show that symbolic ML deals with structural and relational complexity while statistical ML provides principled approaches to uncertainty modeling. Learning is used to analyze traces of biochemical reactions and model the dynamicity through parameter learning, while inference is used to produce stochastic simulation of the network.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4373-4; POD:978-1-61284-709-2","10.1109/CISIS.2011.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5989023","inference;machine learning;metabolomics;simulation;systems biology","Biochemistry;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Hidden Markov models;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Stochastic processes","biology computing;chemical reactions;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","biochemical reactions;biological system;metabolic networks;metabolomics;relational complexity;statistical machine learning framework","","0","","27","","","June 30 2011-July 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the objective is to perform data analysis to investigate if specific features have a greater impact on predicting whether the patients had the desired outcome after a surgical procedure is done.

The flaws in the e-mail protocols and the increasing amount of electronic business and financial transactions directly contribute to the increase in e-mail-based threats. Email spam is one of the major problems of the today's Internet, bringing financial damage to companies and annoying individual users. Spam emails are invading users without their consent and filling their mail boxes. They consume more network capacity as well as time in checking and deleting spam mails. The vast majority of Internet users are outspoken in their disdain for spam, although enough of them respond to commercial offers that spam remains a viable source of income to spammers. While most of the users want to do right think to avoid and get rid of spam, they need clear and simple guidelines on how to behave. In spite of all the measures taken to eliminate spam, they are not yet eradicated. Also when the counter measures are over sensitive, even legitimate emails will be eliminated. Among the approaches developed to stop spam, filtering is the one of the most important technique. Many researches in spam filtering have been centered on the more sophisticated classifier-related issues. In recent days, Machine learning for spam classification is an important research issue.

Machine learning is a powerful tool for modeling correlations in physiological signals, but model complexity in typical biomedical applications makes detection too computationally intensive. We analyze the computational energy trade-offs and propose a method of restructuring the computations to yield more favorable trade-offs, especially for typical biomedical applications. We thus develop a methodology for implementing low-energy classification kernels and demonstrate energy reduction in practical biomedical systems. Two applications, arrhythmia detection using electrocardiographs (ECG) from the MIT-BIH database and seizure detection using electroencephalographs (EEG) from the CHB-MIT database, are used.

First, real hotspots become hard to identify at early design stages and hard to fix at post-layout stages. Second, false alarms must be kept low to avoid excessive and expensive post-processing hotspot removal. Third, full chip physical verification and optimization require very fast turn-around time. Last but not least, rapid technology advancement favors generic hotspot detection methodologies to avoid exhaustive pattern enumeration and excessive development/update as technology evolves. To address the above issues, we propose a high performance hotspot detection methodology consisting of: 1) a fast layout analyzer; 2) powerful hotspot pattern identifiers; and 3) a generic and efficient flow with successive performance refinements. We implement our algorithms with industry-strength engine under real manufacturing conditions and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in false alarms (2.4X to 2300X reduction) and runtime (5X to 237X reduction), meanwhile achieving similar or better hotspot accuracies. Compared with pattern matching, our method achieves higher prediction accuracy for hotspots that are not previously characterized, therefore, more detection generality when exhaustive pattern enumeration is too expensive to perform a priori. Such high performance hotspot detection is especially suitable for lithography-friendly physical design.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2011.2164537","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6046168","Lithography hotspot detection;machine learning;manufacturability/yield;pattern classification","Design for manufacture;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Lithography;Machine learning;Pattern recognition","learning (artificial intelligence);lithography;pattern matching","detection generality;exhaustive pattern enumeration;fast layout analyzer;generic hotspot detection;hotspot pattern identifier;industry-strength engine;lithography hotspot detection;lithography-friendly physical design;machine learning;pattern matching;post-processing hotspot removal;rapid technology advancement;real manufacturing condition;refined pattern identification","","10","","26","","","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The advantages of such an approach are often hampered by additional parameters and hyper-parameters involved in creating this model, not to mention the greater likelihood of over-training. Additionally, existing methods to create a localized multi-kernel classifier rely on partitioning the feature-space, followed by applying a multi-kernel to the partitioned data points. We introduce a Bayesian approach to the localized multi-kernel machine. The new model is shown to provide greater classification abilities by learning the local scales of the feature-space without the need to partition the data.

Thus self-coherent tomography is proposed, which has two main steps. First, phase reconstruction is achieved using the received amplitude only data. Second, the standard radio tomographic imaging algorithms are used for data analysis. However for the real application, the effect of noise can not be ignored.

To this end, binary identification of SSH vs non-SSH traffic is used as a case study since the plain text initiation of the SSH protocol allows us to obtain data sets with a reliable ground truth. The methods are subject to several tests using different export options, feature sets, and training and test traffic traces for a total of 128 different configurations. Of particular interest are test cases which that use a test set from a different network than that which the model was trained on, i.e. robustness of the trained models. Results show that the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) based trained model is able to achieve the best performance among the three methods when each approach is tested on traffic traces that are captured on the same network as the training network trace. On the other hand, C4.5 achieved the best results among the three methods when tested on traffic traces which are captured on totally different networks than the training trace. Furthermore, it is shown that continuous sampling of the training data is no better than random sampling, but the training data is very important for how well the classifiers will perform on traffic traces captured from different networks. Moreover, the C4.5 based approach provides the fastest and the most human readable model, whereas the MOGA reduces the complexity of the k-means clustering algorithm tremendously.","2329-6267;23296267","Electronic:978-1-4244-9941-0; POD:978-1-4244-9939-7","10.1109/CISDA.2011.5945941","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5945941","","Clustering algorithms;Equations;Mathematical model;Payloads;Protocols;Robustness;Training","IP networks;cryptography;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;protocols;telecommunication traffic","C4.5-based approach;IP addresses;MOGA-based trained model;SSH protocol;binary identification;encrypted network traffic analysis;feature sets;k-mean clustering;machine learning techniques;multiobjective genetic algorithm;nonSSH traffic;payload information;port number;random sampling;traffic traces","","4","","16","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Evaluation of imbalanced datasets using fuzzy support vector machine-class imbalance learning (FSVM-CIL)","B. Lakshmanan; A. J. Priscilla; S. Ponni; V.

While considering imbalanced datasets, it produces suboptimal classification models which is sensitive to outliers and noise present in the datasets. Fuzzy SVMs (FSVMs), which is a variant of the SVM algorithm also suffers from the problem of class imbalance. Hence in this paper we present a method to improve FSVMs for Class Imbalance Learning (CIL) i.e. FSVM-CIL, which handles the problem of outliers and noise. In this method we assign fuzzy membership values for training examples to reduce the effect of outliers and noise under the principle of cost-sensitive learning. In our proposed method we compare the results obtained by different existing imbalance-learning methods for the different datasets. Simulation results show that the proposed FSVM-CIL method produces a consistent solution for imbalance datasets by reducing the problem of outliers and noise. FSVM-CIL overcomes the disadvantages of SVMs in many practical applications especially in medical field like classification of multiple cancer types.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0590-8; POD:978-1-4577-0588-5","10.1109/ICRTIT.2011.5972431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972431","Class imbalance learning (CIL);fuzzy support vector machines (FSVMs);outliers;support vector machines (SVMs)","Classification algorithms;Machine learning;Noise;Optimization;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Training","cancer;data analysis;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;support vector machines","cost-sensitive learning;fuzzy membership value;fuzzy support vector machine-class imbalance learning;imbalanced dataset evaluation;medical field;multiple cancer type classification;noise sensitivity;outlier sensitivity;suboptimal classification model","","1","","13","","","3-5 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"On-line Cache Strategy Reconfiguration for Elastic Caching Platform: A Machine Learning Approach","X. Qin; W. Zhang; W. Wang; J. Wei; H. Zhong; T. Huang","Inst. of Software, Chinese Acad. of Sci., Beijing, China","2011 IEEE 35th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","20111003","2011","","","523","534","Cloud computing provide scalability and high availability for web applications using such techniques as distributed caching and clustering. As one database offloading strategy, elastic caching platforms (ECPs) are introduced to speed up the performance or handle application state management with fault tolerance. Several cache strategies for ECPs have been proposed, say replicated strategy, partitioned strategy and near strategy. We first evaluate the impact of the three cache strategies using the TPC-W benchmark and find that there is no single cache strategy suitable for all conditions, the selection of the best strategy is related with workload patterns, cluster size and the number of concurrent users. This raises the question of when and how the cache strategy should be reconfigured as the condition varies which has received comparatively less attention. In this paper, we present a machine learning based approach to solving this problem. The key features of the approach are off-line training coupled with on-line system monitoring and robust synchronization process after triggering a reconfiguration, at the same time the performance model is periodically updated. More explicitly, first a rule set used to identify which cache strategy is optimal under the current condition are trained with the system statistics and performance results. We then introduce a framework to switch the cache strategy on-line as the workload varies and keep its overhead to acceptable levels. Finally, we illustrate the advantages of this approach by carrying out a set of experiments.","0730-3157;07303157","Electronic:978-0-7695-4439-7; POD:978-1-4577-0544-1","10.1109/COMPSAC.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032392","Elastic caching platform;availability;cache strategy;reconfiguration;scalability","Availability;Benchmark testing;Machine learning;Monitoring;Scalability;Servers;Software","cache storage;cloud computing;fault tolerant computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;software architecture;synchronisation","application state management;cloud computing;database offloading strategy;distributed caching;distributed clustering;elastic caching platform;fault tolerance;machine learning approach;off-line training;online cache strategy reconfiguration;robust synchronization process","","2","","37","","","18-22 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing number of services available within an enterprise and over the internet, locating a service online may not be appropriate from the performance perspective, especially in large internet-based service repositories. Instead, services usually need to be clustered offline according to their similarity. Thereafter, services in one or several clusters are necessary to be examined online during dynamic service discovery. In this paper we propose to cluster data providing (DP) services using a refined fuzzy C-means algorithm. We consider the composite relation between DP service elements (i.e., input, output, and semantic relation between them) when representing DP services in terms of vectors. A DP service vector is assigned to one or multiple clusters with certain degrees. When grouping similar services into one cluster, while partitioning different services into different clusters, the capability of service search engine is improved significantly.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4515-8; POD:978-1-4577-1323-1","10.1109/SKG.2011.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6088125","Cluster Network;Clustering;Data-Providing Services","Clustering methods;Drugs;Internet;Ontologies;Semantics;Vectors","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;search engines;service-oriented architecture","DP service element;Internet-based service repository;data providing service clustering;data providing service management;dynamic service discovery;fuzzy c-means algorithm;machine learning technique;service search engine;service-oriented computing","","3","","28","","","24-26 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
