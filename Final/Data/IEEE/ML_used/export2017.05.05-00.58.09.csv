This weight is used to put emphasis on those edge points located on clear boundaries between different objects, leading to higher probability of sampling from perceptually reasonable real lines in the edge image, as well as suppressed false peaks in Hough space formed by large amount of noise edges.

To solve this problem different intrusion scenario detection methods are proposed. In this paper a data mining method is used to find the attack scenarios. Firstly redundancy alerts are checked and deleted, then attack scenario patterns are mined by using the associate-rule algorithms which is an improved Apriori algorithm. These mined scenario patterns are used to find attack scenarios. In this paper 1999 DARPA intrusion detection scenario specific datasets are used as the experimental data and the corresponding results are shown.

Expression-similarity weighted expression feature, which is the optimal estimation based on Bayesian estimation theory and the assumption, is used to estimate the face feature of the test person. As a result, the estimated face feature can reduce the influence of expression caused by insufficient training data and becomes less expression-dependent, and can be more robust to new expressions.

In this paper, a O(dn) complexity random projection method, directly random projection (DRP), is proposed. The performance of DRP is investigated in terms of expected distortion analysis. We prove: 1) an expected distortion bound of DRP; and 2) given moderate conditions, the DRP with appropriate expected distortion can be found in O(1) random time.

It needs to explore the logistic regression of the multi-class chronic gastritis classification. In this research, we address multi-class chronic gastritis classification by applying logistic regression based methods on data of nominal and ordinal scaled sample class outcomes, e.g., samples of different chronic gastritis subtypes.

The exogeneous input is designed to model the adjustment of the deviation between the aiming point and the center of target. In other words, the normal aiming style can be modeled by the combination of these two parts. Afterwards, the moving average part is related to the muscle strength and stability of archers. The mean and variance of the drive noise of the moving average part are also calculated and utilized to justify the correctness of the proposed model. Previous study based on AR2 model can not reveal the importance of the exogeneous input, but in the paper it becomes very significant for the correctness of the proposed model.

Traditionally, case-based reasoning techniques have been widely used to help workers solve problems. However, conventional approaches focus on identifying similar problems without exploring relevant context of problem situations. Situation features are generally occurred according to the context characteristics of problem. Moreover, situation features collected are usually partial or incomplete. Workers need to use knowledge inferred from relevant context information and previous problem-solving experience to clarify the causes and take appropriate action effectively. In this paper, we propose to use rule inference to infer possible situation features based on context information. Association rule mining is used to discover context-based inference rules from historical problem-solving logs. The discovered patterns identify frequent associations between context information and situation features, and therefore can be used to infer more situation features. By considering the inferred situation features, case-based reasoning can then be employed to identify similar situations effectively. Moreover, we employ information retrieval techniques to extract context-based situation profiles to model workerspsila information needs when handling problem situations in certain context. Effective knowledge support can thus be facilitated by providing workers with situation-relevant information based on the profiles.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620959","Case-based reasoning;Data mining;Information retrieval;Problem solving;Rule inference","Association rules;Communication industry;Context modeling;Cybernetics;Data mining;Information management;Information retrieval;Machine learning;Problem-solving;Production systems","case-based reasoning;data mining;information retrieval","association rule mining;case-based reasoning;competitive business advantages;context-based inference rules;context-based knowledge support;information retrieval;problem-solving;rule-inference;situation-relevant information","","0","","19","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address the above problems, a novel multi-graph propagation algorithm for ranking named MGP is proposed, which can be applied to both directed and undirected graphs. It is implemented by constructing multiple graphs in inhomogeneous views and combining results to maximize the agreement of multiple graphs. Compared to existing multi-view learning approaches using labeled data as agreement, MGP introduces order change tendency as agreement substituting for label information, which also ensures the combination being uniform. The theoretical analysis on the convergence of MGP is given.

But according to research on those credentials, we found management of those credentials is too complicated to implement, and the complication leads to underlying insecurity. The paper proposes a new architecture for credentials, making use of the EK credential and platform identity credential to accomplish the trust mechanism. This is a significant improvement on the previously five credentials required which are now reduced to only three. The proposal provides evidence for superiority in security and availability.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621043","Architecture of credentials;Root of trust;Transitive trust;Trusted computing","Availability;Computer architecture;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Machine learning;Privacy;Proposals;Public key;Security;Virtual manufacturing","security of data","platform identity credential;trust mechanism;trusted computing group credentials","","0","","15","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existence of outliers, which are defined as data points with different distributional characteristics than the assumed model, will produce erroneous estimates, and then get a terrible result. Considering the outliers, Farsiu et.al. proposed a robust super-resolution method to simple reject the outliers frames but not considering the more complex motion model. This paper presents a new multilayer model of image super-resolution in the presence of inner-frame motion outliers. We first use GLOMO algorithm to separate the low-resolution image as several layers. After identify the motion models of the layers, we calculate them separately, then we can get the accurate image registration of background. At last, we fuse them into a high-resolution image. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is better than Farsiupsilas method in the presence of inner-frame motion outliers.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620868","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620868","Super-resolution;multilayer model;outliers","Costs;Cybernetics;Degradation;Image reconstruction;Image registration;Image resolution;Layout;Machine learning;Nonhomogeneous media;Robustness","image motion analysis;image registration;image resolution","distributional characteristics;image multilayer model;image registration;image super-resolution;inner-frame motion outliers","","0","","17","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

After detection, a rectification process is then applied for rectifying different skewed road signs into a normal one. Then, its all embedded texts can be more accurately recognized using their distance maps. On the map, a weighting function is used to balance the importance between a road signpsilas inner and outer feature so that its embedded characters can be more accurately recognized.

We demonstrate that these features are biologically relevant to classify the heartbeat patterns by a K-means clustering approach.
