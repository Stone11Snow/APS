But they often result in very high dimensional feature vectors, which rend them impractical for real applications in resource limitation environment (such as mobile phone, PDA etc). This paper proposes a two-level supervised feature selection algorithm for Gabor feature-based face recognition. In the first stage, a non-parametric measure of discrimination performance is used as criterion to reduce Gabor features and formed a sub-optimal subset. In the second stage, the most informative Gabor features are determined using Adaboost feature selector. These most discriminative Gabor features are then subjected to the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) process for further class separability enhancement. Experimental results on a CAS-PEAL large-scale Chinese face databases show that the proposed method achieves high recognition accuracy, whilst the dimensionality and computation cost of Gabor features have been effectively reduced.

ICA is a novel method of signal processing and data analysis, through which the source signals can be derived from the observed signals even in the case of the source signals and the mixing procedure being unknown, so long as they are independent. SVD is a linear algebra technique used to diagonalizable matrices and it packs most of the signal energy into very few singular values (SVs). In this paper, the original watermark, which is a binary image, is rearranged by Arnold transform before embedded into the host signal. In the embedding procedure, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of the host signal and the embedding watermark, which are regarded as two sources are mixed through the ICA instantaneous mixing model. Then, two mixed signals can be obtained. One of them is used to generate the watermarked signal and the other is kept as the secret key. In the extraction procedure, with the watermarked signal and the secret key, the popular ICA algorithm is employed to get the estimation of the embedding watermark.

The goal is to identify both TF target genes and their binding motifs. Subspace-valued weak learners (formed from an ensemble of different motif finding algorithms) combine candidate motifs as probability weight matrices (PWM), which are then translated into subspaces of a DNA k-mer (string) feature space. Assessing and then integrating highly informative subspaces by machine methods gives more reliable target classification and motif prediction.

The color difference among the different markers and human skin is very significant, so that the position of a marker can be easily extracted from background.

So the study of STLF system requires an efficient computational tool such as computational intelligence technique. In this paper, we applied the use of computational intelligent methods to short term load forecasting systems. With power systems growth and the increase in their complexity, many factors have become influential to the electric power generation and consumption. First, we use entropy theory to select relevant ones from all load influential factors. Next, considering the features of power load and reduced influential factors, we use fuzzy classification rules to divide the past load data into different network property. Then the representative historical load data samples were selected as the training set for neural network, which have the same weather characteristic as the certain forecasting day. Finally, Elman recurrent neural network (ERNN) forecasting model is constructed which is a kind of globally feed forward locally recurrent network model with distinguished dynamical characteristics.

In recent years, the image processing technology is widely applied to detection of the flame combustion condition. The combustion in furnace, such as the combustion of the pulverized coal, is the complex, stochastic and unstable burning process. The flame images are static and include a lot of noise signals from different reasons; so the method based on the processing of the single image does not reflect the combustion in furnace exactly. In this paper, the stochastic model, that is, hidden Markov model (HMM) is introduced to achieve modeling and recognition of the flame combustion condition in furnace. It makes use of a hidden Markov process to characterize the image frames correlation in the image sequences and transition of image states where the model parameters are determined by the feature vectors of image frames that form the observation sequences.

Support vector machines (SVM) have been successfully employed to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. Grey system theory successfully utilizes accumulated generating data instead of original data to build forecasting model, which makes raw data stochastic weak, or reduces noise influence in a certain extent. However, the application combining grey system theory and SVM for LP forecasting is rare. In this study, a grey support vector machines with genetic algorithms (GSVMG) is proposed to forecast HTM LP. In addition, GM (1, N) model of grey system is used to add a grey layer before neural input layer and white layer after SVM layer. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used to determine free parameters of support vector machines. Evaluation method has been used for comparing the performance of forecasting techniques.

Grid computing, as a prevalent paradigm for resource-intensive scientific application, is expected to provide a computing platform with tremendous computational power to speed up the optimization process of DE. When implanting DE based ORPF on grid system, fault tolerance due to unstable environment and variation of grid is a significant issue to be considered. In this paper, a fault tolerant DE-based ORPF method is proposed. In this method, when the individuals are distributed to the grid for fitness evaluation, a proportion of individuals, which returns from the grid slowly or fails to return, are replaced with new individuals generated randomly according to some specific rules.

The results show that stemming-based text representation gives better performance than hypernym-based text representation even though we used a novel hypernym formation approach.

From NCBI' 97 reports, the most significant challenge is the docking procedure in CADD, and employs Lyapunov's stability theorem to decrease the number of binding sites for enhancing the docking performance. These novel techniques are significantly, based on the application of minimum energy and optimal geometry search strategies to prove the stability of protein-ligand interactions. This study applies the Lyapunov stability theorem to discuss the molecular orbit adjustment of molecular dynamics system equations during the molecular leave equilibrium point from the initial state with zero input and passing through infinite time t. Lyapunov's asymptotically stable theorem was developed to provide the stability of protein folding for drug docking computations. When the eigenvalue is smaller than the X-ray convergence value, the molecular framework is stable. When t tends toward infinity and its convergence rate is a negative ratio for Lyapunov exponentially function, the molecular system is close to the global minimum from various saddle points. In energy minimum, we have used the NURBS curves to accelerate the molecular docking system by the short route. This investigation studies the folding of various proteins and calculates the force field application; this is a novel technology that exhibits the protein structure with describe their function. In previous published studies, the WebDeGrator system was utilized to establish the molecular computer modeling for the docking process. Examples in protein folding kinetics and drug docking computations have been demonstrated, and this study successfully employs the Lyapunov function and molecular dynamics to support the determination of system stability.

Δ VEGA and optimization are two important technique to reduce the total Δ V in deep space missions. The earth swingby increase the sensitivity of the trajectory greatly, so the optimization of Δ VEGA trajectory is one of the most sophisticated problem currently investigated in the region. In this paper, the whole Δ VEGA trajectory is divided into several trajectory segments. Each trajectory segment connecting consecutive maneuver points is found by solving an N-body analog to Lambert's problem. We can also obtain state transition matrix of each trajectory segments.

In contrast to the support vector machine approach, our algorithm is free to use any finite family of continuously differentiable functions which linearly compose the decision function. Nevertheless, robustness properties are maintained due to a maximizing margin. To obtain a useful algorithm, the inherent difficult problem is formulated in a convex semi-infinite program. Using this new formulation, we develop a duality result enabling us to solve the original problem iteratively as a finite sequence of constrained quadratic programming problems over a convex hull of matrices.

Quadratic program was used to solve the restraint problem of MGPC, as the performance index of the MGPC was quadratic, which reduced the calculation and simplified designing of control system. The simulation result was given and showed that this control scheme was effective and can be applied to the process industry control system","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.259034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028084","Constraints;Generalized Predictive control;Multivariable control;Quadratic program","Computational modeling;Control systems;Electrical equipment industry;Equations;Industrial control;Input variables;MIMO;Performance analysis;Prediction algorithms;Predictive control","adaptive control;control system synthesis;multivariable control systems;predictive control;quadratic programming;self-adjusting systems","Diophantine equation;constrained multivariable control system;control system design;generalized predictive self-tuning control algorithm;quadratic program;restraint problem","","0","","3","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
