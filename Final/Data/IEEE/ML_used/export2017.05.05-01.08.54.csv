The tongue also presents both geometric shape information and physiological texture information which are potentially useful in identity verification applications. Furthermore, the act of physically reaching or thrusting out is a convincing proof for the liveness. Despite these obvious advantages, little work has hitherto been done on tongue features. A primary factor for preventing such research is the lack of an available 3D tongue image database. In this paper, we present a newly developed 3D tongue image database, which includes both tongue geometric shape and surface textures of 134 subjects. This is the first attempt at making a 3D tongue image database available for the research community, with the ultimate goal of fostering the research on tongue biometrics.

Event-clock-driven controller nodes, together with clock-driven sensor nodes and actuator nodes are required in this framework. Queuing Strategy is introduced both in controller nodes and actuator nodes while the time delay between controller node and actuator node is compensated by multi-step control increment given by the algorithm of General Predictive Control. An output error prediction model is built using BP neural network to deal with the time delay between sensor node and controller node. The principle of this model is to revise the predictive output of general predictive control model using predictive error signal; if the value of time delay exceeds the upper limit, controller nodes will immediately produce the control strategies adopting the revised predictive output, and thus the compensation for time delay between sensor nodes and controller nodes would be accomplished. Simulation experiments are practiced over Ethernet network which embraces both kinds of time delay. It is proved that the scheme of complete compensation remains a good control performance.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370222","BP neural network;General Predictive Control (GPC);Networked Control System (NCS);Queuing Strategy (QS);Time delay","Actuators;Clocks;Delay effects;Error correction;Ethernet networks;Networked control systems;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Predictive control;Predictive models","backpropagation;compensation;control engineering computing;delays;neural nets;predictive control;queueing theory","actuator node;backpropagation neural network;event-clock-driven controller;general predictive control;networked control system;predictive error signal;queuing strategy;uncertain time delay","","4","","6","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study applies the energy minimum theorem to solve the objection. A geometry search is performed and compared with the other four methods for classifying receptors. First, this work attempts to improve the speed of computer simulations of protein folding and to propose an improved genetic algorithm to accelerate the binding site search. Second, the paper focuses on energy theme. Lyapunov's stability theorem is adopted to decrease the number of binding sites, thus enhancing the docking performance in computer simulation examples. Finally, various drug-ligand interaction models are employed to compute docking simulations, while the energy minimum theorem is used to judge the approach approximately global energy minimum area and docking stability. This investigation develops the AMBER force field and Ullman's algorithm to support the computer simulation environments. The significance of the eigenvalue lambda is analyzed at each protein folding. Moreover, the performance of this study is increased by 25 percents comparing to various binding sites. Additionally, the protein folding and various bond forces in drug-ligand interaction model are discussed. Comparing with the other four geometry search methods and referring to the two been published paper written by Pegg and Camila, the improved genetic algorithms are specified to undertake the search binding site and docking. As a result, the global minimum search and the arithmetic convergence time of 1.16 hr can be obtained. Analytical results indicate that the improved genetic algorithm is better than the traditional random methods in terms of processing the geometry graphics operation.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370723","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370723","Lyapunov equation;Minimum energy","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Computer simulation;Design automation;Drugs;Genetic algorithms;Geometry;Lyapunov method;Proteins","CAD;Lyapunov methods;computer graphics;drugs;genetic algorithms;pharmaceutical industry;production engineering computing;proteins","AMBER force field;Lyapunov stability;Ullman algorithm;binding site search;computer simulation;computer-aided drug design;docking performance;docking stability;drug-ligand interaction;energy minimum;energy theme;genetic algorithm;geometry graphics;geometry search;protein folding","","0","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The CPN model of TC2O uses object oriented design approach and it is composed of 3 objects: mission environment, TC2O structure, and resources. In CPN model, the concept of control variable is defined and the model represents all kinds of TC2O parameters by the initial tokens of control variable. At the same time, the switch rules are extracted which can turn the relation of tasks into tokens. Furthermore, the CPN model of TC2O structure is based on Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory (CMOT) and the organization contingency theory. TC2O structure is composed of DMs. Each DM has the same model structure and carries out the tasks with other DMs by communication that includes 5 kinds of messages (i.e. resource requirement message, resource response message, resource movement message, task finish message, information transfer message). Resources are controlled by DMs and used to execute tasks. The CPN model of TC2O is adaptive to the military environment of high time pressure, because the related parameters of TC2O are presented by the initial marking of control variable, and then the CPN model structure of TC2O hasn't to be changed under different mission environments or organization structures.

With the help of a supervisory controller, the resulting closed-loop system is globally stable in the sense that all signals involved are uniformly bounded. Furthermore, the adaptive compensation terms of the approximation errors are adopted to minimize the influence of modeling errors and parameter estimation errors. In addition, the approach does not require the dead-zone model parameters and parameters in the lumped uncertainty to be known constants.

Therefore, according to the particularity of logistic distribution under electronic commerce environment, the improved two-phase algorithm needs to be adopted to get solutions.

Since in most scenes, the number of static background pixels (single-mode pixels) is far more than the number of dynamic background pixels (multi-mode pixels), thus the presented method can help improve the speed of background reconstruction without reducing its precision.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370420","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370420","Background pixel classification;Mean shift;Mode seeking;Motion segmentation;Visual information processing","Background noise;Computer vision;Gaussian distribution;Gaussian noise;IIR filters;Kernel;Motion estimation;Motion segmentation;Robustness;Video sequences","image classification;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;image segmentation;image sequences;video signal processing","background pixel classification;background reconstruction;mean shift algorithm;motion segmentation;video sequence","","0","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

New techniques such as moving-mass control systems are being explored for their apparent cost advantage. This paper investigates the ability of a moving-mass attitude control system to control a vehicle with three-axis stabilization in intra-atmospheric space. The general nonlinear equations of motion with three internal moving masses are used to describe the coupling influence to the system caused by the relative movement of the moving masses to the vehicle's shell. The rapid self-learning and adaptive capacities of radial basis function (RBF) neural networks were exploited to revise the proportional integral differential (PID) controller to calculate the positions of the moving masses. The optimal solution is determined by optimizing the weights of the network through genetic algorithm (GA) training. With the coordination of the control, the masses are positioned independently to generate modest attitude corrections for the vehicle. Simulation results show the method to be effective in system control as static system stability is achieved to optimally adjust the missile attitude.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370622","Attitude control;Moving mass;Moving mass position;PID parameter;RBF (Radial Basis Function)","Adaptive control;Attitude control;Control systems;Costs;Couplings;Missiles;Neural networks;Nonlinear equations;Programmable control;Space vehicles","attitude control;genetic algorithms;neurocontrollers;nonlinear equations;radial basis function networks;three-term control","genetic algorithm training;intraatmospheric space;moving mass attitude law;moving-mass control systems;neural networks;nonlinear equations;proportional integral differential controller;radial basis function neural networks;static system stability;three-axis stabilization","","0","","6","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The techniques of image denoising fall into two categories: spatial domain methods and transform domain methods. The term spatial domain refers to the image plane itself, and approaches in this category are based on direct manipulation of pixels in an image. Transform domain processing techniques are based on modifying the Fourier or wavelet transform of an image. The major problem of these traditional methods is as follows: The representation couldn't contain basis elements oriented at a variety of directions, much more than the few directions that are offered by tensor product wavelets. To conquer the above headache trouble, a new approach to image denoising by using a non-tensor product bivariate orthogonal wavelet filter banks is presented. The core of our new method is that using centrally symmetric orthogonal matrices to compute filter banks. Our investigations demonstrate that there are three characteristics in this new approach: First, it is easily to understand and implement that using iterative method to compute orthogonal filter banks; Second, three high frequency subbands could present more directional features than tensor product wavelets; And the last is that different filter banks could emphasize different directional information. We employ those new filter banks to the denoising of some standard images embedded in white noise, the experimental results show that our new approach is superior to other methods in terms of denoising effectiveness.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370427","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370427","Centrally symmetric orthogonal matrix;Filter banks;Image denoising;Non-tensor product;Wavelet transform","Filter bank;Fourier transforms;Image denoising;Noise reduction;Pixel;Smoothing methods;Symmetric matrices;Tensile stress;Wavelet domain;Wavelet transforms","Fourier transforms;image denoising;matrix algebra;smoothing methods;wavelet transforms","Fourier transform;image denoising;nontensor product bivariate orthogonal wavelet filter bank;smoothing method;spatial domain method;symmetric orthogonal matrix;transform domain method","","1","","12","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper deals with the locating of solder joints in PCB. In recent years, the theory of rough sets has gained paramount applicability in diverse areas of research, especially in data mining, knowledge discovery, artificial intelligence and information systems analysis. Rough sets have also been used in image processing; however, the application of rough sets for image locating analysis has yet to be fully investigated. In this paper image segmentation using rough set theory has been presented, and then locate the solder joint by calculating the correlation of solder joint image. In traditional production, the locating in automatic optical inspection must be done by manual, so design a new method to find the solder joint region becomes very important.

Thus, the communication delays often appear and produce random and unknown influence upon the performance of fusion estimators. Recently, data fusion for ""Out-of-sequence"" measurements (OOSM) attracts a mass of attentions gradually and some filters based on single sensor and multiple sensors have been reported. However, the existing methods for OOSM problem have several shortcomings, such as limited application for single sensor, bad real-time performance for the smooth property, low fusion estimate for neglecting the delayed information, and so forth. To tackle these problems, a novel batch fusion estimator based on the relative measurements for multisensor tracking systems with OOSM is proposed. The estimator is optimal in linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE). The paper also presents the suboptimal recursive form of the proposed estimator. Its principle is to establish the relative measurement equations of delayed observations to the next latest systemic state. Compared with some existingfusion methods for OOSM, the proposed method with arbitrary time delays has the best total performance. At the same time, algorithm analysis and computer simulation validate the advantages of the proposed fusion estimator.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370769","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370769","Batch fusion;OOSM;Recursive form;Relative measurements;Sensor networks","Communication channels;Delay estimation;Filters;Mean square error methods;Multisensor systems;Recursive estimation;Sensor fusion;Sensor systems;Time measurement;Wireless sensor networks","least mean squares methods;recursive estimation;sensor fusion;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","arbitrary time lag;batch fusion estimation;communication channel;data fusion;linear minimum mean square error;multi hop sensor network;multisensor network system;multisensor tracking system;out-of-sequence measurement problem;relative measurement;suboptimal recursive form","","1","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Neural networks which have versatile features such as learning capability, nonlinear mapping and parallel processing, is difficult to obtain true teaching signals and to apply to a wide range of real-time control. However, for fuzzy control, it is not necessary to build mathematic model, and its control mechanism accords with people's logic although being short of schematism during design is its shortcoming. FNN has the advantages of both fuzzy systems and neural networks. This paper presents a novel method to obtain true teaching signals for the FNN and overcome the real-time control problems existing in the neural network control.

For providing fast and stable classification, a k-means clustering ensembles approach which combine the clustering results obtaining from a set of k-means clusters started from a random initialization is employed. The consensus partitions of skin color pixel feature vector can be obtained based on voting mechanism. By taking face region property into account, the optimum region boundaries are then obtained by frame integration and frame segmentation algorithms those are used for merging frames and partitioning different faces in the same region respectively. Finally, candidate face regions will be found by rejecting the framed regions when its ratio of height to width is over than 2.3.

MRI produces a sequence of multiple spectral images of tissues with a variety of contrasts, but the multi-spectral images cannot be conveniently used to be a pathology diagnosis correctly. In general, we need to transform the multispectral images to an enhanced image which is easier to be used for doctor's clinical diagnosis. One of the potential applications of MRI in clinical practice is the brain parenchyma classification. In this paper, we present a new approach called ""Unsupervised Linear Discriminant Analysis (ULDA)"" for the classification of multi-spectral MRI images. The ULDA consists of two processes, Target Generation Process (TGP) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification. As a result, ULDA can be used to search for a specific target in unknown scenes. Finally, the effectiveness of ULDA in target classification is evaluated by several MRI images experiments. In order to further evaluate its performance, ULDA is compared with Fuzzy C-mean for the medical image segmentation. Several experiment results show that the ULDA has the much better effective segmentation for multispectral MRI images and is robust to the noise disturbance in the image.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370478","Classification;Linear discriminant analysis (ULDA);Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI);Unsupervised","Biological tissues;Biomedical imaging;Image classification;Image segmentation;Instruments;Linear discriminant analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical diagnostic imaging;Multispectral imaging;Visualization","biomedical MRI;data visualisation;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;pattern clustering","3D visualization;Fuzzy C-mean;brain parenchyma classification;clinical diagnosis;image noise disturbance;magnetic resonance imaging;medical image segmentation;medical science;multiple spectral tissue images;multispectral MRI images classification;multispectral images;pathology diagnosis;soft tissue characterization;target generation p;unsupervised linear discriminant analysis","","1","","21","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For the purpose of reducing calculation complexity, smooth method is presented to improve standard SVR arithmetic, and is utilized to build the combustion state model of flame in the furnace of utility boilers according to the feature parameters of flame image, in order to predict the combustion state of flame. The flame images are gained from the flame image gathering system on-line. The feature parameters of the flame image are extracted, and are used to determined combustion indices which can denote different combustion states of flame. The time series of combustion indices are used for constructing the smooth support vector regression (SSVR) model and predicting the combustion state of flame. The results of experimentation indicate that SSVR has excellent performance on time series prediction. Compared with traditional time series prediction method such as artificial neural network, SSVR has faster convergence speed and higher fitting precision, which effectively extends the application of SVR.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370643","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370643","Combustion state of flame;Flame image;Smooth method;Support vector regression;Time series prediction","Arithmetic;Boilers;Combustion;Fires;Furnaces;Modeling;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Prediction methods;Predictive models;Time series analysis","combustion;feature extraction;regression analysis;support vector machines;time series","dynamic system modeling;flame combustion state prediction;smooth support vector regression;time series analysis;utility boilers","","3","","9","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Acoustic emission (AE) technique is more effective than vibration for detecting initiation fatigue in materials. The wavelet transform is a good signal analysis and treatment method for AE signals. But the wavelet threshold method may produce pesudo-Gibbs phenomenon on the singularity points of signal. The translation invariant wavelet is an improve method based on that algorithm. Comparing with threshold method, a translation invariance method can suppress pesudo-Gibbs phenomenon and minish RMSE between the original signal and estimated one. At the same time, SNR of estimated signal can also be improved. The acoustic emission energy method is adopted to identify the fatigue cracks of axle of railway vehicle. The results demonstrate that this method can effectively eliminate noise, extract characteristic information of acoustic emission signals, is effective for online detection of the fault.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370297","Acoustic Emission;Axle Fault diagnosis;De-noising;Translation Invariant Wavelet","Acoustic emission;Acoustic materials;Acoustic signal detection;Axles;Fatigue;Fault diagnosis;Rail transportation;Railway safety;Vehicle safety;Wavelet analysis","acoustic emission;acoustic signal processing;axles;failure analysis;fatigue cracks;fault location;mean square error methods;railways;vibrations;wavelet transforms","RMSE;SNR;acoustic emission technique;fatigue cracks;fault detection;fault diagnosis system;initiation fatigue detection;pesudoGibbs phenomenon;railway vehicles axle;translation invariance method;translation invariant wavelet;vibration;wavelet transform","","2","","7","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Neural network as a data mining method commonly is used to find classification knowledge in IDSS. But the classic data mining based on neural network is short in dealing with the blank value data or data with the character of blurring and randomicity. Such data is called as imperfect data. In order to overcoming this shortcoming the method of combination of cloud model and neural network to find knowledge from imperfect data in IDSS is proposed. Firstly the cloud is used to depict the imperfect data by group decision. In the following, attribution generation based on cloud model or grey cloud model is used to generate the upper concept layer. In this step the cloud model depicting the imperfect data is classified into the concept layer that is proximal to itself according to distance between two cloud models. Then classic neural network method is used to gain knowledge. The data is input into the neural network to training and gaining the classification knowledge. Lastly an experiment is given to verify the validity of the method.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370615","Cloud model;Data mining;Data pretreatment;Decision support system;Imperfectness of data;Neural network","Artificial neural networks;Clouds;Cognition;Data mining;Decision support systems;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Neural networks","data mining;decision support systems;grey systems;neural nets;pattern classification","attribution generation;classification knowledge;data mining;decision knowledge;grey cloud model;group decision;imperfect data classification;intelligent decision support system;neural network","","0","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
