When distributing the password cracking task between threads or nodes, it is necessary to divide the search space into several subspaces. It is ideal that the size of these subspaces is the same for a load balanced solution. However, increasing the length of passwords will raise the number of combinations exponentially. This will raises issues for the search space uniform partition. This paper presents a universal distributed model for password cracking capable of dividing the search space evenly. For this, the paper addresses the definition of a base-n-like number, and discusses operations on it and relations with base-n number. The model is data independent, easily implemented and needs a few of communications. Experimental results are then shown.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016851","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016851","GPU;brute force attack;password attacking;password-based authentication;search space partition","Force","cryptography;parallel processing;resource allocation;search problems","base-n-like number;distributed computing;load balanced solution;one-way hash function;parallel computing;password cracking;password encryption;search space uniform partition;universal distributed model","","1","","6","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper implements the PSM in NS-2 which is a popular discrete event simulator for analyzing the performance of network protocols. Firstly, the NS-2 patch of PSM is implemented in the WLAN with infrastructure mode. After validating the PSM implementation, we show that PSM can save wireless devices' energy while influencing bandwidth slightly. We analyze how the protocol parameters and network conditions affect the performance of PSM in terms of clients' energy consumption and energy efficiency metric. The experiment results show that the parameter configuration has a great impact on the performance of PSM.

The technique first extracts reduced-reference features from multiple regions in the surveillance image, and then detects anomaly events by analyzing variation of features when image quality decreases and field of view changes. Event detection is achieved by statistically calculating accumulated variations along temporal domain. False alarms occurred due to noise are further reduced by an online Kalman filter that can recursively smooth the features. Experiments are conducted on a set of recorded videos simulating various challenging situations.

Therefore, in this paper we focus on passive and active RFID collision problems with authentication and counterfeit. We propose a new protocol called CRPA to make anti-collision protocol and authentication protocol working together for passive RFID tags. Previously, we have proposed a suitable communication protocol with the function of anti-collision and anti-counterfeiting called CRPAC for active RFID tags. In this CRPA scheme, when the anti-collision mechanism is in progress, the anti-counterfeiting scheme is working along with it. Eventually, the new scheme effectively reduces the workload of RFID system and significantly decreases collision probability of the passive tags.

A great number of digital mammograms are generated in hospitals and screening centers. Those digital mammograms can further be used for study and research by medical professionals. Content-based image retrieval refers to the retrieval of images whose contents are similar to a query example, using information derived from the images themselves. Relevance feedback, expressing the user's search target, can be used to bridge the semantic gap and improve the performance of CBIR systems. This study proposes a learning method for relevance feedback learning, which develops multiple logistic regression models to generalize the classification problem and provide an estimate of probability of class membership. To build the model, relevance feedback is utilized as the training data and the IRLS method is applied to estimate the parameters of the regression model and compute the maximum likelihood. Logistic regression models are created individually. After logistic regression models are fitted, discriminating features are selected by the measure of goodness of fit statistics. The weights of those discriminating features can be assigned according to their individual contributions to the maximum likelihood. The probability of the membership of the relevant class can therefore be obtained for each image of the database. Experimental results show that the proposed learning method can effectively improve the average precision from 30% to 65% through five iterations of relevance feedback rounds.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016984","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016984","Content-based image retrieval;Feature extraction;Logistic regression;Relevance feedback","Equations;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Learning systems;Logistics;Mathematical model","content-based retrieval;diseases;image retrieval;mammography;medical image processing;regression analysis;relevance feedback;search problems","CBIR systems;breast cancer;content based image retrieval;digital mammograms;hospital centers;logistic regression models;medical image retrieval;medical professionals;multiple regression models;probability estimation;relevance feedback;screening centers;users search target","","1","","9","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nevertheless, the user's location information may still be exposed during positioning because of the nature of the unreliable wireless environment. This paper presents a secure network-based positioning system that can protect the privacy of the users by encrypting the location estimation. To preserve privacy, the proposed method exposes only an encrypted version of the user location based on asymmetric encryption schemes. When a network of base stations sends back the estimated result, it uses the public key to encrypt the data. The device will then use its private key to decrypt the location information. This intelligent scheme prevents the exposure of location information in the radio transmission and thus, protects the location privacy. Our experimental results show that, although the encryption in mobile device results in extra energy consumption, the computational time is acceptable in current high-level devices. The positioning accuracy is also comparable to the unencrypted results with a suitable choice of the scaling factor in the adopted RSA encryption techniques.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016714","Encryption and Decryption;RSA;Security;location fingerprinting;mobile phone positioning","Cryptography","cryptography;data privacy;mobile computing","RSA encryption techniques;asymmetric encryption schemes;encryption based approach;intelligent scheme;location based services;location estimation;location privacy protection;network based location systems;radio transmission;secure network based positioning system;unreliable wireless environment;user location information","","3","","10","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To overcome this deficiency, we develop a switching adaptive control scheme using only essential qualitative information of the plant to attain asymptotical stability of the adaptive control system for a typical first-order nonlinear system without imposing the mentioned severe assumption. The switching adaptive control system consists of an adaptive VSS controller for coarse control, an adaptive fuzzy controller for fine control, and a hysteresis switching mechanism. An adaptive VSS control scheme is proposed to force the state to enter the universe of discourse in finite time. While the premise variable is within the universe of discourse, an adaptive fuzzy control is proposed to learn the capability to stabilize the plant. At the boundary of the universe of discourse, a hysteresis switching scheme between the two controllers will be proposed.

In this paper, we develop a new probabilistic subspace ensemble framework known as PSEFminer for cancer microarray data analysis. PSEFminer integrates the probabilistic subspace generator, the self-organizing map(SOM) and the normalized cut algorithm into the ensemble framework to discover the underlying structure from cancer microarray data.

As consecutive 2D images in DWI volume have similar content and structure, we can process a fixed number of adjacent images from DWI volume simultaneously. The proposed method first learned a dictionary from the selected 2d diffusion weighted images according to the K-SVD learning algorithm. Then the clean images are obtained by gradually approximating the underlying images using the bases selected from the learned dictionary based on sparse representation. At last, the tensor images are estimated from the diffusion weighted images. The experiments on both synthetic and real DT-MRI images show that the proposed method performs better than classical techniques by preserving image contrast and structures.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016994","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016994","3D image denoising;Diffusion tensor image;Diffusion weighted images;K-SVD;Sparse representation","Dictionaries;Diffusion tensor imaging;Image denoising;Noise;Noise reduction;Tensile stress;Three dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;diseases;image denoising;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","3D diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images denoising;DT-MRI;K-SVD learning algorithm;adjacent images;brain disease;health disease;image contrast;image structures;sparse representation","","1","","16","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The reason why to choose polynomial smooth support vector machine model is that compared with the traditional one, it can have better performance in classification. In this paper, we first use the evaluations of baby formula which are acquired through the Internet to train the support vector machine, but the results are not good. Then we use the cluster method, to put the baby formula into two kinds, combine with the evaluation, training again, at this time the performance improved much. According to the above method, we classify the baby formula whose classifications are unknown, and the conclusions are as follow: some kinds of baby formula which are not thought of high quality are actually in similar components and contents with those international brands.

As a graph-based method for linear dimensionality reduction, Locality Preserving Projections (LPP) searches for an embedding space in which the similarity among the local neighborhoods is preserved. However, LPP has two disadvantages: Firstly, LPP doesn't take the label information into consideration which is crucial for classification tasks; Secondly, like most graph-based methods, graph construction of LPP is sensitive to noise and outliers. To these end, we propose an Enhanced Supervised LPP(ESLPP) that allows both locality and class label information to be incorporated which improves the performance of classification. In the mean time, ESLPP uses similarity based on robust path instead of Gaussian heat kernel similarity such that it can capture the underlying geometric distribution of samples even when there are noise and outliers.

In this paper, a measuring method based on the Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench (LabVIEW) techniques is proposed. We successfully eliminate the interference of the noise sources, which include of cardiac and pulmonary sounds, by means of filtering techniques. The experimental design was of using a stethoscope joined to a unidirectional microphone, and then using a data-acquisition (DAQ) interface to obtain the measured data via the LabVIEW software on a PC. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of using digital infinite impulse responses (IIR) filter for processing signals in measuring BS real-time.

A high number of nodes and edges will have implications on the usage of computer memory. Therefore, reducing the number of nodes and edges will bring direct benefits to the memory usage and reduction of the search time.
