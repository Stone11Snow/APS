Convergence of kernel based clustering method [M. Girolami, 2002] is slow when the size of the data set is large. This limitation is overcome by clustering the data of each class separately. Computation of the measure of similarity between a data vector and the mean vector of a cluster in the feature space of an implicit mapping Mercer kernel involves evaluation of kernel function on the data vector and every member of the cluster.

A general sound recognition tool would require: first, a taxonomy that represents the world and, second, thousands of classifiers, each specialized in distinguishing little details. We report experimental results on a general sound annotator. To tackle the taxonomy definition problem we use WordNet, a semantic network that organizes real world knowledge.

The dynamic model of the car movement is implemented in a Kalman filter, which relays on the GPS signal as a teacher. In the second step the available digital map is used to find the most likely position on the roads. Contrary to the standard application of the digital map where the current estimated car position is just projected on the road map, the herein presented approach compares the features of the integrated vehicle path with the features of the candidate roads from the digital map.

To help to circumvent some of these problems, we introduce the a posteriori data-reusing (DR) approach into the class of first order (sign) algorithms for complex-valued feedforward neural adaptive filters.

It is assumed that the target motion is rectilinear and uniform which leads us to restrict to batch algorithms. Poor observability is generally resulting from a (very) limited amplitude of the observer maneuvers. In these situations, classical methods perform very poorly (especially for range estimation) and including constraints is uneasy and not reliable. We consider here methods for determining a confidence interval for the range based on the highest probability density (HPD) intervals, by taking into account prior informations about the kinematics parameters. Two types of prior constraints are considered: first the kinematics parameters are supposed belonging to intervals, without supposing a particular distribution, and second the target trajectory is supposed to be staying in a known area. The determination of an HPD interval requires a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The HPD interval method is illustrated by simulation results","1551-2541;15512541","POD:0-7803-8608-4","10.1109/MLSP.2004.1422969","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1422969","","Kinematics;Monte Carlo methods;Motion analysis;Motion measurement;Observability;Performance evaluation;Sampling methods;Surveillance;Trajectory;Working environment noise","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;direction-of-arrival estimation;image motion analysis;observers;sampling methods","Monte Carlo Markov chains sampling;batch algorithms;bearings-only observations;confidence interval;constrained bearings;highest probability density intervals;observer maneuvers;target motion analysis;weakly observable scenarios","","1","","8","","","Sept. 29 2004-Oct. 1 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The robot is endowed with a topological map of its environment. During the learning phase, the robot takes a lot of pictures from the environment; each picture is labelled by its origin place in the topological map. After the learning phase, the robot is supposed to locate itself in the learnt environment using the visual sensor. Since the discriminating information is sparse, the usual supervised classification techniques as neural networks are not sufficient to perform efficiently this task. Therefore, we propose to use a symbolic learning approach, the ""formal concept analysis"". The relevant information is gathered into one concept lattice. A formal classification rule is proposed to achieve localization on the topological map. In order to improve the response rate of the decision process, the original formal landmark set is extended to plausible landmarks for a given confidence level. Experimental results in a structured environment support this approach.

Noting that, a relatively small class of Gaussian densities can approximate a large class of distributions, we systematically reduce the number of Gaussians and re-approximate the densities in the MoG spectral model. The Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance between the densities in the mixture was found to allow optimal ML-MoG solutions to the spectra. A fitness measure based on KL information provides a figure for estimating the model order in representing formant-like features. The mixture model was fitted to a normalised smooth spectrum obtained by filtering the short-time Fourier transform in time and frequency by a pitch adaptive Gaussian filter. This results in the removal of all source information from the spectra.

The DOA estimation performance may be improved by employing a pre-processor that enhances the SNR, before performing the DOA estimation. In this paper, a denoising technique based on the use of wavelet packet transform in the spatial domain is proposed for enhancing the output SNR of a uniform linear array of sensors receiving narrowband signals in the form of plane waves from different directions. The technique involves the use of a spatial wavelet packet transform (SWPT) followed by a block thresholding scheme based on the norm of SWPT subvectors in different spatial frequency subbands. This method has the advantage of not requiring the high sampling rates demanded by the temporal wavelet denoising techniques. It is shown through simulations that SWPT denoising (SWD) requires a sampling rate that is just 2-4 times the signal frequency, whereas temporal wavelet denoising (TWD) requires a much higher sampling rate for achieving a comparable SNR gain. Consequently, at lower sampling rates, the DOA estimation performance indices, such as bias, mean square error and resolution, achieved by SWD are much superior to those achieved by TWD or by undenoised data","1551-2541;15512541","POD:0-7803-8608-4","10.1109/MLSP.2004.1423041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423041","","Degradation;Direction of arrival estimation;Frequency;Multiple signal classification;Noise reduction;Sampling methods;Sensor arrays;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet packets;Wavelet transforms","array signal processing;direction-of-arrival estimation;mean square error methods;signal denoising;signal sampling;wavelet transforms","DOA estimation;SNR;block thresholding scheme;direction-of-arrival estimation;mean square error;narrowband signals;sampling rate;signal-to-noise ratio;spatial wavelet packet denoising;spatial wavelet packet transform subvector;uniform linear sensor array","","0","","9","","","Sept. 29 2004-Oct. 1 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when source data violate these assumptions, conventional ICA methods might not work well. As a result, modeling of the underlying sources becomes an important issue for ICA applications. In this paper, we propose a source density-driven adaptive ICA (SDA-ICA) method for functional magnetic resonant imaging (fMRI) which allows the utilization of a priori information. The SDA-ICA algorithm involves a two-step procedure. It uses a conventional ICA algorithm to obtain initial independent source estimates at the first-step; then source density calculation using a kernel estimator technique, and finally a refitted ""optimal"" nonlinearity based source density function is obtained for each source separation at the second step. Since the physiological meaningful components (e.g., activated regions) of fMRI signals are typically governed by small percentage of the whole brain map on a task-related activation, extra prior information (using a skewed-weighted distribution transformation) is applied to the algorithm on the regions of interest of data for emphasizing the importance of the tail part of the distribution.

In some cases, such as for the analysis of a rapid event-related paradigm, it would be useful to incorporate paradigm information into the ICA analysis in a flexible way. In this paper, we present an approach for constrained or semi-blind ICA (sbICA) analysis of fMRI data. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using simulations and fMRI data of an auditory oddball paradigm. Simulation results suggest that 1) a regression approach slightly outperforms ICA when prior information is accurate and ICA outperforms the general linear modeling (GLM) approach when prior information is not completely accurate, 2) prior information improves the robustness of ICA in the presence of noise, and 3) and ICA analysis using prior information with weak constraints can outperform a regression approach when the prior information is not completely accurate","1551-2541;15512541","POD:0-7803-8608-4","10.1109/MLSP.2004.1423005","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1423005","","Biomedical imaging;Blind source separation;Computed tomography;Data analysis;Data mining;Delay estimation;Independent component analysis;Information analysis;Magnetic analysis;Magnetic resonance imaging","blind source separation;higher order statistics;independent component analysis;magnetic resonance imaging;regression analysis","FMRI;auditory oddball paradigm;blind source separation technique;functional magnetic resonance imaging;general linear modeling approach;high-order statistics;hypothesis-derived time course;independent component analysis;regression approach;semiblind ICA;spatial ICA analysis","","3","","36","","","Sept. 29 2004-Oct. 1 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this article, we address the use of neural networks for promoter recognition in the genome of the fungus crinipellis perniciosa, an aggressive phytopathogen of the cacao tree, which is being sequenced by a Brazilian consortium.

With that purpose, we trained a feed-forward neural network using patterns found in other species, due to absence of validated data for the fungus under study.

EMRT has two phases, in the first phase the image is divided into small patches then color and texture features are extracted for each patch. We perform EM clustering of the features and then map the clusters back to the image domain to construct segmented image or subimages. The cost function of EM clustering is based on maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the feature data to a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). In the second phase we use edge detection techniques and morphological operations on each subimage for refinement to define the final segments.

Recently, the proposed median root prior (MRP) algorithm is a good alternative, but are prone to step like streaking effect. In this research work, a fuzzy logic based approach is proposed to overcome these shortcomings. Unlike traditional potential function, a fuzzy potential is used for modeling inter pixel interaction. Two basic operations viz. edge detection and fuzzy smoothing are performed sequentially during each iteration. The first operation is employed for the detection of edges (if present) in all the eight directions of a 3 times 3 neighborhood window. The second operation uses this edge information to perform fuzzy smoothing. Due to the recursive nature of the reconstruction algorithm, both these operations are employed iteratively to reduce heavy noise produced due to dimensional instability [E. Veclerov and J. Llacer, 1987]. Simulated experimental results are obtained to show the feasibility of the proposed approach. These algorithms are also compared with other approaches such as, MAP and MRP by numerical measures and visual inspection.

Smoothed estimates can be found without inverting latent space dynamics and can be improved by iteration. Multiple forward and backward passes make it possible to improve local approximations and make them as consistent as possible. We demonstrate the validity of the approach with an interesting inference problem in stochastic stock volatility models.

This paper uses two classification methods, the hidden Markov model (HMM) and the support vector machine (SVM), to classify five emotional states: anger, happiness, sadness, surprise and a neutral state. In the HMM method, 39 candidate instantaneous features were extracted, and the sequential forward selection (SFS) method was used to find the best feature subset. The classification performance of the selected feature subset was then compared with that of the Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC). Within the method based on SVM, a new vector measuring the difference between Mel frequency scale sub-bands energies is proposed. The performance of the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classifier using the proposed vector was also investigated. Both gender dependent and gender independent experiments were conducted on the Danish emotional speech (DES) database. The recognition rates by the HMM classifier were 98.9% for female subjects, 100% for male subjects, and 99.5% for gender independent cases. When the SVM classifier and the proposed feature vector were employed, correct classification rates of 89.4%, 93.6% and 88.9% were obtained for male, female and gender independent cases respectively.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527805","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527805","Emotion recognition;Hidden Markov Model;Mel energy spectrum dynamics coefficients;Sequential Forward Selection;Support Vector Machine","Cepstrum;Emotion recognition;Energy measurement;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Man machine systems;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Speech;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","emotion recognition;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;human computer interaction;pattern classification;speech recognition;support vector machines","Danish emotional speech database;HMM;K-nearest neighbors classifier;Mel energy spectrum dynamics coefficients;SFS method;SVM;automatic speech emotion recognition;candidate instantaneous feature extraction;hidden Markov model;human-machine interactions;pattern classification methods;sequential forward selection;support vector machine","","31","1","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
