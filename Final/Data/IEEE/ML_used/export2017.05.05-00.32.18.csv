There are many potential factors affecting a serial offender's selection of the next crime site, we mainly studied the factors related to geographic information. For each factor, by using a discrete distance decay function which derives from the classical crime prediction theory “Journey to Crime”, we create a geographic profilewhich is a probability distribution of being the next crime site on given geographical locations. The final prediction is made by combining all geographic profiles weighted by effect functions which can be adjusted adaptively based on Bayesian learning theory. By testing the model on a crime dataset of a serial crime happened in Gansu, China, we can successfully capture the offender's intentions and locate the neighborhood of the next crime scene.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580971","Bayesian Learning Theory;Crime Prediction;Geographic Profiling;Hausdorff Distance;Kernel Function;Mixture of Gaussian Distribution","Bayesian methods","Bayes methods;computer crime;geographic information systems;software reliability;statistical distributions","Bayesian learning theory;discrete distance decay function;geographic information;geographic profiling;geographical locations;probability distribution;public security;serial crime prediction model","","0","","10","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, one common approach is based on Granger causality, which models the time-series genomic data as a vector autoregressive (VAR) process and estimates the GRNs from the VAR coefficient matrix. The main challenge for identification of VAR models is the high dimensionality of genes and limited number of time points, which results in statistically inefficient solution and high computational complexity. Therefore, fast and efficient variable selection techniques are highly desirable. In this paper, an introductory review of identification methods and variable selection techniques for VAR models in learning the GRNs will be presented.

With the development of society, energy saving and environmental protection have become a topical issue. The sun energy using is in the rapid development and application; however, the amount of power produced by a sun tracker depends upon the amount of sun light. This paper proposes a fuzzy sliding-mode controller (FSMC) with a time-varying sliding surface to control a light tacking system via the sliding-mode control approach. The proposed FSMC system is composed of a fuzzy controller and a slope regulator. The fuzzy controller infers the control action to control the system states to reach the sliding surface without large overshoot, and the slope regulator tunes the slope of the sliding surface to govern small convergence time of the system trajectories. Thus, the proposed FSMC system can achieve satisfactory tracking performance with fast transient response and good robustness. Finally, the proposed FSMC system is implemented based on a field programmable gate array chip for low-cost and high-performance industrial applications.

Further we transform the sensitive attribution into principal component space using disordered PCA, thus the sensitive attributes are encrypted and protected. Because the PCA method is disordered, this algorithm is very secure. In addition, PCA can keep the main character of dataset, so the precision change of CBR after encryption can be controlled in a small scope.

The main difficulty faced by the current face recognition techniques stems from large variations in facial expression, pose and illumination. This paper presents an effective method for face recognition using nonseparable wavelet domain block-based PCA(BPCA) method. Our investigations demonstrate that the constructed nonseparable wavelet can detect more singularities of the face image than traditional separable wavelet. The BPCA approach has overcome the low accuracy of PCA in cases of extreme change of facial expression, pose and illumination variations. The face image is first transformed into the wavelet domain using nonseparable wavelet, then the wavelet subbands are divided into sub-images with the same size. The block-based PCA method is then applied to extract features from the sub-images. Finally, weighted Euclidean distance based k-Nearest Neighborhood (kNN) classifier is performed for similarity measurement. Experimental results on the Yale database, the ORL database, and the CMU PIE Database demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580578","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580578","BPCA;Face recognition;Nonseparable wavelet;weighted Euclidean distance","Databases;Face;Irrigation;Principal component analysis;Training","face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;principal component analysis;wavelet transforms","CMU PIE database;ORL database;Yale database;block-based PCA method;face image singularity detection;face recognition technique;facial expression;feature extraction;illumination variations;k-nearest neighborhood classifier;kNN classifier;nonseparable wavelet domain BPCA;pose variations;principal component analysis method;similarity measurement;weighted Euclidean distance","","0","","24","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) is the most common method to control the micro-step motor, but the equivalent magnetic circuit taking into account the localized saturation throughout the hybrid step motor is a non-linear model. This paper presents the development of a non-linear FPGA based driver for controlling five-phase hybrid step motor. The application circuit we developed is aimed for use in a low cost system.

Because WTG has the characteristic of inertia and delay and the wind speed varies randomly, the simple feedback control method such as PID controller can hardly achieve satisfactory performance. This paper firstly analyzes the shortcomings of PID controller, and then a new pitch control method combined with nonlinear feed forward controller and PID controller is proposed. At high wind speed range, there is nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and wind speed due to the aerodynamic characteristic of the rotor. This paper obtains this relationship with numerical calculation and least square polynomial fit method. Then the nonlinear model is used to design the feed forward controller. Its input is wind speed and the output is the increasing feed forward reference pitch angle. The feed forward controller has achieved the dynamic feed forward compensation and improved the rapidness of control system. With the simulation of a 300 kW wind turbine generator at different wind speed, the new pitch control strategy can effectively reduce system's overshoot and regulation time, and has a satisfactory control performance.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580595","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580595","Aerodynamic characteristic;Nonlinear feed forward controller;Variable pitch control system","Feeds;Generators;Polynomials;Rotors;Wind speed;Wind turbines","feedback;feedforward;least squares approximations;nonlinear control systems;polynomials;power generation control;rotors;three-term control;wind turbines","PID controller;aerodynamic characteristic;dynamic feed forward compensation;feed forward controller;feedback control method;least square polynomial fit method;nonlinear feed forward pitch controller;power 300 kW;rotors;wind turbine generator","","1","","8","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A CNC machine enhances both quality and productivity. However, the variance of machining processes still occurred and the quality was still an issue for engineers to solve. To solve the issue, a quality inspection was conducted to ensure the satisfaction of customers. The quality inspection takes time and it should be eliminated from the aspect of lean production. To eliminate the wasting time of inspection, the in-process quality inspection was proposed to measure the quality characters during the machining processes without wasting time. Surface roughness (Ra), a key index to evaluate and determine the quality of a product, is influenced by the machine parameters and other factors resulting from the cutting tool. Surface roughness has a direct effect on the functional characteristics of the workpiece such as fatigue, fracture resistance, and surface friction. The traditional measurement of surface roughness always takes time and if the quality were not within the specification, the machine should stop and make adjustment. Therefore, to maintain the quality assurance and eliminate the inspection and adjusting time, an in-process neural-based adaptive control of surface roughness in end milling operations was proposed in this study. A neural network was applied as a decision-making algorithm to immediately predict the surface roughness. Following by the prediction, the predicted Ra was then compared to customer's specification. If the quality is not within the specification, the adaptive control system will be launched to adjust the feed rate and spindle speed of the CNC machine.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580906","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580906","In-process adaptive control;Milling operations;Neural networks;Surface roughness","Adaptive control;Artificial neural networks;Feeds;Machining;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Surface treatment","adaptive control;computerised numerical control;customer satisfaction;cutting tools;decision making;inspection;machine tool spindles;milling;neural nets;process control;production engineering computing;surface roughness","CNC;computer numerical control;customer satisfaction;cutting tool;decision-making algorithm;end milling operations;in-process adaptive control;machining manufacturing processes;machining processes;neural network;quality inspection;spindle speed;surface roughness","","1","","9","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To build this representation, visual vocabulary is necessary, which is typically constructed by vector quantization of local image features. However, current approaches typically consider basic vector quantization for vocabulary construction, which limits the practical applicability of bag-of-words representation for many visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to build image representation based on classified vector quantization. A major effect of using classified vector quantization is that it can achieve a more compact visual vocabulary. The traditional visual vocabulary for image representation is compared against our method for scene categorization task on well-known dataset: 15 natural scenes. We demonstrate that our method can greatly reduce the complexity of vocabulary construction, and at the same time it can improve the categorization performance for scene categorization. Moreover, we show that our method reaps higher categorization performance when decreasing the vocabulary size.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580564","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580564","Visual vocabulary;bag-of words;image representation;scene categorization;vector quantization","Legged locomotion;Vocabulary","image classification;vector quantisation;vocabulary","bag-of-words image representation;classified vector quantization;local image features;natural scene datasets;scene categorization task;visual vocabulary construction","","1","","10","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, in this paper, we propose a new method to detect the local community for a given node. To start, we find the local maximal-degree nodes which associate with the given node, then find the enclosing communities by calculating the local modularity of community from the local maximal-degree node, finally we optimize the communities' structure and get the local community for the given node.

NSCT is developed recently and can offer a trait of multidirection, flexible multiscale and shift-invariant, which can capture the intrinsic geometrical structures perfectly, and fuzzy set theory is a useful tool for handling the uncertainty in the images, and the proposed algorithm accepts advantages of NSCT and fuzzy set theory as a basis for image enhancement. Firstly, decompose the source remote sensing image in highpass subbands and lowpass subbands by NSCT. Secondly, map each highpass subband into corresponding fuzzy plane using membership function with different constraints and implement fuzzy contrast enhancement in fuzzy domain for each fuzzy plane. Finally, transform the fuzzy domain to NSCT domain and reconstruct the enhanced image from the modified NSCT coefficients.

When a new query is asked, the documents retrieved for the new query are ranked according to the scores determined by a joint ranking model which is combined from the individual models of similar training queries.

The demand for monitoring quality is not only to capture the object image, but also to present sharp and recognizable image. Thus, PTZ camera, which has pan and zoom functions, has become the best equipment. How to zoom in object and move camera lens so that the object is placed at the center of image becomes the major issue. This paper proposes the method of using the widest camera viewing angle as the moving range, and employing the spatial adjustment method of camera to establish the relative position of the camera and space. However, once the targeted object is unclear, the zoom in function of the PTZ camera is used; if the targeted object is not within the center of the image, the targeted object will move out of the image frame during the zoom-in process. Hence, by using the fuzzy nerves to simulate nonlinear horizontal movement and vertical rotation of PTZ camera, the image can be moved to the center of the image. In this paper, PTZ camera can zoom in image of the targeted object and move camera lens so that the object is at the frame center. Without additional adjustment, the camera lens can be moved exactly to the target position.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580868","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580868","Ellipse detection;Fuzzy neural network","Artificial neural networks;Calibration;Cameras;Copper;Equations;Mathematical model;Training","calibration;cameras;fuzzy neural nets;image motion analysis;photographic lenses;surveillance","PTZ camera;camera lens;fuzzy neural network;image frame;image recognition;nonlinear horizontal movement;quality monitoring;spatial adjustment method;surveillance system;zoom-in process","","0","","12","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Every country was conscious of the energy of earth was almost consumption danger, thus they positively developed the new energy of next generation such nuclear energy, windpower generator, solar energy, biologic energy etc. Among those methods nuclear energy was the better strategy for producing energy for its economical benefits, but it would generate large amount emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, and finally leading to second pollution and ozonosphere broken to form greenhouse effect and cause gradual ecological damage. That's why all countries again developed all possible methods to conserve energy and decrease CO<sub>2</sub> emission and that meant not only regarded energy develop but also energy conserved. This research was mainly to meet with the government policy of energy saving which was positively promoted by Energy Bureau of Taiwan Economy Department and to use all brand-new technology of sensor and communication techniques to construct active intelligent energy-conserved system which was designed on the conception of module to correspond to different energy consumption condition. In this system “active” meant the system with auto-sensor and monitoring control techniques would detect the energy consumption conditions both in environmental factors and power system in addition to feedback control with optimal operating parameters such as voltage, current, power factor, harmony-wave factor that was arranged with intelligent agent technique. All those parameters in this system would be automatically detected by digital meters which was designed by researchers with DSP, high-speed A/D concerted card so as to real-time respond to system oper- - ation; as to recognition of objective environment such as persons, facilities, air conditioning, lights in the space would need to use RFID system; parameters would be transmitted to servo PC to be judged what's the best feedback control parameters so there would develop ZigBee wireless sensor network technique; the controlled facilities would use Bluetooth modules which was operating with high frequency, non-disturbed, low power-consumption, non-direction features; as to long distance far away main servo PC the transmission mechanism would use embedded system to construct middle-way real-time respond system; the rear terminal control would design with power PLC.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580737","Bluetooth;Intelligent Energy-saving system;Module;Wireless Sensors Network;ZigBee","Air conditioning;Bluetooth;Buildings;Electricity;Power systems;Servomotors;Zigbee","Bluetooth;analogue-digital conversion;digital signal processing chips;energy conservation;multi-agent systems;power system control;power system measurement;radiofrequency identification;wireless sensor networks","Bluetooth modules;CO2 emission;DSP;RFID system;ZigBee wireless sensor network;active energy-saving system;active intelligent energy-conserved system;autosensor system;biologic energy;energy conservation;environmental factors;feedback control;global economic crises;harmony-wave factor;high-speed A/D concerted card;intelligent agent technique;intelligent energy-saving system;modules strategy;monitoring control;nuclear energy;oil;power factor;solar energy;storage capacity;windpower generator","","1","","12","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We then analyzed the impact of different parameters on the quality of clustering, by using a set of cluster metrics. We also compared RRW with two other random walk based graph clustering algorithms.
