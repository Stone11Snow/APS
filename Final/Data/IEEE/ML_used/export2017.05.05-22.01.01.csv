Previous work has shown that specific combinations of Android permissions, intents, broadcast receivers, native code and embedded applications can be effectively used to identify potentially malicious applications. We extend this work by using frequent combinations of such attributes as training features for random decision forest classification of malicious and benign applications. We demonstrate that using combinations of frequently-occuring permissions in this manner significantly improves previous results, and provides true positive rates in excess of 90% while maintaining tractable false positive rates. This is true even with novel malware that is not reliably detected at the time of release by conventional anti-malware tools. In addition, the auxiliary information generated by the random decision forest algorithm provides useful insights into the key indicators of malicious activity and the functionality of the associated malware.","2155-7578;21557578","Electronic:978-0-7695-5124-1; POD:978-1-4799-4899-4","10.1109/MILCOM.2013.170","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6735751","android;machine learning;mobile malware;random decision forest","Androids;Humanoid robots;Malware;Mobile communication;Operating systems;Smart phones","decision trees;invasive software;mobile computing;random processes","Android permissions;benign application;broadcast receivers;malicious application;mobile malware;native code;random decision forest classification;random decision forests;rapid permissions-based analysis;rapid permissions-based detection","","7","","47","","","18-20 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many approaches have been evolved for this purpose. The classical approaches such as port number or payload analyis methods has their own limitations. For example, some applications uses dynamic port number and encryption techniques, making these techniques ineffective. To overcome these limitations machine learning approaches were proposed. But these approaches also have problems of labeled instances in supervised learning and tedious manual work in unsupervised learning. Our aim was to implement an approach for classification of network traffic on semi-supervised data which overcomes the shortcomings of other two approaches. In this approach, flow (instance) statistics are used to classify the traffic. These flow statistics contains few labeled and many unlabeled instances constitutes a training data set which was used for the training(learning) of classifier. Then we used two processes: the clustering (using K-Medoids) which divides the training data into different groups and classification in which the labeling to the groups was done. To build the model we used the MATLAB tool. To test the build model we used KDD CUP 99 intrusion detection data set, which includes both attack data and normal data.","2375-1282;23751282","Electronic:978-1-4799-0727-4; POD:978-1-4799-0725-0","10.1109/NUiCONE.2013.6780083","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6780083","Classification;Clustering;K-Medoids;Machine Learning;Semi-Supervised","Accuracy;Clustering algorithms;Internet;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic;Training;Training data","computer network management;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","K-Medoids clustering;KDD CUP 99 intrusion detection data set;MATLAB tool;attack data;classifier learning;classifier training;clustering techniques;diagnostic monitoring;dynamic port number;encryption technique;flow instance statistics;flow prioritization;labeled instance;machine learning approach;network management;network traffic classification;normal data;payload analyis method;port number method;semisupervised data;traffic policing;traffic shaping;unsupervised learning","","0","","18","","","28-30 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In recent years a number of traffic classifiers have been proposed, in particular classifiers based on machine learning techniques exhibit high levels of accuracy. However, in practice, even if classifiers can be accurately trained at a given time, their accuracy will subsequently degrade when the characteristics of the network traffic change. In this paper, we propose an adjustable traffic classification system, the key technique of which is ensemble classification, assisted with a change detection method.

This means that the birds may appear in different scenarios as well may present different poses, sizes and angles of view. Besides, the images present strong variations in illuminations and parts of the birds may be occluded by other elements of the scenario. The proposed approach first applies a color segmentation algorithm in an attempt to eliminate background elements and to delimit candidate regions where the bird may be present within the image. Next, the image is split into component planes and from each plane, normalized color histograms are computed from these candidate regions. After aggregation processing is employed to reduce the number of the intervals of the histograms to a fixed number of bins. The histogram bins are used as feature vectors to by a learning algorithm to try to distinguish between the different numbers of bird species. Experimental results on the CUB-200 dataset show that the segmentation algorithm achieves 75% of correct segmentation rate. Furthermore, the bird species classification rate varies between 90% and 8%, depending on the number of classes taken into account.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0652-9; POD:978-1-4799-0650-5","10.1109/SMC.2013.740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722493","bird species classification;color features;color image segmentation;machine learning;pattern recognition","Birds;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Vectors;Visualization","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);vectors;zoology","CUB-200 dataset;aggregation processing;bird species classification rate;color feature extraction;color segmentation algorithm;feature vectors;histogram bins;learning algorithm;normalized color histograms;segmentation rate;unconstrained images","","2","","21","","","13-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of this study was to separate bony structures such as ribs and clavicles from soft tissue in CXRs. To achieve this, we developed anatomically specific multiple massive-training artificial neural networks (MTANNs) combined with total variation (TV) minimization smoothing and a histogram-matching-based consistency improvement method. The anatomically specific multiple MTANNs were designed to separate bones from soft tissue in different anatomic segments of the lungs. Each of the MTANNs was trained with the corresponding anatomic segment in the teaching bone images. The output segmental images from the multiple MTANNs were merged to produce an entire bone image. TV minimization smoothing was applied to the bone image for reduction of noise while preserving edges. This bone image was then subtracted from the original CXR to produce a soft-tissue image where bones were separated out. This new method was compared with conventional MTANNs with a database of 110 CXRs with nodules. Our new anatomically specific MTANNs separated rib edges, ribs close to the lung wall, and the clavicles from soft tissue in CXRs to a substantially higher level than did the conventional MTANNs, while the conspicuity of lung nodules and vessels was maintained. Thus, our technique for bone-soft-tissue separation by means of our new MTANNs would be potentially useful for radiologists as well as CADe schemes in detection of lung nodules on CXRs.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2284016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630091","Chest radiography;computer-aided detection;lung nodules;pixel-based machine learning;virtual dual-energy","Biological tissues;Bones;Histograms;Image segmentation;Lungs;Ribs;Training","bone;diagnostic radiography;image denoising;image segmentation;lung;medical image processing;minimisation;neural nets","anatomic segments;anatomically specific multiple massive-training ANN;anatomically specific multiple massive-training artificial neural networks;bone image;bone separation;bone-soft-tissue separation;bony structures;chest radiographs;clavicles;computer-aided detection;histogram-matching-based consistency improvement method;lung nodules;lung wall;noise reduction;output segmental images;radiologists;ribs;soft-tissue image;total variation minimization smoothing","0","5","","39","","20131011","Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper, bi-tagged phrases are used as features in combination with unigram features for sentiment classification. Joint feature vectors of unigrams and bi-tagged phrases have high dimensions consisting of noisy and irrelevant features.

Hub objects have a small distance to an exceptionally large number of data points, and anti-hubs are far from all other data points. It is related to the concentration of distances which impairs the contrast of distances in high dimensional spaces. Computation of secondary distances inspired by shared nearest neighbor (SNN) approaches has been shown to reduce hubness and concentration and there already exists some work on direct application of SNN in the context of hubness in image recognition. This study applies SNN to a larger number of high dimensional real world data sets from diverse domains and compares it to two other secondary distance approaches (local scaling and mutual proximity). SNN is shown to reduce hubness but less than other approaches and, contrary to its competitors, it is only able to improve classification accuracy for half of the data sets.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-3142-2; POD:978-1-4799-3144-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.101","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753957","curse of dimensionality;hubness;machine learning;shared nearest neighors","Accuracy;Conferences;Context;Electronic mail;Histograms;Image recognition;Standards","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","SNN;data points;high dimensional data spaces;image recognition;machine learning;real world data sets;shared nearest neighbors","","5","","28","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By leveraging rich annotations associated with each image, our algorithm can automatically produce precise and detailed 3D models of a scene from a single image. Moreover, we can transfer information across images to accurately label and segment objects in a scene. The true benefit of 3DNN compared to a traditional 2D nearest-neighbor approach is that by generalizing across viewpoints, we free ourselves from the need to have training examples captured from all possible viewpoints. Thus, we are able to achieve comparable results using orders of magnitude less data, and recognize objects from never-before-seen viewpoints. In this work, we describe the 3DNN algorithm and rigorously evaluate its performance for the tasks of geometry estimation and object detection/segmentation. By decoupling the viewpoint and the geometry of an image, we develop a scene matching approach which is truly 100% viewpoint invariant, yielding state-of-the-art performance on challenging data.","1550-5499;15505499","Electronic:978-1-4799-2840-8; POD:978-1-4799-2841-5; USB:978-1-4799-2839-2","10.1109/ICCV.2013.235","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751343","3D Data;Computer Vision;Geometry Estimation;Machine Learning;Scene Understanding","Cameras;Estimation;Geometry;Image edge detection;Layout;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","geometry;image matching;image segmentation;object detection","2D nearest-neighbor approach;3D Nearest-Neighbor algorithm;3D models;3DNN algorithm;geometry estimation;image matching;object detection;object segmentation;scene matching approach;scene understanding;viewpoint invariant 3D geometry matching","","4","","39","","","1-8 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While the disease may not manifest with symptoms at early stages, the high risk of heart attack and stroke at first presentation make early detection of this disease process critical. While the electrocardiogram (ECG) exercise stress test is commonly used to diagnose coronary artery atherosclerosis, it is an expensive test that requires cumbersome electrode placement with standardized exercise environment testing. We present an automated method for using a single lead of ECG sensors to classify subjects afflicted by atherosclerosis. This method is not only optimized for streamlined sensor implementation, but also automates classification to address data overload. Using the MIT-BIH database, the framework achieves high accuracy and diagnostic performance, supporting the clinical value of this novel classification method.","","DVD:978-1-4799-1560-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-1576-7; POD:978-1-4799-1563-7","10.1109/ICWISE.2013.6728790","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728790","ECG;SVM;atherosclerosis;coronary heart disease;electrocardiogram;machine learning","Atherosclerosis;Diseases;Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Heart;Sensors;Testing","biomedical electrodes;blood vessels;diseases;electric sensing devices;electrocardiography;medical signal processing;signal classification","ECG sensors;MIT-BIH database;automated classification;coronary artery atherosclerosis diagnosis;electrocardiogram;electrode placement;heart attack;single lead ECG","","0","","45","","","2-4 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A Nearest Prototype Selection Algorithm Using Multi-objective Optimization and Partition","J. Li; Y. Wang","Sch. of Comput.

Genetic algorithms have been used recently for prototype selection and showed good performance, however, they have some drawbacks such as the deteriorated running effect, slow convergence for the large datasets. The goal of designing good prototype selection algorithm is to maximize prediction classification accuracy and minimize the reduction ratio simultaneously. According to this goal, a two objective optimization model is set up for prototype selection problem. To make the model easier to be solved, the model is transformed to a single objective optimization model by the division of the two objectives. To solve the problem efficiently, a new prototype selection algorithm based on genetic algorithm and the divide-and-conquer partition is presented. The divide-and-conquer partition can divide the whole dataset into some random subsets, and thus make the problems more easier. Then, the genetic algorithm is specifically designed on these divided random subsets. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain smaller reduction ratio and higher classification efficiency, or at least comparable to those of some existing compared algorithms. This illustrates that the proposed algorithm is an expedient method in design nearest neighbor classifiers.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2548-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-2549-0; POD:978-1-4799-2550-6","10.1109/CIS.2013.62","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746398","divide-and-conquer partition;genetic algorithm;machine learning;multi-objective optimization;prototype selection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Prototypes","divide and conquer methods;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;set theory","divide-and-conquer partition;divided random subsets;genetic algorithms;multiobjective optimization;nearest neighbor classification algorithms;nearest prototype selection algorithm;prediction classification;random subsets","","1","","16","","","14-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In protein design, approximations are made to both the structural representation of the molecule and to the form of the energy equation, such that the existence of a general energy function for proteins is by no means guaranteed. Here, we present new insights toward the application of machine learning to the problem of finding a general energy function for protein design. Machine learning requires the definition of an objective function, which carries with it the implied definition of success in protein design. We explored four functions, consisting of two functional forms, each with two criteria for success. Optimization was carried out by a Monte Carlo search through the space of all variable parameters. Cross-validation of the optimized energy function against a test set gave significantly different results depending on the choice of objective function, pointing to relative correctness of the built-in assumptions. Novel energy cross terms correct for the observed nonadditivity of energy terms and an imbalance in the distribution of predicted amino acids.

The traditional board, chalk, talk based classroom scenario involves a teacher setting question papers based on the concepts taught, checks the answers written by students manually and thus evaluates the students' performance. However, setting question papers remains a time consuming process with the teacher having to bother about question quality, level of difficulty and redundancy. In addition the process of manually correcting students' answers is a cumbersome and tedious task.

The amount of malware is increasing every year and poses as a serious global security threat. Signature-based detection is the most broadly used commercial antivirus method, however, it fails to detect new and previously unseen malware. Supervised machine-learning models have been proposed in order to solve this issue, but the usefulness of supervised learning is far to be perfect because it requires a significant amount of malicious code and benign software to be identified and labelled in beforehand. In this paper, we propose a new method that adopts a collective learning approach to detect unknown malware. Collective classification is a type of semi-supervised learning that presents an interesting method for optimising the classification of partially-labelled data. In this way, we propose here, for the first time, collective classification algorithms to build different machine-learning classifiers using a set of labelled (as malware and legitimate software) and unlabelled instances. We perform an empirical validation demonstrating that the labelling efforts are lower than when supervised learning is used, while maintaining high accuracy rates.","","Electronic:978-989-8425-71-3; POD:978-1-4673-0203-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732395","Computer viruses;Data-mining;Machine learning;Malware detection;Security","Accuracy;Filtering;Gold;Training","","","","1","","28","","","18-21 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hard disk and server failures are not frequent but are often very costly. Such failures can have a very adverse effect on the business of an organization. The ability to accurately predict an impending disk or server failure can add an essential functionality for designing a reliable, fault tolerant and continuously available storage system. This paper explains a novel approach to predict hardware failures using spectrum-kernel Parallel Support Vector Machine (Parallel SVM) method by analyzing the system events logged in the system log files. These log files not only records the events processed by the system but it also holds the messages as the system state changes. A single message in the system log file is insufficient for any prediction and such prediction is bound to be less accurate. The approach introduced in the paper uses a sequence or pattern of messages from the system log file using a Sliding Window of messages with window size of 5 message sequence to predict the likelihood of a failure. These Sliding Windows of message sequences acts as inputs to the Parallel SVM. The Parallel SVM further tags the messages to a failure or non-failure system. Data Mining techniques are used in extracting useful information from the raw dataset. A solutioning model is developed using the structured dataset and Machine Learning algorithms. This environment when implemented using actual system logs from Linux-based storage system have shown to predict a hardware failure with accuracy of 90-92 percent.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2571-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-2572-8; POD:978-1-4799-2573-5","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779422","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779422","Big Data Analytics;Cloud Computing;Hard disk & Server failure prediction;MPP Database;Machine Learning;Parallel SVM Classification","Conferences;Decision support systems;Handheld computers","Big Data;Linux;computer centres;data mining;hard discs;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;support vector machines;system recovery","Data Mining techniques;Linux-based storage system;continuously available storage system;failure system;fault tolerant storage system;hard disk failure;hardware failure prediction;information extracting;machine learning algorithms;message pattern;message sequence;nonfailure system;parallel SVM;raw dataset;server failure;sliding window size;spectrum-kernel parallel support vector machine method;structured dataset;system log files","","0","1","12","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a novel method of detecting a relative direction of human movement (in eight directions uniformly distributed) with two pairs of PIR sensors whose sensing elements are orthogonally aligned. We have developed a data collection unit with four dual sensing element PIR sensors with modified lenses, and collected data set from six subjects walking in eight directions each. Based on the collected PIR signals, we have performed classification analysis with well known machine learning algorithms, including instance-based learning and support vector machine. Our findings show that with the raw data set captured from two orthogonally aligned PIR sensors with modified lenses, we were able to achieve more than 98% correct detection of direction of movement. We also found that with the reduced feature set composed of three peak values for each PIR sensor, we could achieve 89%-95% recognition accuracy according to machine learning algorithms.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2296601","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6697828","Pyroelectric infrared sensor;machine learning;movement detection;occupancy sensing;occupant localization","Accuracy;Legged locomotion;Sensor arrays;Sensor systems;Support vector machines","computerised instrumentation;infrared detectors;learning (artificial intelligence);lenses;optical sensors;pattern classification;pyroelectric detectors;support vector machines","PIR signal collection;automatic lighting system;classification analysis;data collection unit;dual sensing element PIR sensor;human movement direction detection;instance-based machine learning algorithm;lens;movement direction detection;orthogonally aligned PIR sensor;polarization;pyroelectric infrared sensor;support vector machine","","14","","23","","20140102","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Three wheelchair users participated in outdoor driving experiments held in urban center of Tokyo and all their actions were recorded in time-series of acceleration values and filmed on a digital video camera. In total, four units of iPods, which attached on left and right wheels, seats, and user's body, recorded approximately 1,800,000 accelerations signals during 10,000 seconds. In this paper, we analyze and classify life-logs of three wheelchair users' driving as the first step of computational estimation. We employed Support Vector Machine for classification, and created the supervised data from the video by human judgments. The life-logs were classified into moving/resting state and rough/flat state of the ground surface with finding optimal window size from 0.5 sec to 10 sec. As the result of classifications, estimation of moving/resting was achieved 99.8% accuracy rate and estimation of rough/flat surface was achieved 88.3% accuracy rate. Also estimations of driving difficulty were visualized on Google Map, and were evaluated by comparing with actual states of roads about wheelchair driving difficulty.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-3142-2; POD:978-1-4799-3144-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753985","accessibility visualization;human action recognition;machine learning;smart device;wheelchair life-logs","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Accidents;Accuracy;Estimation;Roads;Wheelchairs","accelerometers;data mining;data visualisation;handicapped aids;pattern classification;road accidents;support vector machines;time series;traffic engineering computing","Google Map;Tokyo urban center;acceleration value time-series;accidents possibility estimation;classification;computational estimation;digital video camera;driving difficulty estimation;ground surface rough-flat state;incidents possibility estimation;moving-resting state;optimal window size;outdoor driving experiments;road accessibility visualization;smart devices;spatiotemporal life-log mining;supervised data;support vector machine;three-axis accelerometers;wheelchair driving difficulty;wheelchair users driving life-log mining","","0","","20","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The communities are then computed on that constructed network. Because real networks are dynamic by nature, investigations on community detection in dynamic networks have started these last years. One problem actually unexplored in community dynamic is the prediction: knowing the evolution of the network until the time-step t, can we predict the communities at the time-step t+1? In this paper, we propose a general approach for communities prediction based on a machine learning model predicting interaction in social networks. In fact, we believe that if one is able to predict the structure of the network with a high precision, then one just need to compute the communities on this predicted network to have the prediction of the community structure. Evaluation on real datasets (DBLP and Facebook walls) shows the feasibility of the approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3211-5; POD:978-1-4799-3212-2","10.1109/SITIS.2013.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727230","Dynamic social networks;community prediction;interaction prediction;machine learning","Communities;Complex networks;Computational modeling;Facebook;Optimization;Predictive models","complex networks;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs);social networking (online);social sciences computing","DBLP;Facebook walls;community detection;community dynamic;complex networks;dynamic networks;interactions prediction;machine learning model;social networks","","0","","22","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Biologically inspired approaches to security in networks are interesting to evaluate because of the analogies between network security and survival of human body under pathogenic attacks. Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network based on multiple low-cost communication and computing devices connected to sensor nodes which sense physical parameters. While the spread of viruses in wired systems has been studied in-depth, applying trust in WSN is an emerging research area. Security threats can be introduced in WSN through various means, such as a benevolent sensor node turning fraudulent after a certain period of time. The proposed research work uses biological inspirations and machine learning techniques for adding security against such threats. While it uses machine learning techniques to identify the fraudulent nodes, consecutively by deriving inspiration from human immune system it effectively nullify the impact of the fraudulent ones on the network.

These ambiguities can be resolved by projecting a structured light pattern into the scene, and detecting points in the light pattern in each image. Robust detection of the structured light pattern is hard because of variations in object colour and lighting within the scene, however for specific applications, training data can easily be collected and labelled, enabling the detection problem to be solved using machine learning techniques. We demonstrate the application of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect laser light patterns projected into images of vines, using Feature Subset Selection to design a feature descriptor. A descriptor is computed for every candidate pixel, and the SVM determines if each descriptor is part of the laser line pattern. On test images, the proposed detector achieves 99.4% precision at 90% recall, outperforming a detector which uses only one pixel's colour.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-2341-0; POD:978-1-4799-2342-7; USB:978-1-4799-2340-3","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738248","Feature Subset Selection;Feature detection;Machine learning;Structured light;Support Vector Machine","Detectors;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Lasers;Support vector machines;Three-dimensional displays;Training","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","3D reconstruction;SVM;ambiguous matches;colour images;feature descriptor design;feature subset selection;lighting;machine learning technique;object colour;pixel colour;point detection;robust detection;similar-looking features;structured light pattern detection;support vector machine;test images;vine image","","1","","23","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using a learned dictionary in sparsity models can in general outperform predefined bases in clean data. In practice, both training and testing data may be corrupted and contain noises and outliers. Although recent studies attempted to cope with corrupted data and achieved encouraging results in testing phase, how to handle corruption in training phase still remains a very difficult problem. In contrast to most existing methods that learn the dictionary from clean data, this paper is targeted at handling corruptions and outliers in training data for dictionary learning. We propose a general method to decompose the reconstructive residual into two components: a non-sparse component for small universal noises and a sparse component for large outliers, respectively. In addition, further analysis reveals the connection between our approach and the ``partial'' dictionary learning approach, updating only part of the prototypes (or informative code words) with remaining (or noisy code words) fixed.

An agnostic data mining approach to the problem is introduced in this paper - the philosophical plausibility considerations follow after the correlations are found.

Due to this mixture of noised and heterogeneous resources, learning the regularities in navigational paths and a prediction for modeling user behavior seem to be necessary. In this paper, we will present a dynamic and hybrid approach of the users behavior modeling based on the extraction and analysis of implicit usage traces. Our aim is to optimize the predictive modeling of the user behaviors online by combining two complementary approaches. Derived from the Web Usage Mining field (WUM), the first approach consists in Sequential Patterns Mining (SPM). The second approach stems from the probabilistic model: Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). Therefore, our challenge is to show that the application of the CRFs on the patterns (sequence of resources) does optimize the metric performance of the SPM approach in terms of accuracy, coverage and complexity.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3391-4; Electronic:978-1-4799-3392-1; POD:978-1-4799-3393-8","10.1109/ISKO-Maghreb.2013.6728133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728133","Accuracy;Complexity;Conditional Random Fields;Coverage;Knowledge Extraction;Machine learning;Sequential Patterns Mining;Users Modeling","Accuracy;Association rules;Complexity theory;Context;Navigation;Predictive models;Random variables","Internet;data mining;probability","CRF;Internet;SPM;WUM;Web resources;Web usage mining field;conditional random fields;heterogeneous resources;predictive modeling;sequential patterns mining;user behavior modelling;user navigational behaviors","","0","","31","","","8-9 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous work has focused on algorithm selection or improved light curve representations, and naively convert light curves into structured feature sets without regard for the time span or phase of the light curves. In this paper, we highlight the violation of a fundamental machine learning assumption that occurs when archival light curves with long observational time spans are used to train classifiers that are applied to light curves with fewer observations. We propose two solutions to deal with the mismatch in the time spans of training and test light curves. The first is the use of classifier committees where each classifier is trained on light curves of different observational time spans. Only the committee member whose training set matches the test light curve time span is invoked for classification. The second solution uses hierarchical classifiers that are able to predict source types both individually and by sub-group, so that the user can trade-off an earlier, more robust classification with classification granularity. We test both methods using light curves from the MACHO survey, and demonstrate their usefulness in improving performance over similar methods that naively train on all available archival data.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-3142-2; POD:978-1-4799-3144-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.118","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753899","machine learning;supervised learning;time series analysis","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Lenses;Microoptics;Radio frequency;Robustness;Training","astronomical photometry;astronomy computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;time-domain analysis","MACHO survey;Magellanic cloud observations;archival data;archival light curves;classification granularity;classifier committees;classifier training;hierarchical classifiers;machine learning;observational time spans;online classification;performance improvement;real-time classification;synoptic sky surveys;test light curves;time span mismatch;time-domain astronomy;training light curves","","0","","24","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many approaches do not model the relation between aspects and subjective phrases explicitly, implicitly assuming that a subjective phrase refers to a certain aspect if they co-occur together in the same sentence, thus potentially sacrificing accuracy. Instead, in the approach presented in this paper, we model the relation between aspects and subjective phrases explicitly, exploiting a flexible model based on imperatively defined factor graphs (IDF). The extraction of subjective phrases, aspects and the relation between them is modeled as a joint inference problem and compared to a pure pipeline architecture. Our goal is to analyse and quantify to what extent a joint model outperforms a pipeline model in terms of extraction of aspects, subjective phrases and the relation between them. Our results show that, while we have a substantial improvement on predicting targets using a joint inference model, the performance on subjective phrase detection and relation extraction actually decreases only slightly.","2375-9232;23759232","Electronic:978-1-4799-3142-2; POD:978-1-4799-3144-6","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754022","factorie;fine-grained sentiment analysis;imperatively defined factor graphs;information extraction;machine learning;probabilistic graphical models","Cameras;Joints;Pipelines;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Proposals;Training","data mining;graph theory;inference mechanisms;pattern classification;probability;text analysis","IDF;fine-grained sentiment analysis;flexible model;imperatively defined factor graphs;joint inference model;opinion mining;pipeline architecture;pipeline probabilistic models;relation extraction;subjective phrase detection;text classification entity recognition problem","","2","","29","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such experiments yield a very large number of images that encode complex cellular activities, and reliable automated cell tracking emerges naturally as a prerequisite for further quantitative analysis. However, many existing cell tracking methods are restricted to using only a small number of features to allow for manual tweaking. In this paper, we propose a novel cell tracking approach that embraces a powerful machine learning technique to optimize the tracking parameters based on user annotated tracks. Our approach replaces the tedious parameter tuning with parameter learning and allows for the use of a much richer set of complex tracking features, which in turn affords superior prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we developed an active learning approach for efficient training data retrieval, which reduces the annotation effort to only 17%. In practical terms, our approach allows life science researchers to inject their expertise in a more intuitive and direct manner. This process is further facilitated by using a glyph visualization technique for ground truth annotation and validation. Evaluation and comparison on several publicly available benchmark sequences show significant performance improvement over recently reported approaches.

But it is labor intensive in high quality sample images selection, especially when collecting by visual features. Most researchers randomly choose positive and negative sample images for classifier training. In many applications, adopting different negative sample image datasets will vary annotation accuracy. In this research, we will discuss the accuracy between different negative sample images dataset collected by semantic features. We adopted Image Net as image dataset in this study, and we adopted Word Net for building semantic hierarchical tree. Semantic hierarchical structure tree is adopted to calculate the distance between each node. Then we adopt this distance relationship to prepare positive and negative sample images. We prepare one baseline method and suggest six different negative sample images selection methods for experiment. The binary SVM classifier training and prediction is implemented to compare the accuracy and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) between baseline and each proposed method. Our results show that if we select uniform amount of negative sample images in each distance in the semantic hierarchical tree, we will achieve highest accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3211-5; POD:978-1-4799-3212-2","10.1109/SITIS.2013.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6727186","Image Annotation;ImageNet;Machine Learning;Negative Sample Selection;SVM;WordNet","Accuracy;Airplanes;Feature extraction;Semantics;Support vector machines;Training;Visualization","image recognition;pattern classification;support vector machines;visual databases","MRR;binary SVM classifier training;high quality sample images selection;image annotation;image net;image recognition accuracy;mean reciprocal rank;negative sample image datasets;negative sample image selection method;negative sample images selection;positive sample images;semantic features;semantic hierarchical structure tree;visual features;word net","","0","","18","","","2-5 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This increases the probability that consecutive recorded instants of expressions represent the same affective content. In this paper, we exploit such a relationship to improve the recognition performance of continuous naturalistic affective expressions. Using datasets of naturalistic affective expressions (AVEC 2011 audio and video dataset, PAINFUL video dataset) continuously labeled over time and over different dimensions, we analyze the transitions between levels of those dimensions (e.g., transitions in pain intensity level). We use an information theory approach to show that the transitions occur very slowly and hence suggest modeling them as first-order Markov models. The dimension levels are considered to be the hidden states in the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. Their discrete transition and emission matrices are trained by using the labels provided with the training set. The recognition problem is converted into a best path-finding problem to obtain the best hidden states sequence in HMMs. This is a key difference from previous use of HMMs as classifiers. Modeling of the transitions between dimension levels is integrated in a multistage approach, where the first level performs a mapping between the affective expression features and a soft decision value (e.g., an affective dimension level), and further classification stages are modeled as HMMs that refine that mapping by taking into account the temporal relationships between the output decision labels. The experimental results for each of the unimodal datasets show overall performance to be significantly above that of a standard classification system that does not take into account temporal relationships. In particular, the results on the AVEC 2011 audio dataset outperform all other systems presented at the international competition.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2253768","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6507321","Affective computing;HMM;continuous emotion recognition;dimensional model of affect;machine learning;naturalistic affective expressions","","audio signal processing;emotion recognition;face recognition;feature extraction;hidden Markov models;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;speech recognition","AVEC 2011 audio-and-video dataset;HMM;PAINFUL video dataset;affective expression features;affective state level recognition;classification stages;continuous naturalistic affective expressions;discrete emission matrices;discrete transition matrices;emotion recognition;first-order Markov models;hidden Markov model framework;machine learning;naturalistic facial expressions;naturalistic vocal expressions;path-finding problem;probability;soft decision value","0","16","","74","","20130423","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Any impending fault within these motors is generally very difficult to isolate by conventional fault sensors or experts. The fact is generally attributed to the non-linear behavior of the motor's terminal characteristics. Extracting anomalous behavior from such data is a challenging task and predominantly relies on the historical machine data pattern. Based on the abovementioned context, this paper presents a novel time-series condition monitoring data assessment methodology to identify developing faults in induction motors. The technique employs Hidden Markov Models to identify anomalous machine behavior. The identification thus obtained is further improved via a Naïve Bayes classifier to further eliminate false positives from healthy and fault-containing data. The overall Bayes classification outcome showed a marked increase in detection accuracy at 84.55% with a substantial reduction in false positives.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1125-7; POD:978-1-4799-1123-3","10.1109/ISIEA.2013.6738971","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738971","Condition monitoring;hidden markov models;machine learning;pattern recognition","Accuracy;Bayes methods;Condition monitoring;Data models;Hidden Markov models;Induction motors;Rotors","belief networks;condition monitoring;fault diagnosis;hidden Markov models;induction motors;mechanical engineering computing;time series","Bayes classification;Naive Bayesian classifier;fault classification improvement;hidden Markov model;industrial condition monitoring;polyphase induction motors;time series","","0","","39","","","22-25 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The application domains seem to be restricted to particular fields and significantly less research has been conducted in cross domains.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1276-6; POD:978-1-4799-1273-5","10.1109/ICTer.2013.6761169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6761169","Machine Learning;Natural Language processing;Text mining","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Blogs;Classification algorithms;Data mining;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","behavioural sciences computing;data mining;pattern classification;text analysis","language specific properties;morphological variations;nonEnglish languages;nonEnglish text opinions;opinion mining;sentiment classification","","1","","20","","","11-15 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This framework provides a machine learning scheme for investigating the relationship between human visual complexity perception and low-level image features. Since the global and local characteristics of paintings affect human's holistic impression and detail perception, we design a set of methods to extract the features that represent the global and local characteristics of paintings. By feature selection, we look into the role that each image feature plays in assessing visual complexity. Then the selected features are combined by a Support Vector Machine for classification. Experimental results indicate that the proposed work can predict the visual complexity perception of paintings with the accuracy of 88.13%, which is highly close to the assessments given by humans. Compared with the conventional measure of complexity, our approach considers human visual perception and performs more efficiently in assessing visual complexity of painting images.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-2341-0; POD:978-1-4799-2342-7; USB:978-1-4799-2340-3","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738080","Classification;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Perception;Visual complexity","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Painting;Visualization","feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","detail perception;feature extraction;human holistic impression;human visual complexity perception;image classification;low-level image features;machine learning scheme;painting global characteristics;painting images;painting local characteristics;support vector machine;visual complexity assessment","","0","","25","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The features are extracted from four benchmark datasets viz. CSDMC2010, Spam Assassin, Ling Spam, and Enron-Spam.

We evaluate the classifier performances and find that BAGGING performs the best. Moreover, its performance surpasses that of a number of state-of-the-art methods proposed in previous studies.

However, in order to promote inter-operability with existing systems using the H.264/AVC, transcoding from H.264/AVC to the HEVC codec is highly needed. This paper presents a transcoding solution that uses machine learning techniques in order to map H.264/AVC macroblocks into HEVC coding units (CUs). Two alternatives to build the machine learning model are evaluated. The first uses a static training, where the model is built offline and used to transcode any video sequence. The other uses a dynamic training, with two well-defined stages: a training stage and a transcoding stage. In the training stage, full re-encoding is performed while the H.264/AVC and the HEVC information are gathered. This information is then used to build a model, which is used in the transcoding stage to classify the HEVC CU partitioning. Both solutions are tested with well-known video sequences and evaluated in terms of rate-distortion (RD) and complexity. The proposed method is on average 2.26 times faster than the trivial transcoder using fast motion estimation, while yielding a RD loss of only 3.6% in terms of bitrate.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-2341-0; POD:978-1-4799-2342-7; USB:978-1-4799-2340-3","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738406","HEVC;Transcoding;machine learning","","learning (artificial intelligence);transcoding;video coding","AVC-HEVC video transcoder;H.264 video coding;HEVC coding units;computational complexity;machine learning technique;mode mapping;rate distortion;static training;transcoding solution;video sequence","","11","","15","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The direct use of the spectral libraries in spectral unmixing is increased by increasing the availability of the libraries. In this way, the spectral unmixing problem is converted into a sparse regression problem that is time-consuming. This is due to the existence of irrelevant spectra in the library. So these spectra should be removed in some way. In this paper, a machine learning approach for spectral library pruning is introduced. At first, the spectral library is clustered based on a simple and efficient new feature space. Then the training data needed to learn a classifier are extracted by adding different noise levels to the clustered spectra. The label of the training data is determined based on the results of spectral library clustering. After learning the classifier, each pixel of the image is classified using it. For pruning the library, the spectra with the labels that none of the image pixels belong to, are removed. We use three classifiers, decision tree, neural networks and k-nearest neighbor to determine the effect of applying different classifiers. The results compared here show that the proposed method works well in noisy images.","2166-6776;21666776","Electronic:978-1-4673-6184-2; POD:978-1-4673-6183-5","10.1109/IranianMVIP.2013.6779966","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779966","hyperspectral image;machine learning;sparse unmixing;spectral library","Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Hyperspectral imaging;Libraries;Materials;Training data","decision trees;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;remote sensing","classification techniques;classifier learning extraction;decision tree;feature space;k-nearest neighbor;machine learning approach;neural networks;pixel classification;remote sensing;sparse regression problem;spectral library clustering;spectral library pruning;spectral unmixing;training data","","0","","13","","","10-12 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is useful and important, for various software engineering tasks, to know which design pattern is implemented where in a software design. However, this information is often lost due to poor or absent documentation, and so accurate recognition tools are required. The problem is that design patterns, given their abstract and vague nature, have a level of resistance to be automatically and accurately recognized. Although this vagueness or fuzziness can be captured and modelled by the fuzzy inference system, it has not yet been applied to solve this problem. This paper fills this gap by proposing an approach for design pattern recognition based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System. Our approach consists of two phases: space reduction phase and design pattern recognition phase. Both phases are implemented by ANFIS.

Before the tape-out, a pre-silicon design has to be thoroughly inspected by time-consuming functional verification and code review to exclude bugs. For functional verification and code review, a critical issue determining their efficiency is the allocation of resources (e.g., computational resources and manpower) to different modules of a design, which is conventionally guided by designers' experiences. Such practices, though simple and straightforward, may take high risks of wasting resources on bug-free modules or missing bugs in buggy modules, and thus could affect the success and timeline of the tape-out. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called pre-silicon bug forecast to predict the bug information of hardware designs. In this framework, bug models are built via machine learning techniques to characterize the relationship between design characteristics and the bug information, which can be leveraged to predict how bugs distribute in different modules of the current design. Such predicted bug information is adequate to regulate the resources among different modules to achieve efficient functional verification and code review. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed pre-silicon bug forecast framework, we conducted detailed experiments on several open-source hardware projects. Moreover, we also investigate the impacts of different learning techniques and different sets of characteristic on the performance of bug models. Experimental results show that with appropriate learning techniques and characteristics, about 90% modules could be correctly predicted as buggy or clean and the number of bugs of each module could also be accurately predicted.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2013.2288688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740024","Bug forecast;code review;design characteristics;functional verification;machine learning","Computer bugs;Genetic algorithms;Hardware;History;Open source software;Organizations;Predictive models","computer debugging;elemental semiconductors;learning (artificial intelligence);program verification;silicon","Si;bug information;code review;functional verification;hardware designs;machine learning techniques;pre-silicon bug forecast","","1","","42","","","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

On the other hand, the IGRT workflow involves collecting a series of computed tomography (CT) images from the same patient under treatment. These images contain valuable patient-specific information yet are often neglected by previous works. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework, namely incremental learning with selective memory (ILSM), to effectively learn the patient-specific appearance characteristics from these patient-specific images. Specifically, starting with a population-based discriminative appearance model, ILSM aims to “personalize” the model to fit patient-specific appearance characteristics. The model is personalized with two steps: backward pruning that discards obsolete population-based knowledge and forward learning that incorporates patient-specific characteristics. By effectively combining the patient-specific characteristics with the general population statistics, the incrementally learned appearance model can localize the prostate of a specific patient much more accurately. This work has three contributions: 1) the proposed incremental learning framework can capture patient-specific characteristics more effectively, compared to traditional learning schemes, such as pure patient-specific learning, population-based learning, and mixture learning with patient-specific and population data; 2) this learning framework does not have any parametric model assumption, hence, allowing the adoption of any discriminative classifier; and 3) using ILSM, we can localize the prostate in treatment CTs accurately (DSC ~ 0.89) and fast ( ~ 4 s), which satisfies the real-world clinical requirements of IGRT.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2291495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6668908","Anatomy detection;image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT);incremental learning;machine learning;prostate segmentation","Computed tomography;Detectors;Image segmentation;Planning;Sociology;Statistics;Training","biological organs;computerised tomography;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;radiation therapy","3D treatment-guided radiotherapy;backward pruning;computed tomography images;discriminative classifier;fast prostate localization;forward learning;image guided radiotherapy;incremental learning selective memory;large anatomical variation;low tissue contrast;mixture learning;novel learning framework;patient treatment;patient-specific appearance characteristics;patient-specific images;population-based discriminative appearance model;population-based learning;valuable patient-specific information","0","9","","42","","20131118","Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this study, we aim to classify fMRI measurements recorded during an object recognition experiment. Previous studies focus on Multi Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA) which feeds a set of active voxels in a concatenated vector form to a machine learning algorithm to train and classify the cognitive processes. In most of the MVPA methods, after an image preprocessing step, the voxel intensity values are fed to a classifier to train and recognize the underlying cognitive process. Sometimes, the fMRI data is further processed for de-noising or feature selection where techniques, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Independent Component Analysis (ICA) or Principal Component Analysis are employed. Although these techniques are proved to be useful in MVPA, they do not model the spatial connectivity among the voxels. In this study, we attempt to represent the local relations among the voxel intensity values by forming a mesh network around each voxel to model the relationship of a voxel and its surroundings. The degree of connectivity of a voxel to its surroundings is represented by the arc weights of each mesh. The arc weights, which are estimated by a linear regression model, are fed to a classifier to discriminate the brain states during an object recognition task. This approach, called Mesh Learning, provides a powerful tool to analyze various cognitive states using fMRI data. Compared to traditional studies which focus either merely on multi-voxel pattern vectors or their reduced-dimension versions, the suggested Mesh Learning provides a better representation of object recognition task. Various machine learning algorithms are tested to compare the suggested Mesh Learning to the state-of-the art MVPA techniques. The performance of the Mesh Learning is shown to be higher than that of the availab- e MVPA techniques.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-2341-0; POD:978-1-4799-2342-7; USB:978-1-4799-2340-3","10.1109/ICIP.2013.6738542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6738542","Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI);Multi Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA);brain decoding;classification;feature extraction;machine learning","","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;feature selection;image classification;image denoising;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;object recognition;regression analysis","MVPA method;active voxel;arc weights estimation;brain state discrimination;cognitive process classification;cognitive process modeling;cognitive state;concatenated vector;degree of connectivity;fMRI measurement;feature selection;functional magnetic resonance imaging;image denoising;image preprocessing;linear regression model;machine learning algorithm;mesh learning;mesh network;multivoxel pattern analysis;object classification;object recognition;object recognition representation;voxel intensity value","","0","","20","","","15-18 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Later its generalized version called Real AdaBoost was proposed by Schapire and Singer. Real AdaBoost increases weights for misclassified samples and decreases weights for correctly classified samples in every iteration. This kind of weight adjustment focuses on the samples with large weights and tries to make them correctly classified in future runs. However, it may lead to the misclassification of some other samples that have been correctly classified in previous runs. If we can curb this kind of misclassification during the boosting process, a faster training can be achieved. Based on this assumption, we propose Parameterized AdaBoost in which a parameter is devised to penalize the misclassification of samples that have already been correctly classified. Then we analyse that samples with positive classification margins in Parameterized AdaBoost are more than in Real AdaBoost. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a faster convergence of the training error and also improves the generalization error to some degree when compared with Real AdaBoost.","1070-9908;10709908","","10.1109/LSP.2014.2313570","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778011","AdaBoost;generalization error;machine learning;real AdaBoost;training error","Indexes;Machine learning algorithms;Materials;Object detection;Signal processing algorithms;Training;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","AdaBoost training;boosting process;classification margins;data classification;generalization error;machine learning algorithm;object detection;parameterized AdaBoost","","4","","17","","20140325","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we present a seizure-detection processor that directly uses compressively-sensed electroencephalograms (EEGs) for embedded signal analysis. In addition to addressing communication, this has two advantages for local computation. First, with compressive sensing, reconstruction costs are typically severe, precluding embedded analysis; directly analyzing the compressed signals circumvents reconstruction costs, enabling embedded analysis within applications. Second, compared to Nyquist-sampled signals, the use of compressed representations reduces the computational energy of signal analysis due to the reduced number of signal samples. We describe an algorithmic formulation as well as a hardware architecture that enables two strong power-management knobs, wherein application-level performance can scale with computational energy. The two knobs are parameterized as follows: 1) ξ, which quantifies the amount of data compression, and 2) ν, which determines the approximation error within the proposed compressed-domain processing algorithm. For ξ and ν in the range 2-24×, the energy to extract signal features (over 18 channels) is 70.8-1.3 nJ, and the detector's performance for sensitivity, latency, and specificity is 96-91%, 4.7-5.3 sec., and 0.17-0.30 false-alarms/hr., respectively (compared to a baseline performance of 96%, 4.6 sec., and 0.15 false-alarms/hr.).","1549-8328;15498328","","10.1109/TCSI.2013.2285912","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693771","Circuits;compressive sensing;energy efficiency;machine learning;seizure detection;signal processing","Approximation methods;Detectors;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits;Signal analysis","compressed sensing;data compression;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing;sensitivity;signal reconstruction;signal sampling","Nyquist-sampled signals;algorithmic formulation;application-level performance;approximation error;communication constraints;compressed representations;compressed signals circumvents reconstruction costs;compressed-domain processing algorithm;compressively-sensed EEG;compressively-sensed electroencephalograms;computational energy;data compression;embedded signal analysis;energy-scalable processor;hardware architecture;local computation;low-power sensors;power 0.6 muW to 107 muW;power-management knobs;seizure-detection processor;sensitivity;signal feature extraction","","9","","20","","20140102","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The computational principles and neural mechanisms underlying operant learning are a subject of extensive experimental and theoretical investigations. Theoretical approaches largely rely on concepts and algorithms from reinforcement learning. The dominant view is that organisms maintain a value function, that is, a set of estimates of the cumulative future rewards associated with the different behavioral options. These values are then used to select actions. Learning in this framework results from the update of these values depending on experience of the consequences of past actions. An alternative view questions the applicability of such a computational scheme to many real-life situations. Instead, it posits that organisms exploit the intrinsic variability in their action-selection mechanism(s) to modify their behavior, e.g., via stochastic gradient ascent, without the need of an explicit representation of values. In this review, we compare these two approaches in terms of their computational power and flexibility, their putative neural correlates, and, finally, in terms of their ability to account for behavior as observed in repeated-choice experiments. We discuss the successes and failures of these alternative approaches in explaining the observed patterns of choice behavior. We conclude by identifying some of the important challenges to a comprehensive theory of operant learning.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2307022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6767062","Computational intelligence;Markov decision process;decision making;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;machine learning;neural networks;reinforcement learning","Behavioral science;Computational modeling;Gradient methods;Learning (artificial intelligence);Markov processes;Neural networks;Neurons;Transient analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","action-selection mechanism;behavioral options;computational power;computational principles;flexibility;intrinsic variability;neural mechanisms;operant learning;putative neural correlates;reinforcement learning misbehavior;stochastic gradient ascent","","3","","104","","20140314","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

These processes often introduce geometric distortions which affect the visual quality of the ultimate data visualization. In order to accurately evaluate perceptual impacts caused by the distortions, assessment metrics on 3D Mesh Visual Quality (MVQ) have been extensively discussed in the literature. Researchers recommended various metrics to predict the adverse effects that visual artifacts can have in applications. Most of these metrics are based on geometric attributes, conventional geometric distance, Laplacian coordinates, different types of curvature computation, and dihedral angles. We hypothesize that an optimal combination of multiple attributes associated with a 3D mesh surface can contribute to better perceptual prediction than single attributes used separately. In this paper, we use two user studies to validate our hypothesis. Our contributions are: (1) providing a detailed analysis of the most relevant geometric attributes for mesh quality assessment, and (2) introducing a new perceptual evaluation metric based on multiple attributes, with the optimal combination determined through machine learning techniques. Statistical quantitative analysis shows that our metric delivers better results than other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed method is simple to implement and fast in execution.

In this work, we address this problem by investigating a retrieval-based annotation scheme of mining massive web facial images that are freely available over the Internet. In particular, given a facial image, we first retrieve the top n similar instances from a large-scale web facial image database using content-based image retrieval techniques, and then use their labels for auto annotation. Such a scheme has two major challenges: 1) how to retrieve the similar facial images that truly match the query, and 2) how to exploit the noisy labels of the top similar facial images, which may be incorrect or incomplete due to the nature of web images. In this paper, we propose an effective Weak Label Regularized Local Coordinate Coding (WLRLCC) technique, which exploits the principle of local coordinate coding by learning sparse features, and employs the idea of graph-based weak label regularization to enhance the weak labels of the similar facial images. An efficient optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the WLRLCC problem. Moreover, an effective sparse reconstruction scheme is developed to perform the face annotation task. We conduct extensive empirical studies on several web facial image databases to evaluate the proposed WLRLCC algorithm from different aspects. The experimental results validate its efficacy. We share the two constructed databases ""WDB"" (714,454 images of 6,025 people) and ""ADB"" (126,070 images of 1,200 people) with the public.

Reasons for this include applying Quality of Service (QoS), network planning, prohibiting its use in some networks and lawful interception of communications. Researchers have addressed VoIP traffic classification from different viewpoints, such as classifier accuracy, building time, classification time and online classification. This previous research tested their models using the same version of a VoIP product they used for training the model, giving generalizability only to that version of the product. This means that as new VoIP versions are released, these classifiers become obsolete. In this paper, we address if this approach is applicable to detecting new, untrained, versions of Skype. We suggest that using cost-sensitive classifiers can help to improve the accuracy of detecting untrained versions, by testing compared to other algorithms. Our experiment demonstrates promising preliminary results to detect Skype version 4, by building a cost sensitive classifier on Skype version 3, achieving an F-measure score of 0.57. This is a drastic improvement from not using cost sensitivity, which scores an F-measure of 0. This approach may be enhanced to improve the detection results and extended to improve detection for other applications that change protocols from version to version.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3076-0; POD:978-1-4799-3077-7","10.1109/CTC.2013.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6754636","Machine Learning;Network;Security;Skype;VoIP","Buildings;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Monitoring;Ports (Computers);Telecommunication traffic","Internet telephony;pattern classification;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","F-measure scores;QoS;Skype traffic classification;Skype version-3 detection;Skype version-4 detection;VoIP traffic classification;building time;classifier accuracy;cost sensitive algorithms;cost-sensitive classifiers;network level;network planning;online classification time;quality of service;voice over IP technologies","","1","","31","","","21-22 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Predicting immunogenic T-cell epitopes by combining various sequence-derived features","W. Zhang; J. Liu; Y. Xiong; M. Ke; K.

In the bioinformatics, the MHC-binding peptides are defined as the T-cell epitopes, which will trigger the immune response to the antigens. However, binding peptides cannot necessarily activate the immune response, namely non-immunogenic. Until now, little attention has been paid to the immunogenic epitopes. Therefore, the recognition of immunogenic epitopes is a challenging task of the practical value. This paper systematically evaluates a wide variety of sequenced-derived features, which have been ever used for epitope prediction or similar tasks, and reveals their relationship with epitope immunogenicity. Then, we consider how to effectively exploit various features for the computational prediction of immunogenic epitopes. Subsequently, the random forest is adopted as the classification engine, and an ensemble model is developed by using the average scores of individual feature-based predictors. Compared with the previously published methods (POPI, POPISK and PAAQD), our models produce better performance on the benchmark datasets. Evaluated by t-test, the improvements of our method against existing methods are statistically significant (P<;0.01), showing the promise for the immunogenic epitope prediction.

However, the task is challenging as business rules are often not explicitly stated in the requirements documents. In case business rules are explicit, they may not be atomic in nature or, may be vague. In this paper, we present an approach for identifying business rules in the available requirements documentation. We first identify various business rules categories and, then examine requirements documentation (including requirements specifications, domain knowledge documents, change request, request for proposal) for the presence of these rules. Our study aims at finding how effectively business rules can be identified and classified into one of the categories of business rules using machine learning algorithms. We report on the results of the experiments performed. Our observations indicate that in terms of overall result, support vector machine algorithm performed better than other classifiers. Random Forest algorithm had a higher precision than support vector machine algorithm but relatively low recall. Naïve Bayes algorithm had a higher recall than support vector machine. We also report on evaluation study of our requirements corpus using stop-words and stemming the requirements statements.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2571-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-2572-8; POD:978-1-4799-2573-5","10.1109/IAdCC.2014.6779538","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6779538","Business Rules;Machine Learning;Requirements","Classification algorithms;Documentation;Information systems;Machine learning algorithms;Organizations;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;business data processing;formal specification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;support vector machines;systems analysis;text analysis;trees (mathematics)","automated business rule identification;business rules categories;change request;domain knowledge documents;machine learning algorithm;naive Bayes algorithm;random forest algorithm;request for proposal;requirement specifications;requirement statements;requirements corpus;requirements documentation;requirements engineering process;stop-words;support vector machine algorithm","","0","","15","","","21-22 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method for image fragment identification using a machine learning approach.

Further, many sorted logic is a closer reflection of the real world of objects that belong to sorts, in the presence of a sort hierarchy.

In this paper, we propose Non-negative Multiple Tensor Factorization (NMTF), which factorizes the target tensor and auxiliary tensors simultaneously. Auxiliary data tensors compensate for the sparseness of the target data tensor. The factors of the auxiliary tensors also allow us to examine the target data from several different aspects. We experimentally confirm that NMTF performs better than NTF in terms of reconstructing the given data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed NMTF can successfully extract spatio-temporal patterns of people's daily life such as leisure, drinking, and shopping activity by analyzing several tensors extracted from online review data sets.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-5108-1; POD:978-1-4799-1328-2","10.1109/ICDM.2013.83","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6729621","Machine Learning;Non-negative Tensor Factorization;Spatio-Temporal Pattern","Business;Geology;Matrix decomposition;Motion pictures;Probabilistic logic;Sparse matrices;Tensile stress","data analysis;matrix decomposition;tensors","auxiliary data tensors;data analysis;higher-order tensors;nonnegative multiple tensor factorization;target data tensor sparseness","","4","","21","","","7-10 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On the other hand, algorithms used for anomaly detection often have black box qualities that are difficult to understand for people who are not algorithm experts. Rule extraction methods create interpretable rule sets that act as classifiers. They have mostly been combined with already labeled data sets. This paper aims to combine unsupervised anomaly detection with rule extraction techniques to create an online anomaly detection framework. Unsupervised anomaly detection uses diffusion maps and clustering for labeling an unknown data set. Rule sets are created using conjunctive rule extraction algorithm.

Prediction of type 2 diabetes using a combination of anthropometric measures remains a controversial issue. This study aims to predict the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) status that is used in the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by a combination of various measures among Korean adults. A total of 4870 subjects (2955 females and 1915 males) participated in this study. Based on 37 anthropometric measures, we compared predictions of FPG status using individual versus combined measures using two machine-learning algorithms. The values of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the predictions by logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier based on the combination of measures were 0.741 and 0.739 in females, respectively, and were 0.687 and 0.686 in males, respectively. Our results indicate that prediction of FPG status using a combination of anthropometric measures was superior to individual measures alone in both females and males. We show that using balanced data of normal and high FPG groups can improve the prediction and reduce the intrinsic bias of the model toward the majority class.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2013.2264509","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6556939","Anthropometry;diabetes;fats;machine learning","Data models;Diabetes;Logistics;Optical wavelength conversion;Power measurement;Predictive models;Sensitivity","Bayes methods;anthropometry;biochemistry;blood;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;sensitivity analysis;signal classification","FPG;anthropometric measures;area under the receiver operating characteristic curve;body fat distribution;fasting plasma glucose status;logistic regression;machine learning;naive Bayes classifier;obesity;type 2 diabetes diagnosis","0","12","","58","","20130710","March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Of great concern is the blue-green algae Microcystis that thrives in eutrophic conditions and generates microcystin, a powerful hepatotoxin. Microcystin poses a threat to the delicate ecosystem of Lake Erie, and it threatens commercial fishing operations and water treatment plants using the lake as a water source. Integrated Data Fusion and Machine-learning (IDFM) is an early warning system proposed by this paper for the prediction of microcystin concentrations and distribution by measuring the surface reflectance of the water body using satellite sensors. The fine spatial resolution of Landsat is fused with the high temporal resolution of MODIS to create a synthetic image possessing both high temporal and spatial resolution. As a demonstration, the spatiotemporal distribution of microcystin within western Lake Erie is reconstructed using the band data from the fused products and applied machine-learning techniques. The performance of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Genetic Programming (GP) are compared and tested against traditional two-band model regression techniques. It was found that the GP model performed slightly better at predicting microcystin with an R2 value of 0.6020 compared to 0.5277 for ANN.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0652-9; POD:978-1-4799-0650-5","10.1109/SMC.2013.182","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6721935","Data fusion;harmful algal bloom;machine-learning;microcystin;remote sensing;surface reflectance","Artificial neural networks;Earth;Lakes;MODIS;Reflectivity;Remote sensing;Satellites","agriculture;ecology;genetic algorithms;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);monitoring;neural nets;remote sensing;sensor fusion;water quality","ANN;IDFM;MODIS;Western Lake Erie;agricultural activities;artificial neural networks;blue-green algae microcystis;comparative data fusion;ecosystem;eutrophic conditions;genetic programing;hepatotoxin;machine learning;remote sensing images;synthetic image possessing;urban growth;water quality monitoring","","0","","21","","","13-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We address the standard multiarmed bandit problem, the multiarmed bandit problem with transition costs, and the multiarmed bandit problem on graphs. We focus on the case of Gaussian rewards in a setting where the decision maker uses Bayesian inference to estimate the reward values. We model the decision maker's prior knowledge with the Bayesian prior on the mean reward. We develop the upper-credible-limit (UCL) algorithm for the standard multiarmed bandit problem and show that this deterministic algorithm achieves logarithmic cumulative expected regret, which is optimal performance for uninformative priors. We show how good priors and good assumptions on the correlation structure among arms can greatly enhance decision-making performance, even over short time horizons. We extend to the stochastic UCL algorithm and draw several connections to human decision-making behavior. We present empirical data from human experiments and show that human performance is efficiently captured by the stochastic UCL algorithm with appropriate parameters. For the multiarmed bandit problem with transition costs and the multiarmed bandit problem on graphs, we generalize the UCL algorithm to the block UCL algorithm and the graphical block UCL algorithm, respectively. We show that these algorithms also achieve logarithmic cumulative expected regret and require a sublogarithmic expected number of transitions among arms. We further illustrate the performance of these algorithms with numerical examples.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2014.2307024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6774467","Adaptive control;human decision making;machine learning;multiarmed bandit","Algorithm design and analysis;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Decision making;Human factors;Resource management;Stochastic processes","belief networks;decision making;deterministic algorithms;stochastic processes","Bayesian inference;Gaussian rewards;deterministic algorithm;explore-exploit tasks;generalized Gaussian multiarmed bandits;graphical block UCL algorithm;human decision making;logarithmic cumulative expected regret;multiarmed bandit problems;stochastic UCL algorithm;uninformative priors;upper-credible-limit algorithm","","12","","52","","20140317","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
