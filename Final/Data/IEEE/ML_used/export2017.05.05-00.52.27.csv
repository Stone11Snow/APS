For the purpose of online training, we develop a novel mixed effects evoked response detector, which is capable of combining individual random effects and population fixed effects, for the analysis of neural signatures associated with targets. To avoid numerical problems in high dimensional matrix computations, we develop equivalent dimension reduced expressions for the mixed models. We construct the mixed effects evoked response model using principal component analysis to provide bases for the population model and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to provide bases for the individual models. In addition, the LDA is adopted for Elecroencephalography channel dimensionality reduction. Data collected at different time and experimental conditions from two subjects performing image search tasks are utilized to assess the quality of the models. We also compare the proposed model with the support vector machine (SVM).

Due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor microvasculature, the measured signals can be represented as the mixture of the permeability images corresponding to different perfusion rates. We recently reported a hybrid convex analysis of mixture framework for unmixing of non-negative yet dependent angiogenic permeability distributions (APDs) and perfusion time activity curves (TACs). In our last work, we presented an underlying theory to infer the concept that the TACs can be identified by finding the lateral edges of an observation-constructed convex pyramid when the well-grounded points exist for all APDs. For fulfilling this concept, a hybrid method including non-negative clustered component analysis, convex analysis, and least-squares fitting with non-negativity constraints was developed. In this paper, we use computer simulations to validate the performance of our reported framework, and further apply it to three sets of real DCE-MRI data, before and during the treatment period, for assessing the response to antiangiogenic therapy. The experimental results are not only surprisingly meaningful in biology and clinic, but also capable of reflecting the efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors in cancer treatment.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685490","Blind source separation;antiangiogenic therapy;compartment latent variable model;convex analysis;dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging","Cancer;Image analysis;Independent component analysis;Inhibitors;Magnetic resonance imaging;Medical treatment;Pattern analysis;Permeability;Pixel;Source separation","biomedical MRI;blind source separation;blood vessels;cancer;curve fitting;haemodynamics;haemorheology;least squares approximations;medical signal processing;patient treatment;permeability;statistical analysis","DCE-MRI;angiogenesis inhibitor assessment;angiogenic permeability distributions;antiangiogenic therapy response;cancer treatment;dynamic contrast enhanced MRI;functional pattern separation;hybrid convex analysis;least squares fitting;magnetic resonance imaging;nonnegative clustered component analysis;nonnegativity constraints;observation constructed convex pyramid;perfusion rate;perfusion time activity curves;permeability images;tumor microvasculature;vascular heterogeneity characterization","","1","","17","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The basic idea is to mix the outputs of two adaptive filters with complementary capabilities, so that the combination is able to retain the best properties of each component. In previous works, we proposed to use a convex combination, applying weights lambda(n) and 1-lambda(n), with lambda(n) isin (0,1), to the filter components, where the mixing parameter lambda(n) was updated to minimize the overall square error using stochastic gradient descent rules. In this paper, we present a new adaptation scheme for lambda(n) based on the solution to a least-squares (LS) problem, where the mixing parameter is allowed to lie outside range [0,1]. Such affine combinations have recently been shown to provide additional gains. Unlike some previous proposals, the new LS combination scheme does not require any explicit knowledge about the component filters. The ability of the LS scheme to achieve optimal values of the mixing parameter is illustrated with several experiments in both stationary and tracking situations.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685501","Adaptive filters;combination of filters;least squares (LS)","Adaptive filters;Adaptive signal processing;Convergence;Error correction;Least squares approximation;Least squares methods;Proposals;Signal processing algorithms;Steady-state;Stochastic processes","adaptive filters;gradient methods;least squares approximations","adaptive filter affine combination;complementary filters;convex filter combination;least squares adaptation;least squares problem;mixing parameter;square error;stochastic gradient descent rules","","11","","13","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, we are able to combine uncertain velocity measurements observed at different image scales and positions over time. We arrive at a new recurrent optical flow filter formulated in a dynamic Bayesian network applying suitable factorisation assumptions and approximate inference techniques. The introduction of spatial uncertainty allows for a dynamic and spatially adaptive tuning of the constraining neighborhood. Here, we realize this tuning dependent on the local structure tensor of the intensity patterns of the image sequence.

Scoliosis is complex 3 dimensional deformity of the spine in which the trunk distorts because of the internal spinal deformity. Thus monitoring the distortion in the external torso would be beneficial in tracking important changes and possibly predicting the underlying changes in the internal spine. The technique proposed in this paper, facilitates torso surface assessment and it consists of three stages of digitizing, parameterizing and mapping.

The Monte Carlo sequential estimation on point process enables the decoding directly from the multi-neuron spike trains without constraints on posterior density estimation. However, it poses the problem to bridge the time scale gap between the spike events and the behaviors, and generates stochastic kinematic estimation due to the randomness embedded in the time structure of the spike trains. We propose here a synthetic averaging method to mimic the neural population effects by generating synthetic spike trains from neural recordings and utilizing them as extra model observation. The decoding performance by Monte Carlo SE is averaged in the kinematics domain, which preserves the resolution of the neuron activity and bypasses the possible distortion by nonlinear tuning function due to the binning in spike domain. Tested in simulation and real data, synthetic averaging provides better reconstructions with less NMSE.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685459","","Adaptive filters;Bridges;Decoding;Filtering algorithms;Kinematics;Monte Carlo methods;Neurons;Sampling methods;State estimation;Timing","Monte Carlo methods;brain-computer interfaces;decoding;neural nets","Monte Carlo sequential estimation;binned spike rates;decoding algorithm;motor brain machine interfaces;multineuron spike trains;neural dynamics;neural population effects;point process;posterior density estimation;spike timing resolution;stochastic kinematic estimation;synthetic averaging method","","0","","15","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These three complex-valued vectors have such similarities: 1) despite of resulting from the Fourier transformation, they are not indexed by the frequency bins; 2) its real part and image part are proved to be correlated. Hence, such a complex-valued vector is improper, and the pseudo-autocorrelation matrix of this improper vector exists. Moreover, if components of an improper complex-valued vector are uncorrelated, except the autocorrelation matrix, the pseudo-autocorrelation matrix should also be diagonal.

The monkey was trained during consecutive training sessions in a classical conditioning paradigm in which one stimulus was consistently paired with a fluid reward and another stimulus not. We first look at the flow of activation in the array by examining the non-linear Granger causality between pairs of electrodes. We observe that, as a function of training, the connectivity increases dramatically, for both stimulus types, making it unsuited for discriminating them. We also looked at the LFP amplitudes for both cases and discovered that the electrodes appear in two groups, depending on the similarity of their LFPs. Changes in synchrony between the two stimuli also mostly occur in the connections between the electrodes from the two groups. This provides us with a first set of discriminative features. The spectra of the LFPs showed a difference in the low and high frequency ranges for the two stimuli, which led us to consider specific coefficients of the wavelet decomposition as a second set of discriminative features. Finally, a classifier is constructed based on the feature scores in the 300 ms interval after stimulus onset, and prior to the possible fluid reward (at 400 ms), so as to avoid any influence of the reward. We obtained 80% classification performance from single trials, thus without any averaging.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685472","","Brain;Delay;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Electronic mail;Enterprise resource planning;Frequency synchronization;Laboratories;Psychology;System testing","biomedical electrodes;brain;medical signal processing;network theory (graphs);neural nets;neurophysiology;nonlinear dynamical systems;time series;visual evoked potentials","LFP spectra;V4 visual cortical area;connectivity;electrode array activation flow;local field potential similarity;monkey visual cortex;multielectrode array;nonlinear Granger causality;rhesus monkey;synchrony changes;visual stimuli classification;visual stimuli discrimination;wavelet decomposition coefficients","","0","1","14","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we use Laplacian matrix to represent gene-gene interaction network to regularize the objective function of SVM, which imposes the smoothness of coefficients over the network.

Since the first BIMF provides the highest local spatial variations and/or scales of the image, this BIMF is then processed for obtaining the edge. Binarization and morphological operations are applied as post processing operations to the first BIMF to achieve the desired edge map.

Generalization of two-class separation criteria such as Mahalanobis, Bhattacharya, or Chernoff distance are often done in an ad-hoc fashion. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for multiclass LDR that aim at minimizing upper bounds on the probability of misclassification and are based on generalizations of Chernoff distance for the multiclass problem.

In this paper, a distance likelihood ratio test was discussed and evaluated using simulated data. The distance likelihood ratio test (DLRT) shares several characteristics with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor methods but approaches the use of distance from a different perspective. Results illustrate the ability of the distance likelihood ratio test to approximate the likelihood ratio and compare the DLRT to two other k-neighborhood classification rules that utilize distance-weighting.

However, due principally to both of the limited size and of the microelectronics technology of the used hardware devices, many practical problem can be encountered to reach the real time processing since the application of the ICA algorithm requires the consumption of a huge number of input signal samples. Hence, the system performance was degraded since we required the consumption of an important number of memory circuits with faster hardware execution time. Therefore, in order to improve the hardware performances of the device, in this paper, the authors proposed the sequential processing of one neuron hardware model based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation. Such approach overcomes the interconnections complexities of the FPGA architecture. Thus, an optimal digital circuit design can be proposed to avoid the consumption of much hardware resources in which a maximum number of samples can be handled while maintaining high speed of hardware processing time. The proposed approach was demonstrated through the experimental study of TIMIT data base exhibiting a hardware execution time of 3.3 mus to process 10000 samples with 57 KHz of sample rates to separate two output independent signals from two input mixed signals.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685476","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685476","","Blind source separation;Degradation;Digital circuits;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Independent component analysis;Microelectronics;Signal design;Signal processing;System performance","VLSI;blind source separation;digital signal processing chips;field programmable gate arrays;independent component analysis;integrated circuit design;logic design;neural nets;sequential circuits","FPGA implementation;ICA algorithm;VLSI;digital circuit design;field programmable gate array;independent component analysis;microelectronics technology;neuron hardware model;real-time blind signal separation;sequential processing","","1","","12","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Dogs actively deform their nostrils when they sniff. The air in front of a dog is drawn to the nose by inhalation, and then, ejected backward. This backward jet further induces air currents flowing from the front of the dog to the nose, which assist in collecting odors. To mimic this mechanism, ASNose is equipped with two diaphragm pumps and two gas sensors. Air is sucked through two pipes, and delivered to the two gas sensors. The exhaust of the pumps is expired backward. Moreover, backflows inevitably generated by the diaphragm pumps make air currents flowing in the direction away from ASNose and work like an air curtain.

We discuss the link between the eigenvalues of the reservoir weight matrix and the ESN approximation ability in a simplified ESN case. We propose a new ESN with decoupled reservoir states, in which the neurons in the reservoir are decoupled into single or pairs of neurons.

A low complexity algorithmic solution is established. Constraints that encode a-priori information and several design specifications take the form of multiple intersecting closed convex sets. A cost function and the training data stream create a sequence of closed convex sets in the RKHS. The resulting recursive solution generates a sequence of estimates which converges to such an infinite intersection of closed convex sets. A time-adaptive beamforming task in an RKHS, rich in constraints, is also established. The numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits a significant improvement in resolution, when compared to the classical linear solution, and outperforms a recently unconstrained online kernel-based regression technique.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685451","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685451","","Array signal processing;Constraint theory;Hilbert space;Informatics;Interference constraints;Kernel;Noise cancellation;Recursive estimation;Space technology;Support vector machines","Hilbert spaces;array signal processing;recursive estimation;regression analysis","a-priori information;beamforming paradigm;closed convex set sequence;constrained adaptive learning;cost function;low complexity algorithmic solution;recursive solution;reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces;time-adaptive beamforming task;training data stream;unconstrained online kernel-based regression","","0","","8","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This proposal departs from these approaches, considering that a biologically plausible ANN aims to create a more faithful model concerning the biological structure, properties, and functionalities of the cerebral cortex, not disregarding its computational efficiency. The choice of the models to be considered takes into account two main criteria: the fact they are considered biologically more realistic and the fact they deal with intra and interneuron signaling in electrical and chemical synapses.

However, proper application of these powerful methods would require better understanding of a high-dimensional feature space that is spanned by all these variables. In this work, we investigate methods for visualization of this high-dimensional space and compare different approaches for extracting discriminant features.

The cumulative hazards curve for the neural network model was much closer to the empirical curve in the test data than the one produced by the Cox model. The neural network model showed equal performance to Cox's model in terms of discrimination. However, the neural network model was better than Cox's model in terms of calibration.

However, there is substantial evidence that a phase of MRI image can contain additional useful diagnostic information. For example the phase of MRI image can be used to detect excessive iron accumulation associated with many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzeimerpsilas and Parkinson disease. Phase wrapping and background phase variations are two main problems, which prevent clinical use of phase images directly. In this paper, we propose 2-D technique for phase unwrapping and background phase correction based on spectral image segmentation and detrending algorithms.

The integration of local information in the estimation provides a fast adaptation along with an efficient discrimination between normal and abnormal behavior. The proposed technique is evaluated on both synthetic and real data. Synthetic data simulates different scenarios occurring in road traffic, and illustrates how the model adapts to local conditions.

Determination of the direction of the chemical source is enabled by collecting water samples from different directions. Active flow generation thus serves for extracting desired information from the surrounding chemical concentration field. The development of SPR (surface plasmon resonance) chemical sensors for the crayfish robot is also described.

This paper describes a framework to automate the data analysis and classification of simulation data. First, we propose a new method to identify locations with high density of particles in the space-time domain, based on maximum extremum point detection on the particle distribution. We analyze high density electron regions using a lifetime diagram by organizing and pruning the maximum extrema as nodes in a minimum spanning tree. Second, we partition the multivariate data using fuzzy clustering to detect time steps in a experiment that may contain a high quality electron beam.

The studied DOE problem consists in selecting sequentially the instants where the measures will be done in order to best estimate the systempsilas parameter. The robustness is achieved by considering a statistical representation of the model error defined as the difference between the true ODE and the ODE used in the model. The idea of modeling the model error with a statistical representation has been widely explored in the DOE literature for the identification of static systems. However, there have been little previous works that apply this idea for the identification of dynamic systems. This paper initiates an exploration of this idea in the context of first-order ODE. The model error is modeled by using a kernel-based representation (Gaussian process). A new criterion for the instant selection is constructed and tested on an illustrative example.

Seizure prediction is a major field of neurological research, enabled by statistical analysis methods applied to features derived from intracranial Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings of brain activity. However, no reliable seizure prediction method is ready for clinical applications. In this study, we use modern machine learning techniques to predict seizures from a number of features proposed in the literature. We concentrate on aggregated features that encode the relationship between pairs of EEG channels, such as cross-correlation, nonlinear interdependence, difference of Lyapunov exponents and wavelet analysis-based synchrony such as phase locking. We compare L1-regularized logistic regression, convolutional networks, and support vector machines. Results are reported on the standard Freiburg EEG dataset which contains data from 21 patients suffering from medically intractable focal epilepsy. For each patient, at least one method predicts 100% of the seizures on average 60 minutes before the onset, with no false alarm. Possible future applications include implantable devices capable of warning the patient of an upcoming seizure as well as implanted drug-delivery devices.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2376-7; POD:978-1-4244-2375-0","10.1109/MLSP.2008.4685487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4685487","","Brain;Convolution;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Floors;Machine learning;Prediction methods;Statistical analysis;Support vector machines","Lyapunov methods;biology computing;brain;diseases;drug delivery systems;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","Freiburg EEG dataset;L1-regularized logistic regression;Lyapunov exponents;convolutional networks;epileptic seizure prediction;implanted drug-delivery devices;intracranial EEG;intractable focal epilepsy;machine learning techniques;phase locking;support vector machines;wavelet analysis-based synchrony","","20","","28","","","16-19 Oct. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Despite receiving a great attention, a massive number of applications, and a huge research effort, recognition of handwritten text has not still reached a desired efficiency and is an active area of research. One of the most important factors that makes handwriting recognition a challenging task is the huge variety of writing styles which can not be captured efficiently through available classification methods using current feature descriptors. Our approach to gain performance in online character recognition is to design more representative features for handwritten character representation in order to tackle the huge inter-class variability problem and increase recognition accuracy. The representation can also be used in recognition of other online planar patterns.

These methods constitute a new and emerging theory known as Compressive Sampling (or Compressed sensing). Here, we apply Compressive Sampling to non-negative signals, and propose an algorithm-non-negative under-determined iteratively reweighted least squares (NUIRLS)-for signal recovery.

Accurate segmentation is difficult especially for complicated patterns such as lesions overlapping or touching normal structures, low-contrast lesions, and subtle opacities. With standard segmentation methods, normal structures overlapping or touching lesions are often erroneously included in segmented regions. In addition, normal structures are often segmented erroneously as lesions. Thus, improving the specificity of segmentation methods is very important in the development of a CAD scheme. Our purpose in this study was to develop a supervised lesion segmentation method based on a massive-training artificial neural network (MTANN) filter in a CAD scheme for detection of lung nodules in CT. The MTANN filter was trained with actual nodules in CT images to segment nodules with improved specificity.

Our aim in this paper is to compare several commonly-used sparsity measures according to intuitive attributes that a sparsity measure should have. Sparsity of representations of signals in fields such as blind source separation, compression, sampling and signal analysis has proved not just to be useful but a key factor in the success of algorithms in these areas. Intuitively, a sparse representation is one in which a small number of coefficients contain a large proportion of the energy. In this paper we discuss six properties (robin hood, scaling, rising tide, cloning, bill gates and babies) that we believe a sparsity measure should have. The main contribution of this paper is a table which classifies commonly-used sparsity measures based on whether or not they satisfy these six propositions.
