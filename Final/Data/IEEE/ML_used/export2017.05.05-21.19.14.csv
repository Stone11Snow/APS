The reduction semantics is modified accordingly. A type system for the safe BoCa is given to control the mobility of ambients and the number of threads, and to guarantee that the intended capacity bounds are statically preserved throughout computation.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380727","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380727","","Calculus;Computer errors;Computer science;Control systems;Electronic mail;Interference;Mobile computing;Security;Smart cards;Yarn","calculus of communicating systems;mobile computing","BoCa;calculus of bounded capacity;grave interference;mobile ambient;mobile resource;process calculus","","0","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the main reasons which influence the accuracy of analysis is the existence of overlapping bubbles. An overlapping bubble splitting method is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the convex hull of the overlapping objects is obtained. Secondly, the candidate concavities are founded on the contour of the object in each concave residuum after the iterated search, and then, the departing point pairs of the overlapping bubbles are then obtained by matching based on middle axis (MA). Finally, an optimal splitting conic can be gained by minimum mean square error (MMSE) ellipse fitting with constrains of concavities, which ensures the accuracy of the overlapping area calculation. Experimental results show that the method can split the overlapping bubbles efficiently and improve the accuracy of the bubble characteristic analysis in aerated water flows.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380472","","Automation;Curve fitting;Image analysis;Image processing;Image segmentation;Image sequences;Loss measurement;Object detection;Video sequences;Water","bubbles;curve fitting;error analysis;flow;image matching;iterative methods;least mean squares methods;water","aerated water flow;convex hull;curve fitting;image processing;middle axis;minimum mean square error;overlapping bubble splitting method;overlapping bubbles partition method;quantitative analysis;water characteristic analysis","","1","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the same time, the palmprints have a great deal of different features, such as principal lines, wrinkles, ridges, minutiae points and texture, which can be regarded as multi-scale features.

The algorithm sufficiently demonstrates the idea of parallel, eliminates the redundant proposition levels, and makes the planning graph be much smaller than the classical one. Therefore, the algorithm has excellent performance in terms of time and space. In addition, the algorithm handles the mutual exclusion relationships (mutex) by adopting a novel idea, and the paper have proved that there are no mutex in the planning graph, namely, the algorithm makes the idea of constructing a planning graph without mutex come true.

Firstly, the new approach refines the sensor signals closely associated with the sintering temperature using the attribute reduction theory. Then, it constructs a nonlinear predictive model between those sensor signals and sintering temperature utilizing SVM, and dynamically corrects the SVM predictive model via continuous tracing of the predictive error. Thereby, the anti-interference and the fault-tolerant performances have been improved. Through the comparative experiments between the direct SVM approach and the RS-SVM approach proposed The results show that the RS-SVM approach has superiority in the temperature predictive task of rotary kiln sintering process.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380737","","Fault tolerance;Fires;Kilns;Predictive models;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Set theory;Support vector machines;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors","fault tolerance;kilns;nonlinear control systems;parameter estimation;regression analysis;rough set theory;sintering;support vector machines;thermal variables control","antiinterference;fault-tolerant performance;hybrid RS-SVM dynamic prediction approach;nonlinear predictive model;reduction theory;rotary kiln sintering process;rough sets theory;sensor signal;support vector machine regression","","1","","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A visual language E based on an event-triggered concurrent dataflow (ECDF) model is presented in this paper.

The same as Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, fuzzy hyperbolic model (FHM) is a universal approximator, and can be used to establish the model for unknown complex systems. Furthermore, the main advantage of using FHM over T-S fuzzy model is that no premise structure identification is needed and no completeness design of premise variables space is needed. Also a FHM is a kind of valid global description and nonlinear model in nature. First, the fuzzy hyperbolic model (FHM) is proposed to represent the state-space model for nonlinear continuous-time systems. Next, a nonlinear quadratic cost function is considered as a performance measurement of the closed-loop fuzzy system. Some sufficient conditions are provided for the construction of a fuzzy hyperbolic guaranteed cost controller via state feedback. These conditions are given in terms of the feasibility of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Thus the problem of fuzzy hyperbolic guaranteed cost controller design is converted into linear matrix inequalities problem, which can be efficiently solved using convex optimization techniques, such as the interior point algorithm. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate the design procedure of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382300","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382300","","Control design;Control systems;Cost function;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Linear matrix inequalities;Measurement;Nonlinear control systems;Takagi-Sugeno model;Uncertain systems","continuous time systems;cost optimal control;fuzzy control;linear matrix inequalities;nonlinear control systems;state feedback;uncertain systems","closed loop fuzzy system;convex optimization technique;fuzzy hyperbolic guaranteed cost control;linear matrix inequalities;nonlinear continuous time dynamics system;nonlinear quadratic cost function;parameter uncertainties;state feedback;unknown complex system","","1","","11","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ASMC adapts a kind of hierarchical structure. Firstly the Pendubot system is divided into two subsystems. For each subsystem, we define first-layer sliding plane. From these two first-layer sliding planes, we further define a second-layer sliding plane. Using Lyapunov law, we derive the sliding-mode control law and obtain the adaptive law of the sliding-mode controller's parameters. The control law can drive the system's states to their desired values, and implement anti-disturbance control. The paper also gives a stable analysis about the sub-sliding planes in theory, and the simulation results show the controller's validity and its adaptive abilities for the all kinds of extraneous disturbances.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382310","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382310","","Adaptive control;Asymptotic stability;Automatic control;Control systems;Fuzzy control;Nonlinear control systems;Programmable control;Sliding mode control;Stability analysis;Switches","Lyapunov methods;adaptive control;manipulators;variable structure systems","Lyapunov law;Pendubot;adaptive sliding mode control;antidisturbance control;second layer sliding plane;underactuated manipulator","","6","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many practical semantic annotation cases need multi-ontologies. For the sake of solving the semantic annotation problem based on multi-ontologies, one prevalent approach is extending current ontology or integrating multi-ontologies, but both methods are complex problems which have no good solutions till now. Another approach used distributed description logic to denote multi-ontologies and the subsumption relations between concepts in different ontology with a simple bridge rule, but this approach could not describe more complex relations between multi-ontologies. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to deal with the problem, and we employ a bridge ontology to express the complex relationships between multi-ontologies. The bridge ontology is a peculiar ontology, which can be created and maintained easily, but effective in semantic annotation applications based on multi-ontologies. The approach has the characteristics of low-cost, scalability, robust in the Web circumstance, avoiding the unnecessary ontology extending and integration, and promoting ontology reuse.

Firstly, each input vector is presented to the network to compare with the prototype vector that it most closely matched. If there are not any prototype vectors to match the input pattern, a new prototype is generated to hold it. Then Hebb rule is used to activate neurons simultaneously in the second scanning. If more than two prototype vectors match, the strength of the synapse will increase. After activated neurons in competitive layer stimulate each other, neuron fuzzy graph made up of neurons of competitive layer is formed. Finally, making λ cut graph to get connected components, neurons in the same connected components of λ cut graph export to the same neuron of output layer created currently. Being not sensitive to the input sequence of data and the noises ART existing, it can either hold the former memory, or memorize the new patterns. Web log files mined by this algorithm can dispose noises and get good results of the clusters in users and pages. Not only can it help us to discover the user access patterns effectively, but it can provide the valid decision-making for the Web master to devise the personalized Web site.

The n segments - which are spread across n machines - do not have to be recombined on a single machine to perform a key computation. Since t&Lt;n, the requirement that only t segments are needed inherently provides system reliability. The evaluation shows that the system performance is not impacted by changing t or n.

One popular approach is pruning which means training a larger than necessary network and removing unnecessary weights/nodes. Though pruning is commonly used in architecture learning of neural network, there is still no theoretical framework about it. We give an information geometric explanation of pruning. In information geometric framework, most kinds of neural networks form exponential or mixture manifold which has a natural hierarchical structure. In a hierarchical set of systems, a lower order system is included in the parameter space of a large one as a submanifold. Such a parameter space has rich geometrical structures that are responsible for the dynamic behaviors of learning. The pruning problem is formulated in iterative m-projections from the current manifold to its submanifold in which the divergence between the two manifolds is minimized, and it means meaning the network performance does not worsen over the entire pruning process. The result gives a geometric understanding and an information geometric guideline of pruning, which has more authentic theoretic foundation.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380390","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380390","","Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Electronic mail;Guidelines;Information geometry;Information theory;Mathematical programming;Neural networks;Probability distribution;Solid modeling","artificial intelligence;information theory;iterative methods;neural net architecture","architecture learning;artificial neural network;exponential manifold;information geometry;iterative m-projections;mixture manifold;pruning","","1","","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The watermarking method presented here does not require the use of the original signal for watermark detection. The watermark signal is generated by using a chaotic map and a key. Furthermore, the watermark is embedded in three-layer model, which ensures a more exciting result of ""synchronization"" between the watermark and the video scene and guarantees a more robust watermark. Experimental data show that watermarked video is resistant to several video degradations and distortions.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380517","","Chaos;Copyright protection;Degradation;Humans;Immune system;Layout;Robustness;Signal detection;Signal generators;Watermarking","discrete cosine transforms;synchronisation;video signal processing;visual perception;watermarking","DCT-domain perceptual model;block perceptual feature;chaotic map;copyright protection;human perceptual model;masking coefficients;self-adaptive MPEG video watermarking;synchronization;watermark detection","","2","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus data reconciliation and gross error detection are needed before the measurements can be used successfully. Almost all existing rectification methods are developed on the hypothesis that the measurement errors are normally distributed with zero mean and a known covariance matrix. However the errors are bounded distinctly in nature, whereas normal distribution is unbounded in both sides. A new method for simultaneous steady data reconciliation and gross error detection is presented assuming that the errors are subject to the bounded contaminated normal distribution.

To capture the users' habit of sketching, a dynamic user modeling is adopted to build the user models in an incremental decision tree for each specific user. It can be used to recognize the 'possible shapes' dynamically by means of fuzzy matching based on the visiting frequency of each recorded shape of user models. To capture the user's input intensions, a relevance feedback method, which is widely used in multimedia retrieval, is introduced into the sketch recognition for the first time. It can adjust iteratively the weights of the similarity-based matching of the sketchy shape and refine the recognition results incrementally by the users' explicit feedback.

As a positive protection, intrusion detection system has been successfully applied in wired networks. However, these correlative researches are not fit for mobile ad hoc networks. This paper puts forward a novel architecture based on mobile agent platform for superior intrusion detection in mobile ad hoc networks.

There existed time series, period graph method, neural networks and GM(1,1) of grey system theory to be used to study the motion of ship. A system model is constructed for ship pitch using grey system theory. Not alike GM(1,1), a new method is proposed to handle the residual GM(1,1) of pitch series using the inverse transformation of triangle function. Noticing the multivaluedness of inverse trigonometric function, a monotone increasing series is obtained from the error of pitch prediction with the transformation. Finally, according to the fact that GM(1,1) can simulate the monotone series very well, the GM(1,1) model is constructed for the error series of GM(1,1) model. The numerical results imply that the method is better than residual GM(1,1) model.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380760","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380760","","Computational modeling;Differential equations;Electronic mail;Inverse problems;Marine vehicles;Motion control;Neural networks;Paper technology;Predictive models;Surge protection","grey systems;motion control;ships;time series","grey system theory;inverse transformation;inverse trigonometric function;neural networks;period graph method;pitch motion;residual GM(1,1);ship pitch;time series;triangle function","","0","","3","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
