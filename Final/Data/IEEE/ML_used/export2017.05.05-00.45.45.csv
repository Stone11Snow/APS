Firstly, the assumption is not valid any more that different agents cannot control the same actions which obviously does not fit human commonsense understanding of the world. Secondly, several functions are brought in to make it possible to deal with the relation between agents and actions and the relation between actions and states separately.

Agent technology focuses on the development of concepts, methodologies, and algorithms for autonomous problem solvers that can act flexibly in uncertain and dynamic environments in order to achieve their objectives. We can therefore take advantage of the flexibility and autonomy of agent technology to solve the above mentioned problem. This paper proposes an agent federations (AF) based infrastructure for grid monitoring and discovery (AFBIGMD). AFBIGMD adopts AF as the basic unit of grid M&D and multi-federations from different domains as the whole grid's M&D system. Due to the distributed architecture and agent's mobility, AFBIGMD cannot only implement grid's M&D flexibly, but also relieve the network load efficiently.

Each feedback control law is easy to be designed because it uses only one element of the state variable with a fixed positive or negative feedback gain. For an n-order system, 2n feedback control laws are needed to realize the proposed VS control. The concept of the sliding sector is used in the paper to show that there exists an area for each feedback control law, inside which a Lyapunov function decreases with the control law although the system may not be stabilized by it alone. It is shown that a common Lyapunov function for all control laws exists for a controllable system, i.e., for any state in the state space, there exists at least one control law among those laws mentioned above such that the system state is inside the sliding sector of the system with the corresponding control law. Thus a hybrid-type control rule of the variable structure control system is designed to switch the control input to the control law, which ensures the decrease of the common Lyapunov function.

How to effectively allocate and schedule the grid resources is a challenge for a grid computing system. To the grid service providers, two issues should be addressed to maximize their profits: 1) how to choose the optimal resource combination; 2) how to adjust the resource price under certain resource combination. While most of the existing grid literatures only consider the second problem, this paper focuses on the first one. This paper provides a novel approach to optimize the resource combination in computational grid. By analyzing historical grid trade data, the proposed method can mine the important associations between different kinds of grid resources based on principal component analysis (PCA). Another contribution of this paper is that it attempts to measure the fitness of certain grid resource combination. Moreover, this paper shows how to adjust the grid resource combination when its fitness is not good enough.
