This paper is focused on two types of adaptive critic design, one is action dependent and the other uses an approximation of the plant dynamics. The goal of this paper is to gain insight into the theoretical and practical differences between these two controllers, when applied in an online environment with changing plant dynamics. To investigate the practical differences the controllers are implemented for a model of the general dynamics F-16 and the characteristics of the controllers are investigated and compared to each other by conducting several experiments in two phases. First the controllers are trained offline to control the baseline F-16 model, next the dynamics of the F-16 model are changed online and the controllers will have to adapt to the new plant dynamics. The result from the offline experiments show that the controller with the approximated plant dynamics has a higher success ratio for learning to control the baseline F-16 model. The online experiments further show that this controller outperforms the action dependent controller in adapting to changed plant dynamics","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028069","Adaptive critic designs;Adaptive flight control;Reinforcement learning","Adaptive control;Aerodynamics;Aerospace control;Aerospace engineering;Aerospace simulation;Control systems;Cybernetics;Humans;Machine learning;Programmable control;Testing","adaptive control;aerospace control;learning (artificial intelligence)","adaptive critic design;approximated plant dynamics;general dynamics F-16 model;online adaptive critic flight control;reinforcement learning","","0","","9","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, the Sugeno integral techniques are introduced to solve this problem. At first, the English phonemes that are hard to be distinguished (HDP) from Chinese language learner are collected and are grouped into different HDP sets. Then, the system reliabilities for distinguishing the phonemes within a HDP set are computed based on the standard speech corpus and are integrated with the phoneme recognition results under the Sugeno integral framework. The fuzzy measures are given for each subset of speech segments that contains at least 10 occurrences of phonemes within a same HDP set. Finally, the linguistic evaluation results are given by the Sugeno integral model based on system reliability and fuzzy measures.

First, a simple background subtraction algorithm is utilized to get the binary mask of moving objects. So the motion of every frame is calculated to segment the sequence of surveillance video.

In this paper, we propose a service discovery approach based on the distributed spanning-tree architecture. According to this architecture, we arrange the grid resources in such a hierarchical way as IS layer, institution layer, organization layer and domain layer in turn. Any member at the same layer is equivalent. Only IS layer and Institution layer have real resource entities while other layers over them are overlays to cluster the resource information onto their own delegation nodes (DN). These DNs have the resource index and can locate the query route. Hence, query message traffic is sharply decreased depending on the DN's locating of query routes. Every Institution in grid owns a global unique ID according to the coding mechanism. Based on this, the parallel searching process can be synchronously implemented among peer nodes, which improves the efficiency dramatically. Caching and collaboration units techniques are adopted to increase the efficiency of service discovery. The DN can be replaced by the new elected one when it fails which ensures the survivability of the system.

First, the basic characters and structure frames of this system is introduced. Then, the dynamic clustering algorithms which can dynamically cluster the input training patterns is presented. For each cluster, a fuzzy rule with an ellipsoidal region around a cluster center is defined. The strategy of tuning fuzzy rules is that the slopes of the membership functions are tuned successively until there is no improvement in the recognition rate of the training patterns. The tuning method and the policy of inserting rules and aggregating rules are discussed.

A remarkable character of the framework is that there are two feature extraction processes. The first feature extraction process is performed to transform high dimensional samples into low dimensional data. And, the second feature extraction process is implemented based on the obtained low dimensional data. With the novel framework, the kernel methods become much efficient.
