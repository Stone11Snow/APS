Second, by applying the segmentation result of the leading signal to the other signals, the detailed properties of each segment, including inter-signal relationships, are extracted to form a feature vector. Finally, a fuzzy intelligent system is used to learn diagnostic features from a training set containing feature vectors extracted from signal segments at various vehicle states.

In addition, apart from BBN and SVM, which have not previously used for this task, we have experimented with three well-known machine learning methods (feedforward backpropagation neural networks, learning vector quantization and decision tables), which are also being applied to the task of verb subcategorization frame defection for the first time. We argue that both BBN and SVM are well suited for learning to identify verb subcategorization frames. Empirical results will support this claim. Performance has been methodically evaluated using two different corpora types, one balanced and one domain-specific in order to determine the unbiased behaviour of the trained models. Limited training data are proved to endow with satisfactory results.

However, one of the more difficult concepts to teach in machine component design courses is fatigue analysis of ""real world"" components. These components come with multiple cyclic loads, each with different stress concentrations, which result in mean and alternating stress states. The student then must select a failure criterion to obtain an equivalent stress that can be used in one of several different fatigue failure theories to predict either a safety factor or an estimated life. Without a heuristic to guide the student, these types of analyses are very difficult. The authors have developed a heuristic which consists of a combination of a concept map and flow charts that give a student not only process but also directions for improvement of the analysis. The heuristic is a visual image that is simple and can be readily reproduced in a basic sketch. The visual quality (simple and striking) of these concept maps/flow charts produces ready access to the understanding which students ultimately develop.

These approaches yield global or class-specific measures of map quality by comparing classification results with independent ground-truth data. In most maps, considerable spatial variation is present in the accuracy of land cover labels that is not captured by these statistics. To date, this issue has rarely been addressed in the land cover remote sensing literature. The authors present a method to estimate pixel-scale land cover classification confidence using nonparametric machine learning methods. The method is based on recent theoretical developments from the domains of statistics and machine learning that explain the machine learning technique known as “boosting” as being equivalent to additive logistic regression. As a result, results from classification algorithms that use boosting can be assigned classification confidences based on probability estimates assigned to them using this theory. they test this approach using three different data sets. Their results demonstrate that classification errors tend to have low classification confidence while correctly classified pixels tend to have higher confidence. Thus, the method described in this paper may be used as a basis for providing spatially explicit maps of classification quality. This type of information will provide substantial additional information regarding map quality relative to more conventional quality measures and should be useful to end-users of map products derived from remote sensing","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/36.951086","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=951086","","Boosting;Classification algorithms;Learning systems;Logistics;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Probability;Remote sensing;Statistics;Testing","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;terrain mapping","accuracy assessment;additive logistic regression;boosting;confidence;geophysical measurement technique;image classification;land cover;land cover map;land surface;map quality;nonparametric machine learning;pixel-scale;remote sensing;spatial variation;terrain mapping;vegetation mapping","","58","","70","","","Sep 2001","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To solve this problem, we present an image-based video recognition framework combined with video retrieval and object recognition. To develop an effective combination, we evaluated several retrieval methods and the support vector machine (SVM), which is one of the most popular supervised learning techniques.

Bottou","Facebook AI Research, New York","2015 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data)","20151228","2015","","","1","1","Summary form only given. This presentation illustrates how big data forces change on algorithmic techniques and the goals of machine learning, bringing along challenges and opportunities. 1. The theoretical foundations of statistical machine learning traditionally assume that training data is scarce. If one assumes instead that data is abundant and that the bottleneck is the computation time, stochastic algorithms with poor optimization performance become very attractive learning algorithms. These algorithms quickly became the backbone of large-scale machine learning and are the object of very active research. 2. Increasing the training set size cannot improve average errors indefinitely. However this diminishing returns problem vanishes if we measure instead the diversity of conditions in which the trained system performs well. In other words, big data is not an opportunity to increase the average accuracy, but an opportunity to increase coverage. Machine learning research must broaden its statistical framework in order to embrace all the (changing) aspects of real big data problems. Transfer learning, causal inference, and deep learning are successful steps in this direction.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9926-2; POD:978-1-4799-9927-9","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363712","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363712","","","Big Data;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence)","Big Data;causal inference;deep learning;learning algorithms;statistical machine learning;transfer learning","","","","","","","Oct. 29 2015-Nov. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Texture measures can be used to update land cover maps and enhance classification accuracy. Most previous studies have focussed only on fine resolution data such as Landsat, SPOT and Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. Texture analysis at coarser resolution (250 m) has not been investigated because data are only beginning to become available with the launch of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). To meet the need of global change research, the MODIS instrument is planned to provide global coverage at 250 m resolution in the red and infrared bands. Early warning of human-induced land cover changes, such as urbanization and deforestation, is expected from MODIS. This paper examines whether texture analysis at this scale would be useful for detecting changes. There are at least two issues in using texture analysis: 1) which texture measures should be used, and 2) what window size is most appropriate for capturing textures. In this study we test a large number of texture measures and window sizes on MODIS data simulated from Landsat data using the data mining technique of feature selection","","POD:0-7803-6359-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2000.860336","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=860336","","Image analysis;Image resolution;Image texture analysis;Instruments;MODIS;Remote sensing;Satellites;Size measurement;Synthetic aperture radar;Testing","feature extraction;geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;terrain mapping","IR;change detection;coarse resolution;feature subset selection;geophysical measurement technique;global change;global coverage;human-induced land cover change;image processing;image texture;infrared;land cover;land surface;machine learning;optical imaging;red;remote sensing;terrain mapping;texture feature;visibel","","0","2","18","","","2000","24 Jul 2000-28 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In connection with the processing of measurements in physical/technical applications, tasks like: 1) reconstruction of a time signal or the identification of a physical model from noisy data, 2) prediction of quantities that are rather unobservable using available measurements of related quantities, and 3) data reduction for communication within sensor networks, frequently arise. After the description of some application examples to the tasks mentioned above, powerful tools based on regression techniques will be presented for their solution. Various introductory aspects of linear regression will be considered by using weighted least-squares, including e.g. how the least squares solution can be implemented as an ordinary FIR filter (Savitzky Golay filter) if computationally efficient signal smoothing is required. Since least-squares are often insufficiently robust against measurement outliers, a regularized least-squares criterion motivated by a Bayesian approach is presented and its analogy to more general kernel-based regression techniques is pointed out. Finally, the regularization term is modified such that together with the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm the connection to the currently popular methods of finding so-called sparse representations in signal processing applications becomes apparent.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3720-9; POD:978-1-5090-3721-6; Paper:978-1-5090-3718-6; USB:978-1-5090-3719-3","10.1109/SST.2016.7765620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765620","","","Bayes methods;FIR filters;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;nonparametric statistics;regression analysis;signal reconstruction","Bayesian approach;FIR filter;LASSO algorithm;Savitzky Golay filter;data reduction;kernel-based regression techniques;least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm;linear regression techniques;machine learning;measurement outliers;nonparametric regression methods;parametric regression methods;physical model identification;regularization term;regularized least-squares criterion;sensor networks;signal processing;signal smoothing;sparse representations;time signal reconstruction;weighted least-squares","","","","","","","12-14 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper outlines some previous efforts in developing machines that learn. It sketches the authors's work on statistical learning theory and theoretical results on the problem of classification and function approximation that connect regularization theory and support vector machines. The main application focus is classification (and regression) in various domains-such as sound, text, video and bioinformatics. In particular, the paper describe the evolution of a trainable object detection system for classifying objects-such as faces and people and cars-in complex cluttered images.

ICCV 2001","20020807","2001","2","","674","679 vol.2","Face images are subject to changes in view and illumination. Such changes cause data distribution to be highly nonlinear and complex in the image space. It is desirable to learn a nonlinear mapping from the image space to a low dimensional space such that the distribution becomes simpler tighter and therefore more predictable for better modeling effaces. In this paper we present a kernel machine based approach for learning such nonlinear mappings. The aim is to provide an effective view-based representation for multi-view face detection and pose estimation. Assuming that the view is partitioned into a number of distinct ranges, one nonlinear view-subspace is learned for each (range of) view from a set of example face images of that view (range), by using kernel principal component analysis (KPCA). Projections of the data onto the view-subspaces are then computed as view-based nonlinear features. Multi-view face detection and pose estimation are performed by classifying a face into one of the facial views or into the nonface class, by using a multi-class kernel support vector classifier (KSVC). Experimental results show that fusion of evidences from multi-views can produce better results than using the result from a single view; and that our approach yields high detection and low false alarm rates in face detection and good accuracy in pose estimation, in comparison with the linear counterpart composed of linear principal component analysis (PCA) feature extraction and Fisher linear discriminant based classification (FLDC)","","POD:0-7695-1143-0","10.1109/ICCV.2001.937691","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937691","","Face detection;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Kernel;Lighting;Machine learning;Predictive models;Principal component analysis;Space technology;Support vector machines","face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);motion estimation;principal component analysis","Fisher linear discriminant based classification;data distribution;face detection;image space;kernel machine based learning;low dimensional space;multi-view face detection;nonlinear mapping;pose estimation;principal component analysis;view-based representation","","47","7","41","","","2001","07 Jul 2001-14 Jul 2001","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In conventional machine learning, a lot of research has been focused on a specific method for a specific environment in which models are selected and built generally by using ad hoc methods, ""trial and error"" or solely on ""expert"" knowledge or intuition. As a result, the effectiveness of the models is limited and the research results often do not contribute to the fundamental understanding of the field nor lend themselves to the broader problem domain. The paper aims to provide theoretical foundations as well as useful tools to guide model building and to explain and evaluate model performance by using several information-theoretic measures, namely, entropy, conditional entropy, relative entropy, information gain, and information cost. These measures can characterize the regularity of data set and thus contribute to the data modeling.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1167394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1167394","","Computer science;Costs;Data analysis;Data models;Entropy;Gain measurement;Impurities;Machine learning;Partial response channels;Performance gain","data models;entropy;learning (artificial intelligence)","conditional entropy;data modeling;information cost;information gain;information-theoretic measures;machine learning;model building;relative entropy","","0","","5","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To determine whether these two tests make the same decisions regarding statistical significance, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation using several problems derived from Gaussian distributions, three machine-learning algorithms, ROC analysis, ANOVA, and LABMRMC. Results suggest that the decisions these tests make are not the same, even for simple problems.

As a result, there is rising interest in opportunities to implement ML efficiently in custom hardware. We have designed hardware for one broad class of ML techniques: Inference on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs). In these graphs, labels on nodes encode what we know and “how much” we believe it; edges encode belief relationships among labels; statistical inference answers questions such as “if we observe some of the labels in the graph, what are most likely labels on the remainder?” These problems are interesting because they can be very large (e.g., every pixel in an image is one graph node) and because we need answers very fast (e.g., at video frame rates). Inference done as iterative Belief Propagation (BP) can be efficiently implemented in hardware, and we demonstrate several examples from current FPGA prototypes. We have the first configurable, scalable parallel architecture capable of running a range of standard vision benchmarks, with speedups up to 40X over conventional software. We also show that BP hardware can be made remarkably tolerant to the low-level statistical upsets expected in end-of-Moore's-Law nanoscale silicon and post-silicon circuit fabrics, and summarize some effective resilience mechanisms in our prototypes.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8773-6; POD:978-1-4673-8774-3","10.1109/TEST.2016.7805817","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7805817","","","field programmable gate arrays;graph theory;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","BP hardware;FPGA;ML technologies;PGM;custom hardware;end-of-Moore's-Law;graph node;hardware inference accelerator;iterative belief propagation;low-level statistical upset;machine learning;nanoscale post-silicon circuit;nanoscale silicon circuit;parallel architecture;pixel;probabilistic graphical model;resilience mechanism;statistical inference;video frame rate","","","","","","","15-17 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Big data play an indispensable role not only in a wide range of engineering applications, but also in the cognitive mechanisms of both humans and cognitive robots such as sensation, quantification, qualification, estimation, memory, and reasoning. This keynote lecture presents online big data analytic theories by machine learning as well as knowledge extraction by cognitive robotics. Data, information, knowledge, and intelligence are the four hierarchical layers of cognitive objects in the brain and cognitive systems from the bottom up. It is discovered by the author that, although the cognitive unit of data is bit, that of knowledge is bir, i.e., a binary relation. A resent finding towards big data science is that big data systems in nature are a recursive n-dimensional typed hyperstructure (RNDTHS). This topological property of big data reveals that the mathematical foundation of big data science is underpinned by big data algebra (BDA), which is a denotational mathematical structure for efficiently dealing with the inherited complexities and unprecedented challenges in big data engineering. This leads to a coherent theory for big data modeling, analyses, mining, information elicitation, knowledge extraction, and intelligent generation for cognitive robots. Latest experiments demonstrate that cognitive robots may autonomously transform big data in vast linguistic databases (corpuses) into sophistic knowledge bases by cognitive machine learning.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7753-9; Electronic:978-1-4673-7755-3; POD:978-1-4673-7756-0","10.1109/ICOACS.2016.7563130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7563130","Big data;applications;big data algebra;big data science;cogniitve machine learning;cognitive computing;cognitive informatics;computational intelligence;denotational mathematics;formal concepts;knowledge extraction;knowledge generation;mathematical models;recursively hierarchical hyperstructures","","","","","","","","","","28-29 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A high gain bumpless transfer scheme is described and tested successfully. The experimental results presented show much better performance for the transition between the two learning controllers. Under the current scheme, when the second (packing phase) controller takes over, the IMM system has a significantly smoother control signal and pressure transient than the scheme presented in Havlicsek and Alleyne, (1999).

The approach utilizes boosting, a method of improving classification accuracy using multiple iterations of a classification algorithm. Boosting has been shown to successfully improve classification accuracy, to be resistant to overfitting, and to be effective with remote sensing data. A recent statistical examination of boosting has shown that this algorithm is a form of additive logistic regression. As such, boosting can provide probabilities of class membership. These probabilities of class membership are evaluated as a measure of local classification quality. This approach is shown to be an effective predictor of classification errors and therefore, provides a means of assessing local classification quality","","POD:0-7803-6359-0","10.1109/IGARSS.2000.860337","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=860337","","Boosting;Classification algorithms;Decision trees;Learning systems;Logistics;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Probability;Remote sensing;Training data","geophysical signal processing;geophysical techniques;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;terrain mapping","additive logistic regression;boosting;errors;geophysical measurement technique;image classification quality;land cover;land surface;local classification quality;local estimation;machine learning;multiple iteration;nonparametric algorithm;remote sensing;terrain mapping","","1","","14","","","2000","24 Jul 2000-28 Jul 2000","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is based on a breakdown of knowledge to integrated modules of information. The basic level of breakdown is to be used in education to buildup concepts, while the higher ones are to be used to buildup complex concepts of knowledge, including those of experts. Key to the success of this breakdown is the relational integration of the information leading to the concept under consideration. This approach lends itself smoothly to a unified teaching-learning concept of education. The information handler, being a teacher, a student, or another educational environment, is at the center of this educational model. The main inherent characteristics of this model are extreme flexibility, integration, ease of interaction, and being evolutional. The last leads to the development of the educational environment to grow in complexity, approaching that of an expert, by its own internal behavior and interaction with the information handler. As examples of the proposed UITLM, we discuss its application to computer engineering education and to machine learning.","0190-5848;01905848","POD:0-7803-7444-4","10.1109/FIE.2002.1158632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1158632","","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer science education;Educational institutions;Electric breakdown;Humans;Information analysis;Information processing;Machine learning;Neurons","computer aided instruction;computer science education;learning (artificial intelligence);teaching","computer engineering education;education;information handler;integrated teaching-learning modular approach;knowledge breakdown;machine learning","","1","","26","","","6-9 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This feed-forward part should contain the (stable part of the) inverse of the plant. This inverse is difficult to obtain if non-linear dynamics are present. To overcome this problem, learning feed-forward control can be applied. The properties of the learning mechanism are of importance in this setting. In the paper, a support vector machine is proposed as the learning mechanism. It is shown that this mechanism has several advantages over other learning techniques when applied to learning feed-forward control.

The visual-field sensitivity test is commonly used in a clinical setting to evaluate glaucoma. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is a common computerized visual-field test whose output is amenable to machine learning. We compared the performance of a number of machine learning algorithms with STATPAC indexes mean deviation, pattern standard deviation, and corrected pattern standard deviation. The machine learning algorithms studied included multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and linear (LDA) and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), Parzen window, mixture of Gaussian (MOG), and mixture of generalized Gaussian (MGG). MLP and SVM are classifiers that work directly on the decision boundary and fall under the discriminative paradigm. Generative classifiers, which first model the data probability density and then perform classification via Bayes' rule, usually give deeper insight into the structure of the data space. We have applied MOG, MGG, LDA, QDA, and Parzen window to the classification of glaucoma from SAP. Performance of the various classifiers was compared by the areas under their receiver operating characteristic curves and by sensitivities (true-positive rates) at chosen specificities (true-negative rates). The machine-learning-type classifiers showed improved performance over the best indexes from STATPAC. Forward-selection and backward-elimination methodology further improved the classification rate and also has the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of visual-field location measurements.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2002.802012","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1028420","","Automatic testing;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Magnetic heads;Multilayer perceptrons;Optical receivers;Optical sensors;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","eye;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;multilayer perceptrons;neural nets;neurophysiology;probability;vectors;vision defects","Bayes rule;Parzen window;clinical setting;computerized visual-field test;data probability density;generalized Gaussian;glaucoma diagnosis;machine learning algorithms;mixture of Gaussian;optic nerve head;quadratic discriminant analysis;standard automated perimetry;support vector machine;true-positive rate;visual field;visual-field location measurements number","Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;False Negative Reactions;False Positive Reactions;Glaucoma;Humans;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Optic Nerve Diseases;Perimetry;Predictive Value of Tests;ROC Curve;Sensitivity and Specificity","71","","68","","","Sept. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
