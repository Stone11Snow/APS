We adapt the model selection technique from machine learning to learn the relationship between performance and power. The theoretical results show that the resulting models satisfy convexity properties essential to efficiently determining optimal voltage/frequency operating points for minimizing energy consumption under throughput constraints or maximizing throughput under a given power budget.

Consequently, traffic classification based on machine learning (ML) is now employed. The number of features used in an ML algorithm has a significant impact on performance, in particular accuracy. In this paper, a minimum best feature set is chosen using a supervised method to obtain uncorrelated features. Outlier removal and data normalization is used to reduce the dimensionality. The data projected into the resulting space is then used to construct the classifier input. Finally, the decision tree, artificial neural network and naïve Bayesian single classifier algorithms, and the bagging and boosting ensemble algorithms, are used for traffic classification.

VDIP provides a lightweight robust framework for detecting oncoming, preceding, sideview, and partially occluded vehicles in urban driving. In this paper, we use active learning to train independent-part detectors. A semisupervised approach is used for training part-matching classification, which forms sideview vehicles from independently detected parts. The hierarchical learning process yields VDIP, featuring efficient evaluation and robust performance. Parts and vehicles are tracked using Kalman filtering.

Due to the dramatic growth of these attacks, malware detection has been brought up as an important topic in computer security. Since traditional signature based techniques embedded in commercial anti-viruses have failed to detect new and obfuscated malwares, machine learning algorithms have been used to detect behavior patterns of malwares via features extracted from programs. In this paper, we propose two methods based on compression models as heuristic malware detection techniques. The main advantage of our approach is eliminating the feature extraction step which is vital and expensive for machine learning based approaches. Also, this study focuses on solving the problem of memory space requirement of these models by applying more compatible input data without changing the raw nature of the programs or the compression algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, several experiments are conducted. The experimental results of both methods show promising improvement of accuracy to support the main idea.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6490-4; POD:978-1-4673-6488-1","10.1109/IKT.2013.6620051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6620051","classification;data compression;machine learning;malware detection","Biological system modeling;Classification algorithms;Context;Data models;Feature extraction;Malware;Training","data compression;feature extraction;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","PE header;compression algorithm;compression models;computer security;feature extraction;heuristic malware detection techniques;machine learning;memory space requirement;portable executable files","","1","","26","","","28-30 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the hidden assumptions in IEs is that they propose a change of perspective in the relationships between humans and technology, shifting from a techno-centered perspective to a human-centered one. Unlike current computing systems where the user has to learn how to use the technology, an IE adapts its behavior to the users, even anticipating their needs, preferences, or habits. For this reason, the environment should learn how to react to the actions and needs of the users, and this should be achieved in an unobtrusive and transparent way. In order to provide personalized and adapted services, it is necessary to know the preferences and habits of users. Thus, the ability to learn patterns of behavior becomes an essential aspect for the successful implementation of IEs. This paper presents a system, learning frequent patterns of user behavior system (LFPUBS), that discovers users' frequent behaviors taking into consideration the specific features of IEs. The core of LFPUBS is the learning layer, which, unlike some other components, is independent of the particular environment in which the system is being applied. On one hand, it includes a language that allows the representation of discovered behaviors in a clear and unambiguous way. On the other hand, coupled with the language, an algorithm that discovers frequent behaviors has been designed and implemented. For this reason, it uses association, workflow mining, clustering, and classification techniques. LFPUBS was validated using data collected from two real environments. In MavPad environment, LFPUBS was tested with different confidence levels using data collected in three different trials, whereas in a WSU Smart Apartment environment LFPUBS was able to discover a predefined behavior.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2252892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516530","Ambient intelligence;intelligent environments;machine learning techniques;pattern learning","Ambient intelligence;Intelligent systems;Machine learning;Pattern analysis","ambient intelligence;behavioural sciences;data mining;human factors;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering","LFPUBS;MavPad environment;WSU Smart Apartment environment;adapted services;classification techniques;computing systems;human-centered perspective;intelligent environments;learning frequent pattern of user behavior system;learning layer;personalized services;techno-centered perspective;user actions;user frequent behavior discovery;user habits;user needs;workflow clustering;workflow mining","","8","","36","","20130515","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Face is an acceptable biometric modality because it can be captured from a distance, even without physical contact of the user being identified. Thus the identification or verification does not require cooperation of the user. Recognition systems based on human face are used for a wide variety of applications, due to these benefits. However, the crucial task is still to provide reliable recognition accuracy, but it is a challenging problem under real-world conditions. There have been proposed many methods, but only a few of them are being used in the real-world applications. Even the most recent face recognition algorithms are still facing problems when there is non-ideal imaging, varying illumination, occlusions in the scene or noise of used cameras. We solve these issues within The Next-Generation Hybrid Broadcast Broadband project (HBB-Next) [1]. In this project, we also deal with development of face recognition application, as part of multimodal interface, which will interact with HBB-TV user. In this paper we provide a comparative study of several conventional face recognition methods (PCA a.k.a. Eigenfaces, RBF) and novel kernel methods (KPCA, GDA and SVM) that are suitable to work properly under these conditions. We evaluate the influence of noise and partial occlusion on face recognition accuracy. We are focused on occlusions of eyes and eyebrows as these are the most significant features of a face. Face recognition rates achieved by machine learning methods with accuracy achieved by human perception only are compared. In addition we explore these methods for cases where only a few (up to 4) training samples is available.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2232-4; POD:978-1-4673-2233-1","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625266","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625266","face recognition;machine learning methods;noise;partial occlusion","Eyebrows;Face;Face recognition;Kernel;Noise;Principal component analysis;Support vector machines","biometrics (access control);face recognition;image denoising;support vector machines","Eigenfaces;GDA;HBB-Next;HBB-TV user;KPCA;RBF;SVM;biometric modality;biometric security system;face recognition algorithms;face recognition application;face recognition methods;human face;human perception;kernel methods;multimodal interface;next generation hybrid broadcast broadband project;partial noise;partial occlusion","","2","","26","","","1-4 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Several previously unexplored issues are addressed in this work. For example, only one method may not be good for the binarization of an entire document whereas a particular method may produce desired result for a particular region. Therefore, for a given document image, our model selects a set of one or more binarization techniques suitable for different regions of the document. This selection is completely automatic and guided by the machine learning approaches. Formulation of a completely automatic way for generating the annotated data for training the learning algorithms is also a novel contribution of this work.

In this paper, we built an online robotic arm to extract movement datasets and have used machine learning algorithms to predict robotic arm articulation. For efficient training, small training datasets were used for learning purpose. Classification is used as a scheme to replace prediction-correction approach and to test whether the method can function as a replacement of usual forward kinematics schemes or predictor-corrector methods in directing a remotely controlled robotic articulator.

Their short (18-24) single stranded mature sequences are involved in targeting specific genes. It turns out that experimental methods are limited and that it is difficult, if not impossible, to establish all miRNAs and their targets experimentally. Therefore, many tools for the prediction of miRNA genes and miRNA targets have been proposed. Most of these tools are based on machine learning methods and within that area mostly two-class classification is employed. Unfortunately, truly negative data is impossible to attain and only approximations of negative data are currently available. Also, we recently showed that the available positive data is not flawless. Here we investigate the impact of class imbalance on the learner accuracy and find that there is a difference of up to 50% between the best and worst precision and recall values. In addition, we looked at increasing number of features and found a curve maximizing at 0.97 recall and 0.91 precision with quickly decaying performance after inclusion of more than 100 features.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-0701-4; POD:978-1-4799-0699-4","10.1109/HIBIT.2013.6661685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6661685","class imbalance;data mining;feature selection;machine learning;miRNA gene prediction;microRNA","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;RNA;Testing;Training","RNA;data mining;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations","class imbalance;data mining;gene expression;machine learning methods;miRNA genes;miRNA targets;microRNA gene prediction;noncoding RNA;posttranscriptional modulation","","1","","21","","","25-27 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Providing rehabilitation tasks at a “desirable difficulty” is one of the ways to address this issue and increase the motivation of a patient to continue with the therapy program. Then the problem is to design a system that is capable of estimating the user's desirable difficulty, and ultimately, modifying the task based on this prediction. In this paper we compared the performance of three machine learning algorithms in predicting a user's desirable difficulty during a typical reaching motion rehabilitation task. Different levels of error amplification were used as different levels of task difficulty. We explored the usefulness of using participants' motor performance and physiological signals during the reaching task in prediction of their desirable difficulties. Results showed that a Neural Network approach gives higher prediction accuracy in comparison with models based on k-Nearest Neighbor and Discriminant Analysis methods.","1945-7898;19457898","Electronic:978-1-4673-6024-1; POD:978-1-4673-6021-0","10.1109/ICORR.2013.6650429","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650429","desirable difficulty;error amplification;machine learning;motor performance;physiological signals;robotic reaching exercise;stroke therapy","Accuracy;Medical treatment;Physiology;Robots;Thyristors;Training;Visualization","biomechanics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical robotics;medical signal processing;motion control;neural nets;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;physiology","conventional therapies;discriminant analysis methods;error amplification;k-nearest neighbor methods;machine learning algorithms;neural network approach;physiological responses;physiological signals;rehabilitation exercises;robot-assisted rehabilitation regimens;task difficulty adaptation;therapy program;typical reaching motion rehabilitation task;user motor performance","0","3","","17","","","24-26 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, we propose an algorithm that captures important multi-scale perceptual cues shown to correlate well with intelligibility.

However, someone asking a question may not necessarily know the best way to categorize or tag the question, and automatically tagging or categorizing a question is a challenging task. Since a Q&A site may host millions of questions with tags and other data, this information can be used as a training and test dataset for approaches that automatically suggest tags for new questions.

The explicit context approach is illustrated on the example of Linked Data concept for the structured representation of data on the Web. The implicit context representation is based on contexts defined by natural language structures (words, phrases, paragraphs, documents) and the meaning is defined using semantic categories representing semantically relevant words and phrases in different contexts. Unlike the explicit context approach, which requires an effort of specialized experts, the implicit context approach is based on various kinds of learning, where human support is only needed in supervised learning.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2232-4; POD:978-1-4673-2233-1","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625002","Linked Open Data;Semantic Web;knowledge representation;machine learning;natural languages;semantics","Context;Knowledge representation;Natural languages;Resource description framework;Semantics;Vocabulary","data structures;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;semantic Web","explicit context approach;implicit context approach;knowledge representation techniques;linked data concept;natural language structures;practical semantics approach;semantic categories;semantic problem;semantically relevant phrase representation;semantically relevant word representation;structured data representation;supervised learning","","0","","15","","","1-4 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evolution of computational intelligence can improve many areas in health care including diagnosis, prognosis, screening, etc. The multiclass classification problem is important in data mining applications. Medical datasets are characterized by high dimensionality. Feature selection is considered as the main process to improve classification performance, particularly with the curse of dimensionality. This paper presents a hybrid system that combines the genetic algorithm (GA) and random forest (RF) for diagnosing lymphatic diseases. The genetic algorithm is used as a feature selection technique for reducing the dimension of the lymphatic diseases dataset and RF is used as a classifier. The performance of the proposed GA-RF system is compared with that of other feature selection algorithms combined with RF classifier such as principal component analysis (PCA), ReliefF, Fisher, sequential forward floating search (SFFS), and the sequential backward floating search (SBFS). The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated to measure the prediction performance. The experiments performed show that GA-RF achieved a high classification accuracy of 92.2%.

However, they cannot always reproduce an ideal stroke that they have drawn, because they do not understand how they moved their own hands to draw it. In order to solve this problem, a new learning support system based on presenting the ideal stroking motion of the learner as a teacher's motion is needed so that learners can enhance their own drawing skills. In order to clarify the differences in motion between good and bad drawing strokes as the first step in the development of such a system, this paper analyzes the stroking motions of experts in the process of drawing circles. Several features are exploited, namely, the pen speed, the pen pressure, the time required to draw each quarter circle, and the movement of the hand. With these features, the accuracy of classification using machine learning is 67% on average. This means that stroke speed, pen pressure, and stroke rhythm (which is the specific pattern of changes in speed) may be useful to distinguish between good and bad strokes.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5071-8; POD:978-1-4799-2136-2","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2013.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630376","classification;drawing;machine learning;motion learning support system","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Graphics;Haptic interfaces;Painting;Rhythm;Software","computer aided instruction;humanities;learning (artificial intelligence)","circle drawing;drawing circle processing;drawing skills;drawing strokes;hand movement;learning support system;machine learning;pen pressure;pen speed;quarter circle;stroke rhythm;stroke speed;stroking motion analysis;teacher motion","","1","","15","","","Aug. 31 2013-Sept. 4 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that this method can be viewed as a combination of filtered backprojection steps, and, therefore, has a relatively low computational cost.

We derive a cost function for optimizing feature selection that simultaneously trades off between these two competing criteria. Furthermore, we develop an efficient algorithm that optimizes this cost function and test the algorithm on a set of 34 dysarthric and 13 healthy speakers.

Given a set of challenge-response pairs (CRPs) of a Strong PUF, the goal of our attacks is to construct a computer algorithm which behaves indistinguishably from the original PUF on almost all CRPs. If successful, this algorithm can subsequently impersonate the Strong PUF, and can be cloned and distributed arbitrarily. It breaks the security of any applications that rest on the Strong PUF's unpredictability and physical unclonability. Our method is less relevant for other PUF types such as Weak PUFs. The Strong PUFs that we could attack successfully include standard Arbiter PUFs of essentially arbitrary sizes, and XOR Arbiter PUFs, Lightweight Secure PUFs, and Feed-Forward Arbiter PUFs up to certain sizes and complexities. We also investigate the hardness of certain Ring Oscillator PUF architectures in typical Strong PUF applications. Our attacks are based upon various machine learning techniques, including a specially tailored variant of logistic regression and evolution strategies. Our results are mostly obtained on CRPs from numerical simulations that use established digital models of the respective PUFs. For a subset of the considered PUFs-namely standard Arbiter PUFs and XOR Arbiter PUFs-we also lead proofs of concept on silicon data from both FPGAs and ASICs. Over four million silicon CRPs are used in this process. The performance on silicon CRPs is very close to simulated CRPs, confirming a conjecture from earlier versions of this work. Our findings lead to new design requirements for secure electrical Strong PUFs, and will be useful to PUF designers and attackers alike.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2013.2279798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6587277","Physical unclonable functions;cryptanalysis;machine learning;physical cryptography","Computer security;Cryptography;Delays;Machine learning;Numerical models;Protocols","application specific integrated circuits;cryptography;evolutionary computation;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis","ASIC;CRP;FPGA;PUF design;PUF modeling attacks;Strong PUF application;Strong PUF unpredictability;XOR Arbiter PUF;challenge-response pairs;computer algorithm;digital model;evolution strategy;feed-forward arbiter PUF;lightweight secure PUF;logistic regression;machine learning technique;numerical modeling attacks;numerical simulation;physical unclonability;physical unclonable functions;ring oscillator PUF architecture;secure electrical Strong PUF;security;silicon data;standard Arbiter PUF","","50","","51","","20130827","Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the high-dimensionality and complexity of the data, it is impossible to analyze it manually. Therefore machine learning techniques play an important role in dealing with such data. In this paper we propose to use a one-class approach to classifying microarrays. Unlike canonical classifiers, these models rely only on objects coming from single class distributions. They distinguish observations coming from the given class from any other possible states of the object, that were unseen during the classification step. While having less information to dichotomize between classes, one-class models can easily learn the specific properties of a given dataset and are robust to difficulties embedded in the nature of the data. We show, that using one-class support vector machines can give as good results as canonical multi-class classifiers, while allowing to deal with imbalanced distribution and unexpected noise in the data. To cope with high dimensionality of the feature space, we propose to form an ensemble, based on Random Subspace and prune it with the usage of diversity measure. Experimental investigations, carried on public datasets, prove the usefulness of the proposed approach.","","Electronic:978-83-60810-52-1; POD:978-1-4673-4471-5; USB:978-83-60810-53-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6643980","bioinformatics;classifier ensembles;high dimensionality;machine learning;microarray analysis;multiple classifier systems;one-class classification","Accuracy;Breast cancer;Kernel;Noise;Support vector machines;Training","bioinformatics;data analysis;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","biology;data complexity;data noise;dataset property learning;diversity measure;gene microarray;high-throughput technique;imbalanced distribution;machine learning technique;medicine;microarray classification;one-class support vector machines;protein chips;pruning;random subspace;single class distribution","","0","","26","","","8-11 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This remains true even if all subcarriers use a common modulation and coding scheme (MCS). Link adaptation, which here shall be understood as the process of adapting the MCS in order to maximize goodput, therefore remains a major challenge. Non-parametric learning is an elegant way to evade the lack of robust analytical models. Learning from multidimensional features is particularly interesting because one-dimensional features can characterize frequency-selective channels only roughly. However, most of the literature discusses methods that are not truly online. Either the computational costs become unbearable over time or the method saturates and effectively stops learning. The modified k nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) seems to be the only exception currently. However, k-NN has well-known weaknesses in learning from small sample sets. Two adaptive kernel regression (AKR) methods are therefore proposed instead. Simulation results are reported for a setup in which several practically relevant conditions that have been mostly ignored in previous studies using multidimensional features (imperfect channel knowledge, Doppler shift, feedback delay, collisions) are modeled.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-0356-6; POD:978-1-4799-0357-3; USB:978-1-4799-0355-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6638641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6638641","Link adaptation;Machine learning algorithms;OFDM;Unsupervised learning;Wireless communication","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Kernel;Modulation;OFDM;Prediction algorithms;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless communication","Doppler shift;OFDM modulation;frequency selective surfaces;modulation coding;regression analysis;wireless channels","AKR;Doppler shift;PER;adaptive kernel regression;bit-interleaved coded modulation;coding scheme;common modulation;feedback delay;frequency selective channels;imperfect channel knowledge;k nearest neighbors;k-NN;link adaptation;multidimensional features;nonparametric learning;one-dimensional features;packet error rate;wireless BICM-OFDM systems","","4","","32","","","26-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, ensuring such assumptions demands a lot of work from security experts which is precisely what they wanted to avoid. It seems that most of current intrusion detection approaches have focused on obtaining high detection accuracy leaving aside the goal of reducing human interaction during intrusion detection process. In this work we propose a prototype for a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) based on machine learning techniques. In opposition to other approaches, we focused on reducing the human effort in the generation of network traffic model and further adjustments, while keeping accuracy within acceptable levels. Prototype relays on a hybrid detection and evolutionary summarizing schemes The viability of the two schemes has been confirmed trough experiments considering different attack distributions and types.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1429-6; POD:978-1-4799-1425-8","10.1109/IDAACS.2013.6663006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6663006","Genetic Algorithms;Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning","Genetic algorithms;IP networks;Intrusion detection;Measurement;Sociology;Statistics","computer network security;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic","attack distributions;attack types;evolutionary summarizing scheme;human effort reduction;hybrid detection scheme;machine learning techniques;network intrusion detection;network traffic model generation;prototype relays","","1","","13","","","12-14 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this issue, we design an interneural computing machine (INCM) made of plastic random interneural connections. We develop a mechanical way to measure collective ensemble firing of neurons in INCM. Two sorts of plasticity operators are derived from the measure of synchronous neural activity and the measure of self-sustaining neural activity, respectively. Such plasticity operators conduct activity-dependent operation to modify the network structure of INCM. The activity-dependent operation meets the neurobiological perspective of Hebbian synaptic plasticity and displays the tendency toward circulation breaking aiming to control neural population dynamics.

The open-source system is implemented in the graphic programming languages Pure Data (PD) and Max MSP, and aims to work with a large variety of drum sets. We evaluated its performance on a database of audio samples generated from a well known collection of midi drum loops randomly matched with a diverse collection of drum sets. Both of the evaluation stages, testing and validation, show an improvement in the performance when using the instance filtering algorithm.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-0356-6; POD:978-1-4799-0357-3; USB:978-1-4799-0355-9","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637641","drum transcription;feature-based classification;machine learning;real-time audio;signal processing","Hybrid fiber coaxial cables;Labeling;Open source software;Real-time systems;Signal processing algorithms;Testing;Training","filtering theory;musical instruments;programming languages;public domain software;signal classification","KNN;Max MSP;Pure Data;audio samples generation;bass drum;feature-based K-nearest neighbor classifier;graphic programming languages;hi-hat cymbals;instance filtering;midi drum loops;open-source drum transcription;real-time audio;snare drum;sub-band onset detection","","0","","19","","","26-31 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new method for estimating sentiment and/or emotion expressed in social media which addresses the challenges associated with Web-based analysis. We formulate the problem as one of text classification, model the data as a bipartite graph of documents and words, and construct the sentiment/emotion classifier through a combination of semi-supervised learning and graph transduction. Interestingly, the proposed approach requires no labeled training documents and is able to provides accurate text classification using only a small lexicon of words of known sentiment/ emotion. The classification algorithm is shown to outperform state of the art methods on a benchmark task involving sentiment analysis of online consumer product reviews. We illustrate the utility of the approach for security informatics through two case studies, one examining the possibility that online sentiment about suicide bombing predicts bombing event frequency, and one investigating public sentiment about vaccination and its implications for population health and security.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5062-6; POD:978-1-4799-0775-5","10.1109/EISIC.2013.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657124","emotion;machine learning;security informatics;sentiment;social media;text analysis","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Media;Security;Standards;Training","Internet;content management;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security;social networking (online);text analysis","Web-based analysis;bombing event frequency;documents bipartite graph;emotion estimation;graph transduction;online consumer product reviews;population health;public opinion;security informatics;semisupervised learning;sentiment analysis;sentiment estimation;sentiment-emotion classifier;social media content analysis;suicide bombing;text classification;vaccination;word bipartite graph","","2","","33","","","12-14 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To tackle this problem, we propose an effective unsupervised label refinement (ULR) approach for refining the labels of web facial images using machine learning techniques. We formulate the learning problem as a convex optimization and develop effective optimization algorithms to solve the large-scale learning task efficiently. To further speed up the proposed scheme, we also propose a clustering-based approximation algorithm which can improve the scalability considerably.

This paper presents a novel approach for the task, which performs clustering based on Random Forest (RF) proximities instead of Euclidean distances. The approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we derive a proximity measure for each pair of data points by performing a RF classification on the original data and a set of synthetic data. In the next step, we perform a K-Medoids clustering to partition the data points into K groups based on the proximity matrix. Evaluations have been conducted on real-world Internet traffic traces and the experimental results indicate that the proposed approach is more accurate than the previous methods.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-4673-3122-7; POD:978-1-4673-3120-3; USB:978-1-4673-3121-0","10.1109/ICC.2013.6654829","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654829","Clustering;Machine Learning;Traffic Analysis","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Radio frequency;Telecommunication traffic","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;statistics;telecommunication traffic","Euclidean distances;ML techniques;RF classification;RF proximities;k-medoids clustering;machine learning techniques;network traffic clustering;proximity matrix;proximity measure;random forest proximities;real-world Internet traffic traces;statistics-based network traffic classification;unlabeled traffic data;unsupervised clustering algorithms","","1","","28","","","9-13 June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions.

This paper presents all the adequacy measures that have been proposed in the load profiling related literature. Some of these measures show unstable behavior while the number of the output clusters increases. Hence, they are not suitable for defining the optimal number of clusters.

Experiment results show that our method is intuitive and comprehensive by using SVM based multi-index evaluation, and can position issue accurately according to the three new indexes.","2162-1233;21621233","Electronic:978-1-4799-0698-7; POD:978-1-4799-0696-3; USB:978-1-4799-0697-0","10.1109/ICTC.2013.6675313","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675313","Support Vector Machine;bus arrival time prediction;machine learning;multi-index evaluation","","support vector machines;transportation","SVM;bus arrival time prediction;bus arrival time real-time prediction;multiindex evaluation method;public transport service;support vector machine","","0","","15","","","14-16 Oct. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While there can be a lot of network performance level factors considered to generate subgraphs for efficient and timely delivery of data. ISA 100.11a specification doesn't specifies a graph generation algorithm to generate subgraphs for a network. Hence, numerous efforts can be found where the research community has taken initiative in proposing subgraphs considering factors affecting the performance of the network. Subgraphs which are optimal at a particular instance of time may not prove to be effective after a certain time period. Therefore, there is a need to update the subgraphs in the network based on the history of the network performance parameters accumulated over a certain time period which will not necessarily regenerate the subgraphs in the network based on the history will penalize the subgraphs which degrade the performance of the applications using the subgraph. Q-learning mechanism is a lightweight mechanism which works on the idea of rewarding an action considered good for environment.

On the other hand, benign web pages evolve to improve content rendering and interaction with users. Consequently, the onceprecise detection techniques suffer from limitations to cope with the evolution, resulting in malicious web pages that escape detection. In this paper, we present EINSPECT, an evolution-aware and learning-based approach to address evolution of web page artifacts to more precisely analyze and detect malicious web pages. EINSPECT continuously tunes its detection models to automatically decide the best interplay of features and learning algorithms to embrace the evolution of web page artifacts into the analysis and detection.

Heart, being a magnificent pump, has his performance orchestrated via a group of valves and highly sophisticated neural control. While the kinetics of the heart is accompanied by sound production, sound waves produced, by the heart, are reliable diagnostic tools to check heart activity. Chronologically, several data sets have been put forward to sneak on the heart performance and lead to medical intervention whenever necessary. The heart sounds data set, utilized in this paper, provides researchers with abundance of sound signals that was classified using different classification algorithms; decision tree, rotation forest, random forest are few to mention. This paper proposes an approach based on local transfer function classifier as a new model of neural networks for heart valve diseases detection. In order to achieve this objective, and to increase the efficiency of the predication model, boolean reasoning discretization algorithm is introduced to discretion the heart signal data set, then the rough set reduction technique is applied to find all reducts of the data which contains the minimal subset of attributes that are associated with a class label for classification. Then, the rough sets dependency rules are generated directly from all generated reducts. Rough confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the predicted reducts and classes. Finally, a local transfer function classifier was employed to evaluate the ability of the selected descriptors for discrimination whether they represent healthy or unhealthy.

As a result, issue trackers are often full of duplicate issues and bugs, and bug triaging is time consuming and error prone. Many researchers have approached the bug-deduplication problem using off-the-shelf information-retrieval tools, such as BM25F used by Sun et al. In our work, we extend the state of the art by investigating how contextual information, relying on our prior knowledge of software quality, software architecture, and system-development (LDA) topics, can be exploited to improve bug-deduplication.

The challenge that we aim to solve is finding the eyes on faces expressing emotions - this is extremely difficult because the shape of the facial features changes drastically when the subject goes through an emotional state. We attempt to solve this challenge by looking for eye patterns in an image and categorizing them using neural network classification approaches. The image features used are integral projections encoded by TESPAR method, thus reducing the dimensionality of the problem to vectors of 60 elements - we observed that the network classification ability becomes more robust on input samples computed in this manner and the computational complexity is lowered, such that the system gets closer to making real-time decisions.

Often a representation that reflects the internal structure of the managed system is used to reason about its characteristics and make the appropriate adaptation decisions. However, runtime conditions can radically change the internal structure in ways that were not accounted for during their design. As a result, unanticipated changes at runtime that violate the assumptions made about the internal structure of the system could degrade the accuracy of the adaptation decisions. We present an approach for engineering self-adaptive software systems that brings about two innovations: 1) a feature-oriented approach for representing engineers' knowledge of adaptation choices that are deemed practical, and 2) an online learning-based approach for assessing and reasoning about adaptation decisions that does not require an explicit representation of the internal structure of the managed software system. Engineers' knowledge, represented in feature-models, adds structure to learning, which in turn makes online learning feasible. We present an empirical evaluation of the framework using a real-world self-adaptive software system.

Accurate prediction of proline cis-trans isomerization is of great importance for the understanding of protein folding, splicing, cell signaling, and transmembrane active transport in both the human body and animals. Our goal is to develop a state-of-the-art proline cis-trans isomerization predictor with a biophysically-motivated consensus model through the use of evolutionary information only. The current computational predictors of proline cis-trans isomerization achieve about 70-73% accuracies through the use of evolutionary information as well as predicted protein secondary structure information. However, our methods that utilize support vector machine (SVM) and tree-based consensus model have achieved 76.72% and 81.5% accuracies, respectively, on the same proline dataset.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4979-8; POD:978-1-4799-1372-5","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650918","consensus modeling;machine learning;proline cis-trans isomerization","Accuracy;Amino acids;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Proteins;Support vector machines;Vegetation","biology computing;cellular biophysics;molecular biophysics;proteins;support vector machines;tree data structures","SVM;biophysically-motivated consensus model;cell signaling;proline cis-trans isomerization prediction;proline dataset;protein folding;protein folding rate-determining steps;protein secondary structure information prediction;protein splicing;support vector machine;transmembrane active transport;tree-based consensus model","","0","","29","","","20-24 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

From human perspective, it is difficult to read all the opinions and summarize them which require an automated and faster opinion mining to classify the reviews. In this paper different features namely, N-gram features, POS based features and features based on the lexicon SentiWordNet, have been investigated. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier has been modeled with presence as feature representation for classification of the reviews into positive and negative classes thereby identifying the best feature combination. Results of Experiments conducted on smart phone reviews for different feature combinations have been presented. A highest accuracy up till 92% and 95% has been obtained for small and large datasets, respectively.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-6217-7; POD:978-1-4799-1664-1","10.1109/ICACCI.2013.6637154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637154","Machine Learning;Online reviews;Opinion mining;SentiWordNet;Sentiment analysis","Accuracy;Cameras;Feature extraction;Speech;Support vector machines;Tagging;Training","Web sites;consumer behaviour;pattern classification;support vector machines","N-gram features;POS based features;SVM;Websites;best feature combination;customer reviews;future customers;lexicon SentiWordNet;microblogs;sentiment analysis;smart phone reviews;support vector machine classifier","","2","","17","","","22-25 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The segmentation of the load curves corresponds to a clustering procedure, i.e. the grouping of load curves that are more similar to each other than those of another group. The interpretation of the clustering effectualness is done with a set of validity indicators or adequacy measures. The present study deals with the presentation and the examination of all clustering validity indicators that have been proposed in the load profiling literature. These indicators utilize the Euclidean distance as metric to address the similarity of the load curves that belong to the same cluster. The authors examine the behavior of the validity indicators by taking into account other metrics like the Manhattan and the Chebychev distances. This leads to a new definition of the adequacy measures that have been proposed in the literature.","2155-5516;21555516","Electronic:978-1-4673-6392-1; POD:978-1-4673-6391-4; USB:978-1-4673-6390-7","10.1109/PowerEng.2013.6635792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6635792","Adequacy measures;Cluster validity;Unsupervised machine learning;load profiling","Clustering algorithms;Energy measurement;Euclidean distance;Indexes;Power engineering;Vectors","demand side management;pattern clustering;power engineering computing;unsupervised learning","Chebychev distances;Euclidean distance;Manhattan distances;clustering validity indicators;consumer category;demand side management;load curve segmentation;load profiling procedure assessment;unsupervised machine learning","","1","","9","","","13-17 May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A plethora of different trace ability recovery approaches use information retrieval techniques, which depend on the quality of the textual information in requirements and software artifacts. Not only is it important that stakeholders use meaningful names in these artifacts, but also it is crucial that the same names are used to specify the same concepts in different artifacts. Unfortunately, the latter is difficult to enforce and as a result, software trace ability approaches are not as efficient and effective as they could be - to the point where it is questionable whether the anticipated economic and quality benefits were indeed achieved. We propose a novel and automatic approach for expanding corpora with relevant documentation that is obtained using external function call documentation and sets of relevant words, which we implemented in Trace Lab. We experimented with three Java applications and we show that using our approach the precision of recovering trace ability links was increased by up to 31% in the best case and by approximately 9% on average.","1063-6773;10636773","Electronic:978-0-7695-4981-1; POD:978-1-4673-5218-5","10.1109/ICSM.2013.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6676903","API call;machine learning;software traceability","Documentation;Educational institutions;Java;Semantics;Software;Vectors;Vocabulary","information retrieval;software engineering;system documentation","Java applications;TraceLab;external function call documentation;information retrieval techniques;relevant documentation;software artifacts;software traceability enhancement;textual information quality","","8","","48","","","22-28 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Both can quickly and accurately predict the 3D positions of body joints from a single depth image without using any temporal information. The key to both approaches is the use of a large, realistic, and highly varied synthetic set of training images. This allows us to learn models that are largely invariant to factors such as pose, body shape, field-of-view cropping, and clothing. Our first approach employs an intermediate body parts representation, designed so that an accurate per-pixel classification of the parts will localize the joints of the body. The second approach instead directly regresses the positions of body joints. By using simple depth pixel comparison features and parallelizable decision forests, both approaches can run super-real time on consumer hardware. Our evaluation investigates many aspects of our methods, and compares the approaches to each other and to the state of the art. Results on silhouettes suggest broader applicability to other imaging modalities.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.241","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6341759","Computer vision;depth cues;games;machine learning;pixel classification;range data","Cameras;Feature extraction;Human factors;Pose estimation;Rendering (computer graphics);Shape analysis","pose estimation;shape recognition","body shape;consumer hardware;efficient human pose estimation;field-of-view cropping;imaging modalities;per-pixel classification;single depth images;synthetic set;temporal information;training images","0","77","2","60","","20121110","Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
