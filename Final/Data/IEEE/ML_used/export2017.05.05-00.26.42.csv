This attribute has resulted in a wide variety of machine learning applications for k-NN graphs, for e.g., density estimation, manifold learning and non-parametric classification. For samples with finite support, our analysis shows that k-NN density estimators behave differently in the interior of the support as opposed to near the boundary of the support. Motivated by our analysis, we propose improving the behavior of k-NN graphs by thinning its edges near the boundary.

Core Java is unique in that functional forms for regression analysis are expressed as first-class citizens, i.e., as Java programs, in which some parameters are not a priori known, but need to be learned from training sets provided as input. Typical applications of Core Java include calibration of parameters of computational processes, described as OO programs. If-then-else statements of Java language are naturally adopted to create piecewise functional forms of regression. Thus, minimization of the sum of least squared errors involves an optimization problem with a search space that is exponential to the size of learning set. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial restructuring algorithm which guarantees learning optimality and furthermore reduces the search space to be polynomial in the size of learning set, but exponential to the number of piece-wise bounds.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708972","Combinatorial Restructuring;Object-Oriented Programming;Piecewise Regression","Complexity theory;Java;Linear regression;Optimization;Search problems;Spline;Training","Java;combinatorial mathematics;least squares approximations;parameter estimation;piecewise linear techniques;regression analysis","CoReJava;combinatorial restructuring algorithm;least squared errors;object-oriented programs;optimal regression algorithm;optimization;parameter estimation;piecewise functions;programming language Java","","2","","8","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Services include supplies replenishment, maintenance, repair, and use reporting. Customers are billed per page printed. Data are collected from a network of devices to facilitate management. The number of pages printed per device must be accurately counted to fairly bill the customer. Software errors, hardware changes, repairs, and human error all contribute to “meter reads” that are exceptionally high and are apt to be challenged by the customer were they to be billed. Account managers periodically review data for each device in an account. This process is tedious and time consuming and an automated solution is desired. Exceptional print volumes are not always salient and detecting them statistically is prone to errors owing to nonstationarity of the data. Mean levels and variances change over time and usage is highly auto correlated which precludes simple detection methods based on deviations from an average background. A solution must also be computationally inexpensive and require little auxiliary storage because hundreds of thousands of streams of device data must be processed. We present an algorithm and system for online detection of extreme print volumes that uses dynamic linear models (DLM) with variance learning. A DLM is a state space time series model comprising a random mean level system process and a random observation process. Both components are updated using Bayesian statistics. After each update, a forecasted value and its estimated variance are calculated. A read is flagged as exceptionally high if its value is highly unlikely with respect to a forecasted value and its standard deviation. We provide implementation details and results of a field test in which error rate was decreased from 26.4% to 0.5% on 728 observed meter reads.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708894","Dynamic linear models;Kalman filter;online filtering;state space models","Computational modeling;Data models;Equations;Mathematical model;Printers;Robustness;Time series analysis","Bayes methods;DP management;cost reduction;customer services;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);printing;random processes;time series","Bayesian statistics;adaptive model;automated solution;auxiliary storage;dynamic linear model;extreme print volume detection;help center;human error;managed print service;online detection;random mean level system;random observation process;software error;state space time series;variance learning","","0","2","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some computational methods predict protein functions by aligning to homologous proteins with known functions, but they fail to work if such homology cannot be identified. In this paper we classify enzymes/non-enzymes using non-alignment features. We propose a new ensemble method that includes three support vector machines (SVM) and two k-nearest neighbor algorithms (k-NN) and uses a simple majority voting rule. The test on a data set of 697 enzymes and 480 non-enzymes adapted from Dobson and Doig shows 85.59% accuracy in a 10-fold cross validation and 86.49% accuracy in a leave-one-out validation.

This report argues that the agent-based identification is appropriate to this modelling issue. Although there were many predecessor approaches, which tried to design formal models of manufacturing processes, all of them fell short of the data based identification of complex systems, like paper manufacturing: complex systems consisting of continuous and discrete parts, called hybrid manufacturing systems. This paper focuses on the system identification with agent based evolutionary computation using a local optimization kernel. It presents the system architecture and introduces a data based identification method with different local optimization algorithms.

As non-negative matrix factorization, it treats symmetrically the two sets, and the estimation of associated parameters requires a variational approximation. In this paper we focus on continuous data matrix without restriction to non negative matrix. We propose a parsimonious mixture model allowing to overcome the limits of the latent block model.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.33","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708830","Co-clustering;EM algorithm;mixture model","Adaptation model;Approximation methods;Clustering algorithms;Data models;Matrix decomposition;Partitioning algorithms;Symmetric matrices","matrix algebra;pattern clustering","adapted block latent models;binary data;continuous data matrix;cooccurrence matrix;homogeneous blocks;model-based co-clustering;parsimonious mixture model","","2","","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper contains the results of a comparison of three different cancers (breast, colon, and lung) based on the results of feature selection techniques on a data set created from DNA micro array data consisting of samples from all three cancers. The data was run through a set of eighteen feature rankers which ordered the genes by importance with respect to a targeted cancer. This process was repeated three times, each time with a different target cancer. The rankings were then compared, keeping each feature ranker static while varying the cancers being compared. The cancers were evaluated both in pairs and all together, for matching genes. The results of the comparison show a large correlation between the two known hereditary cancers, breast and colon, and little correlation between lung cancer and the other cancers.

Biochemical networks are often represented as directed graphs in which vertices represent chemical compounds and edges represent chemical reactions between compounds. Therefore, a biochemical longest feedback loop can be formulated as the longest cycle in a directed graph. Because finding the longest cycle in a directed graph is NP-hard, in this paper, we proposed an intelligent heuristic algorithm to find the longest cycle in a directed graph. We tested the algorithm on both randomly generated complex networks and real biochemical networks extracted from the KEGG database. The results showed that our algorithm is able to find more than 70% of the real longest cycles in the 200 randomly generated complex networks and also can find the feedback loop in the longest pathway. Compared with the traditional breadth first search pathway finding algorithm, the search efficiency of the proposed algorithm has been improved dramatically. Among the feedbacks found from the KEGG database using the proposed algorithm, the longest feedback includes 8 compounds, 9 reactions, and 6 pathways across different modules.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.81","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708879","","Algorithm design and analysis;Biological systems;Complex networks;Compounds;Databases;Feedback loop;Heuristic algorithms","biology;chemical reactions;computational complexity;directed graphs;search problems;vertex functions","KEGG database;NP-hard;biochemical feedback loop analysis;biochemical longest feedback loop;chemical compound;chemical reaction;complex network;directed graph;intelligent heuristic algorithm;longest cycle;longest pathways;search efficiency;systems biology;vertex","","0","","26","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indeed, the analysis of the coordination patterns can help clinician to establish patient diagnosis and to choose a treatment. The coordination patterns used in this article were obtained from the Continuous Relative Phase (CRP) measure in the sagittal plane. The CRP correlates angle positions and velocity of two segments, i.e. parts of the patient leg, over each phase of the gait cycle. Thigh-shank and shank-foot CRPs were measured for 66 hemiparetic patients, 27 healthy subjects and 14 patients pre and post treatment. CRPs signals are classified using a multi-classifier. This classification permits to discriminate gait patterns for hemiparetic and healthy subjects. The multi-classifier is based on a structural and a statistical approaches used in parallel. The structural part of the proposed hybrid method keeps links between the data issued from CRPs and the statistical part converts CRPs into spatial scalar parameters. Then, using a similarity measure this approach permits to quantify the global gait coordination improvement of patients after a therapeutic treatment. The proposed approach uses only interpretable parameters in order to let the classification results be physically understandable.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708889","clinical application;dynamic patterns;multi-classifier;patterns evolution","Approximation error;Classification algorithms;Databases;Humans;Motion segmentation;Pattern recognition;Weight measurement","gait analysis;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;patient treatment;pattern classification;signal classification;statistical analysis","continuous relative phase;gait cycle;gait pattern;hemiparetic patient gait coordination;hybrid multiclassifier;intersegmental coordination pattern;patient diagnosis;patient leg;patient treatment;sagittal plane;shank-foot CRP;signal classification;spatial scalar parameter;statistical approach;therapeutic treatment;thigh-shank CRP","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Towards this goal, prediction systems have been developed to deduce the susceptibility of a given HIV genotype to a single drug. Many are rule-based systems or rely on hand-crafted features which are difficult to update for HIV strains and new drugs. We adapted the vector-of-n-grams approach from document classification and chi-square feature selection to automatically generate a feature set that yields comparable performance to the expert-selected and database-derived feature sets without requiring treatment history data. Our automatically-generated feature set also found all the expert-selected mutations and more demonstrating its potential for knowledge discovery. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art with ample expert knowledge, our best fully-automated prediction model for each drug yielded comparable performance at 82.9% classification accuracy and 0.819 coefficient of determination on average.

Xerostomia can be modeled based on the dose to the parotid glands. To date, all spatial information has been discarded and dose-response models are usually reduced to the mean dose. We present novel morphological dose-response models and use multivariate Bayesian logistic regression to model xerostomia. We use 3D invariant statistical moments as morphometric descriptors to quantify the shape of the 3D dose distribution. As this results in a very high number of potential predictors, we apply a Bayesian variable-selection algorithm to find the best model based on any subset of all potential predictors. To do this, we determine the posterior probabilities of being the best model for all potential models and calculate the marginal probabilities that a variable should be included in a model. This was done using a Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The performance of the best model was quantified using the deviance information criterion and a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV). This methodology was applied to 64 head and neck cancer patients treated with either intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or conventional radiotherapy. Results show a substantial increase in both model-fit and area under the curve (AUC) when including morphological information compared to conventional mean-dose models. The best mean-dose model for IMRT patients only resulted in an AUC of 0.63 after LOOCV while the best morphological model had an AUC of 0.90. For conventional patients the mean-dose model and the morphological model had AUC of 0.55 and 0.86 respectively. For a joint model with all patients pooled together, the mean dose model had an AUC of 0.75 and the morphological model an AUC of 0.88. We have shown that invariant statistical moments are a good morphometric descriptor and by using Bayesian variable selection we were able to identify models with a - - substantially higher predictive power than conventional mean-dose models.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708935","dose-response;feature selection;morphometrics;radiotherapy","Bayesian methods;Cancer;Glands;Neck;Predictive models;Shape;Three dimensional displays","Bayes methods;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;cancer;dosimetry;radiation therapy;regression analysis","3D dose distribution;3D invariant statistical moment;Bayesian feature-selection algorithm;Bayesian variable selection;Bayesian variable-selection algorithm;area under the curve;deviance information criterion;head tumour;head-and-neck cancer trial;intensity-modulated radiotherapy;leave-one-out cross-validation;marginal probability;morphological dose-response model;morphometric descriptor;multivariate Bayesian logistic regression;neck tumour;parotid gland;posterior probability;reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm;salivary flow reduction;xerostomia","","2","","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The DC bus voltage of a shunt active power filter should be controlled to compensate the filter losses on the grid. In many industrial applications, a PI controller is generally used to regulate the DC bus voltage of shunt active power filters. In the novel control algorithm the error signal caused by the filter losses has been computed firstly. Then this error signal has been compensated using the fuzzy logic controller. Simulation model of the shunt active power filter with the proposed control algorithm has been designed using the Matlab/Simulink/Simpower and the Fuzzy Toolbox. The simulation results show that the fuzzy logic controller compensates filter losses on the grid and improves the power quality by reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the supply current and increasing the power factor.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.165","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708906","DC bus voltage control;Fuzzy logic controller;Shunt Active Power Filter","Active filters;Fuzzy logic;Mathematical model;Passive filters;Power filters;Power harmonic filters;Voltage control","PI control;active filters;error compensation;fuzzy control;harmonic distortion;losses;power factor;power grids;power harmonic filters;power supply quality;voltage control","DC bus voltage regulation;Matlab;PI controller;Simpower;Simulink;control algorithm;error signal compensated;filter loss compensation;fuzzy logic controller;fuzzy toolbox;power factor;power grid;power quality;single phase shunt active power filter;total harmonic distortion","","4","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) which utilize virtualization have been introduced. One particular challenge present in current virtualization-based IDS systems is considered in this paper. IDS systems are commonly faced with high-dimensionality imbalanced data. Improved feature selection methods are needed to achieve more accurate detection when presented with imbalanced data. These methods must select the right set of features which will lead to a lower number of false alarms and higher correct detection rates. In this paper we propose a new Boosting-based feature selection that evaluates the relative importance of individual features using the fractional absolute confidence that Boosting produces. Our approach accounts for the sample distributions by optimizing for the area under the Receive Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (i.e., Area Under the Curve(AUC)). Empirical results on different commercial virtual appliances and malwares indicate that proper input feature selection is key if we want an effective virtualization-based IDS that is lightweight, efficient and effective.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708950","Virtual machine monitoring;boosting;feature selection;imbalanced data;intrusion detection","Bit error rate;Boosting;Data mining;Feature extraction;Malware;Servers;Virtual machining","feature extraction;security of data;virtual machines","ROC curve;boosting-based feature selection;high-dimensionality imbalanced data;intrusion detection system;receive operating characteristic curve;virtual machine monitoring;virtualization-based IDS system","","4","1","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A critical goal in radiation therapy is to deliver optimal radiation doses to the observed tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues. Radiation oncologists typically manually delineate normal and diseased structures on three-dimensional computed tomography~(3D-CT) scans. Manual delineation is a labor intensive, tedious and time-consuming task. In recent years, concerns about respiration induced motion have led to the popularity of four-dimensional computed tomography~(4D-CT) for the tracking of tumors and deformation of organs. However, as manually contouring in all phases would be prohibitively expensive, the development of fast, robust, and automatic segmentation tools has been an active area of research in 4D radiotherapy. In this paper, we describe a novel application of principal surfaces for the propagation of contours in 4D-CT studies. Regions of interest~(ROIs) are manually delineated slice-by-slice in the reference 3D-CT scans. Edges are detected on all of the slices of the target 3D-CT phase. A kernel density estimation~(KDE) based on the detected edges is then calculated. The principal surface algorithm is applied to find the ridges of the edge KDE to provide the object contours. Manually drawn contours from the reference phase are used as an initialization. Contours of ROIs are propagated recursively in all consecutive phases to complete a respiration cycle. Results are provided for a phantom data set of simulated tumor motion as well as on a de-identified data set of the lung of a patient. Evaluation of the efficacy of automatic segmentation in organs and tumors are based on the comparison between manually drawn contours and automatically delineated contours. The Dice coefficients are approximately 0.97 for the lung tumor on the phantom data sets and 0.95 for the patient data sets. The centroid distances between manually deline- - ated lung volume and automatically segmented lung volume in each CT direction are <; 1 mm for both phantom data sets and patient data sets.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.116","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708938","contour propagation;principal surface;radiation therapy;segmentation","Computed tomography;Image edge detection;Kernel;Lungs;Manuals;Phantoms;Tumors","cancer;computerised tomography;image segmentation;lung;medical image processing;phantoms;radiation therapy;tumours","3D-CT scans;4D radiotherapy;4D-CT segmentation;automatic segmentation tools;automatically segmented lung volume;cancer;contour propagation;de-identified data set;dice coefficients;edge KDE;edge detection;four dimensional computed tomography;healthy tissues;kernel density estimation;labor intensive;liver optimal radiation dose;lung tumors tracking;manually delineated lung volume;patient data sets;phantom data set;principal surface algorithm;radiation oncologists;radiation therapy;radiation treatment planning;respiration cycle;three dimensional computed tomography;tumor motion","","1","","13","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous research on analysing fMRI data mainly focuses on detecting low-level neuron activation from the ensued haemodynamic activities. An important recent advance is to show that the high-level cognitive status is recognisable from a period of fMRI records. Nevertheless, it would also be helpful to reveal dynamics of cognitive activities during the period. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering the dynamic cognitive activities by proposing an algorithm of boosted structure learning. We employ statistic model of random fields to represent the dynamics of the brain. To exploit the rich fMRI observations with reasonable model complexity, we build multiple models, where one model links the cognitive activities to only a fraction of the fMRI observations. We combine the simple models by using an altered AdaBoost scheme for multi-class structure learning and show theoretical justification of the proposed scheme.

In face based biometric systems, data is usually collected using a video camera with high frame rate and thus the captured data has high redundancy. Selecting the appropriate instances from this data to update a classification model, is a significant, yet valuable challenge. Active learning methods have gained popularity in identifying the salient and exemplar data instances from superfluous sets. Batch mode active learning schemes attempt to select a batch of samples simultaneously rather than updating the model after selecting every single data point. Existing work on batch mode active learning assume a fixed batch size, which is not a practical assumption in biometric recognition applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to dynamically select the batch size using clustering based unsupervised learning techniques. We also present a batch mode active learning strategy specially suited to handle the high redundancy in biometric datasets. The results obtained on the challenging VidTIMIT and MOBIO datasets corroborate the superiority of dynamic batch size selection over static batch size and also certify the potential of the proposed active learning scheme in being used for real world biometric recognition applications.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708807","DBSCAN clustering;active learning;numerical optimization","Biometrics;Clustering algorithms;Discrete cosine transforms;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Streaming media","biometrics (access control);face recognition;optimisation;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","MOBIO;VidTIMIT;batch mode active learning;clustering;dynamic batch size selection;face based biometric systems;robust biometric recognition;unsupervised learning","","1","","25","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The biogenesis of a functional miRNA is largely dependent on the secondary structure of the miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). Recently, it has been shown that miRNAs are present in the genome as the form of polycistronic transcriptional units in plants and animals. It will be important to design methods to predict such structures for miRNA discovery and its applications in gene silencing. In this paper, we propose a parallel algorithm based on the master-slave architecture to predict the secondary structure from an input sequence. First, the master processor partitions the input sequence into subsequences and distributes them to the slave processors. The slave processors will then predict the secondary structure based on their individual task. Afterward, the slave processors will return their results to the master processor. Finally, the master processor will merge the partial structures from the slave processors into a whole candidate secondary structure. The optimal structure is obtained by sorting the candidate structures according to their scores.

These distributions are used to predict A-V responses from acoustic features of the music alone via multi-variate regression. In this paper, we extend our framework to account for multiple regression mappings contingent upon a general location in A-V space. Furthermore, we model A-V state as the latent variable of a linear dynamical system, more explicitly capturing the dynamics of musical mood.

The regular structure in references enables us to implement structural SVM, a newly developed structured learning algorithm to parse references. In this study we use two types of contextual features to compare structural SVM with conventional SVM. When only basic observation features are used for each token, structural SVM achieves higher performance compared to SVM since it utilizes the contextual label features. However, when the contextual observation features from neighboring tokens are combined, SVM performance improves greatly, and is close to that of structural SVM after adding the second order contextual observation features.

As a result, the undershoot of the output voltage and the overshoot of the reactor current are suppressed effectively as compared with the conventional one in the step change of load resistance.

Prediction of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) for the unit/part is a key aspect of prognostics and has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Due to the rapid growth of cyber infrastructure and sensing technology, an abundance of data is now readily available for RUL prediction. This paper presents a methodology for predicting RUL based on the failure time data exhibiting heavy-tailed behavior in the survival function and user usage patterns through Proportional Hazards Model (PHM). A numerical study is implemented to investigate the effect of the heavy-tailed behavior on the RUL prediction error. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through a real-world example.

Whereas pattern application is usually more efficient, tree kernels can be superior when assessed by the F-measure. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach to extracting meronymy relations, which is based on both patterns and kernel functions. In a first step, meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from a text corpus by applying patterns. In a second step these relation hypotheses are validated by using several shallow features and a graph kernel approach. In contrast to other meronymy extraction and validation methods which are based on surface or syntactic representations we use a purely semantic approach based on semantic networks. This involves analyzing each sentence of the Wikipedia corpus by a deep syntactico-semantic parser and converting it into a semantic network. Meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from the semantic networks by means of an automated theorem prover, which employs a set of logical axioms and patterns in the form of semantic networks. The meronymy candidates are then validated by means of a graph kernel approach based on common walks. The evaluation shows that this method achieves considerably higher accuracy, recall, and F-measure than a method using purely shallow validation.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708840","graph kernel;logic;meronyms;patterns;support vector machine","Encyclopedias;Feature extraction;Internet;Kernel;Semantics;Support vector machines;Tin","linguistics;pattern matching;support vector machines;theorem proving;trees (mathematics)","F-measure;Wikipedia corpus;automated theorem prover;graph kernels;meronymy hypotheses;pattern matching;support vector machines;syntactic structures;syntactico-semantic parser;tree kernel functions","","1","","23","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an automatic presentation generator for a robot guide, which is considered one more cognitive skill. The presentations are made up of groups of paragraphs. The selection of the best paragraphs is based on a semantic understanding of the characteristics of the paragraphs, on the restrictions defined for the presentation and by the quality criteria appropriate for a public presentation. This work is part of the ROBONAUTA project of the Intelligent Control Research Group at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid to create ""awareness"" in a robot guide. The software developed in the project has been verified on the tour-guide robot Urbano. The most important aspect of this proposal is that the design uses learning as the means to optimize the quality of the presentations. To achieve this goal, the system has to perform the optimized decision making, in different phases. The modeling of the quality index of the presentation is made using fuzzy logic and it represents the beliefs of the robot about what is good, bad, or indifferent about a presentation. This fuzzy system is used to select the most appropriate group of paragraphs for a presentation. The beliefs of the robot continue to evolving in order to coincide with the opinions of the public. It uses a genetic algorithm for the evolution of the rules. With this tool, the tour guide-robot shows the presentation, which satisfies the objectives and restrictions, and automatically it identifies the best paragraphs in order to find the most suitable set of contents for every public profile.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708891","Cognitive systems;autonomous robot;decision making;fuzzy systems;learning","Decision making;Indexes;Mobile robots;Ontologies;Painting;Servers","control engineering computing;decision making;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithms;intelligent robots;learning systems;mobile robots;program verification;travel industry","Urbano tour-guide robot;automatic presentation generator;autonomous robot;best paragraphs selection;cognitive skill;fuzzy logic;genetic algorithm;intelligent skill;learning;optimized decision making;public presentation;quality criteria;rule evolution;software verification","","0","","21","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is based on the reliability of the classifiers in their output responses (confidences in their predictions). Both approaches contribute to a reduction of the annotation effort for operators, as operators only have to label/give feedback on a subset of the off-line/online.

The regression step aims at finding the models governing the continuous dynamic in each mode. In this paper, we propose an approach to achieve the clustering step of the identification of the switched HDS.

To this end, we propose a graphical Bayesian network framework for predicting local failure in lung cancer. The proposed approach was tested using a dataset of locally advanced NSCLC patients treated with radiotherapy. This dataset was collected prospectively, which consisted of physical variables and blood-based biomarkers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can be used as an efficient method to develop predictive models of local failure in these patients and to interpret relationships among the different variables.

In high dimensional space like document datasets, however, two points may be nearest neighbors without belonging to the same class. Thus pair wise similarity alone is often insufficient for class prediction in such space. To that end, in this paper, we propose to augment k-means with pair wise constraints generated from group similarity-based hyper clique patterns, which consist of strongly affiliated objects and serve as more reliable seeds for classification. Experiments with real-world datasets show that, with such constraints from quality hyper clique patterns, we can improve the clustering results in terms of various external criteria. Also, our experiments indicate that even if few constraints are violated in the original result of k-means, imposing many quality constraints may still bring gain of performance.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.45","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708842","constrained clustering;hyperclique patterns;k-means;pairwise constraints","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Entropy;Itemsets;Nearest neighbor searches;Wireless application protocol","pattern classification;pattern clustering","class prediction;classification;cluster assignment;document dataset;group similarity-based hyper clique pattern;k-means;nearest cluster centroid;nearest neighbor;pairwise constrained clustering;pairwise similarity;quality constraint","","0","","17","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose we construct an infinite mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions, which is suited in general for density estimation from data on the D-dimensional sphere. Using a nonparametric Dirichlet process prior, our model infers probability distributions over both the number of clusters and their parameter values. We describe an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm for posterior inference from experimental data in this model. The performance of the suggested beam angle selection framework is illustrated for one intra-cranial, pancreas, and prostate case each. The infinite von Mises-Fisher mixture model (iMFMM) creates between 18 and 32 clusters, depending on the patient anatomy. This suggests to use the iMFMM directly for beam ensemble selection in robotic radio surgery, or to generate low-dimensional input for both subsequent optimization of trajectories for arc therapy and beam ensemble selection for conventional radiation therapy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708936","Beam Angle Optimization;Directional Statistics;Nonparametric Bayesian Inference;Radiation Therapy;Treatment Planning","Artificial neural networks;Biomedical applications of radiation;Correlation;Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;Optimization;Pancreas","Markov processes;Monte Carlo methods;biological techniques;medical robotics;physiological models;radiation therapy;statistical distributions;tumours","D-dimensional sphere;Markov chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm;arc therapy;beam angle selection framework;beam angle selection problem;cluster treatment beam directions;clustering problem;density estimation;external radiation therapy;fully automated selection;infinite mixture;infinite von Mises-Fisher mixture model;intracranial case;nonparametric Dirichlet process;pancreas;patient anatomy;posterior inference;probability distributions;prostate case;robotic radiosurgery","","10","","13","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing research on learning from related data streams is based on an assumption that all streams arrive at a central processing unit in a synchronous way, such that in an arbitrary sliding window, all tuples of the streams can be perfectly joined together. This assumption, however, does not hold when related data streams are generated or transferred at different speeds, and thus may arrive in the central processing unit in an asynchronous manner. In this paper, we argue that for asynchronous data streams, there exist a small portion of perfectly joined examples (i.e., complete examples) and a large portion of partially joined examples (i.e., incomplete examples). Accordingly, we present a new Learning from Complete and Fixed Examples (LCFE) framework that can fix incomplete examples to boost the learning. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that LCFE is able to achieve a higher prediction accuracy for learning from related data streams than other simple solutions can offer.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708844","","Accuracy;Central Processing Unit;Data models;Data structures;Lifting equipment;Predictive models;Training","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence)","LCFE framework;arbitrary sliding window;asynchronous data streams;asynchronous flowing speed;central processing unit;learning from complete and fixed examples;real-world data streams;related data streams;synthetic data streams","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This allows to learn different dependencies between tasks for different regions of the learning space. Thus, we relax the conventional hypothesis that tasks behave similarly in the whole learning space. Moreover, MT-Adaboost can learn multiple tasks without imposing the constraint of sharing the same label set and/or examples between tasks.

This task is extremely challenging when the inventory scales up, the items become ephemeral, and the user input remains noisy. Indeed, catalog learning has emerged as a key technical property for other major online ecommerce applications including search and recommendation. We formulate the item cataloging task as a Bayesian classification problem, which shall scale well in very large data set and have good online prediction performance. The inherent data sparseness issue, especially for those tail categories, is key to the overall model performance. We address the data sparseness issue by adapting statistically sound smoothing methods well studied in language modeling tasks. However, there are data characteristics specific to the ecommerce domain, including short yet focused item description, very large and hierarchical catalog taxonomy, and highly skewed distribution over types of items. We investigate these domain-specific regularities empirically, and report practically significant results with real-world true-scale data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.11","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708808","catalog;hierarchy;item categorization;smoothing","Bayesian methods;Catalogs;Maximum likelihood estimation;Smoothing methods;Training;Training data;Vocabulary","Web sites;belief networks;cataloguing;electronic commerce","Bayesian classification problem;adapting statistically sound smoothing methods;catalog learning;data sparseness;e-commerce sites;hierarchical catalog taxonomy;highly skewed distribution;inventory;item cataloging task;item categorization;language modeling tasks;long-tail online marketplace;online ecommerce;online prediction;real-world true-scale data;smoothing algorithms","","0","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been shown that these posts can be used to gain a greater understanding of patients' experiences and concerns. As investigators continue to explore large corpora of medical discussion board data for research purposes, protecting the privacy of the members of these online communities becomes an important challenge that needs to be met. Extant entity recognition methods used for more structured text are not sufficient because message posts present additional challenges: the posts contain many typographical errors, larger variety of possible names, terms and abbreviations specific to Internet posts or a particular message board, and mentions of the authors' personal lives. The main contribution of this paper is a system to de-identify the authors of discussion board posts automatically, taking into account the aforementioned challenges. We demonstrate our system on two different message board corpora, one on breast cancer and another on arthritis. We show that our approach significantly outperforms other publicly available de-identification systems, which have been tuned for more structured text like operative reports, pathology reports and discharge summaries.

In the biomedical domain, general WSD has not received much attention compared to the disambiguation of specific categories of entities like proteins and genes or diseases. Statistical learning approaches have achieved better performance compared to other methods. On the other hand, manually annotated data is limited, and covering all the ambiguous cases of a large resource like the UMLS is infeasible. Knowledge-based approaches using the UMLS and MEDLINE citations have achieved good performance but below that of statistical learning approaches. Our best knowledge-based result has been obtained by training a Naïve Bayes algorithm on an automatically extracted MEDLINE corpus. In this work, we extend on previous methods to enhance the quality of an automatically extracted corpus using related terms obtained from MEDLINE without manually annotated training data. We have focused on the extraction of collocations which might be used in combination with one of the senses of the ambiguous terms. We find that left side collocations have the largest improvement in accuracy with an improvement of 4%. In addition, the combination of different types of collocations and post-filtering of retrieved citations achieves an improvement of almost 9% in accuracy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708977","Collocation extraction;Combination of approaches;Text categorization;UMLS;Word Sense Disambiguation","Accuracy;Data mining;Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Knowledge based systems;Semantics;Unified modeling language","learning (artificial intelligence);query processing;text analysis;thesauri","UMLS metathesaurus disambiguation;automatic corpus extraction;information extraction;information retrieval;knowledge-based approaches;naïve Bayes algorithm;query expansion;statistical learning;word sense disambiguation","","3","","10","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Effective wind forecast is essential in order to report the amount of energy supply with high accuracy, which is crucial for planning energy resources for power system operators. Variations in wind power cannot be sufficiently estimated by persistence type basic forecasting methods particularly in medium and long terms. Therefore a new statistical method is presented here in this paper based on independent component analysis (ICA) and autoregressive (AR) model. ICA is utilized in order to exploit the hidden factors which may exist in the wind speed time-series.

However, their training and the validation of final policies can be cumbersome as neural networks can suffer from problems like local minima or over fitting. When using iterative methods, such as neural fitted Q-iteration, the problem becomes even more pronounced since the network has to be trained multiple times and the training process in one iteration builds on the network trained in the previous iteration. Therefore errors can accumulate. In this paper we propose to use ensembles of networks to make the learning process more robust and produce near-optimal policies more reliably. We name various ways of combining single networks to an ensemble that results in a final ensemble policy and show the potential of the approach using a benchmark application. Our experiments indicate that majority voting is superior to Q-averaging and using heterogeneous ensembles (different network topologies) is advisable.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.66","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708863","ensemble methods;neural fitted Q-iteration;neural networks;reinforcement learning;robustness","Approximation algorithms;Artificial neural networks;Function approximation;Network topology;Neurons;Training","function approximation;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","Q averaging;benchmark application;function approximator;iterative method;near optimal policy;neural network;reinforcement learning;training process","","1","","19","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the existence of experimental noises in micro array data and false information in network connectivity data (e.g., ChIP-on-chip binding data, motif information, etc.), it still remains challenging to reconstruct gene regulatory networks for real biomedical applications such as human cancer studies. In this paper, we model the relationship between the genes that share the same transcription factors (TF) from the angle of regression. We propose a statistic called outlier sum testing the conditional significance of the target genes. A Gibbs strategy is utilized in order to estimate the marginal value of outlier sum from its conditional function. Based on the outlier sum statistic we are able to extract the true target genes that carry information about transcription factor activities (TFAs) from the whole population. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method on both simulation data and yeast cell cycle data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.48","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708845","Gibbs sampling;network component analysis;outlier sum;transcriptional regulatory network","Biological system modeling;Data models;Equations;Gene expression;Mathematical model;Sampling methods;Testing","biology computing;genetics;principal component analysis;statistical testing","Gibbs strategy;NCA;genes;marginal function learning;network component analysis;outlier sum statistic;outlier sum testing;transcription factors;transcriptional regulatory networks;yeast cell cycle data","","0","","18","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Depending on the features being selected and evaluated and the external knowledge being used, a balance between recall, precision, noise reduction and information loss has to be applied. In this paper, we propose a new Centroid-based classification approach relying on Wikipedia to enrich the representation of documents through the use of Wikpedia's concepts, categories structure, links, and articles text.

The hypothesis is that more dependencies and higher level dependencies mean more complexity for the task. Some experiments are used to intend to discover some limitations of several feature selection approaches by altering the degree of dependency of the test datasets. A new method has been proposed, which uses a pair of pre-designed Bayesian Networks to generate the test datasets with an easy tuning level of complexity for feature selection test. Relief, CFS, NB-GA, NB-BOA, SVM-GA, SVM-BOA and SVM-mBOA are the filter or wrapper model feature selection approaches which are used and evaluated in the experiments. For these approaches, higher level of dependency among the relevant features greatly affect the capability to find the relevant features for classification. For Relief, SVM-BOA and SVM-mBOA, if the dependencies among the irrelevant features are altered, the performance of them changes as well. Moreover, a multi-objective optimization method is used to keep the diversity of the populations in each generation of the BOA search algorithm improving the overall quality of solutions in our experiments.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708823","BOA;Bayesian Network;Dependent Features;Feature Selection","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Feature extraction;Gallium;Probabilistic logic;Search problems;Support vector machines","feature extraction;optimisation","BOA search algorithm;feature extraction;multi-objective optimization;pre-designed Bayesian network;tuning level;wrapper model feature selection","","0","","23","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent development of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has produced superb performance on scientific computing problems using massive parallel processing cores. However, due to the limited size of device memory, many GPU based algorithms have low capability in solving problems with large datasets. In this paper, a chunking method is proposed to calculate Euclidean distance matrix on large datasets. This is not only designed for scalability in multi-GPU environment but also to maximize the computational capability of each individual GPU device. We first implement a fast GPU algorithm that is suitable for calculating sub matrices of Euclidean distance matrix. Then we utilize a Map-Reduce like framework to split the final distance matrix calculation into many small independent jobs of calculating partial distance matrices, which can be efficiently solved by our GPU algorithm. The framework also dynamically allocates GPU resources to those independent jobs for maximum performance. The experimental results have shown a speed up of 15x on datasets which contain more than half million data points.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708835","Chunking;Euclidean Distance Matrix;Multi-GPU","Euclidean distance;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Kernel;Matrix decomposition;Programming;Symmetric matrices","coprocessors;matrix algebra;parallel processing","Euclidean distance matrix;chunking method;graphics processing units;map-reduce;massive parallel processing cores;multi-GPU environment","","49","","14","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper further explore the Bayes Fuzzy method proposing a classification method specially designed to be used in intelligent systems for data analysis. The main idea is to enhance comprehensibility while maintaining accuracy by decreasing the number of fuzzy rules used to explain a Bayesian Classifier (BC). The proposed Pruned Bayes Fuzzy 2 (PBF2) method is based on a new feature selection method named Selection by Markov Blanket Relation Strength (SMBRS). In the performed experiments, PBF2 is empirically applied to a real world police records problem in order to extract a comprehensible and accurate set of rules which can help in crime prevention. The obtained results show PBF2, when used with proper parameters, brings better precision and comprehensibility compared to other Bayesian/Fuzzy-based methods and to C4.5 algorithm.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.98","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708897","Bayesian Networks;Fuzzy Classification Rules","Bayesian methods;Classification algorithms;Databases;Inference algorithms;Integrated circuits;Markov processes;Neodymium","Bayes methods;Markov processes;fuzzy set theory;groupware;pattern classification;public administration","Bayesian classifier;Bayesian/fuzzy collaboration;SMBRS;crime prevention;data analysis;hybrid intelligent systems;intelligent classification system;pruned Bayes fuzzy rule set;selection by Markov blanket relation strength","","0","","11","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A common type of noise filtering is a data preprocessing technique called classification filtering. In classification filtering, a classifier is built and evaluated on the training dataset (typically using cross-validation) and any misclassified instances are considered noisy. The strategies employed with classification filters are not ideal, particularly when learning from class-imbalanced data. To address this deficiency, we propose an alternative method for classification filtering called the threshold-adjusted classification filter. This methodology is compared with the standard classification filter, and the results clearly demonstrate the efficacy of our technique.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708806","","Neodymium;Niobium;Noise;Noise level;Noise measurement;Training;Training data","filtering theory;noise;pattern classification","cross-validation;data preprocessing technique;imbalanced data;noise filtering algorithm;threshold-adjusted classification filter;training dataset","","4","1","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most robotic imitation learning systems only learn from demonstrators that are homogeneous physiologically (i.e. the same size and mode of locomotion) and in terms of skill level. To successfully learn from physically heterogeneous robots that may also vary in ability, the imitator must be able to abstract behaviours it observes and approximate them with its own actions, which may be very different than those of the demonstrator. This paper describes an approach to imitation learning from heterogeneous demonstrators, using global vision for observations. It supports learning from physiologically different demonstrators (wheeled and legged, of various sizes), and self-adapts to demonstrators with varying levels of skill. The latter allows a bias toward demonstrators that are successful in the domain, but also allows different parts of a task to be learned from different individuals (that is, worthwhile parts of a task can still be learned from a poorly-performing demonstrator). We assume the imitator has no initial knowledge of the observable effects of its own actions, and train a set of Hidden Markov Models to map observations to actions and create an understanding of the imitator's own abilities. We then use a combination of tracking sequences of primitives and predicting future primitives from existing combinations using forward models to learn abstract behaviours from the demonstrations of others. This approach is evaluated using a group of heterogeneous robots that have been previously used in RoboCup soccer competitions.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708820","Heterogeneous Learning;Hidden Markov Models;Imitation Learning;Multi-Robot Learning;physiology;skill","Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Mobile robots;Predictive models;Training;Visualization","control engineering computing;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);physiology;robot vision","RoboCup soccer competition;global vision;heterogeneous demonstrator;heterogeneous imitation learning;heterogeneous robot;hidden Markov model;physiology;robotic imitation learning system;skill level;tracking sequence","","0","","19","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
