Compared with normal inverted pendulum system, the angle bracket inverted pendulum has an inertia weight that caused by gravity downward along the ramp. The character of this system increases the difficulty of balancing the pole. In this paper, adaptive dynamic programming method is used for the system control. Two neural networks are designed separately to achieve the estimation of cost-to-go function and the output of control action through continuously learning. In the utility function design, the consideration of inertia influence is included which makes the estimation of system cost more exactly. In the output layer of the action network we use the S function as the transfer function that makes the outputs of control action be continuous variables. Furthermore, we increase a compensation part to decrease the influence caused by inertia factor. Simulation results show that the method has good results, also prove that it is feasible for the adaptive dynamic programming method to solve inertia problem.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580633","Action-dependent adaptive dynamic programming;Adaptive dynamic critic designs;Angle bracket inverted pendulum;Neural network","Adaptive systems;Artificial neural networks;Dynamic programming;Equations;Gravity;Mathematical model","adaptive control;control system synthesis;dynamic programming;learning systems;neural nets;nonlinear control systems;pendulums","S function;adaptive critic design;adaptive dynamic programming method;angle bracket inverted pendulum control;complex nonlinear system;cost-to-go function;inertia factor;inertia influence;inertia weight;neural networks","","1","","15","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The nodes using LEACH are divided into clusters. The randomized rotation of cluster head in each cluster can save the energy consumption of nodes. However, the random election of cluster heads without considering nodes' residual energy may reduce and oscillate the lifespan of network. In this paper, we have proposed the Adaptive Cluster Head Election and Two-hop LEACH protocol (ACHTH-LEACH) to prolong the lifespan of network. It improves LEACH by using an adaptive algorithm of cluster head election and allowing multi-top transmission among cluster heads and Base Station (BS). Nodes are tagged as near nodes or far nodes according to the distances to the BS. The near nodes belong to one cluster while the far nodes are divided into different clusters by the Greedy K-means algorithm. The cluster head is shifted and the node with the maximal residual energy in each cluster is elected. During the data transmission phase, the far cluster heads may select the cluster head in the near area as the next hop or communicate directly to the BS. The simulation results have shown that ACHTH-LEACH outperforms several existing protocols in terms of network's lifespan. Especially, ACHTH-LEACH can achieve more than 2 times longer lifespan than LEACH and build a more stable routing environment.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580988","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580988","Greedy K-means;LEACH;Lifespan;WSN","Routing protocols;Wireless sensor networks","routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","LEACH protocols;WSN;adaptive cluster head election;base station;low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy protocol;routing protocols;two-hop transmission;wireless sensor network","","16","","11","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the conversion relates to the phonetic aspect of a text, syllabification is considered a major factor affecting the performance of a transliteration system. In grapheme-based approaches, there are two routines to transliterate, one is to perform in a pipeline of separate syllabification and other components in generation process step by step, the other is to synchronously segment syllables and generating transliteration options. Usually, joint decoding outperforms the cascade processing in many natural language processing missions, however, syllabification is a special component in transliteration task. Thus in this paper, we investigate the two routines with a systematic analysis and compare their results to illustrate the strength of syllabification. A phrase-based statistical machine translation framework for joint decoding and a conditional random field syllabification system are used in this work for our investigation, which shows a different scenario on the issue of joint decoding versus cascade processing in transliteration.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580674","Transliteration;joint decoding;log-linear model;statistical machine translation;syllabification","Accuracy;Decoding;Feature extraction;Joints;Testing;Training","decoding;language translation;natural language processing;speech processing","English to Chinese transliteration;cascade processing;grapheme based approach;joint decoding;natural language processing;phonetic equivalence;phrase based statistical machine translation;syllabification","","0","","17","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on linear matrix inequality (LMI), a sufficient condition that ensures asymptotic stability of the sliding mode is derived, and furthermore the asymptotic stability of the original system is studied.

Traditional modeling method for fouling state such as linear regression and ANN is used to establish the off-line static model. But this offline static model must constantly correct with online data to guarantee long-term application. If the model only uses new data to modeling then it will lose the useful information of the dynamic process. It is difficult to calculate and store large data sets with new data and old data combined. This paper present a method based on nonlinear regression PLS, taking into consideration not only the present state of process, but also the information extracted from the old data. Then the model can be update with the changes of operating conditions, automatically.

A typical method for opinion retrieval is document-based and each document is assigned a relevant score and an opinionated score, respectively. Then the documents are ranking based on a combination of the two scores. In this method, however, the document is split into bag-of-word, and the association between the opinion and its corresponding target is broken. In an extreme case, a relevant document full of irrelevant opinions will also be retrieved. In this paper, we propose a sentence-based approach since opinions are always expressed in one sentence where the association between an opinion and its corresponding target is maintained. We assign an individual score to each sentence rather than assign an overall score to the document directly. Moreover, we consider the effectiveness of different positions of sentences in documents to further capture the structural information.

Although many related studies have been suggested, these algorithms may suffer from high computation cost and spatial complexity in dense database, especially when mining long frequent itemsets or support threshold is very lower. To address this problem, a new data structure called P Array is proposed. P Array makes use of data horizontally and vertically like Bit Table FI, and those itemsets that co_occurence with single frequent items are found by computing intersection in P Array. Then, a new algorithm, call MFIPA, is proposed based on P Array. Some frequent itemsets which have the same supports as single frequent item can be found firstly by connecting the single frequent item with every nonempty subsets of its projection, then all other frequent itemsets can be found by using depth-first search strategy. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to Bit Table FI in execution efficiency and memory requirement, especially for dense database.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581018","Depth-first search;Frequent itemsets;Projection array","Algorithm design and analysis;Arrays;Data mining;Itemsets;Memory management","computational complexity;data mining;data structures;tree searching","MFIPA;P array;bit table FI;data mining;data structure;dense database;depth-first search strategy;execution efficiency;frequent itemsets mining;memory requirement;projection array;single frequent items;spatial complexity","","0","","8","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design of selective attention unit includes two steps: selection of optimal features that optimally distinguish between objects and distracting background derived from top-down visual attention and statistic property of image, detecting desired salient objects based on integration between top-down and bottom-up visual attention mechanism. Semantics extraction unit performs the extraction of the object and background semantics of image in terms of classification decision rules. The semantics modeling unit is to construct the image semantic model. It produces a well-structured semantic representation to facilitate the visual information retrieval.

It can improve the detection rate due to the use of the SQI filter to overcome the insufficient light and shade light. Subsequently, angular radial transform (ART), discrete cosine transform (DCT) and Gabor filter (GF) are employed in the procedure of facial expression feature extraction. An SVM is trained and then utilized to recognize the facial expression for a queried face image.

To address this problem, we propose a transfer learning approach called Multi-step Bridged Refinement, which extends the Bridged Refinement algorithm. In the proposed method, we construct a series mixture models to bridge the source and target domain, through which the initial labels of the unlabeled data are refined towards the target distribution in a multi-step way.

How to organize and search large scale music collections is one of the most fundamental challenging research problems. In this paper we introduce an inverted index approach well known in text information retrieval to organize and index music collections. According to musical form structure and repetition rule of musical themes, repeating patterns can be regarded as representation for musical themes. Statistical result indicates repeating patterns follow Zipf's law on a given music database.

This is considering both of the investment costs and reliability of electricity supply. Due to expansion plan of substation and the increasing concern of power supply reliability, considering a more suitable bus scheme for the modern substation is important. Some power companies in other countries apply double bus or ring type bus schemes for their distribution systems. Therefore, the benefit and suitability of different distribution bus schemes for Taiwan is worth to further analysis and study.

One characteristic of the problem is that since the data distributions of the two domains are different, there should be different tailor-made relational logic model for each domain. On the other hand, the relational logic models should share certain amount of similarities due to the same goal and similar nature of the data. Unlike ordinary MLN learning methods, which only consider the distribution of the labeled training examples in learning, we also consider the similarities and differences between the labeled examples from the source domain and the unlabeled examples from the target domain. One major idea of our framework is that we aim at maximizing the likelihood of the observations in the unlabeled data in the target domain, and at the same time, minimizing the difference in the model probability distributions between the source and target domains. As a result, the adapted MLN is tailored to the target domain, but it does not deviate far from the source MLN.

Three high frequency ECG noises; muscle contraction, 50 Hz power line interferences and Gaussian noise were examined. Mean square error (MSE) between filtered ECG and clean ECG was used as a reconstruction performance index. Results showed that the first two IMF levels were deleted owing to their noise components, while the other ensemble IMF constituted clean ECG components for ECG reconstruction. The MSE of EEMD is lower than EMD and IIR filter on these three noise types due to the reduction of mode-mixing effect between separate IMFs.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5581064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5581064","Electrocardiogram (ECG);Ensemble Empirical mode decomposition (EEMD);Noise reduction","Electrocardiography;Filter bank;Finite impulse response filter;IIR filters;Noise;Noise reduction","Gaussian noise;IIR filters;electrocardiography;filtering theory;mean square error methods;signal denoising","ECG noise filtering method;ECG noise reduction;ECG reconstruction;Gaussian noise;IIR filter;electrocardiogram;ensemble empirical mode decomposition;high-frequency muscle contraction;infinite impulse response filters;intrinsic mode function;mean square error","","2","","7","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

So a multiple object detection and tracking algorithm based on optical flow in polar-log images is proposed in this paper. Optical flow computation is only used in moving area. Firstly, the moving edge is extracted in polar-log coordinate. Secondly, the generalized dynamic image model (GDIM) based method is used and the gradient operator in polar-log coordinate is employed to compute the optical flow directly in every moving area and the object tracking is accomplished. This method has there advantages. One is that the image size reduced and the computing time of optical flow decreased in polar-log coordinate. The other is that the optical flow calculation result is accurate because the GDIM base method is used and the gradient operator in polar-log coordinate is employed. The third is that “excessively smooth” can be resolved by optical flow computation only used in moving area. And this method can be used for multiple objects tracking and real time object tracking.
