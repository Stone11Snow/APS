A fashion style classification system can improve the customer search functionality and provide a more personalized experience for the user. Supervised learning techniques with fashion based applications face the problem of developing quantitative measures for describing fashion products which are subjective in nature. To address this issue the authors asked fashion experts to assist in the assembly of a training set of brand-style associations. Quantitative measures were attributed to each brand in the training set by applying natural language processing, text mining, and eBay query results. This data set was used to train a support vector machine which classified the approximately 8000 remaining brands into style categories. The prospective classifier model was assessed based on its positive predictive values which yielded a 56.25% success rate. Given that there are eight different styles to choose from, a baseline for the percentage is only 12.5%. The SVM thus adds significant value to the classification of fashion brands. The final style categorization was integrated as a new filter feature that allows the user to narrow down their searches and access relevant results.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4836-9; POD:978-1-4799-4835-2","10.1109/SIEDS.2014.6829909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829909","Fashion;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Text mining","Classification algorithms;Clothing;Filtering;Media;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Training","clothing;customer services;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;query processing;retail data processing;support vector machines;text analysis","SVM training;classifier model;clothing brand styles classification;customer search functionality;customer service;eBay query results;fashion brand classification;filter feature;machine learning techniques;natural language processing;online fashion retail industry;personalized recommendations;positive predictive values;style categorization;supervised learning;support vector machine;text mining","","0","","15","","","25-25 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper describes an analytical study addressing such cost prediction. Specifically, a novel approach is described in which support vector regression is used to predict service delivery workloads (measured by ticket volumes) based on managed server characteristics Additionally, a proposed framework combining various analytical models is proposed to predict service delivery staffing requirements under changing IT infrastructure characteristics and conditions.

This paper proposes a novel algorithm known as fuzzy refinement domain adaptation to solve this problem based on the ecosystem-oriented architecture. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy system and similarity/dissimilarity concepts to modify the target instances' labels which were initially predicted by a shift-unaware prediction model. It employs a classifier to modify the label values of target instances based on their similarity/dissimilarity to the candidate positive and negative instances in mixture domains. Thirty six experiments are performed using three different shift-unaware prediction models. In these experiments bank failure financial data is used to evaluate the algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive accuracy and outperforms other refinement algorithms.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2012.2232935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6419821","Bank failure prediction;banking ecosystem;domain adaptation;machine learning","Adaptation models;Banking;Classification algorithms;Ecosystems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms","banking;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;prediction theory","bank failure financial data;banking applications;banking ecosystem;ecosystem-oriented architecture;fuzzy refinement domain adaptation;fuzzy system;long term bank failure prediction;machine learning methods;prediction accuracy;refinement algorithms;shift-unaware prediction model;test data","","13","","42","","20130124","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Twitter is one such social media where opinions expressed play a significant influence on the marketability of a product. Hence, an accurate method for predicting sentiments could enable us to understand customers' preferences, their views on the product and services offered by the companies. These have the potential to create positive or negative wave in the market. Hence, this information is valuable for both companies and consumers.

Continuous gathering of data will result in huge amounts of data, especially if many users are involved. Ideally, one might want to keep a large amount of this raw data for future (and maybe different) analysis, and also analyse the data to produce a compact model which can be used in the smartphone for real-time analysis of new data. This motivates a cloud computing solution where data from many users can be stored and analysed efficiently, and then the compact results of the analysis can be downloaded and used in the smartphone. This cloud-based approach is demonstrated using a case study of an activity monitoring application which might be used, for example, to monitor the daily activities, such as walking or going upstairs, of an at-risk person living alone. The cloud-based machine learning uses multiple classification methods, and, starting from individual training sets, enhances and builds classification models for each individual. The cloud-based system also builds a universal model based on all users which can be used as the initial classification model for a new user. The classification model produced by the cloud-based system is downloaded to the smartphone, and can be used to produce accurate real-time activity analysis. As more data is gathered and continually uploaded to the cloud, the models are adapted using an unsupervised learning approach to produce enhanced models which are then downloaded on to the smartphone for improved real-time activity analysis. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed approach can robustly identify activities across multiple individuals: using model adaptation the activity recognition achieves over 95% accuracy in a real usage environment.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4425-5; POD:978-1-4799-4424-8","10.1109/MobileCloud.2014.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6834965","Cloud-based Data Analytics;Machine Learning;Model Adaptation;Real-time Activity Recognition;Smartphone;Wearable Wireless Sensor","Adaptation models;Analytical models;Cloud computing;Data analysis;Data models;Medical services;Real-time systems","cloud computing;data analysis;health care;medical computing;mobile computing;patient monitoring;pattern classification;smart phones;unsupervised learning","activity monitoring application;activity recognition;cloud computing solution;cloud-based machine learning;cloud-based mobile data analytics framework;data analysis;healthcare systems;individual training sets;initial classification model;intelligent assistive services;multiple classification methods;real-time activity analysis;smartphone;universal model;unsupervised learning approach","","1","","29","","","8-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For these evaluations, mathematical algorithms known as model observers (MOs) are often used as a substitute for human observers in early stages of image reconstruction algorithm development. For SPECT-MPI (myocardial perfusion imaging), diagnostic tasks involve detection, localization and assessment of regions with abnormal myocardial perfusion. In this work we propose a new MO for these tasks. The proposed MO is based on a machine-learning algorithm known as Naive-Bayes classifier (NB-MO). In the proposed approach, NB-MO is applied over a set of image features extracted from SPECT polar maps, aiming to predict perfusion scores given by humans for each myocardium region (segment). Next we compute average MO performance by first directly predicting individual human observer scores, and then using multi reader alternative free-response analysis (AFROC) in the same fashion as used on human observers. Our human observer study was comprised of five experienced (physicians) readers who scored location and severity of perfusion defects in 179 simulated SPECT-MPI cases and two different reconstruction methods (FBP and OSEM). The presented results show good performance agreement between humans and the proposed NB-MO, as well as excellent generalization properties of NB-MO between different reconstruction methods.","1082-3654;10823654","Electronic:978-1-4799-0534-8; POD:978-1-4799-0532-4","10.1109/NSSMIC.2013.6829286","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6829286","MPI;Model observer;SPECT;image quality assessment;machine learning;numerical observer","Biomedical imaging;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Myocardium;Observers;Single photon emission computed tomography","Bayes methods;feature extraction;image classification;image reconstruction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;single photon emission computed tomography","AFROC;FBP;MO performance;NB-MO;Naive-Bayes model;OSEM;SPECT polar maps;SPECT-MPI;abnormal myocardial perfusion;human observer;image feature extraction;image quality;image reconstruction algorithm;machine-learning algorithm;mathematical algorithms;medical imaging;model observers;multireader alternative free-response analysis;myocardial perfusion imaging;myocardium region;patient diagnosis;perfusion defects","","0","","19","","","Oct. 27 2013-Nov. 2 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For reliable quality predictions, these objective quality measures need to respond consistently with the behavior of the human visual system (HVS). In practice, many important HVS mechanisms are too complex to be modeled directly. Instead, they can be mimicked by machine learning systems, trained on subjective quality assessment databases, and applied on predefined objective quality measures for specific content or distortion classes. On the downside, machine learning systems are often difficult to interpret and may even contradict the input objective quality measures, leading to unreliable quality predictions. To address this problem, we developed an interpretable machine learning system for objective quality assessment, namely the locally adaptive fusion (LAF). This paper describes the LAF system and compares its performance with traditional machine learning. As it turns out, the LAF system is more consistent with the input measures and can better handle heteroscedastic training data.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2014.2316379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6786302","Objective quality assessment;machine learning;measure fusion","Accuracy;Databases;Distortion;Distortion measurement;Quality assessment;Standards;Transform coding","image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);visual perception","distortion classes;end-to-end quality monitoring;heteroscedastic training data;human visual system;interpretable machine learning system;locally adaptive fusion;locally adaptive system;machine learning systems;objective quality assessment;objective quality measures;perceptual quality;quality predictions;subjective quality assessment databases","","6","1","54","","20140410","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we introduce methods that augment traditional methods for baselining wind turbine performance using multi-feature estimation based on empirical data and present a method for normalizing AEP uncertainty estimates.

It tunes detection parameters in real time, injecting synthetic events to continually retrain itself for optimum performance.

We propose to model the substrate network as a decentralised system and introduce a learning algorithm in each substrate node and substrate link, providing self-organization capabilities. We propose a multiagent learning algorithm that carries out the substrate network resource management in a coordinated and decentralised way. The task of these agents is to use evaluative feedback to learn an optimal policy so as to dynamically allocate network resources to virtual nodes and links. The agents ensure that while the virtual networks have the resources they need at any given time, only the required resources are reserved for this purpose. Simulations show that our dynamic approach significantly improves the virtual network acceptance ratio and the maximum number of accepted virtual network requests at any time while ensuring that virtual network quality of service requirements such as packet drop rate and virtual link delay are not affected.","1542-1201;15421201","Electronic:978-1-4799-0913-1; POD:978-1-4799-0911-7; USB:978-1-4799-0912-4","10.1109/NOMS.2014.6838258","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838258","Artificial Intelligence;Dynamic Resource Allocation;Machine Learning;Multiagent Systems;Network virtualization;Reinforcement Learning;Virtual Network Embedding","Bandwidth;Delays;Dynamic scheduling;Heuristic algorithms;Learning (artificial intelligence);Resource management;Substrates","Internet;computer network management;computer network performance evaluation;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;virtualisation","Internet;decentralised system;machine learning-based approach;multiagent learning algorithm;network virtualisation;quality of service requirements;substrate network;virtual network resource management","","13","","27","","","5-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first step is the polymorphic worms sample collection which is done by the Double-honeynet system. The second step is the signature generation for the collected samples which is done by k-means clustering algorithm and a Multilayer Perceptron Model. The system collects different types of polymorphic worms, we used the k-means clustering algorithm to separate each type into a cluster.

In most cases, SRM is accomplished by using the spatial dependence principle, which is a simple method to describe the spatial patterns of different land cover classes. However, the spatial dependence principle used in existing SRM models does not fully reflect the real-world situations, making the resultant fine resolution land cover map often have uncertainty. In this paper, an example-based SRM model using support vector regression (SVR_SRM) was proposed. Without directly using an explicit formulation to describe the prior information about the subpixel spatial pattern, SVR_SRM generates a fine resolution land cover map from coarse fractional images, by learning the nonlinear relationships between the coarse fractional pixels and corresponding labeled subpixels from the selected best-match training data. Based on the experiments of two subset images of National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 and a subset of real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) image, the performance of SVR_SRM was evaluated by comparing with the traditional pixel-based hard classification (HC) and several existing typical SRM algorithms. The results show that SVR_SRM can generate fine resolution land cover maps with more detailed spatial information and higher accuracy at different spatial scales.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2305652","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6762884","Example-based;K-D tree;machine learning;super-resolution land cover mapping;support vector regression (SVR)","Predictive models;Spatial resolution;Support vector machines;Training;Training data;Vectors","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;image resolution;land cover;regression analysis;support vector machines;terrain mapping","National Land Cover Database;SRM algorithms;SVR_SRM performance;best-match training data;coarse fractional images;example-based SRM model;example-based super-resolution land cover mapping;fine resolution land cover map;labeled subpixels;land cover classes;nonlinear relationships;pixel-based hard classification;real hyperspectral Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer image;real-world situations;spatial dependence principle;spatial information;spatial locations;spatial patterns;spatial scales;subpixel scale;subpixel spatial pattern;support vector regression","","18","","53","","20140311","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This GP based method can achieve a segmentation speed that is significantly higher than that of conventional methods. This method does not require a human expert to manually construct models for texture feature extraction. In an analysis of the evolved classifiers, it can be seen that these GP classifiers are not arbitrary.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used as a modality to detect prostate cancer. Therefore, computer-aided detection of prostate cancer in MRI images has become an active area of research. In this paper we investigate a fully automated computer-aided detection system which consists of two stages. In the first stage, we detect initial candidates using multi-atlas-based prostate segmentation, voxel feature extraction, classification and local maxima detection. The second stage segments the candidate regions and using classification we obtain cancer likelihoods for each candidate. Features represent pharmacokinetic behavior, symmetry and appearance, among others. The system is evaluated on a large consecutive cohort of 347 patients with MR-guided biopsy as the reference standard. This set contained 165 patients with cancer and 182 patients without prostate cancer. Performance evaluation is based on lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve and patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis. The system is also compared to the prospective clinical performance of radiologists. Results show a sensitivity of 0.42, 0.75, and 0.89 at 0.1, 1, and 10 false positives per normal case. In clinical workflow the system could potentially be used to improve the sensitivity of the radiologist. At the high specificity reading setting, which is typical in screening situations, the system does not perform significantly different from the radiologist and could be used as an independent second reader instead of a second radiologist. Furthermore, the system has potential in a first-reader setting.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2014.2303821","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6729091","Computer-aided detection;image analysis;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging;prostate cancer","Biopsy;Design automation;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Machine learning;Magnetic resonance imaging;Prostate cancer","biological organs;biomedical MRI;cancer;feature extraction;image classification;image reconstruction;medical image processing;sensitivity;sensitivity analysis","MRI;cancer death;cancer likelihoods;classification;clinical workflow;first-reader setting;fully automated computer-aided detection system;high specificity reading setting;independent second reader;lesion-based free-response receiver operating characteristic curve;local maxima detection;magnetic resonance imaging;magnetic resonance-guided biopsy;multiatlas-based prostate segmentation;patient-based receiver operating characteristic analysis;pharmacokinetic behavior;prospective clinical performance;prostate cancer detection;radiologists;reference standard;screening situations;second stage segments;sensitivity;voxel feature extraction","0","31","","34","","20140130","May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To detect a human by a laser range finder (LRF), we defined features of the human body in LRF data and employed a support vector data description method. In order to avoid moving obstacles while tracking a running person, we defined a weighted radius for each obstacle using the relative velocity between the robot and an obstacle. For smoothly bypassing obstacles without collision, a dynamic obstacle avoidance algorithm for the MSR is implemented, which directly employed a real-time position vector between the robot and the shortest path around the obstacle.

We review the state-of-the-art for MKL, including different formulations and algorithms for solving the related optimization problems, with the focus on their applications to object recognition. One dilemma faced by practitioners interested in using MKL for object recognition is that different studies often provide conflicting results about the effectiveness and efficiency of MKL. To resolve this, we conduct extensive experiments on standard datasets to evaluate various approaches to MKL for object recognition. We argue that the seemingly contradictory conclusions offered by studies are due to different experimental setups. The conclusions of our study are: (i) given a sufficient number of training examples and feature/kernel types, MKL is more effective for object recognition than simple kernel combination (e.g., choosing the best performing kernel or average of kernels); and (ii) among the various approaches proposed for MKL, the sequential minimal optimization, semi-infinite programming, and level method based ones are computationally most efficient.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2013.212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654166","Feature evaluation and selection;Introductory and Survey;Machine learning;Multiple kernel learning;Object recognition;convex optimization;support vector machine;visual object recognition","Histograms;Image color analysis;Kernel;Object recognition;Optimization;Training;Visualization","feature extraction;image recognition;object detection;optimisation","MKL;feature sets;level method;multiple kernel learning;semiinfinite programming;sequential minimal optimization;visual object recognition","1","38","","96","","20131104","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This focusing leads to reduced variability in the resulting products, due to the use of standardized constructs. Genetic programming (GP) performs heuristic search in the space of programs. Programs produced through the GP paradigm emerge as the result of simulated evolution and are built through a bottom-up process, incrementally augmenting their functionality until a satisfactory level of performance is reached. Can we automatically extract knowledge from the GP programming process that can be useful to focus the search and reduce product variability, thus leading to a more effective use of the available resources? An answer to this question is investigated with the aid of cultural algorithms. A new system, cultural algorithms with genetic programming (CAGP), is presented. The system has two levels. The first is the pool of genetic programs (population level), and the second is a knowledge repository (belief set) that is built during the GP run and is used to guide the search process. The microevolution within the population brings about potentially meaningful characteristics of the programs for the achievement of the given task, such as properties exhibited by the best performers in the population. CAGP extracts these features and represents them as the set of the current beliefs. Beliefs correspond to constraints that all the genetic operators and programs must follow. Interaction between the two levels occurs in one direction through the extraction process and, in the other, through the modulation of an individual's program parameters according to which, and how many, of the constraints it follows. CAGP is applied to solve an instance of the symbolic regression problem, in which a fun- tion of one variable needs to be discovered. The results of the experiments show an overall improvement on the average performance of CAGP over GP alone and a significant reduction of the complexity of the produced solution. Moreover, the execution time required by CAGP is comparable with the time required by GP alone.","1063-6560;10636560","","10.1162/evco.1997.5.2.181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6792772","Genetic programming;cultural algorithms;design concept reuse;machine learning of software design concepts;software design methodologies;software metrics","","","","","1","","","","","June 1997","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Those investigations have also accurately estimated shifts in drivers' levels of arousal, fatigue, and vigilance, as evidenced by variations in their task performance, by evaluating electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. However, monitoring the neurophysiological activities of automobile drivers poses a major measurement challenge when using a laboratory-oriented biosensor technology. This work presents a novel dry EEG sensor based mobile wireless EEG system (referred to herein as Mindo) to monitor in real time a driver's vigilance status in order to link the fluctuation of driving performance with changes in brain activities. The proposed Mindo system incorporates the use of a wireless and wearable EEG device to record EEG signals from hairy regions of the driver conveniently. Additionally, the proposed system can process EEG recordings and translate them into the vigilance level. The study compares the system performance between different regression models. Moreover, the proposed system is implemented using JAVA programming language as a mobile application for online analysis. A case study involving 15 study participants assigned a 90 min sustained-attention driving task in an immersive virtual driving environment demonstrates the reliability of the proposed system. Consistent with previous studies, power spectral analysis results confirm that the EEG activities correlate well with the variations in vigilance. Furthermore, the proposed system demonstrated the feasibility of predicting the driver's vigilance in real time.","1932-4545;19324545","","10.1109/TBCAS.2014.2316224","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818437","Brain computer interface;dry electroencephalographic (EEG) system;machine learning;vigilance monitoring","Biomedical monitoring;Brain models;Electroencephalography;Monitoring;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Java;biomedical equipment;biosensors;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;programming languages;regression analysis;virtual reality;wireless sensor networks","EEG signal recording;JAVA programming language;Mindo system;arousal;automobile drivers;brain activity;driver vigilance status;driving performance;electroencephalographic changes;fatigue;hairy regions;immersive virtual driving environment;laboratory-oriented biosensor technology;mobile wireless EEG system;neurophysiological activities;novel dry EEG sensor;online analysis;regression models;safe driving task;sustained-attention driving task;task performance;wearable EEG system","0","10","","60","","20140519","April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Findings from two studies with human participants are reported. The first study utilized a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm where human “wizards” directed participants through Crystal Island's mystery storyline by dynamically controlling narrative events in the game environment. Interaction logs yielded training data for machine learning the conditional probabilities of a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model of the human wizards' directorial actions. Results indicate that the DBN model achieved significantly higher precision and recall than naive Bayes and bigram model techniques. In the second study, the DBN director agent model was incorporated into the runtime version of Crystal Island, and its impact on students' narrative-centered learning experiences was investigated. Results indicate that machine-learning director agent strategies from human demonstrations yield models that positively shape players' narrative-centered learning and problem-solving experiences.","1943-068X;1943068X","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2292010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6671428","Bayesian networks;interactive drama;machine learning;narrative;serious games","Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Crystals;Educational institutions;Games;Predictive models;Training","belief networks;computer aided instruction;humanities;learning (artificial intelligence);problem solving;serious games (computing)","Bayes techniques;Crystal Islands mystery storyline;DBN director agent model;Wizard-of-Oz paradigm;bigram model techniques;conditional probabilities;dynamic Bayesian network model;dynamically narrative event control;dynamically story event sequencing;educational game;educational interactive narrative Crystal Island;human demonstrations;human participants;human wizard directed participants;human wizard directorial actions;interaction logs;machine-learning director agent strategy modelling;player actions;player narrative-centered learning shaping;problem-solving experiences;student narrative-centered learning experiences;supervised machine-learning framework","","2","","28","","20131120","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The importance of this topic stems from the amount of data currently produced in research, engineering, and other fields. The size of these data sets renders manual analysis infeasible. Automatic analysis methods are required to cope with the data sets produced. The algorithms for filtering, categorization, and analysis have a long tradition and are manifold.

Do such events that extend in time elicit evoked responses of similar strength as evoked responses associated with instantaneous events such as the presentation of a static target image? Using a set of simulated scenarios, with avatars/actors having different behaviors, we identified evoked neural activity discriminative of target vs. distractor events (behaviors) at discrimination levels that are comparable to static imagery. EEG discriminative activity was largely in the time-locked evoked response and not in oscillatory activity, with the exception of very low EEG frequency bands such as delta and theta, which simply represent bands dominating the event related potential (ERP). The discriminative evoked response activity we see is observed in all target/distractor conditions and is robust across different recordings from the same subjects. The results suggest that we have identified a robust neural correlate of target detection in video, at least in terms of the stimulus set we used-i.e., dynamic behavior of an individual in a low clutter environment. Additional work is needed to test a larger variety of behaviors and more diverse environments.","1932-4553;19324553","","10.1109/JSTSP.2014.2313022","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6777281","Video analysis;audio-visual systems;brain- computer interfaces;electroencephalography;machine learning;video surveillance","Acceleration;Data analysis;Data collection;Electroencephalography;Robustness;Streaming media;Watches","brain-computer interfaces;electroencephalography;object detection;video signal processing","EEG discriminative activity;ERP;event detection;event related potential;evidence accumulation;evoked neural responses;static target image;target detection;time elicit evoked responses;video signal processing","","3","","21","","20140321","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The analysis pipeline included three stages, namely, clustering, glaucoma boundary limit detection, and glaucoma progression detection testing. First, cross-sectional visual field tests collected from each subject were clustered using a mixture of Gaussians and model parameters were estimated using expectation maximization. The visual field clusters were further estimated to recognize glaucomatous visual field defect patterns by decomposing each cluster into several axes. The glaucoma visual field defect patterns along each axis then were identified. To derive a definition of progression, the longitudinal visual fields of stable glaucoma eyes on the abnormal cluster axes were projected and the slope was approximated using linear regression (LR) to determine the confidence limit of each axis. For glaucoma progression detection, the longitudinal visual fields of each eye on the abnormal cluster axes were projected and the slope was approximated by LR. Progression was assigned if the progression rate was greater than the boundary limit of the stable eyes; otherwise, stability was assumed. The proposed method was compared to a recently developed progression detection method and to clinically available glaucoma progression detection software.

For our project, we gathered weekly textual reports spanning twelve months from the United States Worldwide Threats to Shipping Reports repository that belongs to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), We considered the maritime incident reports written by human operators as a valuable and accessible unstructured textual input source in which a span of text<sup>1</sup> is called “risk” if it expresses one of the following kinds of vessel incidents: fired, robbed, boarded, hijacked, attacked, chased, approached, kidnapped, boarding attempted, suspiciously approached or clashed with. Our approach benefits from probability distributions of some useful features annotated based on a list of lexicons that contain expressions denoting vessel types, risks types, risk associates, maritime geographical locations, dates and times. These distributions are captured and used to anchor the span of “risks” as they are described in the textual reports. After some preprocessing steps that include tokenization, named entity extraction and part-of-speech tagging, the textual risk mining system applies a variety of sequence classification algorithms, e.g., Conditional Random Fields, Conditional Markov Models and Hidden Markov Models in order to compare the risk classification performance. Empirical results show that our NLP/ML-based system can extract variable-length risk spans from the textual reports with about 90% correctness.","2379-1667;23791667","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3563-5; Electronic:978-1-4799-3564-2; POD:978-1-4799-3565-9","10.1109/CogSIMA.2014.6816558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816558","machine learning;maritime domain awareness;maritime situational awareness;natural language processing;risk detection;sequence-based classifiers;text analysis","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Risk management","command and control systems;decision support systems;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);marine engineering;marine safety;natural language processing;risk management;statistical distributions","MSA operation;NGA;NLP/ML-based system;National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency;United States worldwide threats to shipping reports repository;approached vessel incident;attacked vessel incident;auxiliary ML;auxiliary machine learning;boarded vessel incident;boarding attempted vessel incident;cameras;chased vessel incident;conditional Markov models;conditional random fields;electronic sensors;entity extraction;feature annotation;fired vessel incident;hidden Markov models;hijacked vessel incident;human intuition;human perception;kidnapped vessel incident;maritime command-and-control centers;maritime geographical locations;maritime incident reports;maritime situational awareness operation;natural language processing;part-of-speech tagging;probability distributions;risk associates;risk classification performance;risks types;robbed vessel incident;semiautomated decision support systems;sequence classification algorithms;textual risk mining system;tokenization;variable-length risk span extraction;vessel types;vessels;weekly textual reports","","3","","37","","","3-6 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach relies on the expression of the intrinsic structure of the multivariate sequences in the form of structural constraints, which are imposed on dimensionality reduction process to generate a compact and data-driven manifold in a low dimensional space. This manifold is a mathematical representation of the intrinsic nature of the concept of interest regardless of the stylistic variability found in its instances. In addition, this approach is extended to model jointly several related concepts within a unified representation creating a continuous space between concept manifolds. Since a generated manifold encodes the unique characteristic of the concept of interest, it can be employed for classification of unknown instances of concepts. Exhaustive experimental evaluation on different datasets confirms the superiority of the proposed methodology to other state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods. Finally, the practical value of this novel dimensionality reduction method is demonstrated in three challenging computer vision applications, i.e., view-dependent and view-independent action recognition as well as human-human interaction classification.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2277664","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637031","Computer vision;machine learning;multidimensional;pattern analysis;time series analysis;video analysis","Context;Hidden Markov models;Kernel;Laplace equations;Manifolds;Optimization;Standards","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;pattern classification;sequences","computer vision;concept manifolds;data-driven manifold;embedding-based dimensionality reduction approach;human-human interaction classification;intrinsic structure;low dimensional space;mathematical representation;multivariate sequence sets;structural Laplacian eigenmaps;structural constraints;view-dependent action recognition;view-independent action recognition","0","10","","69","","20131018","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Sensor networks together with surveillance cameras help identify elements disturbing cars' mobility. On the contrary, in developing countries, the lack of this level of infrastructure makes the task of roads' maintenance and traffic control challenging. The presence of roadway surface disruptions (RSDs), in particular, affects the economy and reputation of individuals and companies. Urban computing strategies can be adopted to collect data about the presence of RSDs and be applied to monitor traffic related issues. The implementation of such level of navigation assistance could help save freight and money to companies and authorities, and even reduce cars' accidents. In this direction, current mobile technologies can help with the identification and location of road imperfections alerting drivers about alternative routes. In this paper we present our work that seeks to enable citizens' cars as road watchers. By means of the mobile phones' acceleration sensing capabilities we are identifying and tagging the presence of RSDs. Using Android-based devices situated on the copilot floor side of a car, 5 Mbytes of road information has been collected. We run a series of experiments aiming to differentiate acceleration patterns associated to potholes, speed bumps, metal humps and rough roads. Currently, the classification of disruptions is being experimented with techniques from the field of Machine Learning (ML) such as artificial neuronal networks and logistic regression. Classification of individual events is over 86% of accuracy that is competitive with those reported in the literature.

A single 3-axis accelerometer sensor is attached to the surface of the main water pipe in the house to detect and collect the vibration signals of the main water pipe.

This paper explores the iPhone as a device, which can potentially be a feasible alternative to the conventional methods of data collection for gait analysis and assessment. Within the iPhone, the internal accelerometer is a micro electro-mechanical system (MEMS) based sensor. This study compared the phone sensor against a commercial standalone accelerometer, Minimod developed by McRoberts. One of the most common and costly conditions that people may encounter at one point in their lives is non-specific chronic low back pain (nscLBP). Due to the nature of the condition, it is difficult to determine the aetiology and assess the status of recovery. Machine learning (ML) algorithms were implemented to determine whether patients with LBP and healthy controls could be classified based on gait characteristics recorded by the smart phone. The results show that 85.7% accuracy can be achieved from the features extracted from the iPhone accelerometer, with improvements of 88.8% when feature selection methods are applied. To investigate the feasibility of using iPhone embedded MEMS sensors, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were performed to determine the agreement between the features extracted from the portable devices. A Mann-Whitney U-Test was employed to determine whether features were significantly different between the groups of subjects. It can be concluded from this study that, using the iPhone accelerometer, features can be successfully extracted with high agreement. Classification is achieved with significant accuracy to differentiate between patient and control groups. The experiments demonstrate that the iPhone and smart phone equivalents can provide an accurate and precise measurement that can be used for gait assessment and analysis.","2157-9555;21579555","Electronic:978-1-4673-4714-3; POD:978-1-4673-4712-9","10.1109/ICNC.2013.6818134","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6818134","Smart mobile phone;feasibility;gait analysis;machine learning;portable devices;reliability","Accelerometers;Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Correlation;Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Mobile handsets","accelerometers;bioMEMS;feature extraction;feature selection;gait analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;microsensors;smart phones;telemedicine;ubiquitous computing","Mann-Whitney U-Test;aetiology;feature extraction;feature selection methods;iPhone accelerometer;iPhone embedded MEMS sensors;intraclass correlation coefficient;machine learning algorithms;microelectro-mechanical system based sensor;nonspecific chronic low back pain;patient gait assessment;smart mobile phone;ubiquitous device","","1","","19","","","23-25 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the existing sentiment analysis systems require large training datasets and complex tools for implementation. This paper presents a Two-Parse algorithm with a training dataset of approximately 7,000 keywords, for automatic product review analysis. The proposed algorithm is more efficient as compared to some of the popular review analysis systems with enormous datasets. This algorithm is a solution to a very common problem of high polarity of datasets. This paper proposes a Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (Weighted k-NN) Classifier which achieves a better efficiency than the classical k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier. The proposed Classifier is capable of successfully classifying weakly and mildly polar reviews along with the highly polar ones. The Classifier provides an option of modifying the parameters according to need of the system and thus overcomes the problem of static parameters in classical machine learning algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3188-0; POD:978-1-4799-3189-7","10.1109/ITNG.2014.99","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6822247","Machine Learning;Polarity;Sentiment Analysis;Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm;k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier","Information technology","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;retail data processing","automatic product review analysis;mildly polar review classification;online shopping;sentiment analysis systems;supervised semantic analysis;training dataset;two-parse algorithm;weakly polar review classification;weighted k-NN classifier;weighted k-nearest neighbor classifier","","1","","23","","","7-9 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many consumers' online reviews contain such information as rating value, customer name, and descriptions about a product or service. This paper discusses methods that help web administrators and/or business managers identify the legitimate versus illegitimate customers, use auto regression moving average (ARMA) to predict ratings, and more importantly, detect fraudulent reviews by comparing the differences among customer class, predicted rating, and the actual rating by the customer. In the end, this paper reports an experiment using online restaurant reviews to test the proposed algorithms.

Usually in multimodal imaging we consider the modes to be different types of imaging devices such as EEG, NIRS or fMRI (see e.g. [1], [7], [3], [4]). However, we can also interpret different subjects as imaging modalities to gain a zero training decoder (cf. [5], [6]) from a data base of subjects. Even the same subject data from several experiments can be seen as instantiation of multiple modes. This change of view allows to proceed in various research directions (e.g. [3], [4],[10], [11],[12]). The talk will expand on recent multimodal analysis techniques such as SPoC ([3], [4]). Furthermore we will discuss nonstationarities (cf. [13], [10]) that often occur in neuroscience, e.g. between a subjects' training and testing session in braincomputer interfacing (BCI) (e.g. [10], [11],[12]). We show that such changes can be very similar between subjects, and thus can be reliably estimated using data from other users and utilized to construct an invariant feature space ([11]). These insights can be accumulated into a broader theoretical framework using beta divergences ([12]).

Two of the approaches in program induction are inductive logic programming (ILP) and genetic programming (GP). Since their formalisms are so different, these two approaches cannot be integrated easily, although they share many common goals and functionalities. A unification will greatly enhance their problem-solving power. Moreover, they are restricted in the computer languages in which programs can be induced. In this paper, we present a flexible system called LOGENPRO (The LOgic grammar-based GENetic PROgramming system) that uses some of the techniques of GP and ILP. It is based on a formalism of logic grammars. The system applies logic grammars to control the evolution of programs in various programming languages and represent context-sensitive information and domain-dependent knowledge. Experiments have been performed to demonstrate that LOGENPRO can emulate GP and GP with automatically defined functions (ADFs). Moreover, LOGENPRO can employ knowledge such as argument types in a unified framework. The experiments show that LOGENPRO has superior performance to that of GP and GP with ADFs when more domain-dependent knowledge is available. We have applied LOGENPRO to evolve general recursive functions for the even-<italic>n</italic>-parity problem from noisy training examples. A number of experiments have been performed to determine the impact of domain-specific knowledge and noise in training examples on the speed of learning.","1063-6560;10636560","","10.1162/evco.1997.5.2.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6791296","Machine learning;genetic programming;logic grammars","","","","","6","","","","","June 1997","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

To be effective, WAFs need to analyze the payload of the packets. One of the techniques used for intrusion detection is to extract features from the payload by means of n-grams. An n-gram is a subsequence of n items from a given sequence. The number of n-grams is 256 to the nth power. Since it grows exponentially with n, the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity problem arise. In this paper we propose to apply feature selection in order to reduce the number of features extracted by n-grams and thus to improve the effectiveness of WAFs. We conduct experiments on our own HTTP data set. After extracting n-grams from this data set, we apply the Generic-Feature-Selection (GeFS) measure for intrusion detection [5] to select important features. We use four different classifiers to test the detection accuracy before and after feature selection. The experiments show that we can remove more than 95% of irrelevant and redundant features from the original data set (and thus improve the performance by more than 80% on average), while reducing only slightly (by less than 6%) the accuracy of WAFs.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1307-1; POD:978-1-4577-1306-4","10.1109/IWSCN.2011.6827720","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6827720","Web application firewall;Web attack detection;feature selection;intrusion detection systems;machine learning algorithms;n-grams","Accuracy;Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Optimization;Payloads","Internet;computational complexity;firewalls;telecommunication traffic","GeFS;HTTP traffic;WAF;computational complexity;data set;dimensionality;generic-feature-selection measure;intrusion detection;n-grams;payload-based Web application firewalls","","2","","22","","","18-20 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithms are faster relatively to other existing iterative methods. In particular, we show that unlike such iterative methods, the proposed method does not estimate a given face rotation angle or scaling factor by looking into all possible face rotations or scaling factors. The proposed method looks into segmenting and aligning the distance between two eyes' pupils in a given face image with the image x-axis. Reference face images in a given database are normalized with respect to translation, rotation, and scaling.

Many visual saliency models have been developed for individual images, video clips, and image pairs. However, image sequence, one most general occasion in the real world, is not explored yet. A general image sequence is different from video clips whose temporal continuity is maintained and image pairs where common objects exist. It might contain some similar low-level properties while completely distinct contents. Traditional saliency detection methods will fail on these general sequences. Based on this consideration, this paper investigates the shortcomings of the classical saliency detection methods, which significantly limit their advantages: 1) inability to capture the natural connections among sequential images, 2) over-reliance on motion cues, and 3) restriction to image pairs/videos with common objects. In order to address these problems, we propose a framework that performs the following contributions: 1) construct an image data set as benchmark through a rigorously designed behavioral experiment, 2) propose a neural activity trace aware saliency model to capture the general connections among images, and 3) design a novel measure to handle the low-level clues contained among sequential images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed saliency model is associated with a tremendous advancement compared with traditional methods when dealing with the general image sequence.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2013.2279002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680765","Computer vision;global contrast;machine learning;neural activity trace;preactivation;saliency detection;visual attention","Benchmark testing;Biological system modeling;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image sequences;Indexes;Visualization","benchmark testing;computer vision;image sequences;motion estimation;neurophysiology;video signal processing","NATAS;computer vision;image pairs;image sequence;motion cues;neural activity trace aware saliency model;saliency detection methods;sequential images;temporal continuity;video clips;visual saliency models","0","2","","49","","20131211","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Due to the hysteresis and incompleteness of the signature establishment as well as the inaccuracy of statistics probability model, the effectiveness of traditional signature-based and statistics-based anomaly detection methods are directly restricted. Besides, the species and complexity of anomaly behaviors are varying so fast along with the outbreak of network traffic and the influence of high-speed access. It is difficult to detect and identify anomaly behaviors accurately based on several features of actual network traffic. Anomaly detection is facing the challenge of big data processing and dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph (FL-LPVG), which constructs complex networks based on the network flow series. This method mines structural behavior patterns of the associated graph and detects anomaly traffic through data mining and entropy-based information theoretic techniques. Experiments on KDD Cup 99 dataset demonstrate that this method greatly simplify the process of anomaly detection, and effectively reduce dimensionality of high-dimensional data, and at the same time this method gets a good detection effect.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-729-8","10.1049/cp.2013.2470","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826019","Anomaly Classification;Anomaly Detection;Limited Penetrable Visibility Graph;Machine Learning","","computer network security;data mining;entropy;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","FL-LPVG;anomaly behaviors;anomaly traffic detection;associated graph;big data processing;complex networks;data mining;entropy-based information theoretic techniques;flow-level limited penetrable visibility graph;high-dimensional data dimensionality reduction;network flow series;network traffic;network-based anomaly detection methods;signature establishment hysteresis;signature establishment incompleteness;signature-based anomaly detection methods;statistics probability model;statistics-based anomaly detection methods;structural behavior pattern mining","","0","","","","","22-24 Nov. 2013","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Standard voice assessment approaches cannot accurately determine the actual nature, prevalence, and pathological impact of hyperfunctional vocal behaviors because such behaviors can vary greatly across the course of an individual's typical day and may not be clearly demonstrated during a brief clinical encounter. Thus, it would be clinically valuable to develop noninvasive ambulatory measures that can reliably differentiate vocal hyperfunction from normal patterns of vocal behavior. As an initial step toward this goal we used an accelerometer taped to the neck surface to provide a continuous, noninvasive acceleration signal designed to capture some aspects of vocal behavior related to vocal cord nodules, a common manifestation of vocal hyperfunction. We gathered data from 12 female adult patients diagnosed with vocal fold nodules and 12 control speakers matched for age and occupation. We derived features from weeklong neck-surface acceleration recordings by using distributions of sound pressure level and fundamental frequency over 5-min windows of the acceleration signal and normalized these features so that intersubject comparisons were meaningful. We then used supervised machine learning to show that the two groups exhibit distinct vocal behaviors that can be detected using the acceleration signal. We were able to correctly classify 22 of the 24 subjects, suggesting that in the future measures of the acceleration signal could be used to detect patients with the types of aberrant vocal behaviors that are associated with hyperfunctional voice disorders.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2013.2297372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701200","Ambulatory voice monitoring;clinical detection;machine learning;vocal cord;vocal fold nodules","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Biomedical measurement;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Pathology;Surgery","geriatrics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis","aberrant vocal behaviors;ambulatory neck-surface acceleration features;hyperfunctional vocal behaviors;hyperfunctional voice disorders;neck-surface acceleration recordings;noninvasive acceleration signal;noninvasive ambulatory measurement;pathological impact;patient diagnosis;signal acceleration;sound pressure level;standard voice assessment approaches;supervised machine learning;vocal cord nodules;vocal fold nodules;vocal hyperfunction","0","9","","26","","20140102","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian mixture of Gaussian process regression models, each component of which models the noise variance process that contaminates the observed data as a separate latent Gaussian process driven by the observed data. This way, we essentially obtain a Gaussian process-mixture conditional heteroscedasticity (GPMCH) model for volatility modeling in financial return series. We impose a nonparametric prior with power-law nature over the distribution of the model mixture components, namely the Pitman-Yor process prior, to allow for better capturing modeled data distributions with heavy tails and skewness. Finally, we provide a copula-based approach for obtaining a predictive posterior for the covariances over the asset returns modeled by means of a postulated GPMCH model.

One primary difficulty, however, is that the solutions may grow too big without any improvement of their generalization ability. In this article we investigate the fundamental relationship between the performance and complexity of the evolved structures. The essence of the parsimony problem is demonstrated empirically by analyzing error landscapes of programs evolved for neural network synthesis. We consider genetic programming as a statistical inference problem and apply the Bayesian model-comparison framework to introduce a class of fitness functions with error and complexity terms. An adaptive learning method is then presented that automatically balances the model-complexity factor to evolve parsimonious programs without losing the diversity of the population needed for achieving the desired training accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is empirically shown on the induction of sigma-pi neural networks for solving a real-world medical diagnosis problem as well as benchmark tasks.","1063-6560;10636560","","10.1162/evco.1995.3.1.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6792127","Bayesian model comparison;evolving neural networks;genetic programming;machine learning;minimum description length principle;tree induction","","","","","40","","","","","March 1995","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

The question of how the visual system is able to develop stable or invariant states through the ever transforming environment is central to understanding the brain's recognition process. The coined term slowness principle used in slow feature analysis is a reference to the brain's ability to generate slow changing and thus stable percepts in response to the fast varying visual stimulations in the environment. Based on this principle this paper deals with categorization of video sequences composed of dynamic natural scenes. Unlike models relying on supervised learning or handcrafted descriptors, we represent videos using unsupervised learning of motion features. Our method is based on: 1) Slow feature analysis principle from which motion features representing the principal and more stable motion components of training videos are learned. 2) Integration of the local motion feature into a global classification architecture. Classification experiments produce 11% and 19% improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods on two dynamic natural scenes data sets.

Various algorithms based on learning of normal trajectory patterns have been proposed for this problem. Yet, these algorithms typically suffer from one or more limitations: They are not designed for sequential analysis of incomplete trajectories or online learning based on an incrementally updated training set. Moreover, they typically involve tuning of many parameters, including ad-hoc anomaly thresholds, and may therefore suffer from overfitting and poorly-calibrated alarm rates. In this article, we propose and investigate the Sequential Hausdorff Nearest-Neighbor Conformal Anomaly Detector (SHNN-CAD) for online learning and sequential anomaly detection in trajectories. This is a parameter-light algorithm that offers a well-founded approach to the calibration of the anomaly threshold. The discords algorithm, originally proposed by Keogh et al. , is another parameter-light anomaly detection algorithm that has previously been shown to have good classification performance on a wide range of time-series datasets, including trajectory data. We implement and investigate the performance of SHNN-CAD and the discords algorithm on four different labeled trajectory datasets.

In this work, we propose a density based performance prediction model specially tailored for cloud services. This model makes full use of the advantage of machine learning techniques and provides a method to predict the performance of cloud services using historical information instead of source code. Experiments verify the feasibility of our proposed method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2830-9; POD:978-1-4799-2831-6","10.1109/CLOUDCOM-ASIA.2013.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820978","machine learning;neural network;performance prediction model;regression","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Runtime","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence)","cloud service performance prediction;density based performance prediction model;historical information;machine learning techniques;neural networks;regression;resource provision;resource throughput;source code","","0","","20","","","16-19 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a decentralized localization algorithm that makes use of radio-location fingerprinting and kernel methods. The proposed algorithm consists of dividing the network into several zones, each of which having a calculator capable of emitting, receiving and processing data. By using radio-information of its zone, each calculator constructs, by means of kernel methods, a model estimating the nodes positions. Calculators estimates are then combined together, leading to final position estimates. Compared to centralized methods, this technique is more robust, less energy-consuming, with a lower processing complexity.","2219-5491;22195491","Electronic:978-0-9928626-0-2; POD:978-1-4799-3687-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6811616","decentralized processing;fingerprinting;localization;machine learning;wireless sensor networks","Calculators;Kernel;Mathematical model;Robustness;Sensors;Trajectory;Wireless sensor networks","radio direction-finding;sensor placement;wireless sensor networks","decentralized localization;kernel methods;radio-location fingerprinting;sensors localization;wireless sensor networks","","0","","19","","","9-13 Sept. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the increasing number of SON functions the probability of conflicts and dependencies between them increases and become more challenging to handle. In this paper an integrated approach for two SON functions, namely handover optimization and load balancing combined with admission control is presented. In this approach the conflicts are solved using the combination of Fuzzy Q-Learning Control (FQLC) algorithm and a heuristic Diff_Load algorithm. The novelty of this approach lies in using of FQLC for adjusting more than a single parameter, namely the handover hysteresis and the time to trigger in order to simultaneously optimize more than one SON function. Working in parallel, the Diff_Load tunes the handover offset parameter. The proposed approach has been evaluated using the LTE-Sim simulator.","2166-0077;21660077","Electronic:978-1-4799-2851-4; POD:978-1-4799-2852-1; USB:978-1-4799-2850-7","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2013.6825113","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6825113","SON;autonomic network management;cognitive networks;fuzzy logic;machine learning","Conferences;Handover;Load management;Long Term Evolution;Optimization;Vectors","Long Term Evolution;fuzzy control;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);optimisation;telecommunication congestion control","FQLC algorithm;LTE networks;LTE-SON functions;LTE-Sim simulator;admission control;fuzzy Q-learning control algorithm;handover hysteresis;handover offset parameter;handover optimization;heuristic diff_load algorithm;load balancing;self organizing networks","","3","","11","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A fully automatic system to recognize signs that starts with breaking up signs into manageable subunits is proposed. A framework for segmenting and tracking skin objects from signing videos is described. A boosting algorithm to learn a subset of weak classifiers for extracted features to combine them into a strong classifier for each sign is then applied. A joint learning strategy to share subunits across sign classes is adopted, which leads to a more efficient classification of sign gestures. Experimental results shown by the system demonstrate that the proposed approach is promising to build an effective and scalable system on real-world hand gesture recognition from continuous video sequences.","","DVD:978-1-4799-2899-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-2900-9; POD:978-1-4799-2901-6","10.1109/ICICICT.2014.6781333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781333","Sign language recognition;boosted subunits;machine learning;support vector machine","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Indexes;Support vector machines;Training","computer vision;image classification;image colour analysis;image segmentation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);object tracking;sign language recognition;skin;support vector machines;video signal processing","English sentence;SVM;boosted learning algorithm;continuous video sequence;feature extraction;joint learning strategy;sign gesture classification;sign language gesture recognition;sign language gesture segmentation;sign translation;signing videos;skin colour model;skin object tracking;strong classifier;support vector machines;vision-based sign language recognition;weak classifiers","","0","","17","","","7-8 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"SeLeCT: Self-Learning Classifier for Internet Traffic","L. Grimaudo; M. Mellia; E. Baralis; R.

The most popular current solutions - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and statistical classification, deeply rely on the availability of a training set. Besides the cumbersome need to regularly update the signatures, their visibility is limited to classes the classifier has been trained for. Unsupervised algorithms have been envisioned as a viable alternative to automatically identify classes of traffic. However, the accuracy achieved so far does not allow to use them for traffic classification in practical scenario. To address the above issues, we propose SeLeCT, a Self-Learning Classifier for Internet Traffic. It uses unsupervised algorithms along with an adaptive seeding approach to automatically let classes of traffic emerge, being identified and labeled. Unlike traditional classifiers, it requires neither a-priori knowledge of signatures nor a training set to extract the signatures. Instead, SeLeCT automatically groups flows into pure (or homogeneous) clusters using simple statistical features. SeLeCT simplifies label assignment (which is still based on some manual intervention) so that proper class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, SeLeCT uses an iterative seeding approach to boost its ability to cope with new protocols and applications. We evaluate the performance of SeLeCT using traffic traces collected in different years from various ISPs located in 3 different continents. Our experiments show that SeLeCT achieves excellent precision and recall, with overall accuracy close to 98%. Unlike state-of-art classifiers, the biggest advantage of SeLeCT is its ability to discover new protocols and applications in an almost automated fashion.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2014.011714.130505","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725830","Traffic classification;clustering;self-seeding;unsupervised machine learning","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Servers;Training","Internet;computer network management;feature extraction;iterative methods;pattern classification;pattern clustering;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","DPI;ISP;Internet traffic;SeLeCT;a-priori knowledge;adaptive seeding approach;class labels;deep packet inspection;homogeneous clusters;iterative seeding approach;label assignment;network management;network visibility;precision and recall;protocols;security;self-learning classifier;signature extraction;statistical classification;statistical features;traffic classification;traffic engineering;traffic traces;training set;unsupervised algorithms","","8","","23","","20140128","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
