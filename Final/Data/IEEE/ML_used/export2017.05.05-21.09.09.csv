For PMLM control system, the output of position control can be divided into a stable value and a changing one when the controlled system is close to stable state. A stable parameter value is acquired from the output of a traditional fuzzy controller when the controlled system comes into the stable state. And the stable parameter value can be tuned by a designed integral part so as to alleviate the static error.

To circumvent the above problems, we present a novel color calibration model based on support vector regression (SVR) method in this paper. First, a new colorchecker which provides a suitable reference for the following color calibration is produced by color clustering of 322 tongue images.

Besides this, the new framework also provides the fusion rules based on max-likelihood theory, which is proposed by us firstly and allows fusion on a systematic statistical theory.

Experimental results show that the algorithm is efficient on simple and sparse datasets when minimum support is high to some degree, and it overcomes some limitations of the previous mining methods.

One of the major issues with the MFCCs is that they are very sensitive to additive noises. In this paper, two methods for robust speech front-ends are proposed. One is to use a predictive difference function to calculate the differential power spectrums (DPS) as precisely as possible in order to restore the power spectrum of its original clean speech. The spectrum in the traditional MFCC calculation is then replaced with this estimated spectrum and the extracted features based on this are referred to as predictive differential power spectrum (PDPS) based cepstral coefficients (PDPSCCs). The other is to incorporate subband power information with subband mel-spectrum centroid information after the outputs of traditional mel-filter banks. The extracted features based on this are referred to as subband mel-spectrum centroid (SMSC) based cepstral coefficients (SMSCCCs). PDPSCCs and SMSCCCs with cepstral mean subtraction (CMS) based, spectral subtraction (SS) based, and differential power spectrum (DPS) based cepstral coefficients are compared at different noise levels. Experimental results show that the PDPSCCs and SMSCCCs are more effective in enhancing the robustness of a speaker recognition system, where with the CMS method the average error rate can be reduced by 12.2% in comparison with DPS based cepstral coefficients.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527796","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527796","Robust;difference function;speaker recognition;subband","Additive noise;Cepstral analysis;Collision mitigation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Mel frequency cepstral coefficient;Noise level;Noise robustness;Speaker recognition;Speech","cepstral analysis;feature extraction;filtering theory;noise;speech recognition","feature extraction;mel-filter bank;mel-scaled frequency cepstral coefficient;predictive differential power spectrum;speaker recognition;stationary noises;subband mel-spectrum centroid","","0","","18","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assuming resource owners have a preemptive priority, we propose an adaptive algorithm of jobs scheduling based on time balancing strategy, which solves the parallel computing tasks by using the idle resources in computational grid. A mathematical model is developed to predict performance, which also considers systems with heterogeneous machine utilization and heterogeneous service distribution. The model separates the influence of machine utilization, job service rate and parallel task allocation on the completion time. According to the time balancing policy, a task is partitioned into several subtasks and scheduled, and the costs of communication are reduced. The expected value of parallel task completion time is predicted with performance model. To get better parallel computing performance, an optimal subset of heterogeneous resources with the shortest parallel executing time of tasks can be selected with the efficient algorithm.

To tackle this problem, the information fusion technique based on network output errors and partial derivative errors, and enhanced convergence technique based on the local equalization of samples output errors are presented in this paper. These new techniques effectively improve neural network generalization through direct utilization of network partial derivative errors and enhancement of local equalization of samples output errors.

It is known that relatively few large wavelet coefficients carry the essential information of an image. These coefficients tend to cluster around the location of important feature in the image, such as edge discontinuities, peaks, and corners. This spatial clustering property is expressed in a prior model in the Bayesian framework. This paper proposes a novel prior model that models the configurations of the wavelet coefficients as a MRF. This model is adaptive to the wavelet transform character of two-dimension images that significant coefficients form clusters with predominantly the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction in each orientation subband. This prior model consequently effects the manipulation of the coefficients and a spatially adaptive Bayesian shrinkage function is obtained. Experimental results demonstrate this method can effectively suppress additive Gaussian white noise and preserve the details of the image.

We conducted several simulations with large training datasets, which demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has similar performance or is marginally better compared with KDR whilst having the advantage of computational efficiency. Further, we applied the proposed dimension reduction algorithm to face recognition in which the number of training samples is very small.

The development of intelligent early-warning systems of dam safety (IEWSDS) is a significant approach to realize above aim. This paper regarded dam as a vital and intelligent system, thereby constructed a bionics model of dam safety, which consisted of sensing system (nerve), central processing unit (cerebrum) and decision-making implement (organism). With above model and systems engineering, this paper designed an IEWSDS, which was composed of integration control, intelligent inference machine, project database, model base, graphics base and input/output modules. In the system, metadata base based on object oriented data model was used to implement the integration of homogeneous or nonhomogeneous databases storing dam safety data from different information sources. The multilevel link style was adopted to manage model base. Intelligent inference machine is the central processing unit of IEWSDS implementing data analysis, abnormality diagnosis and evaluation for dam safety. Because of strong non-linear and dynamic characteristics, the system adopted a combination model based on wavelet networks to approximate and forecast the run characteristics of dam. The abnormality diagnosis is a process of discovering knowledge on the pattern between of disease and geneses. The methods of attributions reduction in rough sets theory were presented to diagnose adaptively the abnormal cases and find out the geneses. The safety status of dam changes dynamically, which emerges in the quantitative and qualitative change manners. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative changes need be considered comprehensively in the process of dam safety evaluation. This paper proposed an extension evaluation method. The quantitative change and qualitative change of dam safety property were integrated into a matter-element. Base- - d on the matter-element extensibility, the contradictory problem for dam safety elevation can be solved. In practice, the proposed system has been used to monitor dam safety successfully. The applications show that the bionics model is feasible; the proposed key technologies are effective. The systems can supply technical support for improving the level of dam safety management, extending normal run time of dam and voiding dam failure.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527250","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527250","Bionics;Dam safety;Extension theory;Intelligent early-warning systems;Rough sets theory;Wavelet networks","Central Processing Unit;Data engineering;Decision making;Intelligent systems;Machine intelligence;Object oriented databases;Object oriented modeling;Organisms;Prototypes;Safety","biocybernetics;dams;data analysis;data mining;data models;fault diagnosis;knowledge based systems;meta data;object-oriented databases;power engineering computing;rough set theory;safety","abnormality diagnosis;bionics model;central processing unit;dam failure;dam safety evaluation;dam safety management;data analysis;decision making;graphics base;homogeneous databases;input/output modules;integration control;intelligent early-warning system;intelligent inference machine;knowledge discovery;matter-element extensibility;metadata base;nonhomogeneous databases;object oriented data model;project database;real-time diagnosis;rough sets theory;sensing system;wavelet networks","","1","","20","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experiment results from two synthetic image sequences demonstrate the robustness of solutions and the feasibility of our algorithm.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527885","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527885","3D non-rigid Motion;MRF;Simulated annealing algorithm;least squared method","Deformable models;Educational institutions;Image motion analysis;Image sequences;Motion analysis;Motion estimation;Parametric statistics;Robustness;Shape;Simulated annealing","Markov processes;feature extraction;image sequences;least squares approximations;motion estimation;object recognition;random processes;simulated annealing;statistical distributions","3D nonrigid motion estimation;Markov random field;constraint relation;energy function;feature analysis;joint probability distribution;least squared method;monocular image sequence;motion model;nonrigid object;simulated annealing","","1","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the recently proposed discriminative common vectors (DCV) method successfully overcomes these drawbacks with high performance in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and numerical stability. In this paper, the second algorithm in the DCV based on the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization is extended to the nonlinear case by using kernel method. The Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure in feature space is first presented. Then the algorithm for KDCV is developed which involves performing the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure twice in feature space. Experiments on ORL database indicate that the proposed KDCV method achieves higher recognition rate than the DCV method.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527750","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527750","Discriminative common vectors;Fisher linear discriminant analysis;face recognition;kernel method;small sample size","Face recognition;Feature extraction;Helium;Iterative algorithms;Kernel;Linear discriminant analysis;Numerical stability;Principal component analysis;Scattering;Vectors","face recognition;feature extraction;image sampling;matrix algebra;statistical analysis;vectors","Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure;LDA;ORL database;face recognition;feature space;kernel discriminative common vectors;kernel matrices;linear discriminant analysis","","3","","8","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But this is not the case in current STA researches. In previous studies, researchers just organize relevant STA functions according to cognitive level, but pay little attention to the real decision making procedure. To solve this problem, the concept of group analysis and a functional model of it are proposed in this paper with a view not to the cognitive level but to the procedure of military decision making. Then a STA model based on group analysis is established. This model forms the awareness of the whole situation part by part and level by level which is in accord with commanders’ cognition procedure. Thus it not only makes the decision aiding more efficiently but also makes the design of military decision support system more conveniently.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526972","Situation Assessment;decision support;group analysis","Cognition;Computer aided instruction;Decision making;Decision support systems;Helium;Information analysis;Information management;Management information systems;Surface acoustic waves;Technology management","","Situation Assessment;decision support;group analysis","","3","","6","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presented guidance law needs accurate information on the accelerations of the target both in tangential direction and in normal direction, and on the value of velocity and velocity heading angle of the target, and hence, their estimation methods are also given. The dynamics of missile has great influence on the miss distance of missile, hence, the compensation method to the dynamics of missile is further studied in this paper. Simulation results have shown that when the dynamics of missile is considered in the simulation, it is very easy to miss the target if no compensation to the dynamics of missile is considered in the guidance law design, but the accuracy of hitting target can be greatly improved if compensation to the dynamics of missile in the guidance law design is considered.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527006","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527006","Compensation;Guidance;Least squares estimation;Lyapunov stability","Acceleration;Closed-form solution;Equations;Feedback;Geometry;Least squares approximation;Lyapunov method;Missiles;Navigation;Sliding mode control","","Compensation;Guidance;Least squares estimation;Lyapunov stability","","0","","8","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
