The framework consists of machine-learning algorithms for predicting driving environments and generating the optimal power split of the HEV system for a given driving environment. In this paper, we present the following three online intelligent energy controllers: 1) IEC_HEV_SISE; 2) IEC_HEV_MISE ; and 3) IEC_HEV_MIME. All three online intelligent energy controllers were trained within the machine-learning framework ML_EMO_HEV to generate the best combination of engine power and battery power in real time such that the total fuel consumption over the whole driving cycle is minimized while still meeting the driver's demand and the system constraints, including engine, motor, battery, and generator operation limits. The three online controllers were integrated into the Ford Escape hybrid vehicle model for online performance evaluation. Based on their performances on ten test drive cycles provided by the Powertrain Systems Analysis Toolkit library, we can conclude that the roadway type and traffic congestion level specific machine learning of optimal energy management is effective for in-vehicle energy control. The best controller, IEC_HEV_MISE, trained with the optimal power split generated by the DP optimization algorithm with multiple initial SOC points and single ending point, can provide fuel savings ranging from 5% to 19%.

"A hybrid heuristics-statistical peer-to-peer traffic classifier","M. M. Hassan; M. N.

This work proposes a novel hybrid heuristics-statistical approach to classify P2P traffic. Heuristics approach provides highly accurate P2P detection, although it involves measuring and analyzing of many correlations between packets and flows for certain duration of time, which make it inapplicable for online P2P traffic classification. On the other hand, statistical classification can classify traffic in an online manner although it needs periodical, often manual, retraining. The proposed hybrid solution merges these two approaches: offline heuristics learning corpus generation and online statistical classification. In the first part, heuristics are used to classify traffic flows into three classes, two which are later used for training the online statistical classifier. This work presents an enhancement on the existing heuristics P2P classification by adding a new class for unknown traffic. Analyses on the offline traces using the improved heuristics show that the addition of the third class reduces the class noise from 7% to 2%, hence, providing quality examples to retrain the online statistical classifier. For the second part, machine learning (ML) algorithms are used to classify traffic on the fly based on the flows and packets statistics. Using examples generated by the heuristics classifier, the overall statistical classification accuracy is 99% based on analysis on downloaded and captured traces.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5157-7; POD:978-1-4673-5155-3","10.1109/ICCSII.2012.6454475","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6454475","Heuristics Classification;Hybrid Classifier;Machine Learning;Peer-to-peer","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Payloads;Peer to peer computing;Ports (Computers);Training","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;peer-to-peer computing;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","Internet bandwidth;P2P detection;flow correlation;hybrid heuristics-statistical peer-to-peer traffic classifier;machine learning algorithm;offline heuristics learning corpus generation;offline trace;online P2P traffic classification;online statistical classification;packet correlation;packet statistics;trace analysis;unknown traffic","","0","","17","","","18-20 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead, actions are directly mapped onto the perceptual transitions that they bring about, eliminating the need for intermediate representation and significantly reducing training requirements. We here set out a very general learning framework for cognitive systems in which online learning of the P-A mapping may be conducted within a symbolic processing context, so that complex contextual reasoning can influence the P-A mapping. In utilizing a variational calculus approach to define a suitable objective function, the P-A mapping can be treated as an online learning problem via gradient descent using partial derivatives. Our central theoretical result is to demonstrate top-down modulation of low-level perceptual confidences via the Jacobian of the higher levels of a subsumptive P-A hierarchy. Thus, the separation of the Jacobian as a multiplying factor between levels within the objective function naturally enables the integration of abstract symbolic manipulation in the form of fuzzy deductive logic into the P-A mapping learning. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting framework achieves significantly better accuracy than using P-A learning without top-down modulation. We also demonstrate that it permits novel forms of context-dependent multilevel P-A mapping, applying the mechanism in the context of an intelligent driver assistance system.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2202109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6232463","Autonomous agents;fuzzy logic (FL);hierarchical systems;machine learning;online learning;perception–action (P–A) learning;subsumption architectures;vehicle safety","Abstracts;Adaptation models;Cognition;Context;Detectors;Fuzzy logic;Vehicles","cognitive systems;driver information systems;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;gradient methods;symbol manipulation;variational techniques","Jacobian;P-A mapping learning;abstract symbolic manipulation;cognitive system building;complex contextual reasoning;context-dependent multilevel P-A mapping;environment-representation/action-planning approaches;fuzzy deductive logic;fuzzy reasoning;gradient descent;hierarchical perception-action learning;intelligent driver assistance system;low-level perceptual confidences;objective function;online learning problem;partial derivatives;perceptual transitions;subsumptive P-A hierarchy;symbolic processing context;top-down modulation;training requirement reduction;variational calculus approach","0","5","","39","","20120705","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This limits scalability and poses a problem for practical deployment in network core or edge routers. In this paper we propose and evaluate subflow packet sampling (SPS) to reduce an ML sub-flow classifier's resource requirements with minimal compromise of accuracy.

Today's smart phones are equipped with increasingly more sensors and accessible data types that enable the collection of literally dozens of signals regarding the phone, its user, and their environment. A great deal of research effort in academia and industry is put into mining this data for higher level sense-making, such as understanding user context, inferring social networks, learning individual features, and so on. In many cases this analysis work is the result of exploratory forays and trial-and-error. Adding to the challenge, the devices themselves are limited platforms, hence data collection campaign must be carefully designed in order to collect the signals in the appropriate frequency, avoiding the exhausting the the device's limited battery and processing power. Currently however, there is no structured methodology for the design of mobile data collection and analysis initiatives. In this work we investigate the properties of learning and inference of real world data collected via mobile phones over time. In particular, we analyze how the ability to predict individual parameters and social links is incrementally enhanced with the accumulation of additional data. To do so we use the Friends and Family dataset, containing rich data signals gathered from the smart phones of 140 adult members of an MIT based young-family residential community for over a year, and is one of the most comprehensive mobile phone datasets gathered in academia to date. We develop several models for predicting social and individual properties from sensed mobile phone data over time, including detection of life-partners, ethnicity, and whether a person is a student or not. Finally, we propose a method for predicting the maximal learning accuracy possible for the learning task at hand, based on an initial set of measure- ents. This has various practical implications, such as better design of mobile data collection campaigns, or evaluating of planned analysis strategies.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4848-7; POD:978-1-4673-5638-1","10.1109/SocialCom-PASSAT.2012.102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406354","Incremental Learning;Machine Learning;Mobile Networks","Accuracy;Communities;Sensors;Smart phones;Social network services","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);smart phones;social sciences computing","Friends and Family dataset;accuracy prediction;behavioral sensing;data collection;data mining;environmental sensing;ethnicity detection;incremental learning;individual property prediction;life-partner detection;mobile phone;smart phone;social network;social property prediction;social sensing;ubiquitous wearable computer","","1","","30","","","3-5 Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presence of unreliable raters can prolong the rating process, make it more expensive and lead to inaccurate ratings. The dominant, ""static"" approach of solving this problem in state-of-the-art research is to estimate the rater reliability and to calculate the target ratings when all ratings have been gathered. However, doing it dynamically while raters rate training data can make the acquisition of ratings faster and cheaper compared to static techniques. We propose to cast the problem of the dynamic estimation of rater reliability as a multi-armed bandit problem. Experiments show that the usage of multi-armed bandits for this problem is worthwhile, providing that each rater can rate any asset when asked.

It has a wide variety of real-world applications, e.g., automatic image annotations and gene function analysis. Current research on multilabel classification focuses on supervised settings which assume existence of large amounts of labeled training data. However, in many applications, the labeling of multilabeled data is extremely expensive and time consuming, while there are often abundant unlabeled data available. In this paper, we study the problem of transductive multilabel learning and propose a novel solution, called Trasductive Multilabel Classification (TraM), to effectively assign a set of multiple labels to each instance. Different from supervised multilabel learning methods, we estimate the label sets of the unlabeled instances effectively by utilizing the information from both labeled and unlabeled data. We first formulate the transductive multilabel learning as an optimization problem of estimating label concept compositions. Then, we derive a closed-form solution to this optimization problem and propose an effective algorithm to assign label sets to the unlabeled instances. Empirical studies on several real-world multilabel learning tasks demonstrate that our TraM method can effectively boost the performance of multilabel classification by using both labeled and unlabeled data.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2011.141","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5936063","Data mining;machine learning;multilabel learning;semi-supervised learning;transductive learning;unlabeled data","Closed-form solution;Data mining;Learning systems;Machine learning;Optimization;Semisupervised learning;Training data","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification","TRAM method;closed-form solution;data mining;label concept composition estimation;label set propagation;labeled training data;multilabel classification problem;multiple class labels;optimization problem;supervised multilabel learning methods;transductive multilabel learning;trasductive multilabel classification;unlabeled data;unlabeled instances","","35","","42","","20110630","March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The dimensionality of the binary codon encoding is less than that of an orthogonal encoding which requires less computations. Protein secondary structure prediction is an important step for machine learning techniques ultimately applied for protein 3D structure prediction. In the proposed model, one-stage binary support vector machines are employed, and the efficiency of the codon encoding to that of a commonly used orthogonal encoding are compared without incorporating protein evolutionary and structural information for an unbiased comparison. The performance of the classification model is measured according to Q<sub>3</sub> and segment overlap (SOV) scores. The scores are compared with those of the prediction methods using an orthogonal encoding and protein sequence profiles. The experimental results indicate higher prediction accuracy based on Q<sub>3</sub> SOV scores when sequence profiles are not used. Also, the relative classification scores of the proposed method are comparable with the methods incorporating protein global and evolutionary information. The experimental result implies the encoding scheme is able to integrate the evolutionary information into the prediction model since the encoding is based on genetic codon mappings which are the building blocks of amino acid formations at the primary level of biological processes. The codon encoding is worthwhile to be investigated using more complex learning architectures with the profiles and structural properties of proteins.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2747-3; POD:978-1-4673-2746-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2012.6470326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470326","amino acids;machine learning;protein secondary structure;support vector machines","Accuracy;Amino acids;Encoding;Prediction methods;Protein sequence;Support vector machines","biological techniques;biology computing;genetics;molecular configurations;proteins;proteomics;support vector machines","Q3 SOV scores;Q<sub>3</sub> SOV scores;amino acid formations;binary codon encoding;biological processes;classification model performance;codon encoding scheme;genetic codon mappings;machine learning techniques;orthogonal encoding;protein 3D structure prediction;protein evolutionary information;protein global information;protein secondary structure prediction model;protein sequence profiles;protein structural information;segment overlap scores;support vector machines","","2","","34","","","4-7 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, there exists a large variability in the morphology of seizure and background patterns, both across patients and over time. This has resulted in relatively poor performance from systems which have been tested over large datasets. Here, the benefits of employing a pattern recognition approach are discussed. Such a system may use numerous features paired with nonlinear classifiers. In particular, two types of nonlinear classifiers are contrasted for the task. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed architecture allows for efficient classifier combination which improves the performance of the algorithm. The resulting automated detector is shown to achieve field leading performance.

However, SVM cannot effectively solve online classification problems since, when a new sample is misclassified, the classifier has to be retrained with all training samples plus the new sample, which is time consuming. According to the geometric characteristics of SVM, in this paper we propose an online SVM classifier called VS-OSVM, which is based on convex hull vertices selection within each class. The VS-OSVM algorithm has two steps: 1) the samples selection process, in which a small number of skeleton samples constituting an approximate convex hull in each class of the current training samples are selected and 2) the online updating process, in which the classifier is updated with newly arriving samples and the selected skeleton samples. From the theoretical point of view, the first <i>d</i>+1 (<i>d</i> is the dimension of the input samples) selected samples are proved to be vertices of the convex hull. This guarantees that the selected samples in our approach keep the greatest amount of information of the convex hull. From the application point of view, the new algorithm can update the classifier without reducing its classification performance. Experimental results on benchmark data sets have shown the validity and effectiveness of the VS-OSVM algorithm.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2238556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6420961","Kernel;machine learning;online classifier;samples selection;support vector machine","Learning systems;Optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Skeleton;Support vector machines;System-on-a-chip;Training","geometry;interactive programming;pattern classification;support vector machines","VS-OSVM algorithm;convex hull vertices selection;geometric characteristics;online classification;online support vector machine","","11","","61","","20130125","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The new MMF score is set to be the nonlinear combination of scores from multiple methods with suitable weights obtained by a training process. In order to improve the regression results further, we divide distorted images into three to five groups based on the distortion types and perform regression within each group, which is called “context-dependent MMF” (CD-MMF). One task in CD-MMF is to determine the context automatically, which is achieved by a machine learning approach. To further reduce the complexity of MMF, we perform algorithms to select a small subset from the candidate method set. The result is very good even if only three quality assessment methods are included in the fusion process.

Many techniques have been developed to analyze time series and understand the system that produces them. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach to improve the accuracy of time series classifiers by using Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The proposed approach is based on the principle of learning by mistakes. A HMM model is trained using the confusion matrices which are normally used to measure the classification accuracy. Misclassified samples are the basis of learning process. Our approach improves the classification accuracy by executing a second cycle of classification taking into account the temporal relations in the data. The objective of the proposed approach is to utilize the strengths of Hidden Markov Models (dealing with temporal data) to complement the weaknesses of other classification techniques. Consequently, instead of finding single isolated patterns, we focus on understanding the relationships between these patterns. The proposed approach was evaluated with a case study. The target of the case study was to classify real drilling data generated by rig sensors. Experimental evaluation proves the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5116-4; POD:978-1-4673-5114-0","10.1109/HIS.2012.6421385","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6421385","Hidden Markov Model;Machine learning;Time series Classification","Analytical models;Classification algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Silicon;Tin;Training","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);oil drilling;pattern classification;time series","HMM;business domains;confusion matrices;finance;gas industry;hidden Markov models;learning process;medicine;oil industry;real drilling data;rig sensors;time series classification","","1","","11","","","4-7 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here, we explore the applicability of several ligand-target kernels by extensively evaluating the prediction performance of ligand-target interactions on five target families, and reveal how different combinations of ligand kernels and protein kernels affect the performance and also how the performance varies between the target families.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2747-3; POD:978-1-4673-2746-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2012.6470295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470295","computational chemogenomics;kernels;ligand-target interactions;machine learning","Accuracy;Compounds;Drugs;Fingerprint recognition;Kernel;Proteins;Vectors","biochemistry;biology computing;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;proteins","chemogenomic approach;computational techniques;drug discovery;kernel-based machine learning approach;ligand-target interactions;ligand-target kernels;protein kernels","","0","","35","","","4-7 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, this research strives to improve topic models in the `real time' environment of online learning. In total, seventeen different nuclear radioisotopes are classified, and performance of Higher-Order versus traditional techniques is evaluated. This project employs LDA and HO-LDA on a nuclear detection numeric dataset to gain a topic decomposition of instances. These learned topics are then used as features in a traditional supervised classification algorithm. In essence, the LDA or HO-LDA topic assignments are used as features in supervised learning algorithms that predict the class (isotope), treating LDA or HO-LDA as a feature space transform. Using Topic Modeling on numeric nuclear detection data is cutting edge, as to our knowledge this has never been done before on a nuclear detection dataset. Two methods of feature transformation are evaluated, including Multinomial Feature Creation and Maximum Channel Value Feature Creation. Results demonstrate further evidence that Higher Order Learning techniques can be usefully applied in topic modeling applied to nuclear detection.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2709-1; POD:978-1-4673-2708-4","10.1109/THS.2012.6459923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459923","HO-LDA;LDA;higher-order latent Dirichlet allocation;higher-order learning;higher-order topic modeling;latent Dirichlet allocation;machine learning;nuclear detection;topic modeling","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Isotopes;Measurement;Resource management;Standards","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);national security;pattern classification;public administration;radiation detection;radioisotopes;signal classification;spectral analysis","HO-LDA;class prediction;feature space transform;feature transformation;higher order learning framework;higher-order latent Dirichlet allocation;higher-order topic modeling;homeland security;isotope prediction;maximum channel value feature creation;multinomial feature creation;nuclear detection numeric dataset;nuclear radioisotope classification;online learning;supervised classification algorithm;supervised learning algorithm;topic assignment;topic decomposition;topic learning","","1","","11","","","13-15 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One problem in using SVM in portable devices is that the implementation cost is usually high. In our research, we have tried to reduced this cost through dimensionality reduction (DR). Since the implementation cost of the DR part should also be considered in a restricted computing platform, we adopted a simple centroid based DR.

A main drawback of manifold learning methods is, however, that there are no explicit mappings from the input data manifold to the output embedding. This prohibits the application of manifold learning methods in many practical problems such as classification and target detection. Previously, in order to provide explicit mappings for manifold learning methods, many methods have been proposed to get an approximate explicit representation mapping with the assumption that there exists a linear projection between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional embedding. However, this linearity assumption may be too restrictive. In this paper, an explicit nonlinear mapping is proposed for manifold learning, based on the assumption that there exists a polynomial mapping between the high-dimensional data samples and their low-dimensional representations. As far as we know, this is the hrst time that an explicit nonlinear mapping for manifold learning is given. In particular, we apply this to the method of locally linear embedding and derive an explicit nonlinear manifold learning algorithm, which is named neighborhood preserving polynomial embedding. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed mapping is much more effective in preserving the local neighborhood information and the nonlinear geometry of the high-dimensional data samples than previous work.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TSMCB.2012.2198916","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6220279","Data mining;machine learning;manifold learning;nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NDR)","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Kernel;Learning systems;Manifolds;Optimization;Polynomials;Training data","geometry;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;polynomials","classification;computer science;explicit nonlinear mapping;high-dimensional data samples;input data manifold;linear projection;linearity assumption;low-dimensional embedding;low-dimensional representations;manifold learning methods;neighborhood preserving polynomial embedding;nonlinear geometry;nonlinear manifold learning algorithm;output embedding;polynomial mapping;real-world data;representation mapping;synthetic data;target detection","","15","","42","","20120618","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In our work we identified a set of features related to listings, sellers and product categories, and built a system for fraud prediction taking into account the high class imbalance of real data, since fraud is a relatively rare event. The identified features are all based on publically accessible data, opening the possibility of developing fraud prediction systems independent of site operators.

Namely, in contrast to classical approaches which train a single classifier regardless of the relative position of the candidate (thus ignoring valuable pose information), a region-dependent analysis is performed by considering four different areas. In addition, a study on the evolution of the classification performance according to the dimensionality of the principal subspace is carried out using PCA features within a SVM-based classification scheme. Indeed, the experiments performed on a publicly available database prove that PCA dimensionality requirements are region-dependent. Hence, in this work, the optimal configuration is adapted to each of them, rendering very good vehicle verification results.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4673-2533-2; POD:978-1-4673-2534-9; USB:978-1-4673-2532-5","10.1109/ICIP.2012.6466894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6466894","Hypothesis verification;Intelligent vehicles;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Vehicle database","Accuracy;Databases;Feature extraction;Lighting;Principal component analysis;Vehicle detection;Vehicles","driver information systems;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;pose estimation;principal component analysis;road vehicles;video signal processing","PCA dimensionality requirements;PCA features;SVM-based classification scheme;classification performance;collision avoidance;optimal configuration;pose information;principal component analysis;principal subspace;publicly available database;region-dependent analysis;region-dependent vehicle classification;supervised learning;vehicle verification;video-based vehicle detection","","1","","13","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second family assumes local similarity of the data and these approaches estimate the prediction intervals with use of the sample's nearest neighbors. The comparison shows that the first family strives to produce valid prediction intervals whereas the second family strives for optimality. We propose a statistic for model selection where we compare the discrepancy between valid and optimal prediction intervals.

Alternatively, we propose to achieve AL with optimal subset selection (ALOSS), where the key is to find an instance subset with a maximum utility value. To achieve the goal, ALOSS simultaneously considers the following: 1) the importance of individual instances and 2) the disparity between instances, to build an instance-correlation matrix. As a result, AL is transformed to a semidefinite programming problem to select a <i>k</i>-instance subset with a maximum utility value.

However, understanding the multiple `aspects' that contribute to users' ratings may help us to better understand their individual preferences. For example, a user's impression of an audio book presumably depends on aspects such as the story and the narrator, and knowing their opinions on these aspects may help us to recommend better products. In this paper, we build models for rating systems in which such dimensions are explicit, in the sense that users leave separate ratings for each aspect of a product. By introducing new corpora consisting of five million reviews, rated with between three and six aspects, we evaluate our models on three prediction tasks: First, we uncover which parts of a review discuss which of the rated aspects. Second, we summarize reviews by finding the sentences that best explain a user's rating. Finally, since aspect ratings are optional in many of the datasets we consider, we recover ratings that are missing from a user's evaluation. Our model matches state-of-the-art approaches on existing small-scale datasets, while scaling to the real-world datasets we introduce. Moreover, our model is able to `disentangle' content and sentiment words: we automatically learn content words that are indicative of a particular aspect as well as the aspect-specific sentiment words that are indicative of a particular rating.","1550-4786;15504786","Electronic:978-0-7695-4905-7; POD:978-1-4673-4649-8","10.1109/ICDM.2012.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413815","machine learning;segmentation;sentiment analysis;summarization","Bipartite graph;Correlation;Data models;Optimization;Predictive models;Training;Unsupervised learning","information services;learning (artificial intelligence);user interfaces","aspect rating;content word;learning attitude;learning attribute;multiaspect review;numeric score;online review;plain-text feedback;rating recovery;rating system;sentiment word;user audio book impression;user evaluation","","5","","12","","","10-13 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We developed SPAN algorithms, implemented a prototype, and evaluated it using two real-world data traces and one synthetic data trace. The results of our evaluation suggest that systems employing SPAN are able to achieve a reduced authorization latency for almost 60 percent of the requests.

Our hybrid algorithm has a Pittsburgh-style GBML framework where a rule set is coded as an individual. A Michigan-style rule-generation mechanism is used as a kind of local search. Our parallel distributed model is an island model where a population of individuals is divided into multiple islands. Training data are also divided into multiple subsets. The main feature of our model is that a different training data subset is assigned to each island. The assigned training data subsets are periodically rotated over the islands. The best rule set in each island also migrates periodically. We demonstrate through computational experiments that our model decreases the computation time of the hybrid fuzzy GBML algorithm by an order or two of magnitude using seven parallel processors without severely degrading the generalization ability of obtained fuzzy rule-based classifiers. We also examine the effects of the training data rotation and the rule set migration on the search ability of our model.","1063-6706;10636706","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2215331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6287013","Fuzzy rule-based classifiers;genetics-based machine learning;parallel distributed algorithms;training data rotation;training data stratification","Classification algorithms;Computational modeling;Genetics;Sociology;Statistics;Training;Training data","computational complexity;fuzzy set theory;knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel algorithms;pattern classification","Michigan-style rule-generation mechanism;Pittsburgh-style GBML framework;assigned training data subsets;computation time;fuzzy rule-based classifiers;generalization ability;hybrid algorithm;hybrid fuzzy GBML algorithm;hybrid fuzzy genetics-based machine learning algorithm;island model;local search;multiple islands;multiple subsets;parallel distributed hybrid fuzzy GBML models;parallel distributed model;parallel processors;rule set migration;training data rotation","","25","","60","","20120824","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They can either make wise decisions by taking advantages of other agents' experiences through learning, or make decisions earlier to avoid competitions from huge crowds. Both these two effects, social learning and negative network externality, play important roles in the decision process of an agent. While there are existing works on either social learning or negative network externality, a general study on considering both effects is still limited. We find that Chinese restaurant process, a popular random process, provides a well-defined structure to model the decision process of an agent under these two effects. By introducing the strategic behavior into the non-strategic Chinese restaurant process, we propose a new game, called the Chinese restaurant game, to formulate the social learning problem with negative network externality. Through analyzing the proposed Chinese restaurant game, we derive the optimal strategy of each agent and provide a recursive method to achieve the optimal strategy. How social learning and negative network externality influence each other under various settings is studied through simulations. We also illustrate the spectrum access problem in cognitive radio networks as one of the application of Chinese restaurant game. We find that the proposed Chinese restaurant game theoretic approach indeed helps users make better decisions and improves the overall system performance.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2012.2225053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6331562","Chinese restaurant game;Chinese restaurant process;cognitive radio;cooperative sensing;game theory;machine learning;network externality;social learning","Cognitive radio;Games;Investments;Learning systems;Machine learning;Nominations and elections;Social network services","game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;random processes;social sciences","decision process;game theory;intelligent agents;negative network externality;nonstrategic Chinese restaurant process;optimal strategy;random process;recursive method;sequential Chinese restaurant game;social learning;social network;strategic behavior","","20","","31","","20121016","Feb.1, 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Researchers have proposed various classification algorithms and practitioners have applied them to various application domains, while most of the classification algorithms are designed with a focus on classification performance rather than interpretability or understandability of the models built using the algorithms. ROUSER is specifically designed to extract human understandable decision rules from nominal data. What distinguishes ROUSER from most, if not all, other rule-based classification algorithms is that it utilizes a rough set approach to decide an attribute-value pair for the antecedents of a rule. Moreover, the rule generation method of ROUSER is based on the separate-and-conquer strategy, and hence it is more efficient than the indiscernibility matrix method that is widely adopted in the classification algorithms based on the rough set theory.

The coefficients of this prediction function are based on a data set that is used to shape this function. However, sometimes the dataset, which is used to generate the prediction function of the logistic regression, would have some odds and need to be smoothened to avoid under or over-fitting. Thus, a mathematical regularization part has been introduced to be added to the cost function of logistic regression and it mainly contains an important parameter which is called the regularization parameter that would have to be determined. Often, this regularization parameter is pre-set or pre-expected by the code developer. Few random values would be tested and judged by the accuracy rate of the prediction function applied on the testing set. Obviously, it's neither effective nor practical approach to choose a parameter that would concretely play an important role in varying the accuracy of the prediction function. In this paper, we propose a mathematical approach to tune the regularization parameter in order to achieve the highest accuracy rate possible. Our idea is basically vectorizing the value of the regularization parameter that is fed to the cost function for the purpose of testing its accuracy. Hence, a vectorized value of the accuracy would be produced and each will correspond to a specific value of the regularization parameter. Lastly, the regularization parameter value which produced the highest accuracy rate would be the obvious suitable choice for the prediction function.","1738-9445;17389445","Electronic:978-89-968650-1-8; POD:978-1-4673-3148-7","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488130","logistic regression;machine learning;regularization parameter tuning;regularized logistic regression","Logistics;Tuning","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;random processes;regression analysis","code developer;cost function;data set;logistic regression analysis method;mathematical approach;mathematical regularization;prediction function coefficients;random values;regularization parameter tuning optimization approach;regularization parameter value vectorization","","0","","15","","","27-30 Jan. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the frequency range of operation is very wide in a CR network (CRN) and, usually, CRs cannot scan all the channels simultaneously, one of the fundamental tasks for a CR is the channel selection strategy, which directly impacts its performance. In this paper, we present a distributed polynomial time algorithmic framework for computing channel strategies in a CRN with no assumption on the distribution followed by the primary users' channel occupancy. For a secondary user (SU), the upper bound on the gap between the expected profit obtained at each time slot by using the global optimal strategy and the expected profit by using our algorithm is guaranteed to be arbitrarily small when the time horizon is sufficiently large.

Depends on the data given, the performance of the NN can vary significantly. In fact, if the training data are close to the true decision boundary (DB), the NN can generalize well. On the other hand, if the given data are far away from the true DB, the DB formed by the NN can be very different from the original one, and the genelization ability of the NN cannot be high. Based on this observation, we propose a new concept called decision boundary learning (DBL) in this study. A direct way for DBL is to approximate the true DB using a support vector machine (SVM), and then find a set of training patterns using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Experimental results on four public databases show that the training patterns so obtained may generate much better NNs, and in all cases, the NNs are comparable to or better than SVMs, although they are much simpler.","2325-5986;23255986","Electronic:978-1-4673-2112-9; POD:978-1-4673-2111-2","10.1109/iCAwST.2012.6469586","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6469586","Evolutionaly Algorithm;Machine Learning;Neural Network;Particle Swarm Optimization;Support Vector Machine","","","","","1","","11","","","21-24 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new hybrid fusion procedure, called variational Bayesian importance sampling (VBIS), is then introduced to combine the strengths of variational Bayes approximations and fast Monte Carlo methods to produce reliable posterior estimates for Gaussian priors and softmax likelihoods. VBIS is then extended to more general fusion problems that involve complex Gaussian mixture (GM) priors and multimodal softmax likelihoods, leading to accurate GM approximations of highly non-Gaussian fusion posteriors for a wide range of robot sensor data and soft human data. Experiments for hardware-based multitarget search missions with a cooperative human-autonomous robot team show that humans can serve as highly informative sensors through proper data modeling and fusion, and that VBIS provides reliable and scalable Bayesian fusion estimates via GMs.","1552-3098;15523098","","10.1109/TRO.2012.2214556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6301744","Bayesian methods;Gaussian mixtures;Monte Carlo methods;human-robot interaction;machine learning;recursive state estimation;robot sensor fusion;variational Bayes","Approximation methods;Bayesian methods;Data models;Humans;Robot sensing systems","Bayes methods;approximation theory;cooperative systems;human-robot interaction;importance sampling;multi-robot systems;recursive estimation;sensor fusion;state estimation;variational techniques","Bayesian multicategorical soft data fusion;GM approximations;VBIS;ambiguous human-generated categorical information;complex Gaussian mixture priors;cooperative human-autonomous robot team;data modeling;fast Monte Carlo method;hardware-based multitarget search mission;human-robot collaboration;hybrid continuous-to-discrete likelihood;hybrid fusion procedure;multimodal softmax likelihoods;nonGaussian fusion posteriors;posterior estimates;robot sensor data;robot sensor information;soft human data;softmax likelihoods;variational Bayes approximation;variational Bayesian importance sampling","","10","","45","","20120912","Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our NMF variant employs the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a cost function and imposes a temporal smoothness constraint to the activations. It is solved by a majorization-minimization technique. The approach proposed is meant to be generic and is particularly well suited to applications where the structuring patterns may overlap in time. As such, it is evaluated on two person-oriented video structuring tasks (one using the visual modality and the second the audio). This is done using a challenging database of political debate videos.

We propose a framework that preprocesses and analyzes these log files. HTTP queries are transformed to numerical matrices using n-gram analysis. The dimensionality of these matrices is reduced using principal component analysis and diffusion map methodology. Abnormal log lines can then be analyzed in more detail. We expand our previous work by elaborating the cluster analysis after obtaining the low-dimensional representation.

The classifier is first trained on software history, and then used to predict if an impending change causes a bug. Drawbacks of existing classifier-based bug prediction techniques are insufficient performance for practical use and slow prediction times due to a large number of machine learned features. This paper investigates multiple feature selection techniques that are generally applicable to classification-based bug prediction methods. The techniques discard less important features until optimal classification performance is reached. The total number of features used for training is substantially reduced, often to less than 10 percent of the original. The performance of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers when using this technique is characterized on 11 software projects. Naive Bayes using feature selection provides significant improvement in buggy F-measure (21 percent improvement) over prior change classification bug prediction results (by the second and fourth authors [28]). The SVM's improvement in buggy F-measure is 9 percent. Interestingly, an analysis of performance for varying numbers of features shows that strong performance is achieved at even 1 percent of the original number of features.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2012.43","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6226427","Reliability;bug prediction;feature selection;machine learning","Computer bugs;Feature extraction;History;Machine learning;Measurement;Software;Support vector machines","belief networks;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program debugging;support vector machines","SVM classifier;buggy F-measure;classification performance;classifier-based bug prediction;code change-based bug prediction;feature selection technique;machine learned feature reduction;machine learning classifier;naive Bayes classifier;software history;software project;source code file;support vector machine","","28","","53","","20120626","April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Vehicle fleets composed of large number of heavy vehicles routinely perform runs with different drivers over a set of fixed routes. While all drivers might achieve on-time and safe driving performance their actual driving behaviors and the subsequent fuel economy can vary substantially. The proposed Intelligent Driver System (IDS) utilizes vehicle performance data combined with GPS information on fixed routes to incrementally build a model of the historically most fuel efficient driving behavior. During driving, the calculated optimal velocity for specific location is compared to the current vehicle state and a fuzzy logic PD controller is used to compute the optimal control action. The control action can be projected to the drivers via a specialized HMI or used directly as a predictive cruise control to achieve overall fuel economy improvements. The method has been validated on a simulated heavy vehicle model, showing potential for substantial fuel economy improvements.","2158-2246;21582246","Electronic:978-0-7695-4894-4; POD:978-1-4673-4498-2","10.1109/HSI.2012.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6473775","Driving Behaviors;Fuel Economy;Fuzzy Logic Control;Machine Learning;Vehicle Fleet","Artificial intelligence;Fuel economy;Fuzzy logic;PD control;Pragmatics;Vehicles","PD control;control engineering computing;driver information systems;fuel economy;fuzzy control;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);optimal control;road vehicles","GPS information;Global Positioning System;IDS;economical benefit;fuel consumption reduction;fuel economy improvement;fuel-efficient driving behavior;fuzzy logic PD controller;human-machine interaction;intelligent driver system;learning;optimal control;proportional-derivative controller;road vehicle;specialized HMI;vehicle fleet fuel economy;vehicle performance data","","2","2","13","","","6-8 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Online Kernel Learning for interactive retrieval in dynamic image databases","P. H. Gosselin","ETIS Laboratory, CNRS, ENSEA, Univ.

In order to handle this, we propose a method that tunes itself according to user labels. The framework we propose is based on visual dictionaries, with the specificity that the dictionaries are built online, during retrieval sessions. In other words, each user has its own visual dictionary, as opposed to usual approaches where all users share the same visual dictionary. In order to create theses dictionaries, we propose a method based on kernel functions. This method iteratively selects base kernels from a large base kernel pool, where each base kernel is related to a low-level descriptor such as color or texture. This learning process is performed in real time, and the classification of the database is faster than usual techniques since only relevant features for the current query are used. Experiments are carried out on a generalist database, and show the ability of the method to build effective kernels with few labels.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4673-2533-2; POD:978-1-4673-2534-9; USB:978-1-4673-2532-5","10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6467261","Boosting;Image databases;Interactive systems;Machine learning algorithms","Databases;Dictionaries;Kernel;Support vector machines;Tuning;Vectors;Visualization","image classification;image colour analysis;image retrieval;image texture;interactive systems;iterative methods;visual databases","base kernels;dynamic image database classification;image adding;image color;image removal;image texture;interactive image retrieval;iterative kernel function selection;low-level descriptor;online kernel learning;query processing;user labels;visual dictionaries","","1","","12","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to undertake the new approach, average relative bin frequency coefficients will be extracted from speech. In a noisy environment, audio data are not strictly aligned, thus getting proper noiseless signal is a challenge. Consequently, this affects the performance of emotion detection system. Due to these reasons, a newly proposed approach of Average Relative Bin Frequency technique in frequency domain will be implemented through audio data. Support vector machine with radial basis kernel will be used for the classification. Preliminary results showed an average of 86% accuracy for average relative frequency bin coefficients.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-3143-2; POD:978-1-4673-3142-5","10.1109/ICCSCE.2012.6487126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6487126","Support vector machine;information retrieval;machine learning;relative frequency bin coefficients","","audio signal processing;emotion recognition;feature extraction;pattern classification;radial basis function networks;signal classification;speech processing;support vector machines","audio data;audio domain;average relative amplitude features;average relative bin frequency coefficient extraction;emotion detection;emotion identification system;frequency domain;human speech;noiseless signal;noisy environment;pattern classification;radial basis kernel;support vector machine","","0","","12","","","23-25 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A zero-range process (ZRP) is a representative traffic-flow model described as a probabilistic cellular automaton. There is a parameter that controls the behavior of the vehicles in the model, and parameter estimation enables us to determine the unobservable behavior from the observable flow data. There are few studies on estimating the parameter, but the properties of models with a known parameter have been well investigated mathematically. In the present paper, we determine the accuracy of parameter estimation and propose an optimization method to collect the data, which corresponds to active learning.","2164-7143;21647143","Electronic:978-1-4673-5119-5; POD:978-1-4673-5117-1","10.1109/ISDA.2012.6416641","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6416641","active learning;machine learning;regression analysis;statistical estimation;traffic flow models","Accuracy;Estimation;Mathematical model;Parameter estimation;Physics;Training data;Vehicles","cellular automata;data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;parameter estimation;probability;regression analysis;traffic engineering computing","ZRP;active learning;data collection;machine learning;optimization method;parameter estimation accuracy;probabilistic cellular automaton;regression analysis;traffic engineering;traffic flow analysis;traffic jam generation process;traffic-flow model;zero-range process","","1","","11","","","27-29 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Part-based models offer a sparse, flexible representation of objects, but suffer from difficulties in training and often use standard kernels. In this paper, we propose a positive definite kernel called “structure kernel”, which measures the similarity of two part-based represented objects. The structure kernel has three terms: 1) the global term that measures the global visual similarity of two objects; 2) the part term that measures the visual similarity of corresponding parts; 3) the spatial term that measures the spatial similarity of geometric configuration of parts. The contribution of this paper is to generalize the discriminant capability of local kernels to complex part-based object models. Experimental results show that the proposed kernel exhibit higher accuracy than state-of-art approaches using standard kernels.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4673-2533-2; POD:978-1-4673-2534-9; USB:978-1-4673-2532-5","10.1109/ICIP.2012.6467320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6467320","Object recognition;data mining;image features;kernel;machine learning","Detectors;Kernel;Object recognition;Standards;Training;Vectors;Visualization","computer vision;data mining;image representation;object recognition","complex part-based object models;computer vision;data mining;discriminant capability;flexible object representation;geometric configuration;global term;global visual similarity;local kernels;part term;positive definite kernel;semisupervised object recognition;spatial similarity;spatial term;standard kernels;structure kernel","","0","","7","","","Sept. 30 2012-Oct. 3 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
