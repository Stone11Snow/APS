For speeding up the training of SVMs with new computing infrastructure such as cluster and grid systems, both methods decompose a large-scale two-class problem to a number of relatively smaller two-class sub-problems which can be implemented in a parallel way, but they use different decomposition and combination strategies. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive investigation in the two methods to compare their generalization performance and training time. Our experiments show that M3-SVM needs shorter training time, but has a little lower generalization performance than the standard SVM and cascade SVM. The experiments also indicate that cascade SVM has the least number of support vectors among these three SVMs.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378557","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378557","","Concurrent computing;Grid computing;Industrial training;Large-scale systems;Pattern classification;Quadratic programming;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Text categorization;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;pattern classification;pattern clustering;support vector machines","M3-SVM;cascade SVM method;cluster systems;decomposition strategy;grid systems;large scale pattern classification problems;min-max modular SVM;parallel method;support vector machine training","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, an increasing number of telecommunications customers are switching from one service or service provider to another. This phenomenon is called 'churn', which is a major cause of corporations' loss of profitability. It is important for a telecommunications company to find out the transitional behavior of its customers through data mining. Our approach is to use a model-based clustering method, extended to handle multi-dimensional data, to automatically and efficiently partition the customer behavior according to their behavior. We model this problem as a sequential clustering problem, and present an effective solution for solving the problem when the elements in the sequences are of a multi-dimensional nature. We provide theory and algorithms for the task, and empirically demonstrate that the method is effective in mining the customers data for the telecommunications industry.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382040","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382040","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Communication industry;Data mining;Electronic mail;Mining industry;Multidimensional systems;Predictive models;Profitability;Telecommunication switching","Markov processes;consumer behaviour;data handling;data mining;pattern clustering;problem solving;telecommunication services","Markov processes;customers churning behavior;multidimensional data handling;multidimensional model based clustering method;problem solving;profitability;sequential clustering problem;sequential data mining system;telecommunications customers;telecommunications industry;user behavior mining","","2","","22","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, it breaches the intrinsic principle of this long range receding horizon strategy, and sometimes it could lead to poor control performance in some processes. A kind of fast algorithm for self-tuning GPC (FGPC) is presented by using back propagation (BP) neural networks. The algorithm involves the derivation of the GPC in a new way and the training of BP neural networks to represent nonlinear relations between the GPC controller coefficients and system open-loop parameters, control horizon, smoothing factor and control weighting factor. The method developed does not involve the Diophantine equation and avoids the matrix operation, therefore substantially alleviates the mathematical computation problems associated with the standard adaptive GPC, especially for a long control horizon. The efficacy of this algorithm is demonstrated with a comparative simulation study.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382282","","Adaptive control;Control systems;Neural networks;Nonlinear control systems;Nonlinear equations;Open loop systems;Predictive control;Programmable control;Smoothing methods;Weight control","adaptive control;backpropagation;neurocontrollers;open loop systems;predictive control","BP neural networks;adaptive generalized predictive control;back propagation neural networks;control horizon;control weighting factor;fast algorithm;smoothing factor;system open-loop parameters","","3","","11","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the Isomap algorithm, geodesic distances between points are extracted instead of simply taking the Euclidean distance, thus a geometric distance graph is constructed and the embedding is obtained from the graph. However, when this method is applied into multi-class data, several isolated sub-graphs will form thus desirable embedding cannot be achieved. An extended Isomap algorithm is proposed for the multi-class manifold learning which computes within-class and between-class geodesic distances separately and the final embedding is obtained from the augmented geodesic distance matrix using multidimensional scaling algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real data reveal the promising performance of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380379","","Cameras;Geophysics computing;Laplace equations;Linear approximation;Manifolds;Multidimensional systems;Nearest neighbor searches;Principal component analysis;Sparse matrices;Stress measurement","differential geometry;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra","Euclidean distance;augmented geodesic distance matrix;extended Isomap algorithm;geodesic distances;geometric distance graph;multiclass manifold learning;multidimensional scaling algorithm;nonlinear dimensionality reduction","","7","1","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The design of the controller is simplified by reducing the multiple fuzzy rules with the rule reduction. The thermodynamic deoxidation system is composed of several deaerators. When they work together the pressure of one deaerator is coupled with others and so is the water level. The pressure and the water level of each deaerator are coupled too. Thus the system is characterized with intensive coupling, multi-input multi-output (MIMO), great delay, time-varying and nonlinearity. Hence the precise mathematic model is difficult to obtain. Fuzzy controller can be implemented on the experience of experts without knowing the model. The number of rules is very large, but it can be reduced with the rule reduction of rough sets. The simulation investigation made for the design shows better robustness of the controller. The design of the fuzzy-rough controller proposed in this paper is simple, easy to achieve and suitable to other MIMO fuzzy controllers.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382213","","Control systems;Couplings;Delay;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy sets;MIMO;Multidimensional systems;Rough sets;Thermodynamics;Time varying systems","MIMO systems;control nonlinearities;control system synthesis;delays;fuzzy control;fuzzy set theory;robust control;rough set theory","MIMO fuzzy controller;MIMO system;deaerator;delay;deoxidation system;fuzzy rule;fuzzy-rough control;intensive coupling;multidimensional fuzzy controller;multiinput multioutput;system nonlinearity;thermodynamic deoxidation system;time-varying system","","0","","4","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, the time complexity of Scarfs algorithm is G(Zn-1). To solve this problem, the hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is put forward. HGA has the mechanism combining the global optimization with the local optimization. HGA takes CGE as the problem of optimization and its solvent is the search for fixed point in unit complex.

Since poetry fully reveals literary language features such as vividness, sensibility and individuality, it is the appropriate start-point in NLP. Stylistic analysis thus contributes as an important task in literary language processing with lots of challenges. This paper looks into the research object, poetic language, strongly recommends and carefully proves poetry stylistic analysis technique based on term connection with the support of NLP technique as the background. Furthermore, the corresponding algorithm is proposed and questionnaires are applied to evaluate poetry stylistics in surveys. Both theories and experiments confirm us that commonness exceeds individuality concerning poetry stylistic analysis, therefore poetry stylistic analysis technique based on term connection is valid in evaluating poetry stylistics.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378311","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378311","","Art;Atmosphere;Bismuth;Computer science;Educational institutions;Helium;Humans;Logic;Natural language processing;Natural languages","literature;natural languages;text analysis","literary language processing;natural language processing;poetic language;poetry stylistic analysis technique","","0","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventionally, these methods employ linear principal component analysis (PCA) to find the most important eigenvoices. Recently, in what we called kernel eigenvoice (KEV) speaker adaptation, we suggested the use of kernel PCA to compute the eigenvoices so as to exploit possible nonlinearity in the data. The major challenge is that unlike the standard eigenvoice (EV) method, an adapted speaker model found by KEV adaptation resides in the high-dimensional kernel-induced feature space; it is not clear how to obtain the constituent Gaussians of the adapted model that are needed for the computation of state observation likelihoods during the estimation of eigenvoice weights and subsequent decoding. Our solution is the use of composite kernels in such a way that state observation likelihoods can be computed using only kernel functions. In an evaluation on the TIDIGITS task using less than 10s of adaptation speech, it is found that KEV speaker adaptation using composite Gaussian kernels outperforms a speaker-independent model and adapted models found by EV, MAP, or MLLR adaptation using 2.1s and 4.1s of speech.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378558","","Computer science;Decoding;Face recognition;Gaussian processes;Independent component analysis;Kernel;Maximum likelihood linear regression;Principal component analysis;Speech analysis;State estimation","Gaussian processes;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature extraction;maximum likelihood estimation;principal component analysis;regression analysis;speaker recognition","MAP adaptation;TIDIGITS task;adapted speaker model;composite Gaussian kernels;decoding;eigenvoice weight estimation;high dimensional kernel induced feature space;kernel PCA;kernel eigenvoice speaker adaptation;linear principal component analysis;maximum likelihood linear regression adaptation;speaker independent model;state observation likelihoods","","1","","13","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the characteristics of the sensors of magnetic bearings, a multi-valued logic algebra method based on sequential variables is presented for the fault diagnosis of the sensors of magnetic bearings. The definition of the logic algebra is given, and some theorems are proved, which are usually used in deduction. According to the presented method, the corresponding experiments should be done, in which only the states of the magnetic bearings are measured by processing the signals from the sensors.

By a little transformation of time series model, a parameter transfer matrix φ(k) for the EKF estimation (TSEKF) is derived to deal with the varying characteristics of the systems. The performance of TSEKF algorithm is compared with the existing EKF algorithm, which does not consider any priori information and only assumes that varying characteristics of the systems is random walk.

Because an application can be partitioned into a group of tasks and represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), the problem can be stated as finding a schedule for a DAG to be executed in a HCS so that the schedule length can be minimized. The tasks scheduling problem is NP-hard in general, except in a few simplified situations. In order to obtain optimal or suboptimal solutions, a large number of scheduling heuristics have been presented in the literature. Genetic algorithm (GA), as a power tool to achieve global optimal, has been successfully used in this field. This work presents a new hybrid genetic algorithm to solve the scheduling problem in HCS. It uses a direct method to encode a solution into chromosome. Topological sort of DAG is used to repair the offspring in order to avoid yielding illegal or infeasible solutions, and it also guarantees that all feasible solutions can be reached with some probability. In order to remedy the GA's weakness in fine-tuning, this paper uses a greedy strategy to improve the fitness of the individuals in crossover operator, based on Lamarckian theory in the evolution. The simulation results comparing with a typical genetic algorithm and a typical list heuristic, both from the literature, show that this algorithm produces better results in terms of both quality of solution and convergence speed.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382217","","Application software;Clustering algorithms;Computer applications;Computer networks;Educational institutions;Genetic algorithms;Heuristic algorithms;High performance computing;Processor scheduling;Scheduling algorithm","computational complexity;directed graphs;genetic algorithms;greedy algorithms;processor scheduling","Lamarckian theory;NP-hard task scheduling problem;crossover operator;directed acyclic graph;greedy strategy;heterogeneous computing system;hybrid genetic algorithm","","3","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For noise-free features, localization errors are automatically corrected by an interpolating scheme. A fast implementation of the hierarchical approach is also proposed. Extensive experiments show that the improved ASM can effectively reduce the lip locating errors. The fast implementation of RoHiLTA can consistently achieve superior performance to conventional ASMs in lip tracking tasks, and then can be effectively integrated in lip-reading and AVSR systems.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380425","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380425","","Active shape model;Colored noise;Data mining;Face detection;Motion detection;Mouth;Noise robustness;Noise shaping;Speech recognition;Video sequences","audio-visual systems;feature extraction;handicapped aids;image colour analysis;image motion analysis;image sequences;interpolation;object detection;speech recognition","active shape models;audio visual speech recognition;facial structure information detection;interpolating scheme;localization error correction;robust hierarchical lip tracking;search algorithms;video sequences","","5","","6","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a new modeling technique (MPtr_nets) based on predication/transition Petri nets to describe component-based information management systems. The MPtr_nets is made up of predication/transition Petri nets to form a tree. The structure of the nets is layered and MPtr_nets gradually describes the system from top to bottom. Structural definitions, behavioral rules and graphical representation of the new modeling technique are given. Examples are shown to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed modeling technique.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382063","","Application software;Computer science;Design for disassembly;Engineering management;Information management;Neural networks;Petri nets;Technology management;Tree graphs;Unified modeling language","Petri nets;formal specification;information management;knowledge representation;object-oriented programming","MPtr nets;behavioral rules;component based information management systems;graphical representation;hierarchical predication Petri nets;hierarchical transition Petri nets;modeling technique;software component representation","","0","","4","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
