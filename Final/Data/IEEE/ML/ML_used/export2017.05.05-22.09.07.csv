In our contribution a “Knowledge-Based System” (KBS) for image processing and pattern recognition, machine learning (ML) is used to measure the quality of the distribution of salami slices on pizza crusts.

In particular, SVMs offer several advantages over artificial neural networks (ANNs) that have attracted the attention of the speech processing community. Nevertheless, their high computational requirements prevent them from being used in practice in automatic speech recognition (ASR), where ANNs have proven to be successful. The high complexity of SVMs in this context arises from the use of huge speech training databases with millions of samples and highly overlapped classes. This paper suggests the use of a weighted least squares (WLS) training procedure that facilitates the possibility of imposing a compact semiparametric model on the SVM, which results in a dramatic complexity reduction. Such a complexity reduction with respect to conventional SVMs, which is between two and three orders of magnitude, allows the proposed hybrid WLS-SVC/HMM system to perform real-time speech decoding on a connected-digit recognition task (SpeechDat Spanish database). The experimental evaluation of the proposed system shows encouraging performance levels in clean and noisy conditions, although further improvements are required to reach the maturity level of current context-dependent HMM-based recognizers.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2178597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6097045","Additive noise;SVM/HMM;artificial neural network (ANN)/hidden Markov model (HMM);compact support vector machine (SVM);hybrid automatic speech recognition (ASR);machine learning;real-time ASR;robust ASR","Artificial neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Real-time systems;Speech;Speech recognition;Support vector machines;Training","neural nets;speech coding;speech recognition;support vector machines","SpeechDat Spanish database;artificial neural networks;connected-digit recognition task;real-time robust automatic speech recognition;real-time speech decoding;speech processing community;support vector machines;weighted least squares training procedure","","8","","83","","20111208","May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An important part of this class of annotation is filtering the relevant (sub)nodes and relations, because the returned graph should only contain relevant information, that is, nodes that are truly related with the topics of the document. In addition, we consider that the relevance of nodes vary depending on if the node is a branch or a leaf, that is, if the node has links to other nodes or it is a text-based description. This paper focuses on the relevance of branch nodes, which is calculated from the relevance of its links, since leaf nodes relevance is usually estimated by similarity metrics. Specifically, our approach incises in learning (through a genetic algorithm) and assigning the most appropriate weights to these links in order to reduce the precision/recall curve of the annotation process.

In our study, we show that a robust Feature Selection allows lifting classification accuracies significantly above previous approaches when combined with complex feature types.

In this Letter we investigate the application of sparse spectrum Gaussian process (SSGP) to the multiuser detection problem. The key point of the SSGP is that the sparsity of spectral representation of Gaussian process leads to an algorithm with much lower complexity than the full GP, while keeping almost the same bit error rate (BER) for DS-CDMA systems. Experimental results validate our proposed SSGP based multiuser detection method. It achieves greater efficiency and good BER performance.","1089-7798;10897798","","10.1109/LCOMM.2011.120211.111508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6095289","Code-division multiple access;machine learning;multiuser detection;sparse spectrum Gaussian process","Bit error rate;Complexity theory;Gaussian processes;Multiaccess communication;Multiuser detection;Training;Vectors","Gaussian processes;code division multiple access;error statistics;regression analysis;spread spectrum communication","BER;DS-CDMA systems;Gaussian process spectral representation;bit error rate;direct-sequence code-division multiple access;minimum mean square error criterion;multiuser detection problem;regression;sparse spectrum Gaussian process","","2","","17","","20111205","February 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

They are introduced in a general form covering not only the distances of discrete and continuous stochastic observations, but also the distances of random processes and signals. It is shown that the scaled Bregman distances extend not only the classical ones studied in the previous literature, but also the information divergence and the related wider class of convex divergences of probability measures. An information-processing theorem is established too, but only in the sense of invariance w.r.t. statistically sufficient transformations and not in the sense of universal monotonicity. Pathological situations where coding can increase the classical Bregman distance are illustrated by a concrete example. In addition to the classical areas of application of the Bregman distances and convex divergences such as recognition, classification, learning, and evaluation of proximity of various features and signals, the paper mentions a new application in 3-D exploratory data analysis. Explicit expressions for the scaled Bregman distances are obtained in general exponential families, with concrete applications in the binomial, Poisson, and Rayleigh families, and in the families of exponential processes such as the Poisson and diffusion processes including the classical examples of the Wiener process and geometric Brownian motion.","0018-9448;00189448","","10.1109/TIT.2011.2178139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6157087","Bregman distances;classification;divergences;exponential distributions;exponential processes;information retrieval;machine learning;statistical decision;sufficiency","Concrete;Context;Convex functions;Information theory;Measurement;Probability;Vectors","convex programming;data analysis;exponential distribution;geometry;signal processing;stochastic processes","3D exploratory data analysis;Poisson families;Poisson processes;Rayleigh families;Wiener process;binomial families;continuous stochastic observations;convex divergences;diffusion processes;discrete stochastic observations;exponential processes;geometric Brownian motion;information divergence;information-processing theorem;nonuniform contributions;probability distributions;probability measure divergences;random processes;random signals;scaled Bregman distances","","7","","47","","","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Drawing from prior work in handwriting recognition, sketches are modeled as a variable duration hidden Markov model, where the distributions on the states and transitions are learned from training data. A forward search algorithm is used to find the most likely sketch given the observations on the strokes, interstrokes, and gestures. A heuristic is implemented to discourage breadth-first search behavior, and is shown to greatly reduce computation time while sacrificing little accuracy. To avoid recognition errors, the recognized sketch is displayed to the user for confirmation; a rejection prompts the algorithm to search for and display the next most likely sketch. Upon confirmation of the recognized sketch, the robot executes the appropriate behaviors. A set of experiments was conducted in which operators controlled a single mobile robot in an indoor search-and-identify mission. Operators performed two missions using the proposed sketch interface and two missions using a more conventional point-and-click interface. On average, missions conducted using sketch control were performed as well as those using the point-and-click interface, and results from user surveys indicate that more operators preferred using sketch control.","0018-9219;00189219","","10.1109/JPROC.2011.2179772","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6132400","Human–machine interfaces;Markov models;human–robot interaction;machine learning;small sketch recognition","Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Man machine systems;Probabilistic logic;Robot control;Training data;User interfaces","handwriting recognition;human-robot interaction;mobile robots;probability;robust control;search problems","breadth-first search behavior;commanding mobile robot;computation time reduction;handwriting recognition error;indoor search-and-identify mission;natural robot control;point-and-click interface;probabilistic multistroke sketch interface;robust control;search algorithm;sketch control;variable duration hidden Markov model","","3","","41","","20120116","March 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Induced models can be used to trigger alerts when estimated monthly disease infection rates reach one of the two thresholds. The first threshold allows applying preventive actions, whereas the second one requires a curative action.

This paper presents a new feature selection method based on Dependency Parsing. Dependency parsing is used to find the syntactic relations among the words expresses willingness, event denoters and other words. Then these features are used in machine learning to classify the events, and finally achieve the identification of willing events.

In our paper, we examine the case of intelligent language tutoring system (ILTS), which has helped increase productivity and reduce overhead costs by automating teaching processes. However, current ILTSs are restrictive when it comes to integrating functionalities such as context-based understanding, and allowing text input from user. This paper proposes a framework, incorporated into an intelligent language tutoring system, based on a string search algorithm that extracts only vital word patterns from a pre-defined 'items bank'. This ensures that only required Basic English patterns are acquired, thereby facilitating the system to deliver accurate context based results and handle advanced structures with ease. Comprehensive evaluation of the system's performance indicates the system has proven to be efficient and robust structure, providing favorable alternatives to Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1131-1; POD:978-1-4673-0091-9","10.1109/ICI.2011.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6141661","Artificial Intelligence;Automation;Computational Intelligence;Data gathering;Intelligent Systems;Machine Learning","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Intelligent systems;Machine learning;Robustness","intelligent tutoring systems;learning (artificial intelligence);linguistics;natural language processing","automated language tutoring tool;automated learning;context-based understanding;intelligent language tutoring system;intelligent system framework;intelligent systems;machine learning;natural language processing systems;string search algorithm","","1","","9","","","12-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, we present a library, called In TOL (Intelligent Test Oracle Library), for the convenient and flexible collection of test traces. We can flexibly use either user guidance or program assertions to collect verdicts to test traces. Such verdicts are used as supervisory signals to the supervised learning algorithm (SLA) for a test oracle. Secondly, we present several sets of feature variables for the temporal relation among events in test traces of unbounded lengths. Then we present procedures that convert test traces into feature vectors, train an SLA with the feature vectors and their verdicts, and use the trained SLA as a test oracle. We report the implementation of In TOL on top of SVM (support vector machine). We experiment with two open-source benchmark SUTs from the internet to check the performance of our techniques.

Sufficient training data are collected in the form of empirical evidence, which have labeled positive and negative samples to build the hypothesis. The hypothesis is constructed by the conjunction of the attributes, which can be learnt by machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we work with two forms of ranking weights, precision and relevance, which help in finding hidden patterns and prediction future events. Empirical evidence for a weather patterns and tracking of a phenomenon needs to accurately extract the attributes and label the training samples, which is a very laborious and time-consuming effort. Automating weather prediction algorithms, which are trained by supervised learning, needs to be generalized so that it can be tested with unreliable and noisy weather data from low cost sensors. We use a training data from previous forest fires events, the datasets containing all the attributes are labeled using manual data logs for a given geographical area. The labeled original dataset is mapped to the data collected from on-line sensors, which further improves the accuracy of the training set. As some of classes have very few samples, which are related to the peak fire seasons, domain specific knowledge are added by sensor measurements and Fire Weather Index (FWI) to help accurately model the events. We show that training accuracy of the small forest fire classifier using attributes from manual logs is enhanced by 30% by using sensor data. The rare and hard to classify large forest fires are 95% accurately classified by using the new Fire Weather Index (FWI). We also show that our framework is more robust to outliers from noisy sensor measurements by accounting for in the model parameters.

The detectors are learned with a boosting algorithm which creates a pixel classifier using an over-complete set of contour features with different curvatures and orientations. We present results that are very competitive with other state-of-art cell nuclei detection scheme and show robustness to biological variations, different staining and illumination conditions, touching or partial occlusions.

In the detection, most studies rely on region of interest (ROI) from color information. In practice, however, there is no way to cover the various conditions such as illumination effects or weather conditions. To overcome the problem, this work uses the ROI-free detection by the supervised learning in which the predictor trains the positive examples of traffic sign image and negative examples of non traffic sign image. The proposed method is robust to illumination effects although it searches the traffic sign over the input scene. Because the real world scene often contains occluded or overlapped traffic signs, it is required that the detection algorithm should handle the cases. In this work, we introduce a novel feature extraction method inspired by vision perception theory developed in biological system and by power spectrum in frequency domain. The method was combined with support vector classifier. The proposed method showed accurate classification results (99.32%, 5 fold cross validation) over combined image sets of positive and negative traffic signs samples. Finally, we compared the detection ability of the proposed method and a previous work using ROI on real-world traffic scenes.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0898-4; POD:978-1-4673-0899-1","10.1109/ESPA.2012.6152433","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152433","Fourier Transform;Support Vector Machine;failure tolerance;machine learning;traffic sign detection","Feature extraction;Gabor filters;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Lighting;Mathematical model;Support vector machines","feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;visual perception","biological system;color information;feature extraction;frequency domain;illumination effects;occluded traffic signs;overlapped traffic signs;power spectrum;predictor trains;real world scene;region of interest;supervised learning;support vector classifier;traffic sign detection;vision perception;weather conditions","","2","","8","","","12-14 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

While citizen science projects can engage a very large number of volunteers to collect volumes of data, they are prone to contain reporting errors. Our experience with eBird, a citizen science project that engages tens of thousands of volunteers to collect bird observations, has shown that a massive effort by volunteer experts is needed to screen data, identify outliers and flag them in the database. But the increasing volume of data being collected by eBird places a huge burden on these volunteer experts. In order to minimize this human effort, we explored whether previously collected eBird data can be used to create automated quality filters that emerge from the data. We do this through a two-step process. First a data-based method detects outliers (i.e., observations that are unusual for a given region and week of the year). Next, a novel machine learning method that estimates observer expertise is used to decide if the unusual observation should be flagged or not. Our preliminary findings indicate that this automated process reliably identifies outliers and accurately classifies them as either an error or represents a potentially valuable observation.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4598-1; POD:978-1-4673-0026-1","10.1109/eScienceW.2011.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6130726","citizen-science;data quality;data-base filters;machine learning;species occurrence","Biological system modeling;Birds;Data models;Matched filters;Mathematical model;Observers;Vegetation","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);research and development;scientific information systems;zoology","automated data verification;automated quality filters;bird observations;eBird;large scale citizen science project;machine learning method;observer expertise;observer variability;outlier detection;research projects;species misidentification","","4","","23","","","5-8 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given that service selection focuses on the nonfunctional performance of services, it must be tightly related to the context. Unfortunately, as far as we know, previous works have not effectively considered this relation. First, most of the existing selection models rely on Quality of Service (QoS) parameters that have been estimated according to the previous executions. However, two consecutive executions might occur in two very different contexts and then behave differently. Thus, this paper argues that these QoS parameters should be predicted from context. Finally, the aggregation of these QoS parameters into a score reflects the expectations on a service; it should also be context-dependent. In this article, a solution addressing these points is proposed for auxiliary services. Auxiliary services assist another service during its execution, usually by delivering a data stream. Instead of focusing on their individual performances, selection considers their impact on the assisted service. We propose to obtain this model through a multilayer perceptron under batch learning. Thus, focus is given to the sample generation. This model is validated in a ubiquitous robotic scenario involving a localization service selection.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0723-0; POD:978-1-4577-0722-3","10.1109/URAI.2011.6145983","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6145983","Service selection;artificial neural networks;machine learning;quality of service;ubiquitous robotics","Analytical models;Context;Quality of service;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems","learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;neurocontrollers;quality of service;service robots;ubiquitous computing","auxiliary services;batch learning;impact based contextual service selection;localization service selection;multilayer perceptron;quality of service parameters;service expectations;ubiquitous robotic environment","","0","","18","","","23-26 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Besides, standard SVM is incapable of tackling multi-classification. To overcome the bottleneck of populating SVM, with training algorithm presented, the problem of quadratic programming is converted into that of resolving a linear system of equations composed of a group of equation constraints by adopting the least square SVM(LS-SVM) and introducing a modifying variable which can change inequality constraints into equation constraints, which simplifies the calculation. With regard to multi-classification, an LS-SVM applicable in multi-classification is deduced. Finally, efficiency of the algorithm is checked by using universal Circle in square and twospirals to measure the performance of the classifier.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6071268","artificial intelligence;control theory & control engineering;machine learning;support vector machine","Classification algorithms;Complexity theory;Equations;Linear matrix inequalities;Linear systems;Support vector machines;Training","","","","0","","","","","Dec. 2005","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

Information extraction can identify relevant sub-sequences of text, but is usually unaware of emerging, previously unknown knowledge and regularities in a text and thus cannot form new facts or new hypotheses. Complementary to information extraction, emerging data mining methods and techniques promise to overcome the deficiencies of information extraction. This research work combines the benefits of both approaches by integrating data mining and information extraction methods. The aim is to provide a new high-quality information extraction methodology and, at the same time, to improve the performance of the underlying extraction system. Consequently, the new methodology should shorten the life cycle of information extraction engineering because information predicted in early extraction phases can be used in further extraction steps, and the extraction rules developed require fewer arduous test-and-debug iterations.

The sole exam approved for this purpose is mammography. Usually, findings are annotated through the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) created by the American College of Radiology. The BIRADS system determines a standard lexicon to be used by radiologists when studying each finding. Although the lexicon is standard, the annotation accuracy of the findings depends on the experience of the radiologist. Moreover, the accuracy of the classification of a mammography is also highly dependent on the expertise of the radiologist. A correct classification is paramount due to economical and humanitarian reasons. The main goal of this work is to produce machine learning models that predict the outcome of a mammography from a reduced set of annotated mammography findings. In the study we used a data set consisting of 348 consecutive breast masses that underwent image guided or surgical biopsy performed between October 2005 and December 2007 on 328 female subjects. The main conclusions are threefold: (1) automatic classification of a mammography, independent on information about mass density, can reach equal or better results than the classification performed by a physician; (2) mass density seems to be a good indicator of malignancy, as previous studies suggested; (3) a machine learning model can predict mass density with a quality as good as the specialist blind to biopsy, which is one of our main contributions. Our model can predict malignancy in the absence of the mass density attribute, since we can fill up this attribute using our mass density predictor.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4574-5; POD:978-1-4577-1799-4","10.1109/BIBM.2011.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120463","BIRADS;machine learning;mammography","Breast;Cancer;Data models;Machine learning;Predictive models;Training","cancer;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical diagnostic computing;patient diagnosis;surgery","BIRADS system;automatic classification;breast cancer;breast imaging reporting;breast screening;data system;machine learning model;malignancy prediction;mammography findings;surgical biopsies","","0","","21","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to the RECNOISY strategy, we propose another strategy, called HYBRID, which for each horizon selects the most accurate approach among the REC and the RECNOISY strategies according to the estimated accuracy. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we carry out an experimental session based on the 111 times series of the NN5 forecasting competition.

In the former situation, the documents are ranked using different techniques to list the relevant documents in the beginning from the huge amount of documents retrieved that contain more irrelevant documents. But in the later case, all the data retrieved are not just relevant to the query but they are all the correct answers to the given query. And there are situations where we cannot order the retrieved tuples using the regular sorting technique. Normally a database query will fetch more tuples and it is not possible to display the whole query result set in one single screen. Even though the users are interested in only few tuples, we cannot reduce the result set unless the query is too selective and user preferences are known. This paper proposes an Abstract Information Model to display only the abstract information of the result set in a single screen instead of showing the actual tuples.

For the case of separable classes, we provide the exact conditions and an efficient algorithm to determine if an element in the training set can become a support vector when new data arrive.

Moreover, complex learning frameworks often require stepping beyond black box evaluation to distinguish between errors based on natural limits on learning and errors that arise from mistakes in implementation. We present a conceptual architecture, failure model and taxonomy, and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) of a semi-supervised, multi-modal learning system, and provide specific examples from its use in a radiological analysis assistant system.

In a previous work, a simple Hill-Climbing algorithm defined over the space of orderings was proposed by the authors. Although it achieves competitive results when comparing with the state of the art algorithms, such as GES, it is not very efficient when the number of variables is high. In this work, we propose a more efficient version of the method that improves its scalability in high dimensional domains and is equivalent to the original.

The goal is to transform very high-dimensional input (typically, millions of voxels) to a low-dimensional representation (small number of constructed features) that preserves discriminative signal and is clinically interpretable. We formulate the task as a constrained optimization problem that combines generative and discriminative objectives and show how to extend it to the semi-supervised learning (SSL) setting. We propose a novel large-scale algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem. In the fully supervised case, we demonstrate accuracy rates that are better than or comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets while producing a representation of the group difference that is consistent with prior clinical reports. Effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for SSL is evaluated with both benchmark and medical imaging datasets. In the benchmark datasets, the results are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art methods for SSL. For evaluation of the SSL setting in medical datasets, we use images of subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is believed to be a precursor to Alzheimer's disease (AD), as unlabeled data. AD subjects and normal control (NC) subjects are used as labeled data, and we try to predict conversion from MCI to AD on follow-up. The semi-supervised extension of this method not only improves the generalization accuracy for the labeled data (AD/NC) slightly but is also able to predict subjects which are likely to converge to AD.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2011.2162961","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5961630","Basis learning;classification;feature construction;generative-discriminative learning;machine learning;matrix factorization;morphological pattern analysis;optimization;semi-supervised learning;sparsity","Biomedical imaging;Image reconstruction;Jacobian matrices;Loading;Machine learning;Matrix decomposition;Optimization","benchmark testing;biomedical MRI;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;optimisation","Alzheimer's disease;benchmark;constrained optimization problem;dimensionality reduction method;discriminative signal;generative discriminative basis learning;high dimensional input;image classification;low dimensional representation;medical imaging;mild cognitive impairment;semisupervised extension;semisupervised learning","Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Artificial Intelligence;Databases, Factual;Diagnostic Imaging;Discriminant Analysis;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuroimaging;Pattern Recognition, Automated","22","","71","","20110725","Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

For this problem, we propose a probabilistic generative model and a robust learning scheme based on variational Bayesian estimation. A key feature of our probabilistic framework is that not only nodes but also given graphs can be clustered at the same time, allowing our model to capture clusters found in only part of all given graphs.

Therefore, preventing text recognition using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools and imposing additional challenges in filtering such type of spam. In this paper, we propose an image spam filtering technique, called Image Texture Analysis-Based Image Spam Filtering (ITA-ISF), that makes use of low-level image features for image characterization. We evaluate the performance of several machine learning-based classifiers and compare their performance in filtering image spam based on low-level image texture features. These classifiers are: C4.5 Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perception (MP), Nave Bays (NB), Bayesian Network (BN), and Random Forest (RF). Our experimental studies based on two publicly available datasets show that the RF classifier outperforms all other classifiers with an average precision, recall, accuracy, and F-measure of 98.6%.","","Electronic:978-1-908320-00-1; POD:978-1-4577-0884-8","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6148459","Email Spam;Machine Learning;Texture Analysis","Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image texture;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Unsolicited electronic mail","belief networks;decision trees;feature extraction;image classification;image texture;information filtering;multilayer perceptrons;support vector machines;unsolicited e-mail","Bayesian network;OCR tool;RF classifier;decision tree;image characterization;image email spam;image spam filtering;image texture analysis;low-level image feature;low-level image texture;machine learning;multilayer perception;obfuscation technique;optical character recognition;random forest;support vector machine;text recognition","","0","","45","","","11-14 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With a ratio close to zero, the evaluation of a model-classifier-combination's generalization ability with leave-n-out-methods or cross-validation becomes unreliable: The generalization error of a complex model (with a more complex hypothesis structure) might underestimated compared to the generalization error of a simple model (with a less complex hypothesis structure). Given this situation, optimizing the bias-variance-tradeoff to select among these models will lead one astray. To address this problem we introduce the idea of robust models, where one intentionally restricts the hypothesis structure within the model formation process. We observe that -- despite the fact that such a robust model entails a higher test error -- its efficiency ""in the wild"" outperforms the model that would have been chosen normally, under the perspective of the best bias-variance-tradeoff. We present two case studies: (1) a categorization task, which demonstrates that robust models are more stable in retrieval situations when training data is scarce, and (2) a genre identification task, which underlines the practical relevance of robust models.","1529-4188;15294188","Electronic:978-0-7695-4486-1; POD:978-1-4577-0982-1","10.1109/DEXA.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6059815","bias;machine learning;overfitting;retrieval model","Accuracy;Analytical models;Machine learning;Robustness;Training;Vocabulary","classification;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","bias-variance-tradeoff;classification tasks;document collections;generalization error;information retrieval;learning process;robust models","","1","","27","","","Aug. 29 2011-Sept. 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Improving Generalization Performance in Co-Evolutionary Learning","S. Y. Chong; P. Tino; D. C. Ku; X.

Generalization performance of a strategy (solution) is estimated using a collection of random test strategies (test cases) by taking the average game outcomes, with confidence bounds provided by Chebyshev's theorem. Chebyshev's bounds have the advantage that they hold for any distribution of game outcomes. However, such a distribution-free framework leads to unnecessarily loose confidence bounds. In this paper, we have taken advantage of the near-Gaussian nature of average game outcomes and provided tighter bounds based on parametric testing. This enables us to use small samples of test strategies to guide and improve the co-evolutionary search. We demonstrate our approach in a series of empirical studies involving the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) and the more complex Othello game in a competitive co-evolutionary learning setting. The new approach is shown to improve on the classical co-evolutionary learning in that we obtain increasingly higher generalization performance using relatively small samples of test strategies. This is achieved without large performance fluctuations typical of the classical approach. The new approach also leads to faster co-evolutionary search where we can strictly control the condition (sample sizes) under which the speedup is achieved (not at the cost of weakening precision in the estimates).","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2010.2051673","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035967","Co-evolutionary learning;Othello;evolutionary computation;generalization;iterated prisoner's dilemma;machine learning","Chebyshev approximation;Educational institutions;Estimation;Games;Robustness;Testing;Tin","evolutionary computation;game theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence)","Chebyshev bounds;Chebyshev theorem;Othello game;average game outcomes;co-evolutionary learning;co-evolutionary search;distribution-free framework;game-playing;generalization framework;generalization performance;iterated prisoner dilemma;parametric testing;random test strategies","","13","","45","","20111006","Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Optimal Bayesian estimation fusion was then used to combine three methods with the fusion parameters determined according to the performance of each method with validation samples. The combined method compensates for the disadvantages of each method for more precise measurements.

The ability to predict player churn can be a valuable resource to game developers designing customer retention strategies. The results from our theory-driven model significantly outperform a diffusion-based churn prediction model on the same dataset. We describe the synthesis between a theory-driven approach and a data-driven approach to a problem and examine the trade-offs involved between the two approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability and model complexity. We observe that even though the theory-driven model is not as accurate as the data-driven one, the theory-driven model itself can be more interpretable to the domain experts and hence, more preferable over a complex data-driven model. We perform lift analysis of the two models and find that if a marketing effort is restricted in the number of customers it can contact, the theory-driven model would offer much better return-on-investment by identifying more customers among that restricted set who have the highest probability of churn. Finally, we use a clustering technique to partition the dataset and then build an ensemble on the partitioned dataset for better performance. Experiment results show that the ensemble performs notably better than the single classifier in terms of its recall value, which is a highly desirable property in the churn prediction problem.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4578-3; POD:978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113108","MMORPGs;churn prediction;machine learning models","Analytical models;Complexity theory;Data mining;Games;Predictive models;Social network services;Training","computer games;human factors;probability;social sciences","MMORPG;churn prediction;clustering technique;customer retention strategies;interpretability;lift analysis;massively multiplayer online role-playing games;model complexity;player motivation;prediction accuracy;probability;return-on-investment;social science;theory-driven model","","8","1","37","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, they are difficult to write manually, and automatic mining techniques suffer from 90-99 percent false positive rates. To address this problem, we propose to augment a temporal-property miner by incorporating code quality metrics. We measure code quality by extracting additional information from the software engineering process and using information from code that is more likely to be correct, as well as code that is less likely to be correct. When used as a preprocessing step for an existing specification miner, our technique identifies which input is most indicative of correct program behavior, which allows off-the-shelf techniques to learn the same number of specifications using only 45 percent of their original input. As a novel inference technique, our approach has few false positives in practice (63 percent when balancing precision and recall, 3 percent when focused on precision), while still finding useful specifications (e.g., those that find many bugs) on over 1.5 million lines of code.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2011.5","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5680914","Specification mining;code metrics;machine learning;program understanding.;software engineering","Cloning;Data mining;Maintenance engineering;Optimization;Refactoring;Software measurement","data mining;formal specification;program debugging;program testing;software quality","automatic mining techniques;code quality metrics;debugging;documentation;formal specifications;optimization;program testing;refactoring;repair;software engineering process;specification mining;temporal-property miner","","8","","61","","20110106","Jan.-Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Various studies in psychology particularly link posture mirroring behaviour to rapport. Currently, however, there are few studies which deal with the automatic analysis of postures and none at all particularly focus on its connection with rapport. This study presents a method for automatically predicting rapport in dyadic interactions based on posture and congruence. We begin by constructing a dataset of dyadic interactions and self-reported rapport annotations. Then, we present a simple system for posture classification and use it to detect posture congruence in dyads. Sliding time windows are used to collect posture congruence statistics across video segments. And lastly, various machine learning techniques are tested and used to create rapport models. Among the machine learners tested, Support Vector Machines and Multi layer Perceptrons performed best, at around 71% average accuracy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4578-3; POD:978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.143","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113180","chameleon effect;image processing;machine learning;social signal processing","Accuracy;Conferences;Head;Humans;Magnetic heads;Psychology;Support vector machines","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;object detection;psychology;social sciences;statistical analysis;video signal processing","SSP;automatic analysis;dyadic interactions;expressive nonverbal cues;machine learning techniques;multilayer perceptrons;posture automatic detection;posture classification;posture congruence statistics;posture mirroring behaviour;psychology;rapport models;self-reported rapport annotations;sliding time windows;video segments","","1","","28","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proliferation of phones (particularly smartphones) on the consumer market has caused a growing demand for forensic examination of the devices, which could not be met by existing Computer Forensics techniques. As a matter of fact, Law enforcement are much more likely to encounter a suspect with a mobile device in his possession than a PC or laptop and so the growth of demand for analysis of mobiles has increased exponentially in the last decade. Early investigations, moreover, consisted of live analysis of mobile devices by examining phone contents directly via the screen and photographing it with the risk of modifying the device content, as well as leaving many parts of the proprietary operating system inaccessible. The recent development of Mobile Forensics, a branch of Digital Forensics, is the answer to the demand of forensically sound examination procedures of gathering, retrieving, identifying, storing and documenting evidence of any digital device that has both internal memory and communication ability [1]. Over time commercial tools appeared which allowed analysts to recover phone content with minimal interference and examine it separately. By means of such toolkits, moreover, it is now possible to think of a new approach to Mobile Forensics which takes also advantage of ""Data Mining"" and ""Machine Learning"" theory. This paper is the result of study concerning cell phones classification in a real case of pedophilia. Based on Mobile Forensics ""Triaging"" concept and the adoption of self-knowledge algorithms for classifying mobile devices, we focused our attention on a viable way to predict phone usage's classifications. Based on a set of real sized phones, the research has been extensively discussed with Italian law enforcement cybercrime specialists in order to find a viable methodology to determine the likelihood that a mobile phone has been used to commit the specif- c crime of pedophilia, which could be very relevant during a forensic investigation.","2324-898X;2324898X","Electronic:978-0-7695-4600-1; POD:978-1-4577-2135-9","10.1109/TrustCom.2011.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120868","Data Mining;Knowledge Analysis;Machine Learning;Mobile Forensics;Triaging","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Decision trees;Forensics;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Testing","computer forensics;data mining;law administration;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile handsets","Italian law enforcement cybercrime specialists;cell phones classification;computer forensics techniques;data mining;digital forensics;machine learning;mobile devices;mobile forensics;pedophilia;phone contents examining;proprietary operating system;triaging","","11","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, there are cases in which the hyper-rectangular surfaces generated by these algorithms can only map the problem description after several sub-sequential partitions, which results in a large and incomprehensible tree. Hence, we propose a new decision tree induction algorithm based on clustering which seeks to provide more accurate models and/or shorter descriptions more comprehensible for the end-user.

We propose a general method for learning a good classifier on target data with generalization guarantees and we improve its efficiency thanks to an iterative procedure by reweighting the similarity function - compatible with Balcan et al. framework - to move closer the two distributions in a new projection space. Hyper parameters and reweighting quality are controlled by a reverse validation procedure.

On the basis of the sparsity characteristic of text vectors, a new TC algorithm based on lazy feature selection (LFS) is presented. As a new type of embedded feature selection approach, the LFS method can greatly reduce the dimension of features without any information losing, which can improve both efficiency and performance of algorithms greatly.

Knowing the subcellular localization of proteins is important in molecular cell biology, proteomics, and system biology and drug discovery. Different predictors have been developed that predict presence, location and interaction of molecules using various computational techniques including probabilistic models of Machine Learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. These predictors partially cover the different aspects of exploration of subcellular locations. Some of them are equally well applicable to many types of organisms (human, yeast, mouse, bacteria) while some are specific and focus on better performance in accuracy of the predicted results. Similarly some of the techniques cover “few” number of proteins but more accurately and on the other side some algorithms predict sub cellular locations of “many” proteins at the expense of prediction accuracy. This research is a review of most common and efficient techniques grouped in four in total, which are 1-amino acid composition and order-based predictors 2-sorting signal predictors 3- homology-based predictors and 4-hybrid methods that use several sources of information to predict localization.

We have evaluated and compared several ensembles obtained by combining six feature extraction methods and several classification approaches based on two general purpose classifiers (i.e., Support Vector Machine and a variant of input decimated ensemble) and their random subspace version. An extensive evaluation was performed according to a blind testing protocol, where the parameters of the system are optimized using the training set and the system is validated in three different independent data sets, allowing selection of the most performing system and demonstrating the validity of the proposed method. Based on the results obtained using the blind test protocol, it is interesting to note that even if in each independent data set the most performing stand-alone method is not always the same, the fusion of different methods enhances prediction efficiency in all the tested independent data sets.","1545-5963;15455963","","10.1109/TCBB.2011.117","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5999656","Virulent proteins;ensemble of classifiers;machine learning;support vector machines.","Amino acids;Bioinformatics;Computational biology;Encoding;Feature extraction;Microorganisms;Proteins","bioinformatics;drugs;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;proteins;support vector machines","Chou pseudoamino acid composition;a blind testing protocol;bacterial virulent protein prediction method;classifiers based variants;drug targets;evolutionary information;feature extraction methods;fusion;general purpose classifiers;independent data set;input decimated ensemble;pathogens;random subspace version;stand-alone method;support vector machine;vaccine candidates","Adhesins, Bacterial;Amino Acids;Bacterial Proteins;Computational Biology;Databases, Protein;Evolution, Molecular;Fimbriae Proteins;Support Vector Machines","77","","72","","20110825","March-April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Additionally, the classes are structured in a hierarchy, in the form of either a tree or a directed acyclic graph. Hence, an instance can be assigned to two or more paths from the hierarchical structure, resulting in a complex classification problem with possibly hundreds of classes. Many methods have been proposed to deal with such problems, some of them employing a single classifier to deal with all classes simultaneously (global methods), and others employing many classifiers to decompose the original problem into a set of subproblems (local methods). In this work, we propose a novel local method named HMC-LMLP, which uses one Multi-Layer Perceptron per hierarchical level. The predictions in one level are used as inputs to the network responsible for the predictions in the next level. We make use of two distinct Multi-Layer Perceptron algorithms: Back-propagation and Resilient Back-propagation. In addition, we make use of an error measure specially tailored to multi-label problems for training the networks. Our method is compared to state-of-the-art hierarchical multi-label classification algorithms, in protein function prediction datasets.

Looking for valuable nuggets of knowledge, such as capturing and summarizing sentiments from these huge amount of data could help users make informed decisions. In this paper, we develop a sentiment identification system called SES which implements three different sentiment identification algorithms. We augment basic compositional semantic rules in the first algorithm. In the second algorithm, we think sentiment should not be simply classified as positive, negative, and objective but a continuous score to reflect sentiment degree. All word scores are calculated based on a large volume of customer reviews. Due to the special characteristics of social media texts, we propose a third algorithm which takes emoticons, negation word position, and domain-specific words into account. Furthermore, a machine learning model is employed on features derived from outputs of three algorithms. We conduct our experiments on user comments from Face book and tweets from twitter. The results show that utilizing Random Forest will acquire a better accuracy than decision tree, neural network, and logistic regression.

The artifacts present in a massive order which are similar in size and shape to abnormal cells would cause the misclassification of cytology images in the screening process. This increases the false positive rate which can hinder the mass screening.

This paper attempts to automatically classify the textual entries made by bloggers on various sports blogs, to the appropriate category of sport by following steps like pre-processing, feature extraction and naïve Bayesian classification. Empirical evaluation of this technique has resulted in a classification accuracy of approximately 87% over the test set. In addition to classifying the textual entries of sports blogs, it is proposed that the extracted features themselves be further classified under more meaningful heads which results in generation of a semantic resource that lends greater understanding to the classification task. This semantic resource can be used for data mining requirements that arise in the future.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1719-2; POD:978-1-4577-1717-8","10.1109/ComComAp.2012.6154802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6154802","automatic text classification;feature extraction;heuristics;intelligent data mining;machine learning;naïve Bayes classification","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Blogs;Feature extraction;Semantics;Text categorization;Training","Bayes methods;Web sites;data mining;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;semantic Web;sport;text analysis","automatic text classification;data mining requirements;feature extraction;naïve Bayesian classification;semantic resource;semi-supervised machine learning task;sports blog data;text document","","1","","16","","","11-13 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The emphasis is now shifted from simply retrieving a set of documents to rank them also for a given query in terms of user's need. The researcher's task is not only to retrieve the documents from the corpus but also to rank them in order of their relevance to the user's requirement. To improve the system's performance is now the hot area of research. In this paper, an attempt has been made to put some of most commonly used algorithms in the community. It presents a survey on the approaches used to rank the retrieved documents and their evaluation strategies.","2375-1282;23751282","Electronic:978-1-4577-2168-7; POD:978-1-4577-2169-4","10.1109/NUiConE.2011.6153228","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6153228","Information Retrieval;Learning to Rank (LETOR);Machine Learning","Accuracy;Boosting;Classification algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Regression tree analysis;Training","document handling;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence)","LETOR approach;document retrieval;information retrieval;learning to rank approach;machine learning;user requirement","","5","","26","","","8-10 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, an investigative survey on cloud computing is conducted with the main focus on gaps that is slowing down cloud adoption as well as reviewing the threat remediation challenges. Next, some thoughts are constructed on novel approaches to address some of the widely discussed attack types using machine learning techniques. Such thoughts captured through a series of experiments are expected to give researchers, cloud providers and their customers' additional insight and tools to proactively protect themselves from known or perhaps even unknown security issues that follow the same patterns.","1521-9097;15219097","Electronic:978-0-7695-4576-9; POD:978-1-4577-1875-5","10.1109/ICPADS.2011.156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6121377","Security;cloud computing;machine learning;threats;trust","Accuracy;Cloud computing;Kernel;Machine learning;Polynomials;Security;Support vector machines","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;trusted computing","cloud computing;cyber attack;machine learning;security issue;threat remediation;trust Issue","","9","","26","","","7-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Meanwhile, many of such technologies have complex reaction processes and often require a fine-tuned primer set where existing primer design tools are not sufficient. We have developed a primer selection system for one important primer, the turn-back primer (TP), which is commonly used in loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) and smart amplification process (SmartAmp). We chose 78 parameters related to the primer and target sequence, and explored their relationship to amplification speed using experimental data for 1344 primer combinations. We employed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method for parameter selection and estimation of their numerical coefficients. The evaluation showed that our approach yields a superior primer design in isothermal amplification and is robust against variations in the experimental setup.
