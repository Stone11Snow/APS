By analyzing the structure of Chinese characters deeply, we present a novel mathematical expression method of Chinese characters. Useful knowledge can be mined from the database of the mathematical expressions of all the Chinese characters. Our experimental results show that the probability of both the component 'water' and the component 'fire' appearing in a Chinese character simultaneously is very small. Even if the two components do appear simultaneously, we show from the figure of the character that 'water' will boil and overflow if fire is burning.

The validity functions frequently used for clustering are based on unsupervised clustering, whose central meaning is the confirmation of class number in unsupervised clustering. This paper puts forward a validity function for judging clustering; the numerical experiments prove its validity. For applications in k-nearest neighbor classification, we can view the class center as its representative if the data set satisfies the qualification of this function. In this way, we can reduce the iteration query in all the training data while we only need to compare the similarities between the testing data and each class center. When selecting k-neighbors, we can only choose the nearest neighbor (1-nearest neighbor) in order to achieve precise classification and avoid the trouble of looking for the k-value.

These weak hypotheses were then combined into a single rule called the final hypothesis, and the final hypothesis ranked the possible labels for a given document with the hope that the appropriate labels would appear at the top of the ranking.

Fuzzy decision tree is popular in dealing with the ambiguity and vagueness associated with human thinking. The generalization capability of decision tree, which is also called the predictive capability, is one of the most important indexes to judge whether a decision tree generation algorithm is good. The stronger the generalization is, the higher the prediction accuracy. In practical applications, the generalization capability of a decision tree algorithm directly affects the accuracy of decision-making. However, so far nobody has given a comparison study between the generalization capabilities of fuzzy and crisp decision tree algorithms.

"Coverage-performance curves for classification in datasets with a typical data","S. Hashemi","Fac. of Comput. Sci., Dalhousie Univ., Halifax, NS, Canada","Proceedings. International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20030219","2002","4","","1946","1950 vol.4","Handling atypical examples in classification tasks is one of the challenges in machine learning. While there seems to be a race for accuracy, very little has been done to understand and solve the issues related to atypical data. In this paper, coverage-performance (CP) curves are introduced to help a better understanding of atypical data. The concept of CP curves is based on the idea of separating atypical data and visualizing performance of classification as a function of coverage (the fraction of data participating in training or evaluation). To generate CP curves, two schemes are compared in this paper. The first scheme is based on SVMs alone and the second one is a hybrid of a PNN and a SVM. Two generated datasets with overlapping features are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of CP curves obtained by each scheme. Calculated theoretical limits on the generated data show that the hybrid scheme is a very effective way of producing CP curves. It is also shown that by separating atypical data, although we lose some data, the performance of the classification increases significantly.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175377","","Computer science;Data visualization;Electronic mail;Hybrid power systems;Integrated circuit testing;Kernel;Machine learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Upper bound","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","PNN;SVM;classification tasks;coverage-performance curves;machine learning;outliers;overlapping features","","1","","11","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Because the designed fuzzy controller in this paper is a single-input and single-output controller, and the corresponding fuzzy control rules are few, so the approach is very simple for real-time implementation.

While standard SVMs solutions involve solving quadratic or linear programming problems, the least squares version of SVMs corresponds to solving a set of linear equations, due to equality instead of inequality constraints in the problem formulation. In LS-SVMs, the Mercer condition is still applicable. Hence several types of kernels such as polynomial, RBF's and MLP's can be used. Here we use LS-SVMs for time series prediction compared with radial basis function neural networks. We consider a noisy (Gaussian and uniform noise) Mackey-Glass time series. The results show that our least squares support vector machines are excellent for time series prediction even with high noise.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1176775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176775","","Chaos;Gaussian noise;Kernel;Least squares methods;Machine learning;Neural networks;Radial basis function networks;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","Gaussian noise;learning (artificial intelligence);learning automata;least squares approximations;radial basis function networks;time series","Gaussian noise;Mackey-Glass time series;Mercer condition;equality constraints;high noise;least squares support vector machines;linear equations;machine learning;radial basis function neural networks;statistical learning theory;time series prediction;uniform noise","","6","","8","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To solve the curse of dimensionality problem of neurofuzzy system, rough set is applied to obtain the reductive fuzzy rule set. The number of rules decreases, and each rule does not need all condition attributes values. Genetic algorithm is used to obtain the optimal discretization of continuous attributes. Then the fuzzy system is represented via an equivalent artificial neural network (ANN). The convergence of the ANN training is fast, and the structure size of the ANN becomes small.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259658","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259658","","Artificial neural networks;Automation;Convergence;Data mining;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Genetic algorithms;Information systems;Set theory","fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;fuzzy systems;genetic algorithms;rough set theory","ANN training;equivalent artificial neural network;genetic algorithms;neurofuzzy system;reductive fuzzy rule set;rough set theory;soft computing modeling approach","","0","","6","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PBVS needs to estimate the pose of target in 3-D space, and IBVS often control the feature in 2-D image plane. The performances of both systems depend on the selection of the state vector. So- it is important to select a desirable state vector to design a visual servoing system. Analyzing the affine model of image motion, we find when camera motion consists of only translation motion and the target is one rigid planar surface, the projected point position of the target centroid in image plane --[x<sub>c</sub>,y<sub>c</sub>]<sup>T</sup>, and the radio of two depths--s, can explicitly describe the target pose with respect to the camera. In addition, x<sub>c</sub>,y<sub>c</sub>, s can be easily calculated from image moments which are quickly computed from a binary image. So, in this paper, the vector [x<sub>c</sub>,y<sub>c</sub>,s]<sup>T</sup> is used as the state vector. Then a simple image Jacobian matrix is gotten from the state equation and leads to a simple adaptive controller, which can drive a camera to the ideal position.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259622","","Adaptive control;Automation;Cameras;Image analysis;Jacobian matrices;Motion analysis;Programmable control;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems;Visual servoing","Jacobian matrices;adaptive control;cameras;computer vision;image motion analysis","adaptive control;camera motion;image Jacobian matrix;image motion;image-based visual servoing system;position-based visual servoing system;state vector;visual servoing","","3","","7","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since Chinese is not a segmented language, the words in a sentence must be segmented before they are processed by consequent Chinese named entity recognition components. Similarly, POS tagging is also an important fundamental task for Chinese named entity recognition. In order to enhance the quality of word segmentation and POS tagging, it is necessary to explore different approaches for improving the performance. One of the approaches is to repair errors as much as possible, if word segmentation and POS tagging tool is available on hand. This paper aims at introducing an effective error repairer using transformation based error-driven machine learning technique. It deals with detecting error positions, producing error repairing rules, selecting higher-score rules, ordering rules and distinguishing rule usage conditions, etc. The experimental results show that word segmentation and POS tagging errors are significantly reduced and the performance has been improved.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175365","","Algorithm design and analysis;Error correction;Machine learning;Modems;Natural languages;Neck;Probability;Statistics;Tagging;Text recognition","knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;pattern recognition","Chinese language;Chinese named entity recognition;Chinese word segmentation;error repairing;error-driven machine learning;natural language processing;part-of-speech tagging;transformation based machine learning","","0","","8","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The estimated reflectance parameters provide the range data with intensity distributions. Therefore, we generate three reference images of a range sphere, which has the same diameter as that of the sample, from the same viewpoint but with different light directions. The new algorithms for data driven, stable, update the surface slope and height maps are proposed. This approach significantly reduce the residual errors. In comparison with the traditional methods.

Pricing models that can fast change prices during transaction on the consequence of the buyer's needs is beneficial to electronic commerce. Demand sensitive model is one of the pricing models that can be used for fast changes of prices in electronic commerce. Price setting algorithm for demand sensitive model helps sellers to get decision variables, price per unit that maximizes profit for the quantity ordered by buyers. In this paper we analyze the price setting algorithms of demand sensitive model. We use a simple example to explain how the changes of price elasticity of demand changes price per unit, gross margin and quantity demanded. Also we show how the changes of quantity demanded changes the unit price and marginal cost. The investigation shows that an increase in demand ordered decreases price per unit of a good, at the same time increasing profit margin to seller and decreasing production cost. The seller extracts some of the buyer's surplus value as profits with residual surplus remaining with the buyer over and above the actual price paid. Buyers do not pay the same amount of total price for the good ordered within the same group of order, because of the difference in the net browsing cost.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259606","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259606","","Aerodynamics;Algorithm design and analysis;Consumer electronics;Costs;Elasticity;Electronic commerce;Monopoly;Pricing;Production;Technology management","demand forecasting;electronic commerce;pricing;supply and demand","bargaining;demand sensitive model;dynamic pricing;electronic commerce;marginal cost;net browsing cost;price setting algorithm","","2","1","14","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is believed that artificial intelligent methods have the potential to apply on it and solve uncertainties. Although there already exist some sorts of controllers in the communication networks designed either from intuition or probabilistic and conventional control theories that do include intelligence for some extent, they are not constructed in the way as intelligent control. As a result, those share the benefits from the research contributions of artificial intelligent and intelligent control.

An artificial immune system algorithm, antibody clone algorithm, is put forward. Compared with an improved gene algorithm, the new algorithm is shown to be an evolutionary strategy capable of solving complex machine learning tasks, like multi-modal optimization. Using Markov chain theories, it is proved that the antibody clone algorithm is convergent.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1176807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1176807","","Artificial immune systems;Artificial intelligence;Biology computing;Cloning;Evolution (biology);Genetic mutations;Immune system;Machine learning algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Stochastic processes","Markov processes;convergence;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation","Markov chain;antibody clone algorithms;artificial immune system algorithm;artificial intelligence;clonal operator;clonal selection theory;complex machine learning tasks;convergent algorithm;evolutionary strategy;multi-modal optimization","","21","","11","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
