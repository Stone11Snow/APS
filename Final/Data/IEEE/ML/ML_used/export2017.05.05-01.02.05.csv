Multiple pairs of the truth binary neural network and the false binary neural network are trained to predict multiple pairs of the truth and false membership values. The difference between each pair of truth and false membership values is considered as vagueness in the classification and formed as the indeterminacy membership value. The three memberships obtained from each pair of networks constitute an interval neutrosophic set. Multiple interval neutrosophic sets are then created and used to support decision making in multiclass classification. We have applied our technique to three classical benchmark problems including balance, wine, and yeast from the UCI machine learning repository.

In Cognitive Psychology, the study of conceptual system has an in-depth cognitive investigate on issues of development and representation. However, there lack investigations on the details of system construction and realization. Based on the theory of Developmental Psychology, this paper proposes an object-based representation method for conceptual system, focusing on the representation and development of concepts on four levels: Implicit (I), Explicit 1 (E1), Explicit 2 (E2) and Explicit 3 (E3) representations.

In this paper, a method called TFKNN(Tree-Fast-K-Nearest-Neighbor) is presented, which can search the exact k nearest neighbors quickly.

The most common way for Diabetes Educators to inform diabetes patients of their nutrition therapy is by introducing food substitution. Patients are taught to replace food items from the same food group based on the quantity of the desired nutrients. However, this method may not provide the best results because it does not accurately take into account of all the food characteristics, diabetes diet care requirements, and the relationships between the different types of food. The goal of our study is to propose an automated food ontology constructed for diabetes diet care. Our methods include generating an ontology skeleton with hierarchical clustering algorithms (HCA), class naming by intersection naming, and instance ranking by granular ranking and positioning.

B-SVMs randomly decomposes a large-scale task into many smaller and simpler sub-tasks in training phase and uses simple Bayesian formalism rules to make decision for final classification in test phase. B-SVMs was compared with single SVMs that is trained on entire training data set, parallel SVMs combined by majority voting (MV-SVMs), and one kind of fast modular SVMs (FM-SVMs). Experimental results on four problems show that B-SVMs can get higher accuracy than MV-SVMs and FM-SVMs does, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce training and test time.

In weighted rough sets, weighted entropy is introduced and extended to compute the information content introduced by attributes. A forward greedy weighted attribute reduction algorithm based on the weighted entropy and a weighted rule extraction algorithm are provided. The factors of weighted strength, weighted certainty and weighted cover are employed to evaluate the extracted rules. Finally, a decision algorithm based on the weighted strength factor is constructed. Based on weighted rough sets, a series of experiments on class imbalance learning are conducted on 20 UCI data sets. In the meaning of AUC and minority class accuracy, WRS achieves the better results than classical rough set in class imbalance learning.

The resulting estimator has a closed form and is expressed using the mean and variance of Gaussian subsources. In order to obtain the two most likely subsources which generate the mixture, we use the estimation-detection technique. We also show that the binary mask filtering which has been empirically - and with no mathematical justification - used in speech separation techniques is, in fact, a simplified form of the MMSE estimator. The proposed technique is compared with the binary mask when the input consists of male-male, female-female, and female-male mixtures.

Feature selection in this case may be needed to improve the classifier's generalization performance (given limited training data), to reduce classification complexity, and/or to identify a minimum subset of features necessary for accurate classification, i.e., a set of putative ""biomarkers"". While there are a variety of techniques for SVM-based feature selection, many such may be unsuitable for huge feature spaces due to computational and/or memory requirements. One popular, lightweight scheme is recursive feature elimination (RFE), wherein the feature with smallest weight magnitude in the current solution is eliminated at each step. Here we propose an alternative to RFE that is stepwise superior in that it maximizes margin (in the separable case) and minimizes training error rate (in the non- separable case), rather than minimizing weight magnitude.

The first two measures are derived from second-order statistical models and last measures are based upon information theory concepts. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used as a baseline and reference system. For all experiments, the file sections used for testing have never been used during training. With matched conditions all examined measures yield the best and similar scores (almost 100%). With mismatched conditions, the proposed measures yield better scores than the GMM baseline system, especially for the short testing case.

SIMO-model-based ICA can separate the mixed signals, not into monaural source signals but into SIMO-model-based signals from independent sources in their original form at the microphones. Thus, the separated signals of SIMO-model-based ICA can maintain the spatial qualities of each sound source. Owing to this attractive property, SIMO-model-based binary masking can be applied to efficiently remove the residual interference components after SIMO-model-based ICA. In addition, the performance deterioration due to the latency problem in ICA can be mitigated by introducing real-time binary masking.

By defining the extended measure, clustering methods are studied for the abstract data objects. Framework of clustering algorithm for models is presented. To validate the effectiveness of models clustering algorithm, we choose the hierarchical model clustering algorithm in the experiments. Models in clustering algorithm are BP (back propagation) neural networks and learning method is BP algorithm. Measures are chosen as both same-fault measure and double-fault measure for pairwise of models. Distances between clusters are the single link and the complete link, respectively. By this way, we may obtain part of neural network models which are from each cluster and improve diversity of neural network models. Then, part of models is ensembled. Moreover, we also study the relations between the number of clusters in clustering analysis, the size of ensemble learning, and performance of ensemble learning by experiments.

Presently, we demonstrate how multiplicative updates also can be used for unconstrained optimization. This is for instance useful when estimating the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) i.e. least squares minimization with L<sub>1</sub>-norm regularization, since the multiplicative updates (MU) can efficiently exploit the structure of the problem traditionally solved using quadratic programming (QP). We derive two algorithms based on MU for the LASSO and compare the performance to Matlabs standard QP solver as well as the basis pursuit denoising algorithm (BP) which can be obtained from www.sparselab.stanford.edu. The algorithms were tested on three benchmark bio-informatic datasets: A small scale data set where the number of observations is larger than the number of variables estimated (M < J) and two large scale microarray data sets (M Gt J). For small scale data the two MU algorithms, QP and BP give identical results while the time used is more or less of the same order. However, for large scale problems QP is unstable and slow. Both algorithms based on MU on the other hand are stable and faster but not as efficient as the BP algorithm and converge slowly for small regularizations. The benefit of the present MU algorithms is that they are easy to implement, they bridge multiplicative updates to unconstrained optimization and the updates derived monotonically decrease the cost-function thus does not need any objective function evaluation. Finally, both MU are potentially useful for a wide range of other models such as the elastic net or the fused LASSO. The Matlab implementations of the LASSO based on MU can be downloaded.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414278","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414278","","Benchmark testing;Bridges;Computer languages;Constraint optimization;Large-scale systems;Least squares approximation;Mathematical model;Noise reduction;Pursuit algorithms;Quadratic programming","convergence of numerical methods;least mean squares methods;optimisation;quadratic programming","L<sub>1</sub>-norm regularization;LASSO;basis pursuit denoising algorithm;benchmark bio-informatic datasets;large scale microarray data sets;least absolute shrinkage and selection operator;least squares minimization;multiplicative updates;quadratic programming;small scale data set;unconstrained optimization","","1","","20","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An image prior is defined by imposing Student-t densities on the outputs of local convolutional filters, which are termed ""experts"". Thus, this prior can simultaneously smooth flat areas of the image and preserve edges in different directions.

We use convex analysis to revisit the standard kernel-based classification task as the problem of finding a point that belongs to a closed halfspace (a special closed convex set) in an RKHS. In such a way, classification in an online setting, where data arrive sequentially, is treated as the task of finding a point in the nonempty intersection of an infinite sequence of closed halfspaces in RKHS. Convex analysis is also used to introduce sparsification arguments in the design by imposing a simple convex constraint on the norm of the classifier. An algorithmic solution to this optimization problem, where new convex constraints are added every time instant, is given by the recently introduced Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method (APSM) which unifies a number of well-known adaptive projection-based algorithms such as the classical Normalized Least Mean Squares (NLMS) and the Affine Projection Algorithm (APA). Several theoretical results are established for the generated sequence of classifiers in the RKHS: monotone approximation, strong convergence, asymptotic optimality, and characterization of the limit classifier. Further, we show that the additional convex constraint on the norm of the classifier naturally leads to an online sparse approximation of the resulting kernel series expansion. The validation of the proposed method is performed by considering the adaptive equalization of a nonlinear communication channel.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414322","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414322","","Adaptive equalizers;Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Character generation;Constraint optimization;Convergence;Hilbert space;Kernel;Least squares approximation;Projection algorithms","Hilbert spaces;affine transforms;classification;convex programming","APA;APSM;NLMS;RKHS;adaptive projected subgradient method;affine projection algorithm;convex analysis;kernel based classification;normalized least mean squares;online classification;projections;reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces;sparse approximation","","4","","22","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By incorporating the kernel function, correntropy is able to utilize higher order statistics to enhance the resolution of pitch estimation. The proposed PDA calculates the summary of correntropy functions from the outputs of an equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB) filter bank.

An ICA model is proposed defining the sources as dimensions of the learning styles of the students. A novel non-parametric ICA and standard ICA algorithms are applied to huge historical web log data from a virtual campus in order to detect relationship between web activities and learning styles. The data are divided by the course types in: graduate and regular academic career courses and each of those divisions is separated in two subsets: cases with grades and cases with no grades. Web activities include events as course access, email exchange, forum participation, news reading, chats and achievements. Suitable learning styles of the students were positively detected for graduate courses with grades using the non-parametric ICA algorithm.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414316","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414316","","Boosting;Data mining;Demography;Electronic commerce;Electronic learning;Engineering profession;Independent component analysis;Information analysis;Navigation;Web pages","computer aided instruction;distance learning;educational courses","academic career courses;e-learning;education activities;email exchange;forum participation;historical web log data;independent component analysis;learning styles;news reading;virtual campus","","0","","27","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

SVR has been applied successfully to time-series analysis, but its optimization algorithm is usually built up from certain quadratic programming (QP) packages. Therefore, for small datasets this is practical and QP routines are the best choice, but for large datasets, data processing runtimes become lengthy, which limits its application. Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm can improve operation speed and reduce this long runtime. In this paper, SVR that is based on the SMO algorithm is used to forecast two typical time series models: Wolfer sunspot number data and Box and Jenkins gas furnace data. The results of simulation prove that the operational speed of SVR using the SMO algorithm is improved in comparison to SVR employing QP optimization algorithm; moreover, the forecasting precision is better than that of neural network and SVR using QP optimization algorithm.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370546","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370546","Model analysis and forecast;Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm;Support vector machine;Support vector regression;Time series","Algorithm design and analysis;Data processing;Machine learning;Packaging machines;Predictive models;Quadratic programming;Runtime;Statistical learning;Support vector machines;Time series analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);quadratic programming;regression analysis;support vector machines;time series","learning machine;quadratic programming;sequential minimal optimization;statistical learning theory;support vector machine;support vector regression;time series model","","3","","13","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

And it has become an interesting research after neural networks in machine learning. But it can hardly be handle by the learning problems based on random sets samples. In this paper, combined with the theory of random sets, the definition of the subtraction between the set and the real number is presented, and then some correlative theorems are proven. According to these, some of main concepts of statistical learning theory based on random sets samples are introduced, and at last, the key theorem of learning theory based on random sets samples is given and proven.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370629","ERM principle;Hausdorff metric;Key theorem;Random sets;Subtraction","Computer science;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Learning systems;Machine learning;Mathematics;Neural networks;Random variables;Statistical learning;Support vector machines","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;random processes;set theory;statistical analysis;theorem proving","correlative theorem proving;machine learning;neural networks;random sets samples;statistical learning theory;subtraction definition","","1","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional SVM classifies the data with numerical features. However, in most cases of real world, there are much more data with fuzzy features. It is difficult to apply traditional SVM to fuzzy data directly to classify. In this paper, we provide a fuzzy SVM for the data with triangular fuzzy number features. The designing fundamentals and method of computation and realization are given. The experiment results show that the new method proposed in this paper is more effective and practical. This new method optimizes the classified result of support vector machine and enhances the intelligent level of support vector machine.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370633","Binary classification;Support vector machine;Triangular fuzzy number","Computer science;Cybernetics;Design methodology;Educational institutions;Machine intelligence;Machine learning;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","fuzzy SVM;fuzzy features;learning machine;statistical learning theory;support vector machine;triangular fuzzy numbers","","2","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
