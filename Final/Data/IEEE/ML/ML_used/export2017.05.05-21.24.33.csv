But those models couldn't support abstract objects such as point and line which are very common in real applications. To deal with this, multi-dimensional spatial occlusion relation (MSO) is put forward. The foundation of MSO is MRCC which is the multi-dimensional extension of RCC. So MSO is suitable for both real and abstract objects. The conception neighborhood and composition of MSO is given. Finally MSO is extended to spatio-temporal relation by adding time feature.

One of the main challenges in Bayesian networks structure learning is the development of inductive learning techniques that scale up to large and possibly physically distributed data sets. We consider an approach to learning the structure of BN from distributed data. This is based on the collective learning strategy, where a local structure is obtained at each site and the global structure is obtained by cross learning and combining. Local learning is used to identify the local structure of local nodes and local links of cross nodes from local sample data sets. Cross learning can find the entire cross-links of cross nodes. Combined together, the local BNs and BN learnt from cross learning and removes any extra local links. We use the collective learning algorithm in distributed flood decision supporting system. The result shows that the Bayesian network structure is the same compare the collective learning algorithm from distributed data sets with learning from concentrated data sets.

Obviously, the requirement of forgery signatures is impractical. This paper presents an off-line signature verification system that only requires the genuine signatures of a new user. At the training stage the system learns the mapping between the parameters of classifiers without simple forgeries and those with simple forgeries. In the application stage, a primary classifier is trained for a new user without his/her simple forgeries. The final classifier is obtained by transforming the primary classifier via the mapping learnt in the training stage.

For evaluating its performance, a purely auto-regressive (AR) model is constructed for comparison. The testing result has shown that the prediction of our RBFN model is more accurate.

Then the data is transmitted to the center data fusion unit that contains several model fusion methods and enters into the suitable fusion arithmetic to complete the fusion separately and automatically on the basis of the type of the datum, and then the outputting information comes into the expert arbitration unit to realize the precise fault diagnosis.

To maximize that advantage, knowledge management needs to be available across the whole of the enterprise. Before a knowledge management system is built, the knowledge that pervades the organization is identified and recovered. This paper applies artificial intelligence (AI) techniques within traditional knowledge frameworks to mine association rules for supporting organizational knowledge management and decision making. The mining procedure consists of two essential modules. One is a clustering module based on a neural network, a self-organization map (SOM), which performs grouping tasks on the tremendous number of database records. The other is a rule extraction module applying rough set theory that extracts association rules for each homogeneous cluster and the relationships between different clusters. A simple example is used for describing, how self-organizing map and rough set theory applied in this paper.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259792","","Artificial intelligence;Asset management;Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Databases;Decision making;Knowledge management;Set theory;Technology management","data mining;decision making;knowledge management;pattern clustering;rough set theory;self-organising feature maps","AI techniques;artificial intelligence;decision making;gain competitive advantage;homogeneous cluster;intellectual assets;mine association rules;neural network;organizational knowledge management;rough set theory;self-organizing map","","2","","8","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our approach to plan recognition does not need a plan library, which may cause the problems in searching the plan space of exponential size.

In this paper, first we investigate how to integrate the RDM's classification quality performance index into the GK clustering algorithm in the product space of input and output variables. Then we suggest the way to convert the fuzzy cluster models to rough data models. Hence, we work out an efficient algorithm that can obtain RDMs by just iteratively computing two necessary condition equations, which can minimize the objective function, and turn the multi-dimensional search process of Kowalczyk's method to one dimensional search strategy (in terms of the number of clusters). This technique reduces the searching time greatly. Moreover, by introducing the concept of the fuzzy degree of fulfillment (DoF) to a cluster rule, our approach seems to be much more flexible and more powerful ability in handling data contaminated by noise, with better generalization ability compared with the traditional rough set theory and the Kowalczyk's method.

There are many factors affecting the pellet sphericity in shperonization process, such as the starting materials, spheronization speed, residence time, etc. A satisfactory sphericity measure can indicate how to adjust the starting materials and the operating variables. In this paper, edge detection is employed to obtain a pellet image boundary robustly and then calculate the pellet sphericity. Active contour models, also termed as snakes by the nature of their evolution are a sophisticated approach to contour extraction. Conventional snakes suffer difficulty in appropriate choice of an initial contour and values of parameters. The dual active contour models can relieve this problem by combining with a local shape model to improve the parameterization.
