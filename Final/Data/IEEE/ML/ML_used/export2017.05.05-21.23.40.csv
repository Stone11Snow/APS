So it has more powerful frequency resolution than wavelet transform and is better for machinery fault diagnosis such as hydro-generator with higher frequency vibration signal. But its algorithm is too complex to be used in real-time diagnosis system which an greatly increase the reliability of machinery facility running. In order to simplify the algorithm of wavelet package and reduce the need of memory in real-time system during signal decomposition, one novel lifting scheme of wavelet package is put forward which can quickly decompose signal and extract fault information while collecting signal. With optimization of the program structure of the algorithm on DSP the scheme can realize on-line monitoring and real-time diagnosing of machinery fault. Experiment shows that this algorithm of lifting wavelet package runs well in a real-time fault diagnosis system of hydro-generator.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264498","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264498","","Data mining;Digital signal processing;Fault diagnosis;Frequency;Machinery;Packaging machines;Power system reliability;Real time systems;Signal resolution;Wavelet transforms","fault diagnosis;hydroelectric generators;lifting;real-time systems;wavelet transforms","hydro-generator;machinery fault;machinery fault diagnosis;online monitoring;real-time fault diagnosis system;signal decomposition;wavelet package lifting scheme;wavelet package transform","","1","","6","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, mean shift procedure is used to find the highest density regions which correspond to clusters centered on the modes (local maxima) of the underlying probability distribution in the feature space. The principal component of each significant color is extracted by mode. Second, homogeneous regions corresponding to the modes are as markers to label an image, then marker-controlled watershed transformation is applied to the image segmentation. The segmentation of blood cells is discussed. The input parameters are a few initial color markers that represent significant colors. By combining both methods, the oversegmentation is able to be prevented, touching and overlapping nucleated cells can be separated, and running time is reduced too. The proposed algorithm is very robust to different color space, varied preparation and illumination for blood cell images.

In this paper, a new image fusion algorithm based on wavelet packet transform to fuse multisensor images is presented. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can offer a more precise way for image analysis, than other multi-resolution analysis. It decomposes an image into low frequency band and high frequency band in different level, and it can also be reconstructed gradually in different level. But this method only decomposes low frequency band in a higher scale, so that it omits some useful details of the images. In this paper, we present a new image fusion algorithm. In the algorithm, we use discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to decompose and reconstruct the images. When images are merged in wavelet packet space, different frequency ranges are processed differently. It can merge information from original images adequately and improve abilities of information analysis and feature extraction. This image fusion is performed at the pixel level. In this fusion algorithm, a feature-based fusion rule is used to combine original subimages and to form a pyramid for the fused image. Through merging remote sensing images from multi-sensor to a same object by applying method of wavelet packet analysis, we have obtained a fused picture. In this paper, mutual information is employed as a means of objective assessing image fusion performance. The experiment results show that this fusion algorithm, based on wavelet packet transform, is an effective approach in image fusion area.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259946","","Discrete wavelet transforms;Frequency;Humans;Image analysis;Image fusion;Image reconstruction;Image sensors;Remote sensing;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet packets","discrete wavelet transforms;feature extraction;image reconstruction;image sensors;remote sensing;sensor fusion","discrete wavelet packet transform;feature extraction;human visual perception;image fusion;images reconstruction;multiple image sensor data;multisensor images;remote sensing image","","7","","7","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

According to skin-color distribution in the color space, we developed a statistical skin-color model through interactive sample training. Using this model we convert the color image to binary image and then segment face candidate region. Then we use a facial feature matching scheme for further detection. The presence or absence of a face in each region is verified by means of mouth detector. Real time detection and tracking can be achieved by using this method in video images. In order to speed up tracking, we improve the traditional method by adding motion prediction, which works better when several disturbing objects appear simultaneously. Finally we make the tracking region blurring and transmit the frames to the remote collaborative sites to obtain the privacy protection. The level of privacy protection can be dynamically adjusted according to collaborators' requests and credibility of remote sites.

Bilateral neural network with feedback provides robustness to noise. Orthogonal basis and self inhibition function strengthens sparseness of the code.

But that is only global semantic feature of a document and loses local feature and structural information so that it prevents us to distinguish text well, especially in copy detection. In this paper we present a new text feature extraction model: semantic sequence model (SSM) that based on the concepts of word distance, word density and semantic sequence. The semantic sequences of a document contain not only local semantic features but also global feature and structural information, on which we get excellent accuracy of text copy detection.

A binary skin color map is firstly obtained by applying the skin/non-skin classification algorithm, and then the integral image representation is used to preprocess the skin and intensity map. Thereafter, the refined skin areas are selected from input image for further detection. In the next processing, an intensity distribution model, which can be calculated on integer image very quickly, is used to decide whether the selected skin area contains a face candidate or not. In the possible face areas a new approach is designed to locate eyes accurately. Based on the positions of eyes, the other facial features are located and then the geometrical information of all facial features is used to further verify human face. Experiment results show the proposed method can successfully detect the frontal human faces with a wide range of variations in color, lighting, scale and expression from color image with complex backgrounds.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260064","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260064","","Color;Computer architecture;Cybernetics;Detectors;Eyes;Face detection;Face recognition;Facial features;Humans;Skin","eye;face recognition;image classification;image colour analysis;image representation;skin","binary skin color map;color image;eye location;eye position;facial features;frontal human faces;geometrical information;integral image representation;intensity distribution model;nonskin classification algorithm;real time human face detection;skin classification algorithm","","3","79","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system directly analyzes image intensities using neural networks, whose parameters are learned automatically from training examples. We add false detections into the training set as training progresses. This eliminates the difficult task of manually selecting non-face training examples, which must be chosen to span the entire space of non-face images.

Two large classes of constraint-based frequent itemsets mining (monotone constraint and succinct constraint) have been investigated. However, the problem of frequent itemsets mining with tough constraint has not been solved just because of the complexity of the constraint. In this paper, we propose a TCA algorithm (tough constraint-based frequent itemsets mining algorithm) which uses the order as the pre-process to solve the problem. The principle of the algorithm is to push the tough constraint deeply inside the candidate generation-and-test approach such as a priori. We also extend it to the multi-constraint case.

Usually, the classifier whose inputs are statistical features is easy to train, but its robustness isn't good. The advantage of the classifier whose input is configurable feature is its better reliability, but this kind of classifier usually needs a complicated pretreatment process. So, the classifier, which based on two-kind feature and two-stage classifier, synthesizes the advantages of the two kinds of classifiers and avoids the flaws.

Moreover, many databases are distributed in nature. It is important to device efficient methods for distributed data mining. It is well known that distributed database has an intrinsic data skew property. So it is desirable to mine the global rules for the global business decisions and the local rules for the local business decision. In this paper a mobile-agent-based distributed knowledge discovery architecture has been proposed for data mining in the distributed, heterogeneous database systems. Based on this architecture a flexible and efficient mobile-agent-based distributed algorithm for association rules (IDMA) is presented that can mine the global and local large itemsets at the same time. Furthermore, when mining the local large itemsets an incremental algorithm (IAA) is employed, which utilizes a heuristic selective scan technique to reduce the number of database scans required and to keep the size of the candidate itemset sets from increasing exponential. The performance of IDMA is studied.

Since the point is moving while the camera is moving, then even if the camera motion is known, it is impossible to reconstruct the 3D location of the point under general circumstances. However, we show that if the point is moving along a straight line, and the camera focal is allowed to vary, then the parameters of the line (and hence the 3D position of the point) and the camera focal can be uniquely recovered from at least 6 views. We first form the measurement matrix with the unknown focal length, then the focal length is estimated iteratively so that the rank of the measurement matrix is made to be as close as possible to 5; From the measurement matrix, the line of the moving point can be recovered; at last, the 3D points are reconstructed by intersecting each ray with the line. Thus we propose a novel method in the auto-calibration of camera field of computer vision that is based on the dynamic points.

Before denoising the signal, efficient expectation maximization (EM) algorithms are developed for fitting the HMMs to observational signal data. Parameters of trained HMM are used to modify wavelet coefficients according to the rule of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the signal.

However, keeping a single CBR system seems to be outdated and not practical. With the increasing requests for useful references for all kinds of problems and from different locations, multi-CBR agents located in different places are of great support to fast meet these requests. In this paper, first, a multi-CBR agents system is proposed. In this system, each CBR agent locates at different places, and is assumed to have the same ability to deal with new case (problem) independently. Next, when requests in a request queue from different places are coming one by one, we propose a new policy of dispatching which agent to orderly satisfy the request queue. In the whole paper, we assume that the system must solve one request by considering only past requests. In this context, the performance of a kind of greedy algorithm is not satisfied. We apply a new but simple approach-competitive algorithm for on-line problem (called ODAL) to decide the dispatching policy from the aspect of keeping comparative low cost. The corresponding on-line dispatching algorithm is proposed and the competitive ratio is given, based on which the dispatching of multi-CBR agents is optimized.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259845","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259845","","Computer science;Cost function;Dispatching;Greedy algorithms;Mathematics;Mobile agents;Multiagent systems;Optimal control;Problem-solving;Web sites","algorithm theory;dispatching;optimisation;queueing theory;software agents","approach-competitive algorithm;competitive algorithm;greedy algorithm;online multiCBR agent dispatching;optimization problem;request queue","","0","","4","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a one-class SVM based approach, trained with abstracted user audit logs data from 1999 DARPA.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260106","","Computer errors;Computer security;Cybernetics;Data security;Information security;Information systems;Intrusion detection;Protection;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines;system monitoring","DARPA;Internet;SVM;anomaly detection;computer system security;information system security;intrusion detection;pattern analysis;support vector machines;system audit log files","","4","","10","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, we exclude R-component in RGB color space, then use G-component and B-component as the Fisher transform vector to enhance the lip image. Finally, in the enhanced image, we adaptively set the threshold to separate the lip color and the skin color in the light of the normal distribution of the gray value histogram.

The EPMF method adds the multiscale top-hat transformation and bottom-hat transformation to the conventional multiscale morphological opening and closing filtering. The two added transformations are used to extract and smooth the features which are smaller than the current scale. It is also found that the smaller features have greater possibilities to contain noise particles. Accordingly, the coefficients of top-hat transformation and bottom-hat transformation are modified.

It is knowledge about the state of a particular environment, thus needs frequent exchange of information about other collaborators and the whole group. Bitmap-based collaborative graphics editing systems are a special class of CESs. Because of the intrinsic characteristics of bitmap, the data-streams need to be exchanged in the network will increase dramatically. On the other hand, different collaborators in one collaborative group may have different collaborative requirement and different network environment. So it is not wise to deliver the same large data-stream to distinct receivers. Instead, we propose a multi-level coding method, which encodes each bitmap operation into several different granularities. As a result, different collaborators receive different data-stream in different granularity according to their current requirement and network condition. In addition, we also propose a self-adaptive awareness model by combining the awareness model with network QoS. It adjusts the awareness strategy and awareness coefficient intelligently to make the awareness model adaptive to the network condition.

However, for the sake of distributed embedded system's inherent properties, especially for real-time property, load balancing strategy may not be desirable. On consideration of those properties, an improved load management scheme is presented based on a new way of resource reservation, which has considerable enhancements in satisfying real-time requirements. First, the conception of satisfaction to real-time requirement of incoming task is introduced in a new aspect. Then the implementation of resource reservation is narrated in detail. Under this concept of load management, the new incoming tasks are allocated to the most heavily loaded node, if only the service node can provide real-time satisfaction. Thus, a great amount of calculating resources is reserved for those tasks that require almost full resource of a service node. In addition, a central control model based on this improved load management is introduced into application and implement in building up a prototype system according to this model. During this simulation, the new load management strategy based on resource reservation shows great advantage according to real-time criteria against load balancing. The conclusion comes into being that the resource reservation strategy arising in the paper benefits from a distributed embedded system with high real-time requirements.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259834","","Centralized control;Computer science;Delay;Embedded computing;Embedded system;Load management;Measurement standards;Optimization;Prototypes;Real time systems","distributed processing;embedded systems;resource allocation;software prototyping","distributed systems;embedded systems;load balancing strategy;load management;real-time systems;resource reservation strategy","","1","","10","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an image-based solution to recognize the sleep motions. We use the contact free and IR-based night vision camera to capture the video frames during the sleep of the patient. The video frames are used to recognize the body orientations and the body directions such as the ""body up"", ""body down"", ""body right"", and ""body left"". In addition to the image processing, the proposed artificial neural network (ANN) sleep motion recognition solution is composed of two neural networks. These two neural networks are organized as in a cascade configuration. The first ANN model is used to identify the body orientation features from the images; and the follower ANN model is constructed based on the features that are identified by the first ANN model to recognize the body direction.

The result of simulation shows that the fuzzy learning control is superior to the conventional PID control systems.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264547","","Arithmetic;Control systems;Force control;Fuzzy control;Fuzzy systems;Iterative methods;Robust control;Servomechanisms;Servosystems;Three-term control","adaptive control;control system synthesis;electrohydraulic control equipment;fuzzy control;fuzzy set theory;iterative methods;learning systems;robust control;servomechanisms;three-term control","PID control systems;electrohydraulic servo force control system;fuzzy control method;fuzzy learning control;iterative learning control;learning arithmetic;robustness","","2","","5","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such cases, reactive navigation controllers are commonly employed to deal with the uncertainties in motion planning and control. To realize the automatic design of reactive navigation controllers, a self-learning navigation method is proposed in this paper. The self-learning reactive navigation method is based on a Markov decision model of the navigation problem and uses reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize the action policies of mobile robots. Neural networks are employed to approximate value functions in continuous state spaces so that the self-learning navigation controller has good generalization ability and learning efficiency. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259909","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259909","","Automatic control;Learning;Mobile robots;Motion control;Motion planning;Navigation;Neural networks;Optimization methods;Path planning;Uncertainty","Markov processes;computerised navigation;dynamic programming;mobile robots;optimisation;path planning;unsupervised learning","Markov decision model;automatic design;global path planning methods;mobile robots;motion planning;reactive navigation controllers;reinforcement learning algorithms;self-learning reactive navigation method;unknown environments","","1","","9","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we present new scalable algorithm for maximal frequent itemset mining. It decomposes the search space by prefix-based equivalence classes, distributes work among the processors and selectively duplicates databases in such a way that each processor can compute the maximal frequent itemsets independently. It utilizes multiple level backtrack pruning strategy, along with vertical database format, counting frequency by simple tid-list intersection operation. These techniques eliminate the need for synchronization, drastically cutting down the communication cost. The analysis and experimental results demonstrate that our approach is well scalable in speedup and sizeup.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264459","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264459","","Algorithm design and analysis;Costs;Data mining;Databases;Distributed computing;Educational institutions;Frequency synchronization;Itemsets;Partitioning algorithms;Scalability","data mining;database management systems;equivalence classes","database duplication;decomposition technique;independent classes;maximal frequent itemsets mining;multiple level backtrack pruning strategy;multiple processors;parallel mining;prefix-based equivalence classes;scalable algorithm;search space;tid-list intersection operation;vertical database format","","0","","15","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
