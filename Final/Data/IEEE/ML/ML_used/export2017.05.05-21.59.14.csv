We evaluate our approach by subselecting data from 1300 hours of conversational English telephone data to train two types large-vocabulary speech recognizers, one with Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based acoustic models, and another based on deep neural networks (DNNs). We show that training data can be reduced significantly, and that our technique outperforms both random selection and a previously proposed selection method utilizing comparable resources. Notably, using the submodular selection method, the DNN system using only about 5% of the training data is able to achieve performance on par with the GMM system using 100% of the training data - with the baseline subset selection methods, however, the DNN system is unable to accomplish this correspondence.","1520-6149;15206149","Electronic:978-1-4799-2893-4; POD:978-1-4799-2894-1; USB:978-1-4799-2892-7","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854213","automatic speech recognition;large-scale systems;machine learning;speech processing","Acoustics;Hidden Markov models;Speech;Speech processing;Speech recognition;Training;Training data","Gaussian processes;combinatorial mathematics;neural nets;optimisation;speech recognition","ASR systems;DNN;GMM based acoustic models;Gaussian mixture model;NP-hard problem;automatic speech recognition;combinatorial optimization problem;constant-factor guarantees;constrained submodular function maximization;data selection technique;deep neural networks;large-scale speech training data;large-vocabulary speech recognizers;submodular subset selection method","","10","1","19","","","4-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Data classification that considers not only physical attributes but also the pattern formation is here called <i>high level classification</i>. In this paper, we present an alternative technique which combines both low and high level data classification techniques. The low level term can be implemented by any classification technique, while the high level term is realized by means of the extraction of the underlying network's features (graph) constructed from the input data, which measures the compliance of the test instances with the pattern formation of the training data. Out of various high level perspectives that can be utilized to capture semantical meaning, we utilize the dynamical features that are generated from a tourist walker in a networked environment. Specifically, a weighted combination of transient and cycle lengths are employed for that end. Furthermore, we show computer simulations with synthetic and widely accepted real-world data sets from the machine learning literature.

Big data analytics is the process of examining large amounts of data of a variety of types (big data) to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information. Its revolutionary potential is now universally recognized. Data complexity, heterogeneity, scale, and timeliness make data analysis a clear bottleneck in many biomedical applications, due to the complexity of the patterns and lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms. Advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms are being developed to address one or more challenges listed above. It is typical that the complexity of potential patterns may grow exponentially with respect to the data complexity, and so is the size of the pattern space. To avoid an exhaustive search through the pattern space, machine learning and data mining algorithms usually employ a greedy approach to search for a local optimum in the solution space, or use a branch-and-bound approach to seek optimal solutions, and consequently, are often implemented as iterative or recursive procedures. To improve efficiency, these algorithms often exploit the dependencies between potential patterns to maximize in-memory computation and/or leverage special hardware (such as GPU and FPGA) for acceleration. These lead to strong data dependency, operation dependency, and hardware dependency, and sometimes ad hoc solutions that cannot be generalized to a broader scope. In this talk, I will present some open challenges faced by data scientist in biomedical fields and the current approaches taken to tackle these challenges.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4003-5; POD:978-1-4799-4004-2","10.1109/ICSC.2014.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881994","BD2K;big dataanalytics;data mining;machine learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Big data;Complexity theory;Conferences;Data mining;Hardware;Machine learning algorithms","Big Data;data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification","Big Data analytics;FPGA;GPU;biomedical applications;branch-and-bound approach;data complexity;data dependency;data examination;data heterogeneity;data mining algorithms;data scale;data scientist;data timeliness;field programmable gate array;graphics processing unit;greedy approach;hardware dependency;iterative procedure;machine learning;operation dependency;pattern space;recursive procedure","","0","","","","","16-18 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, the method implements the feature mapping idea of kernel methods into a multi-layer perceptron. Unlike in kernel learning where the feature space is usually invisible and inaccessible, the multilayer perceptron based mapping is explicit. Therefore, the proposed model can be learned directly in feature space. Together with the inherent sparse representation, the proposed approach will thus be much faster and easier to train even in the event of a large network size. The proposed approach is applied in the context of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Mine-Like Objects detection task. The results show that the proposed approach is able to improve upon the generalization performance of neural network based methods. Its prediction results are also close to or better than those obtained by kernel machines. Its learning and classification speed is shown to far surpass those of kernel machines.

In this latter case, a set of complex network measures are employed because of their abilities to capture spatial, functional and topological relations. Although high level techniques offer powerful features, good classification performance is usually obtained by combining them with some low level algorithms, which, in turn, reduces the efficiency of the overall technique. A priori, the reason is that low level and high level techniques provide different visions of classification. In this way, one cannot simply substitute another. This paper presents a data classification technique in which low level and high level classifications are embedded in a unique scheme, i.e., the proposed technique does not need a separated low level technique. The novelty is the use of a simple and recently proposed complex network measure, named component efficiency. Thus, our algorithm computes the efficiency of information exchanging among vertices in each component and the resulting values are used to drive the classification of the new instances i.e., a new instance will be classified into one of the components (class), in which their local features are in conformity with the insertion of the new instance.

Because the responses are physically derived and thus noisy, the resulting explosion in noise impacts both the adversary (which is desirable) as well as the verifier (which is undesirable). We present the first architecture for linear additive physical functions where the noise seen by the adversary and the noise seen by the verifier are bifurcated by using a randomized decimation technique and a novel response recovery method at an authentication verification server.

Decisions over audiovisual encoding are related to the perceived quality of experience (QoE), but also to the physical attributes of initial material (i.e. resolution, color range, motion activity, audio dynamic range, bandwidth, etc.). Recent research showed that such decisions can be really crucial during the production of audiovisual e-learning material, where poor encoding may lead to unaccepted QoE or even to the creation of negative emotional response. On the other hand, exaggerated high quality encoding may create increased bandwidth demands that are associated with annoying delays and irregular playback flow, resulting again in QoE degradation with similar emotional repulsion. Thus, there has to be a careful treatment with proper encoding balance during the production of both the networked distance learning and stand-alone audiovisual mediated resources. Such machine creativity strategies are investigated in the current work with the utilization of applicable audiovisual features, QoE metrics and emotional measures. The current work is part of a broader research, aiming at implementing intelligent models for optimal audiovisual production and encoding configuration, with respect to the source content attributes, the requested quality of experience (and learning) and the related emotional properties.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6171-9; POD:978-1-4799-6172-6","10.1109/IISA.2014.6878744","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6878744","QoE;audiovisual features;content classification;emotional descriptors;feature ranking;machine learning","Encoding;Estimation;Feature extraction;Multimedia communication;Sentiment analysis;Training;Visualization","computer aided instruction;distance learning;quality of experience","QoE degradation;QoE metrics;audiovisual encoding;audiovisual feature evaluation;audiovisual feature extraction;emotional descriptors;emotional measures;emotional repulsion;encoding configuration;encoding networked distance learning;intelligent models;machine creativity strategies;mediated learning evaluation;multimedia learning content;negative emotional response;optimal audiovisual e-learning material production;perceived quality-of-experience metrics;physical attributes;source content attributes;stand-alone audiovisual mediated resources","","2","","41","","","7-9 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At the core of many of these methods lie reliable workload-prediction techniques that guide in identifying servers, time intervals, and other parameters that are needed for building sustainability solutions based on techniques like virtualization and server consolidation for server systems. Many workload prediction methods have been proposed in the recent paper, but unfortunately they do not deal adequately with the issues that arise specifically in large-scale server systems, viz., extensive nonstationarity of server workloads, and massive online streaming data.

Through templating the SMC structure, the design flow enables efficient mapping of SMC applications to multiple FPGAs. The proposed design flow consists of a parametrisable SMC computation engine, and an open-source software template which enables efficient mapping of a variety of SMC designs to reconfigurable hardware.

These conditions result in the formation of algal blooms, some of which are toxic due to the presence of Microcystis (a cyanobacteria), which produces the hepatotoxin microcystin. The hepatotoxin microcystin threatens human health and the ecosystem, and it is a concern for water treatment plants using the lake water as a tap water source. This study demonstrates the prototype of a near real-time early warning system using integrated data fusion and mining (IDFM) techniques with the aid of both hyperspectral (MERIS) and multispectral (MODIS and Landsat) satellite sensors to determine spatiotemporal microcystin concentrations in Lake Erie. In the proposed IDFM, the MODIS images with high temporal resolution are fused with the MERIS and Landsat images with higher spatial resolution to create synthetic images on a daily basis. The spatiotemporal distributions of microcystin within western Lake Erie were then reconstructed using the band data from the fused products with machine learning or data mining techniques such as genetic programming (GP) models. The performance of the data mining models derived using fused hyperspectral and fused multispectral sensor data are quantified using four statistical indices. These data mining models were further compared with traditional two-band models in terms of microcystin prediction accuracy. This study confirmed that GP models outperformed traditional two-band models, and additional spectral reflectance data offered by hyperspectral sensors produces a noticeable increase in the prediction accuracy especially in the range of low microcystin concentrations.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2329913","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6851120","Harmful algal bloom;image fusion;machine learning;microcystin;remote sensing","Earth;Hyperspectral sensors;Lakes;MODIS;Satellites;Sea surface","data mining;genetic algorithms;geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;lakes;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;remote sensing;sensor fusion;water pollution","Lake Erie;Landsat images;MERIS images;MODIS images;genetic programming models;hyperspectral satellite sensors;integrated data fusion and mining techniques;machine learning;microcystin distribution;multispectral satellite sensors;near real-time early warning system;sensor fusion;spatiotemporal microcystin concentrations;statistical indices;two-band models","","6","","37","","20140709","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

While several nonlinear mixing models have been proposed decades ago, only recently there has been a proliferation of nonlinear unmixing models and techniques in the signal processing literature. This paper aims to give an historical overview of the majority of nonlinear mixing models and nonlinear unmixing methods, and to explain some of the more popular techniques in detail. The main models and techniques treated are bilinear models, models for intimate mineral mixtures, radiosity-based approaches, ray tracing, neural networks, kernel methods, support vector machine techniques, manifold learning methods, piece-wise linear techniques, and detection methods for nonlinearity.

One practical example of online multitask learning is the micro-blog sentiment detection on a group of users, which classifies micro-blog posts generated by each user into emotional or non-emotional categories. This particular online learning task is challenging for a number of reasons. First of all, to meet the critical requirements of online applications, a highly efficient and scalable classification solution that can make immediate predictions with low learning cost is needed. This requirement leaves conventional batch learning algorithms out of consideration. Second, classical classification methods, be it batch or online, often encounter a dilemma when applied to a group of tasks, i.e., on one hand, a single classification model trained on the entire collection of data from all tasks may fail to capture characteristics of individual task; on the other hand, a model trained independently on individual tasks may suffer from insufficient training data. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a collaborative online multitask learning method, which learns a global model over the entire data of all tasks. At the same time, individual models for multiple related tasks are jointly inferred by leveraging the global model through a collaborative online learning approach. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed technique on a synthetic dataset. We also evaluate it on three real-life problems-spam email filtering, bioinformatics data classification, and micro-blog sentiment detection.

Given the importance of classification functions in such applications, this paper presents an architecture for overcoming faults within a classification processor. The approach employs machine learning for modeling not only complex sensor signals but also error manifestations due to hardware faults. Adaptive boosting is exploited in the architecture for performing iterative data-driven training. This enables the effects of faults in preceding iterations to be modeled and overcome during subsequent iterations. We demonstrate a system integrating the proposed classifier, capable of training its model entirely within the architecture by generating estimated training labels.

An important step towards building a full ITS for reading comprehension is to build an automated ranking system that will assign a hardness level to questions used by the ITS. This is the main concern of this work. For this purpose we, first, had to define the set of criteria that determines the rate of difficulty of a question. Second, we prepared a bank of questions that were rated by a panel of experts using the set of criteria defined above. Third, we developed an automated rating software based on the criteria defined above. In particular, we considered and compared different machine learning techniques for the ranking system of the third part of the process: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree and naïve Bayesian network. The definition of the criteria set for rating a question's difficulty, and the development of an automated software for rating a questions' difficulty, contribute to a tremendous advancement in the ITS domain for reading comprehension by providing a uniform, objective and automated system for determining a question's difficulty.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4432-3; POD:978-1-4799-4431-6","10.1109/SWSTE.2014.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6887542","Evaluation methodologies;Intelligent Tutoring Systems;Machine Learning and Analytics","Artificial neural networks;Data mining;Educational institutions;Learning systems;Software;Support vector machines;Taxonomy","Bayes methods;decision trees;intelligent tutoring systems;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;support vector machines","ANN;ITS;SVM;artificial neural network;automated ranking system;automated rating software;decision tree;intelligent tutoring system;learning methods;machine learning techniques;naïve Bayesian network;reading comprehension questions;support vector machine","","0","","22","","","11-12 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the number of parameters to be assessed is generally exponential in n, improving the efficiency is an important concern in knowledge engineering. Non-impeding noisy-AND (NIN-AND) tree causal models reduce the number of parameters to being linear in n, while explicitly expressing both reinforcing and undermining interactions among causes. The key challenge in NIN-AND tree modeling is the acquisition of the NIN-AND tree structure. In this paper, we formulate a concise structure representation and an expressive causal interaction function of NIN-AND trees. Building on these representations, we propose two structural acquisition methods, which are applicable to both elicitation-based and machine learning-based acquisitions.

First, we use an advanced online psychometric testing platform to make new kinds of annotation data available for learning. Second, we develop a technique for harnessing these new kinds of information-“perceptual annotations”-for support vector machines. A key intuition for this approach is that while it may remain infeasible to dramatically increase the amount of data and high-quality labels available for the training of a given system, measuring the exemplar-by-exemplar difficulty and pattern of errors of human annotators can provide important information for regularizing the solution of the system at hand.

This has severe negative effects, including drivers stress due to increased time pressure, reduced usage efficiency of trucks and other commercial vehicles, and increased gas emissions-responsible for climate change and air pollution affecting population health in densely populated areas. As existing centralized approaches were neither efficient, nor scalable, there is a need for alternative approaches. Social insects provide many solutions for dealing with decentralized problems. For instance ants choose their routes based on pheromones left by previous ants. However, Ant Colony Optimization is not directly applicable to vehicle routing, as routing the vehicles to the same road would cause traffic congestion. Yet, the traffic is broadly similar from work-to work-day. This paper introduces an ant-colony optimization-based algorithm called Time-Ants. Time-Ants considers that an amount of “pheromone” or a traffic rating is assigned to each road at any given time in the day. Using an innovative algorithm the vehicle's routes are chosen based on these traffic ratings, aggregated in time. After several iterations this results in a global optimum for the traffic system. Bottlenecks are identified and avoided by machine learning.

Recent advances in remote sensing techniques such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) enable scientists to nondestructively identify structural and biophysical characteristics of forests. This study quantified forest biomass and carbon stock at the plot level from small-footprint full-waveform LiDAR data collected over a montane mixed forest in September 2011, using seven modeling methods: ordinary least squares, generalized additive model, Cubist, bagging, random forest, boosted regression trees, and support vector regression (SVR). Results showed that higher percentiles of canopy height and intensity made significant contributions to the predictions, while other explanatory variables related to canopy geometric volume, structure, and canopy coverage were generally not as important. Boosted regression trees provided the highest accuracy for model calibration, whereas SVR and ordinary least squares performed slightly better than the other models in model validation.

The technique uses hourly counts of cosmic-ray neutrons, a network of 25 capacitance probes measuring soil moisture at half hourly intervals and at five depths (0-50 cm), and a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. We quantified soil moisture in the top portion of the soil during wet and dry periods for training and testing periods. After training, the technique provided reliable estimates of temporal pattern of soil moisture at 10- and 20-cm depths during a wet period using input data only from the cosmic-ray neutron probe. There was overprediction of soil moisture during a dry period, which suggests a longer training period representative of the full range of likely conditions might be required.

Is it possible for the tutor to intervene in the due time? Considering these constraints in terms of feasibility, tutor availability, and time latency, the purpose our project is to automate the human tutor tasks. In this paper we present the design of an intelligent multi-agents system that assists learners during collaborative E-learning. The assistance is done through the analysis of the cognitive and social indicators which determine the outcomes of interactions between learners to estimate their collaboration state.

The proposed solution is mainly composed of three modules: a pre-processing and hand segmentation module, a static gesture interface module and a dynamic gesture interface module. The experiments showed that the core of vision-based interaction systems can be the same for all applications and thus facilitate the implementation. In order to test the proposed solutions, three prototypes were implemented. For hand posture recognition, a SVM model was trained and used, able to achieve a final accuracy of 99.4%. For dynamic gestures, an HMM model was trained for each gesture that the system could recognize with a final average accuracy of 93.7%.

We show that linear coding schemes such as CRC-RLS share a common pairwise boundary class B. Moreover, the corresponding pairwise classifiers can be realized by quadratic SVMs. Using three datasets, we show empirically that collaborative representations are not always required, and that a quadratic SVM has superior generalization over CRC-RLS, with fast classification times. However, SRC exhibits the best prediction accuracy.

However, most of the previous studies focused on the average LLR activity of a particular genotype, which left information that could address differences in individual zebrafish development unattended. In this study, machine learning techniques were employed to distinguish not only zebrafish larvae of different genotypes, but also different batches, based on their response to light stimuli. This approach allows us to perform efficient high-throughput zebrafish screening with relatively simple preparations. Following the general machine learning framework, some discriminative features were first extracted from the behavioral data. Both unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms were implemented for the classification of zebrafish of different genotypes and batches. The accuracy of the classification in genotype was over 80 percent and could achieve up to 95 percent in some cases.

The affect recognition is never perfect, and its accuracy (percentage of times the correct affective state is recognized) depends on many factors. However, it is unclear how this accuracy relates to the overall user experience. As recognition accuracy is difficult to control in a real affective feedback loop, we describe a method of simulating recognition accuracy in a game where difficulty is increased or decreased after each round. The game was played by 261 participants at different simulated recognition accuracies. Participants reported their satisfaction with the recognition algorithm as well as their overall game experience. We observed that in such a game, the affective feedback loop must adapt game difficulty with an accuracy of at least 80 percent to be accepted by users. Furthermore, users who do not enjoy the game are likely to stop playing it rather than continue playing and report low enjoyment. However, the acceptable recognition accuracy may not generalize to other contexts, and studies of affect recognition accuracies in other applications are needed.","1949-3045;19493045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2014.2326870","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824221","Affective computing;computer games;machine learning;physiological computing;user acceptance","Accuracy;Affective computing;Computers;Electroencephalography;Feedback loop;Games;Robot sensing systems","behavioural sciences computing;computer games;emotion recognition;physiology","affect recognition;affective feedback loop;computer games;game experience;recognition accuracy linking;recognition algorithm;user experience","","4","","17","","20140602","April-June 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Digital Forensics Triage is one solution to this problem as it can extract evidence quickly at the crime scene and provide vital intelligence in time critical investigations. Similarly, such methodologies can be used in a laboratory to prioritize deeper analysis of digital devices and alleviate examination backlog. Developments in Digital Forensics Triage methodologies have moved towards automating the device classification process and those which incorporate Machine Learning principles have proven to be successful. Such an approach depends on crime-related features which provide a relevant basis upon which device classification can take place. In addition, to be an accepted and viable methodology it should be also as accurate as possible. Previous work has concentrated on the issues of feature extraction and classification, where less attention has been paid to improving classification accuracy through feature manipulation. In this regard, among the several techniques available for the purpose, we concentrate on feature weighting, a process which places more importance on specific features. A twofold approach is followed: on one hand, automated feature weights are quantified using Kullback-Leibler measure and applied to the training set whereas, on the other hand, manual weights are determined with the contribution of surveyed digital forensic experts. Experimental results of manual and automatic feature weighting are described which conclude that both the techniques are effective in improving device classification accuracy in crime investigations.","2164-7038;21647038","Electronic:978-1-4799-4640-2; POD:978-1-4799-4639-6; USB:978-1-4799-4641-9","10.1109/ICCW.2014.6881277","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881277","Automated feature weighting;Digital Forensics Triage;Machine Learning;feature manipulation;feature selection;improving classification accuracy;manual feature weighting","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Digital forensics;Discrete Fourier transforms;Feature extraction;Manuals","digital forensics;learning (artificial intelligence)","Kullback-Leibler measure;automatic feature weighting;crime scene;device classification accuracy;device classification process;digital devices;digital forensic experts;digital forensics techniques;digital forensics triage methodology;examination backlog;feature extraction;feature manipulation techniques;machine learning principles","","1","","21","","","10-14 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply this system to engineering the output characteristics of the subtilin receiver system of Bacillus subtilis. Simple modifications, such as altering the strength of the output response to a subtilin input, are easily achieved. More complex adaptations, such as modifying the shape of the receiver response curve, necessitate alterations to the topology of the regulatory network.

To address this issue, port numbers and packet payload signatures have been widely used in many existing traffic classification tools. They, however, are far away from completed due to for example the increase of new Internet applications and traffic encryption. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework to classify the Internet traffic, combining a classifier based on the well-known port numbers and packet payload signatures, and a novel heuristic-based co-clustering algorithm for classifying the leftover unknown Internet traffic. Taking advantage of a fast unsupervised co-clustering algorithm with simple flow-based features, our traffic classifier can perform a real-time computing online for application discovery on the Internet. Experimental evaluations with over 200,000 network flows collected over two consecutive days on a large-scale WiFi ISP show that the proposed approach successfully classifies a large portion of the Internet traffic missed by the signature based classifier while also reducing the false alarm rate.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-2653-4; POD:978-1-4799-2654-1","10.1109/WAINA.2014.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844612","Internet traffic classification;machine learning","Classification algorithms;Communities;Heuristic algorithms;IP networks;Internet;Payloads;Ports (Computers)","Internet;cryptography;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","Internet applications;Internet traffic classification;application discovery;false alarm rate;flow-based features;heuristic-based coclustering algorithm;large-scale WiFi ISP;large-scale communication networks;machine learning;network flows;network traffic classification;packet payload signatures;port numbers;real-time computing online;traffic classification tools;traffic classifier;traffic encryption","","3","","46","","","13-16 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Machine learning-based methods transfer depth from a pool of images with available depth maps to query image in parametric and non-parametric manners. However, these methods generally involve processing a large dataset, therefore are rather time-consuming. This paper proposes to speed up the whole implementation in a hierarchical way. First, feature extraction based methods are utilized to evaluate image similarities. Then, clustering methods are performed on the image dataset to partition the dataset into several groups. Finally, instead of searching the whole dataset, the query image only compares with each cluster's representative image and regards the most similar group as the final training dataset.

The novel RBAIL algorithm performs regression on the vital parameters such as Heart Rate, Blood Pressure and Saturated Oxygen Level to predict the abnormality.

This is due to non-optimal splitting decisions boosted by a possibly unlimited number of examples obtained from a data source. To keep the processing speed high and the tree complexity low, appropriate incremental pruning techniques are needed. In this paper, we introduce a pruning technique for the class of incremental linear model trees with approximate lookahead on stationary data sources. Experimental results show that the advantage of approximate lookahead in terms of processing speed can be further improved by producing much smaller and consequently more explanatory, less memory consuming trees on high-dimensional data. This is done at the expense of only a small increase in prediction error. Additionally, the pruning algorithm can be tuned to either produce less accurate model trees at a much higher processing speed or, alternatively, more accurate trees at the expense of higher processing times.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6574839","Machine learning;Online computation;Real-time and embedded systems;Trees;online computation;real-time and embedded systems;trees","Adaptation models;Complexity theory;Data models;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Runtime","learning (artificial intelligence);trees (mathematics)","approximate lookahead;data source;incremental linear model tree pruning;incremental pruning techniques;nonoptimal splitting decisions;prediction error;processing speed;tree complexity","","0","","13","","20130805","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The particles, which have both competitive and cooperative behavior, are created on the network as the result of label queries. They may be created as the algorithm executes and only nodes affected by the new particles have to be updated. Therefore, it saves execution time compared to traditional active learning frameworks, in which the learning algorithm has to be executed several times. The data items to be queried are select based on information extracted from the nodes and particles temporal dynamics. Two different rules for queries are explored in this paper, one of them is based on querying by uncertainty approaches and the other is based on data and labeled nodes distribution.

In this context, the automated learning of a suitable basis or overcomplete dictionary from training data sets of certain signal classes for use in sparse representations has turned out to be of particular importance regarding practical signal processing applications. Most popular dictionary learning algorithms involve NP-hard sparse recovery problems in each iteration, which may give some indication about the complexity of dictionary learning but does not constitute an actual proof of computational intractability. In this technical note, we show that learning a dictionary with which a given set of training signals can be represented as sparsely as possible is indeed ssb NP-hard. Moreover, we also establish hardness of approximating the solution to within large factors of the optimal sparsity level. Furthermore, we give ssb NP-hardness and non-approximability results for a recent dictionary learning variation called the sensor permutation problem.

This paper presents a self-adaptive honeypot system we are developing that tries to overlap some of the disadvantaged that existing systems have.

The problem is exacerbated by the difficulty of selecting the proper modulation and coding scheme when using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This paper presents a data-driven approach to link adaptation for multiuser multiple input mulitple output (MIMO) OFDM systems. A machine learning classifier is used to select the modulation and coding scheme, taking as input the SNR values in the different subcarriers and spatial streams. A new approximation is developed to estimate the unknown interuser interference due to the use of limited feedback. This approximation allows to obtain SNR information at the transmitter with a minimum communication overhead. A greedy algorithm is used to perform spatial mode and user selection with affordable complexity, without resorting to an exhaustive search. The proposed adaptation is studied in the context of the IEEE 802.11ac standard, and is shown to schedule users and adjust the transmission parameters to the channel conditions as well as to the rate of the feedback channel.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2314104","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6787104","IEEE 802.11ac;link adaptation;machine learning;multiuser multiple input multiple output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","Approximation methods;Interference;MIMO;Receivers;Signal to noise ratio;Transmitters;Wireless communication","MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;antenna arrays;approximation theory;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);modulation coding;pattern classification;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication computing","IEEE 802.11ac standard;SNR information;data-driven approach;feedback channel rate;greedy algorithm;learning-based adaptive transmission;limited feedback multiuser MIMO-OFDM;link adaptation;machine learning classifier;minimum communication overhead;modulation and coding scheme;multiantenna system;multiuser multiple input multiple output OFDM systems;multiuser system;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;precoding;spatial mode selection;spatial streams;subcarriers;transmission parameters;unknown interuser interference;user selection","","4","","57","","20140411","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this paper we propose a new method for improving the clustering accuracy of text data. Our method encodes the string values of a dataset using Huffman encoding algorithm, and declares these attributes as integer in the cluster evaluation phase. In the experimental part, we compared the cluster label assigned by the proposed method to each instance of the dataset with its real category, and we obtained a better clustering accuracy than the one found with traditional methods. This method is useful when the dataset to be clustered has only string attributes, because in this case, a traditional clustering method does not recognize, or recognize with a low accuracy, the category of instances.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3732-5; POD:978-1-4799-3733-2; USB:978-1-4799-3730-1","10.1109/AQTR.2014.6857838","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6857838","accuracy;cluster analysis;huffman encoding;machine learning","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data mining;Encoding;Unsolicited electronic mail","Huffman codes;data mining;encoding;pattern clustering;text analysis","Huffman encoding algorithm;IP-address streams;categorical data;cluster evaluation;cluster label assignment;credit-card transaction streams;data mining problem;dataset instance;dataset string value encoding;document organization;indexing;quantitative data;spam detection;string attributes;text data clustering accuracy improvement","","0","","16","","","22-24 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To do this, we applied a novel feature-scoring procedure that incorporates iterative classifier performance to assess feature robustness. We found that small-worldness, a measure of the balance between global integration and local specialization, most reliably differentiated MDD from nondepressed individuals.

First-order statistical features of the Brix parameters were used. In addition, texture analysis of Brix parameter maps was done by constructing gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) from the maps. Clinical factors and first- and second-order features were used as explanatory variables for support vector machine (SVM) classification, with treatment outcome as response. Classification models were validated using leave-one-out cross-model validation. A random value permutation test was used to evaluate model significance. Features derived from first-order statistics could not discriminate between cured and relapsed patients (specificity 0%-20%, p-values close to unity). However, second-order GLCM features could significantly predict treatment outcome with accuracies (~70%) similar to the clinical factors tumor volume and stage (69%). The results indicate that the spatial relations within the tumor, quantified by texture features, were more suitable for outcome prediction than first-order features.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2014.2321024","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807722","Cervix;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);pattern recognition and classification","Accuracy;Correlation;Kernel;Magnetic resonance imaging;Standards;Support vector machines;Tumors","biomedical MRI;cancer;image classification;image texture;medical image processing;radiation therapy;statistical analysis;tumours","Brix parameter maps;Brix pharmacokinetic model;DCE-MRI uptake patterns;SVM;cervical cancer;dynamic contrast enhanced MR image classification;first-order statistical features;gray level cooccurrence matrices;leave-one-out cross-model validation;prechemoradiotherapy DCE-MRI;random value permutation test;second-order GLCM features;support vector machines;texture analysis;tissue;tumor;vascular properties","0","4","","39","","20140429","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The framework either recognizes or estimates user contextual inferences called `user states' within the concept of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) for future context-aware applications. Context-aware applications require continuous data acquisition and interpretation from one or more sensor reading(s). Therefore, device battery lifetimes need to be extended due to the fact that constantly running built-in sensors deplete device batteries rapidly. In this sense, a framework is constructed to fulfill requirements needed by applications and to prolong device battery lifetimes. The ultimate goal of this paper is to present an accurate user state representation model, and to maximize power efficiency while the model operates. Most importantly, this research intends to create and clarify a generic framework to guide the development of future context-aware applications. Moreover, topics such as user profile adaptability and variant sensory sampling operations are examined. The proposed framework is validated by simulations and implemented in a HAR-based application by the smartphone accelerometer. According to the results, the proposed framework shows an increase in power efficiency of 60% for an accuracy range from 75% up to 96%, depending on user profiles.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2013.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497053","Artificial Intelligence;Computer Applications;Computer Systems Organization;Computing Methodologies;Energy-aware systems;Hardware;Learning;Machine learning;Markov processes;Mathematics of Computing;Mobile Applications;Modeling techniques;Performance of Systems;Pervasive computing;Power Management;Probability and Statistics;Special-Purpose and Application-Based Systems;Ubiquitous computing","Context modelinlg;Energy efficiency;Hidden Marov models;Mobile communication","","","","6","","36","","20130411","Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In order to reach a deeper understanding of the molecular nature of complexly orchestrated biological processes, all the available measurements and existing genomic knowledge need to be fused. In this paper, we introduce a tool for machine learning from heterogeneous gene expression data using prior knowledge. The tool is called miXGENE, it is elaborated upon in close connection with the biological departments that dispose of the above-mentioned data and have a strong interest in their integration within particular problem-oriented projects. The main idea is not merely to capture the transcriptional phase of gene expression quantified by the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA). The increasing availability of microRNA (miRNA) data asks for its concurrent analysis with the transcriptional data. Moreover, epigenetic data such as methylation measurements can help to explain unexpected transcriptional irregularities. miXGENE is an environment for building workflows that enable rapid prototyping of integrative molecular models.","1063-7125;10637125","Electronic:978-1-4799-4435-4; POD:978-1-4799-4434-7","10.1109/CBMS.2014.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6881885","classification;gene expression;machine learning;microRNA;prior knowledge;workflow management system","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Cancer;Gene expression;Genomics;Joints","","","","0","","34","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The key novelties of this paper are as follows: 1) the use of spatio-temporal video slices (tomographs) in the same way that visual keyframes are typically used in video concept detection schemes. These spatio-temporal slices capture in a compact way motion patterns that are useful for detecting semantic concepts and are used for training a number of base detectors. The latter augment the set of keyframe-based base detectors that can be trained using different frame representations. 2) The introduction of a generic methodology, built upon a genetic algorithm, for controlling which subset of the available base detectors (consequently, which subset of the possible shot representations) should be combined for developing an optimal detector for each specific concept. This methodology is directly applicable to the learning of hundreds of diverse concepts, while diverging from the one-size-fits-all approach that is typically used in problems of this size. The proposed techniques are evaluated on the datasets of the 2011 and 2012 Semantic Indexing Task of TRECVID, each comprising several hundred hours of heterogeneous video clips and ground-truth annotations for tens of concepts that exhibit significant variation in terms of generality, complexity, and human participation.

In this paper, we propose a context-aware hypergraph similarity measure (CAHSM), which leads to robust spectral clustering in the case of noisy data. We construct three types of hypergraphs-the pairwise hypergraph, the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) hypergraph, and the high-order over-clustering hypergraph. The pairwise hypergraph captures the pairwise similarity of data points; the kNNhypergraph captures the neighborhood of each point; and the clustering hypergraph encodes high-order contexts within the dataset. By combining the affinity information from these three hypergraphs, the CAHSM algorithm is able to explore the intrinsic topological information of the dataset. Therefore, data clustering using CAHSM tends to be more robust. Considering the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separability of vertices, we further design a discriminative hypergraph partitioning criterion (DHPC). Using both CAHSM and DHPC, a robust spectral clustering algorithm is developed. Theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.126","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6570719","Graph-theoretic methods;Hypergraph construction;Machine learning;Spectral clustering;graph partitioning;similarity measure;spectral clustering","Clustering algorithms;Communities;Context;Optimization;Partitioning algorithms;Robustness;Vectors","data analysis;graph theory;pattern clustering","CAHSM algorithm;DHPC;affinity information;context-aware hypergraph construction;context-aware hypergraph similarity measure;data clustering;data point pairwise similarity;discriminative hypergraph partitioning criterion;high-order contexts;high-order over-clustering hypergraph;inter-cluster vertices separability;intra-cluster compactness;intrinsic topological information;k-nearest-neighbor hypergraph;kNN hypergraph;pairwise hypergraph;robust spectral clustering algorithm;unsupervised data analysis","","11","","38","","20130729","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"A hierarchical learning approach to calibrate allele frequencies for SNP based genotyping of DNA pools","A. D. Hellicar; D. Smith; A. Rahman; U. Engelke; J. Henshall","Comput. Inf., CSIRO, Hobart, TAS, Australia","2014 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","20140904","2014","","","183","189","The combination of low density SNP arrays and DNA pooling is a fast and cost effective approach to genotyping that opens up basic genomics to a range of new applications and studies. However we have identified significant limitations in the existing approach to calculating allele frequencies with DNA pooling. These limitations include a reduced ability to deal with SNP to SNP variation via the standard interpolation method. Our contribution is a new hierarchical learning framework which resolves these drawbacks. The framework involves a hierarchy of two greedily trained layers of learners. The first layer learns the bias of each SNP then applies a calibration to reduce SNP bias by mapping into a common coordinate system across all SNPs. The second layer learns an allele frequency function exploiting the global SNP data. A range of algorithms have been applied including linear regression, neural network and support vector regression. The framework has been tested on pooled samples of Black Tiger prawns that have been genotyped with low density Sequenom iPLEX panels. Analysis of pooled samples and the corresponding individually genotyped SNP samples indicate the pooling approach introduces an allele frequency RMS error of 0.12. The existing calibration approach corrects ~14% of the error. Our hierarchical approach is 4.5 times as effective by correcting for ~64% of the introduced error. This is a significant reduction and has the potential to enable genetic studies previously not possible due to allele frequency error. Although testing so far is limited to low density SNP arrays the approach was developed to generalize to other SNP genotyping technologies.","2161-4393;21614393","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6627-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-1484-5; POD:978-1-4799-1482-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889697","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889697","DNA;Machine learning","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Calibration;DNA;Frequency estimation;Genomics;Interpolation","DNA;biology computing;calibration;genetics;genomics;interpolation;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;molecular biophysics;neural nets;polymorphism;regression analysis;support vector machines","DNA pool;SNP array;allele frequency RMS error;allele frequency calibration;allele frequency function;common coordinate system;genotyping;hierarchical learning approach;linear regression;neural network;sequenom iPLEX panel;singular nucleotide polymorphism;standard interpolation method;support vector regression","","3","","18","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This mission is predominant in reconnaissance, but also in responsibilities fluctuating from the investigation of scientific data to the observing of unsurprisingly happening events, and from controlling engineering procedures to noticing human behavior. We will refer to this observing procedure with the determination of classifying remarkable manifestations, as event detection, analysis and classification. With the appearance of personal computers (PCs) a lot of efforts have been made to substitute manual investigation by a computerized manner. Data, nevertheless, have become gradually difficult, and the sizes of gathered data have become enormously bulky in latest years. Text documents, JPEG images, MP3, videos and even relational data are now regularly gathered. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for event detection, analysis and classification in machine vision. Till proposed algorithm is deliberated a significant facility, required degree of event detection cannot be achieved. Finally, we use K-means algorithm for classification of incoming events and proposed algorithm has been validated by Z Formal specification language in general. The proposed algorithm has been implemented in Matlab and results have been gathered through a data mining tool.

"EBGW_OMP: A sequence-based method for accurate prediction of outer membrane proteins","L. Zou; Q. Ni; F. Hu","Dept. of Microbiol., Third Mil. Med. Univ., Chongqing, China","2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology","20140630","2014","","","1","6","Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) play important roles in bacterial cellular processes. Discriminating OMPs from different fold types of proteins is helpful for successful prediction of their structures and for exact designs of OMP-targeted drugs. In this paper, we developed a novel prediction method based on primary sequence features and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. For protein sequences, discriminative features were extracted by the combination of sequence encoding based on grouped weights (EBGW), amino acid compositions and biochemical properties. Feature subsets were screened using F-score algorithm for training a SVM-based classifier, namely EBGW_OMP. The performance of EBGW_OMP was examined on a benchmark dataset of 1087 proteins. The results show that EBGW_OMP can discriminate OMPs from globular proteins, α-helical membrane proteins or non-OMPs with cross-validated accuracy of 98.0%, 97.6% or 97.9%, respectively, which outperformed existing sequence-based methods. EBGW_OMP also successfully distinguished 681 out of 722 OMPs with 97.0% accuracy in another benchmark dataset of 2657 proteins. Genome-wide tests show that EBGW_OMP has excellent capability of correctly detecting OMPs and is considerable for genomic OMPs prediction.

Online learning algorithms can deal with non-stationary or unpredictable environments, but there is no notion of a state that might be changing throughout the learning process as a function of past actions. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in combining the above two frameworks and considering an MDP setting, where the cost function is allowed to change arbitrarily after each time step. However, most of the work in this area has been algorithmic: given a problem, one would design an algorithm from scratch and analyze its performance on a case-by-case basis. Moreover, the presence of the state and the assumption of an arbitrarily varying environment complicate both the theoretical analysis and the development of computationally efficient methods. This paper builds on recent results of Rakhlin et al. to give a general framework for deriving algorithms in an MDP setting with arbitrarily changing costs. This framework leads to a unifying view of existing methods and provides a general procedure for constructing new ones.","0743-1619;07431619","Electronic:978-1-4799-3274-0; POD:978-1-4799-3275-7; USB:978-1-4799-3273-3","10.1109/ACC.2014.6858844","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6858844","Machine learning;Markov processes","Algorithm design and analysis;Cost function;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Kernel;Markov processes;State feedback","Markov processes;computer aided instruction;interactive programming;minimax techniques","MDP;low-regret algorithms;minimax value;nonstationary environments;online Markov decision processes;online learning algorithms;unpredictable environments","","1","","19","","","4-6 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
