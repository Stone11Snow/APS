In this paper, the average entropy and the total entropy are defined to guide the clustering operation over fault modes. This algorithm firstly stores the related information of existing faults in the form of fault tree, and deems each fault as an initial cluster. By calculating the information entropy between clusters and comparing them with the average entropy and the total entropy, fault clustering is completed. For the faults inappropriate to their located clusters, we take a retrospective approach to cluster them. Thereby the clustering effect related with the fault order could be addressed. Secondly, according to the ascending order of information entropy, the fault to be analyzed is matched to each cluster. Lastly, both the fault diagnosis results and fault paths are put out. In addition, if the fault match isn't successful, the fault path will be identified through fault tree, and the clustering results will be updated later.

L1-PCA is adopted to represent these features and LDA is used to analyze and classify the features. L1-PCA tries to find projections through maximizing L1-norm and LDA tries to find the projective direction which minimize the within-class scatter of examples and maximize between-class scatter.

Support vector machines (SVM) based on statistical learning theory and structural risk minimization is proposed to deal with these problems. However, the model complexity and generalization performance of support vector machines (SVM) depend on a good setting of the three parameters (epsiv,c,gamma). In this paper, the particle swarm optimization is applied to optimize the parameters (epsiv,c,gamma) at the same time. Based on the proposed method, both PSO-SVM and SVM models are established and implemented to estimate lumber moisture content value in wood drying process.

Mutual information has been proved to be an effective measure for categorical features. However, there is a limitation in computing relevance between numerical features with mutual information. In this work, we generalize Shannon's information entropy to neighborhood information entropy and propose a measure of neighborhood mutual information. It is shown that the new measure is a natural extension of classical mutual information which reduces to the classical one if features are discrete; thus the new measure can also be used to compute the relevance between discrete variables. In experiment, we show that neighborhood mutual information produces the nearly same outputs as mutual information.

CMTNN consist of a pair of opposite neural networks. The first neural network is trained to predict degree of truth values and the second neural network is trained to predict degree of falsity values. Both neural networks are complementary to each other since they deal with pairs of complementary output values. In order to predict the more accurate outputs, each pair of the truth and falsity values are aggregated based on two techniques which are equal weight combination and dynamic weight combination. The first technique is just a simple averaging whereas the second technique deals with errors occurred in the prediction. We experiment our approach to the classical benchmark problems including housing, concrete compressive strength, and computer hardware from the UCI machine learning repository. It is found that complementary neural networks improve the prediction performance as compared to the traditional single backpropagation neural network and support vector regression used to predict only truth values. Furthermore, the difference between the predicted truth value and the complement of the predicted falsity value can be used as an uncertainty indicator to support the confidence in the prediction of unknown input data.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212716","","Cybernetics;Machine learning;Neural networks","neural nets;regression analysis","complementary neural network;complementary output value;dynamic weight combination;equal weight combination;falsity value;regression problem;truth value","","1","","15","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Game theory provides mathematical models of real-world situations for studying intelligent behavior. Most of time, effective decision-making in strategic situations (such as competitive situations) requires nonlinear mapping between stimulus and response. This sort of mapping can be provided by artificial neural networks. This paper describes the use of a human-like artificial neural network to find the optimal strategy in strategic situations without injecting expert knowledge. In order to train such a neural network, an unsupervised reinforcement-learning rule using back-propagation is introduced. Unlike most of reinforcement learning systems, this learning rule can operate with continuous outputs, what makes it worth for a lot of different applications. Finally, this decision maker is used to find the optimal strategy in the well-known iterated prisoner's dilemma, in order to demonstrate that this human-like artificial neural networks can be used to design machines that are also capable of intelligent behavior.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212314","Artificial Intelligence;Back-Propagation;Game Theory;Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma;Neural Networks;Reinforcement training","Artificial intelligence;Artificial neural networks;Cybernetics;Game theory;Humans;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Machine intelligence;Machine learning;Neural networks","backpropagation;decision making;game theory;neural nets;unsupervised learning","artificial neural network;backpropagation;competitive situation;decision making;game theory;intelligent behavior;iterated prisoner dilemma;mathematical model;nonlinear mapping;strategic situation;unsupervised reinforcement-learning rule","","0","","10","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this approach can not effectively constrain the effect of those irrelevant or redundant features. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we introduce a novel multi-surface proximal support machine classification model incorporating feature selection, which simultaneously implements classification and feature selection for improving the classification performance. Based on this model, we propose a linear multi-surface classification algorithm by a greedy nonexhaustive search strategy(called GEPSVMFS). Further, we develop a non-linear classifier by using kernel trick (called KGEPSVMFS).

First, the deviation between two random variables is defined, and the weights of every feature are determined by using the principle of maximizing deviations between categories, then the value to same feature for all samples is weighted by the corresponding weights of samples, respectively.

In this paper, we firstly propose a method to evaluate structural complexities of decision trees in pruning process.
