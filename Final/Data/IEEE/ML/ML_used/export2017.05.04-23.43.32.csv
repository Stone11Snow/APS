In order to address this problem, we propose a novel real-time collaborative filtering algorithm, called RCF, based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). The initial training and updating of RCF are very fast and can be finished in real time. The experimental results show that the mean recommendation time of RCF is shorter than SVD/ANN and correlation-based algorithms reported in other papers while the accuracy is better.","","POD:978-0-7695-3801-3","10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.80","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5286029","Extreme Learning Machine;collaborative filtering","Artificial neural networks;Collaboration;Filtering algorithms;Information filtering;Information filters;Intelligent agent;Intelligent networks;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","","","","0","","35","","","15-18 Sept. 2009","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

It is proved theoretically in this study that the generalization ability of an ensemble is determined by the diversity of its components' output space. Therefore SE-ELM regards the diversity of components' output space as a target during the training process. In the first phase, SE-ELM initializes each component with different input weights and analytically determines the output weights through generalized inverse operation of the hidden layer output matrices. The difference among components' input weights forces those components to have different output space thus increasing the diversity of the ensemble. Experiments carried on four real world problems show that SE-ELM not only runs much faster but also presents better generalization performance than some classic ensemble algorithms.","","POD:978-1-4244-4129-7","10.1109/CISP.2009.5303973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5303973","","Artificial neural networks;Bagging;Boosting;Engineering management;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Technology management;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","SE-ELM;hidden layer output matrix;neural network ensemble;simple ensemble of extreme learning machine","","1","","12","","","17-19 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most current methods for identifying CGIs suffered from various limitations and involved a lot of human intervention for search purpose. In this paper, we implement a HMM-based CGIs identification system, namely CpG-Discover. Experiments have been conducted on the EMBL human DNA database and in comparison with other widely-used tools. The controlled experimental results indicate that our system is a promising tool and has the capability of locating CGIs accurately. In addition, our system has significant differences from other tools in that it avoids the disadvantages of using sliding windows and it reduces the large amount of human intervention needed to search for or to combine potential CGIs (such as, the thresholds of initial density or distance seed). Therefore, given annotated training data set, our system has the adaptability to find other specific nucleotides sequences in DNA.","2161-4393;21614393","POD:978-1-4244-3548-7","10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5178863","","Bioinformatics;Cancer;Control systems;DNA;Databases;Genomics;Humans;Machine learning;Neoplasms;Sequences","DNA;biological tissues;biology computing;cancer;genetics;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence)","CpG islands identification;CpG-Discover;EMBL human DNA database;cancer;epigenetic causes;genome analysis;genomic markers;hidden Markov model;house-keeping genes;human DNA sequence;machine learning approach;nucleotides sequences;tissue-specific genes;tumor markers","","0","","17","","","14-19 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This shift in intelligence from the edge to the nodes in the network is particularly relevant in unattended sensor deployments where there is no continuous access to a remote base station. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called MALADY, which uses a machine learning approach to enable a network of embedded sensor nodes to use the data that they have gathered to learn and make decisions in real-time within the network and thereby, become autonomous. MALADY supports supervised as well as unsupervised learning algorithms. Our implementation of the algorithms introduces some practical optimizations, in order to make them viable for nodes with limited resources. Our experimental results base don an implementation on the MicaZ mote/TinyOS platform show that the supervised learning technique based on linear discriminant analysis has a higher learning complexity, but allows a sensor node to learn about the data correlations robustly and make decisions accurately, after learning from only a few samples. In comparison, the unsupervised learning technique based on clustering has a low overhead, but requires more learning samples to achieve a high detection accuracy.","","POD:978-1-4244-5334-4","10.1109/CSE.2009.246","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5283875","autonomous decision-making;machine learning;sensor network;supervised learning;unsupervised learning","Base stations;Decision making;Intelligent networks;Intelligent sensors;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Sensor systems;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","decision making;telecommunication computing;unsupervised learning;wireless sensor networks","MALADY;MicaZ mote;TinyOS platform;autonomous decision making system;data correlations;data gathering network;embedded sensor nodes;linear discriminant analysis;machine learning;supervised learning technique;unsupervised learning algorithms;wireless sensor networks","","3","","15","","","29-31 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Multiple ontologies need to be accessed for several applications. A critical issue is ontology integration, which can largely improve the efficiency to enrich such a domain ontology with less time and lower cost for obtaining related knowledge.

A number of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) (arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, atrioventricular (AV) dysfunctions, and coronary arterial disease, etc.) can be detected non-invasively using ECG monitoring devices. With the advent of modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, the diagnostic power of the ECG has expanded exponentially. The principal reason for this is the expanded set of features that are typically extracted from the ECG time series. The enhanced feature space provides a wide range of attributes that can be employed in a variety of machine learning techniques, with the goal of providing tools to assist in CVD classification.

The results of the machine-learning approaches suggest a link between the MODIS AOD biases and surface type.

The knowledge source for ontology population used in this paper is the Web tables of which structure is relatively well organized. Since a Web table can be analyzed into a parse tree, the most appropriate concept within the ontology for a given Web table is determined by a kernel method, so-called a parse tree kernel. Then, the table is populated as an individual of the concept. According to the experimental results on a large ontology with a great number of concepts, the proposed method achieves 62.35% of accuracy for a number of Web tables.","","POD:978-1-4244-3607-1","10.1109/ICINFA.2009.5204981","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5204981","","Data mining;HTML;Humans;Kernel;Machine learning;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Tree graphs;Web pages;XML","grammars;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence)","Web tables;automatic ontology population;machine learning;parse tree kernel;semi-structured documents","","3","","15","","","22-24 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A computer, on the other hand, has no innate ability to recognize a face or facial features, and must be programmed with an algorithm to do so. Generally, to recognize a face, different kinds of the facial features were used separately or in a combined manner. Feature fusion methods and parallel methods performed by integrating multiple feature sets at different levels. However, these feature fusion methods as well as parallel methods do not guarantee better result. Several Feature extraction techniques and fusion models were explored in several earlier works. This work, addresses feature fusion model with multiple weighted facial attribute set. For facial feature set creation, 1. PCA based Eigen feature extraction technique, 2. DCT based feature extraction technique, 3. Histogram Based Feature Extraction technique and 4. Simple intensity based feature Extraction were used. The proposed model has been tested on face images which differ in expression and illumination condition with a dataset obtained from face image databases of ORL.

China","2009 International Conference on Cyber-Enabled Distributed Computing and Knowledge Discovery","20091201","2009","","","170","175","With the rapid development of digital imaging technology, image annotation is an important and challenging task in image retrieval. At present, many machine learning methods have been applied to solve the problem of automatic image annotation (AIA). However, there exists enormous semantic expressive gap between the low-level image features and high-level semantic concepts. Due to the problem, the annotation performance of existing methods is not satisfactory, and needs to be further improved. This paper proposes an automatic annotation framework via a novel decision tree-based Bayesian (DTB) machine learning algorithm. It is a hybrid approach that attempts to utilize the advantages of both DT and Naive-Bayesian (NB). We firstly segment an image into different regions and extract low-level features of each region. From these features, high-level semantic concepts are obtained using a DTB learning algorithm. Finally, experiments conducted on the Corel dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DTB machine learning. The DTB can not only enhance the classification accuracy, but also associate low-level region features with high-level image concepts. This method presents the advantages of the Bayesian method and the DT. Moreover, this semantic interpretation capability is a natural simulation of human learning.","","POD:978-1-4244-5218-7","10.1109/CYBERC.2009.5342168","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5342168","automatic image annotation;decision tree-based Bayesian;machine learning;semantic-based image retrieval","Bayesian methods;Decision trees;Digital images;Feature extraction;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Niobium","belief networks;decision trees;feature extraction;image retrieval;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence)","Corel dataset demonstration;automatic image annotation;decision tree based Bayesian machine learning algorithm;digital imaging technology;high level image concept;image retrieval;image segmentation;low level feature extraction;naive Bayesian method","","1","","32","","","10-11 Oct. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

P300 Speller is a BCI paradigm that helps disabled subjects to spell words by means of their brain signal activities. This paper tries to demonstrate the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on classification accuracy. Performance has been evaluated on the data sets acquired using BCI2000's P300 Speller Paradigm provided by BCI competitions II (2003) & III (2004) organizers for three subjects. As a primary stage, a preprocessing was applied on the samples in order to extract the most significant features before introducing them to machine learning algorithms. The algorithms applied are Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA), linear support vector machine (SVM), Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), generalized Anderson's task linear classifier (GAT), linear discriminant analysis (LDA). BLDA and SVM yielded the highest accuracy for all 3 subjects. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on the data presented to the BLDA classifier for dimensionality reduction. The results obtained after this stage were slightly lower than those without reduction but they are still acceptable. This advantage could help in using P300 Speller BCI system beyond mere proof-of concept systems and allow their widespread application out of laboratories.","1110-6980;11106980","POD:978-1-4244-4214-0","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5233955","","Brain computer interfaces;Communication system control;Control systems;Data mining;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Principal component analysis;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;brain-computer interfaces;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pattern classification;principal component analysis;support vector machines","BLDA classifier;Bayesian linear discriminant analysis;Fisher linear discriminant analysis;P300 Speller Paradigm;P300 speller brain-computer interface systems;brain signal activity;classification accuracy;dimensionality reduction;feature extraction;generalized Anderson's task linear classifier;linear support vector machine;machine learning algorithms;machine learning methodology;principal component analysis","","3","","16","","","17-19 March 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most widely adopted clinical tool that measures the electrical activities of the heart from the body surface. However, heart rhythm irregularities cannot always be detected on a standard resting ECG machine, since they may not occur during an individual's recording session. Common Holter-based portable solutions that record ECG for up to 24 to 48 hours lack the capability to provide real-time feedback. In this research, we seek to establish a cell phone-based real-time monitoring technology for CVD, capable of performing continuous on-line ECG processing, generating a personalized cardiac health summary report in layman's language, automatically detecting and classifying abnormal CVD conditions, all in real time. Specifically, we developed an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN)-based machine learning technique, combining both an individual's cardiac characteristics and information from clinical ECG databases, to train the cell phone to learn to adapt to its user's physiological conditions to achieve better ECG feature extraction and more accurate CVD classification on cell phones.","1094-687X;1094687X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5333610","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5333610","","","cellular radio;electrocardiography;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;patient monitoring;real-time systems","Holter based portable solutions;adaptive machine learning;artificial neural network;cardiovascular disease;cell phone;real time electrocardiographic monitoring;time 24 hour to 48 hour","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cardiovascular Diseases;Cellular Phone;Electrocardiography;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Time Factors","6","","15","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A machine-learning algorithm has been developed to learn the critical knowledge about fuel efficiency on 11 facility-specific drive cycles representing different road types and traffic congestion levels, as well as a neural learning algorithm for the training of a neural network to predict the RT&TC level. An online University of Michigan-Dearborn intelligent power controller (UMD_IPC) applies this knowledge to real-time vehicle power control to achieve improved fuel efficiency. UMD_IPC has been fully implemented in a conventional (nonhybrid) vehicle model in the powertrain systems analysis toolkit (PSAT) environment. Simulations conducted on the standard drive cycles provided by the PSAT show that the performance of the UMD_IPC algorithm is very close to the offline controller that is generated using a dynamic programming optimization approach.

The main advantage of the use of EMO algorithms for fuzzy system design over single-objective optimizers is that multiple alternative fuzzy rule-based systems with different accuracy-interpretability tradeoffs are obtained by their single run. The decision maker can choose a single fuzzy rule-based system according to their preference. There still exist several important issues to be discussed in this research area such as the definition of interpretability, the formulation of interpretability measures, the visualization of tradeoff relations, and the interpretability of the explanation of fuzzy reasoning results. In this paper, we discuss the ability of EMO algorithms as multiobjective optimizers to search for Pareto optimal or near Pareto optimal fuzzy rule-based systems.

Since an increasing number of applications adopt random port numbers or employ payload encryption, there is a growing interest for new techniques that exploit statistical features of the packet flows, which are difficult to conceal. These features include the length of the packets, the interarrival times, and other parameters that capture temporal correlations in the flow. In this paper, we propose to collect a new class of features based on the process of connection requests from the different traffic sources. These features are then used to help in the classification of traffic flows coming from those sources. Experimental results with real traffic traces show that there are some notable cases in which these features result in an increased classification performance.","2156-7190;21567190","POD:978-1-4244-4718-3","10.1109/INTERNET.2009.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5277868","machine learning;traffic classification;traffic measurement","Algorithm design and analysis;Cryptography;IP networks;Inspection;Internet;Machine learning;Payloads;Quality of service;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic","IP networks;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication network management;transport protocols","IP traffic classification techniques;Internet application identification;TCP port number;UDP port number;connection request process;machine learning techniques;network management;network surveillance;packet flows;packet payloads;payload encryption;temporal correlations;traffic flows;traffic sources","","1","","16","","","23-29 Aug. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the AVI scheme, the region localization module is implemented by using a template-matching technique to locate the subject to be inspected based on the localization sub-mode. The defect detection module is realized by using the representative features obtained from the feature extraction module and executing the verification sub-model built in the model training module. A support vector machine (SVM) based online learning algorithm is proposed for training and updating the verification sub-model.

The basic idea is to apply the concept of Fisher kernels and visualization to reduce the data from a time-series format to two-dimensional plots that can be visually inspected and potentially segregate the 'collapse' class from the 'survival' one. From our experiments we observe that our method fits well for the Technology and Banking sectors, but is not able to provide a visually clear classification for the Pharmaceuticals sector.

This theory provides best mean squared finite sample error bounds for some popular statistical learning algorithms and also for several optimal improvements of other existing learning algorithms such as smoothing splines and kernel regularization. The bounds and improved algorithms are not based on asymptotics or Bayesian assumptions and are truly local for each query, not depending on cross validating estimates at other queries to optimize modeling parameters. Results are given for optimal local learning of approximately linear functions with side information (context) using real algebraic geometry. In particular, finite sample error bounds are given for ridge regression and for a local version of lasso regression. The new regression methods require only quadratic programming with linear or quadratic inequality constraints for implementation. Greedy additive expansions are then combined with local minimax learning via a change in metric. An optimal strategy is presented for fusing the local minimax estimators of a class of experts-providing optimal finite sample prediction error bounds from (random) forests. Local minimax learning is extended to kernel machines. Best local prediction error bounds for finite samples are given for Tikhonov regularization. The geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to derive improved estimators with finite sample mean squared error (MSE) bounds for class membership probability in two class pattern classification problems. A purely local, cross validation free algorithm is proposed which uses Fisher information with these bounds to determine best local kernel shape in vector machine learning. Finally, a locally quadratic solution to the finite Fourier moments problem is presented.

Under these effects, it is feasible to adjust the frame size to maximize the throughput. The majority of existing frame-size optimization solutions are based on the assumption that the optimal frame size only depends on the channel conditions. These approaches do not consider the contention effects, thus leading to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we tackle the frame-size optimization problem using a machine-learning-based adaptive approach. This approach takes both the channel conditions and the contention effect into consideration. In this approach, each source station performs the throughput measurement and collects the ldquoframe size-throughputrdquo patterns. The collected patterns contain the knowledge about the effects of channel conditions and contention processes. Based on these patterns, our approach uses neural networks to accurately model the throughput as a function with respect to the frame size. After the knowledge building, we obtain the gradient information to adjust the frame size. The main contribution of this paper is that we take both the channel conditions and the contention effect into consideration, without any assumptions of the channel models or the stations' behavior that are required by the previous analytical solutions. We perform comprehensive simulations to validate that the proposed approach can effectively optimize the frame size under various channel conditions and contention effects. We also implement the proposed approach and perform comprehensive experiments on a real testbed to evaluate the effectiveness and reaction speed of the proposed approach in practice.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2009.2025133","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5075557","Frame size;machine learning;neural networks;optimization methods;wireless local area networks (WLANs)","","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;wireless LAN;wireless channels","IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network;WLAN environment;channel condition;contention process;frame-size optimization;gradient information;machine learning-based adaptive approach;neural network;wireless medium;wireless station","","3","1","30","","20090616","Nov. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a specific object class. Our feature extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternating filtering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the first and third layers viewing them as separate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hierarchy are then fed as input to a discriminative classifier.

The repeatability is important because the same scene viewed from different positions should yield features which correspond to the same real-world 3D locations. The efficiency is important because this determines whether the detector combined with further processing can operate at frame rate. Three advances are described in this paper. First, we present a new heuristic for feature detection and, using machine learning, we derive a feature detector from this which can fully process live PAL video using less than 5 percent of the available processing time. By comparison, most other detectors cannot even operate at frame rate (Harris detector 115 percent, SIFT 195 percent). Second, we generalize the detector, allowing it to be optimized for repeatability, with little loss of efficiency. Third, we carry out a rigorous comparison of corner detectors based on the above repeatability criterion applied to 3D scenes. We show that, despite being principally constructed for speed, on these stringent tests, our heuristic detector significantly outperforms existing feature detectors. Finally, the comparison demonstrates that using machine learning produces significant improvements in repeatability, yielding a detector that is both very fast and of very high quality.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2008.275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4674368","Corner detection;feature detection;feature detection.","Computer vision;Detectors;Image edge detection;Image matching;Image recognition;Layout;Machine learning;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Streaming media;Testing","edge detection;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence)","3D location;PAL video;corner detection;edge technique;feature detection;machine learning approach;real-world application","","438","22","103","","20081117","Jan. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Morphological analysis is concerned with retrieving the structure, the syntactic and morphological properties or the meaning of a morphologically complex word. The morphology structure of agglutinative language is unique and capturing its complexity in a machine analyzable and generatable format is a challenging job. Generally rule based approaches are used for building morphological analyzer system. In rule based approaches what works in the forward direction may not work in the backward direction. This new and state of the art machine learning approach based on sequence labeling and training by kernel methods captures the non-linear relationships in the different aspect of morphological features of natural languages in a better and simpler way.

Appropriate examples based on data pertaining to the Victorian electricity market, Australia and the PJM electricity market, U.S.A. are used to demonstrate the functioning of the developed neural network (NN) method based on similar days approach to predict hourly electricity load and price, respectively. The other important problem faced by power system utilities are the variability and non-schedulable nature of wind farm power generation. These inherent characteristics of wind power have both technical and commercial implications for efficient planning and operation of power systems.

In this paper we focus on the model based analysis of the PN and compare the expected model performance with the observed one with real samples.We suggest a model of multi-unit (MU) activity as filtered inhomogeneous Poisson pulses of evoked activity contaminated by homogenous spontaneous activity and thermal noise (Filtered Poisson-Poisson-Gaussian model). By assigning the likelihood into the generalize log likelihood test (GLRT), we show that the best expected feature is energy detection. The model parameters were estimated based on the recorded peri-stimuli-time-histogram (PSTH) by chi-square goodness-of-fit minimization.

The proposed approach consists of three main steps. Firstly, a texture analysis is applied onto input abdominal CT images to extract pixel level features. Here, two main categories of features, namely wavelet coefficients and Haralick texture descriptors are investigated. Secondly, support vector machines (SVM) are implemented to classify the data into pixel-wised liver or non-liver. Finally, specially combined morphological operations are designed as a post processor to remove noise and to delineate the liver. Our unique contributions to liver segmentation are twofold: one is that it has been proved through experiments that wavelet features present better classification than Haralick texture descriptors when SVMs are used; the other is that the combination of morphological operations with a pixel-wised SVM classifier can delineate volumetric liver accurately. The algorithm can be used in an advanced computer-aided liver disease diagnosis and surgical planning systems. Examples of applying the algorithm on real CT data are presented with performance validation based on the automatically segmented results and that of manually segmented ones.","","POD:978-0-7695-3645-3","10.1109/CINC.2009.225","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5231027","machine learning;morphology;segmentation;texture analysis;wavelet","Abdomen;Computed tomography;Image analysis;Image segmentation;Liver;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Morphological operations;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","feature extraction;image segmentation;medical image processing;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","Haralick texture descriptors;abdominal CT images;automatic liver parenchyma segmentation algorithm;computer-aided liver disease diagnosis;machine learning;pixel level feature extraction;pixel-wised SVM classifier;support vector machines;surgical planning systems;wavelet coefficients","","5","","17","","","6-7 June 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We investigate a k-step look-ahead prediction which attempts to predict gait variable values based on acceleration information in the current gait cycle. The variable is the minimum toe clearance which has been demonstrated to be a sensitive falls risk predictor. Toe clearance data was collected under normal walking conditions and 9 features consisting of peak acceleration and their normalized occurrences times were extracted. A standard least squares estimator, a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and a support vector regressor (SVR) were trained using 60% of the data to estimate the minimum toe clearance and the remaining 40% was used to validate the model. It was found that when the training data contained data from all subjects (inter-subject) the best GRNN model provided a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.8 mm, the best SVR had RMSE of 2.7 mm while the standard least squares linear regression method obtained 3.3 mm. When the training and test data consisted of different subject examples (inter-subject) data, the linear SVR demonstrated superior generalization capability (RMSE=3.3 mm) compared to other competing models. Validation accuracies up to 5-step look-ahead predictions revealed robust performances for both GRNN and SVR models with no clear degradation in prediction accuracy.","1094-687X;1094687X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-3296-7","10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5334512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5334512","","Acceleration;Data mining;Least squares approximation;Least squares methods;Legged locomotion;Linear regression;Machine learning;Neural networks;Root mean square;Training data","gait analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);prediction theory;regression analysis;support vector machines","GRNN model;acceleration data;gait variables;generalized regression neural network;k-step look-ahead prediction;least squares estimator;machine learning;support vector regressor","","5","","8","","","3-6 Sept. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
