We have analyzed two key requirements, anonymous feedback and credible feedback, to gain insight on the submitted ""suggestions"" as for how to improve an organization, a course, or any decision involving evolutionary system. These two highly desirable requirements are kind of contradictory since it is perhaps a rather obvious point that unless we know the person how will we know the credibility of his/her feedback - simultaneously addressing both of these requirements is the key research contribution of this paper. The proposed system will help in ensuring the anonymity as well as credibility of the feedback and automatic identification of relevant summaries of suggestions with minimal human endeavor during training phase.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5909-9; Electronic:978-1-4799-5912-9; POD:978-1-4799-5913-6","10.1109/ICPCES.2014.7062828","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062828","Anonymous feedback;credible feedback;machine learning;online feedback management system;overall ranking;suggestions","Context;Data privacy;Education;Electronic mail;Filtering;Reliability;Servers","Internet;educational administrative data processing;evolutionary computation;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anonymous feedback identification;automated suggestion system;automatic summary extraction;credible feedback identification;data collection;evolutionary system;machine learning capabilities;online feedback management system;training phase","","0","","10","","","26-28 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Examples of such applications include validating the time-of-recording of an ENF-containing multimedia signal or estimating its recording location based on concurrent reference signals from power grids. In this paper, we examine a novel ENF-based application that infers the power grid in which the ENF-containing multimedia signal was recorded without relying on the availability of concurrent power references. We investigate features based on the statistical differences in ENF variations between different power grids to serve as signatures for the region-of-recording of the media signal. We use these features in a multiclass machine learning implementation that is able to identify the grid-of-recording of a signal with high accuracy.

The proposed algorithm consists of three stages: fast edge-guided interpolation to generate an initial HR estimation, GPU-aided de-convolution, and error feedback compensation.

Predictions of property and/or activity of interest have the potential to save time, money and minimize the use of expensive experimental designs, such as, for example, animal testing. Intelligent machine learning techniques are important tools for QSAR analysis, as a result, they are integrated into the drug production process. The effective learnable model can reduce the cost of drug design significantly. The quantile estimation via neural network structure technique introduced in this paper is used to predict activity of pyrimidines based on the structure-activity relationship of these compounds which assist for finding potential treatment agents for serious disease.

These techniques have been primarily investigated for ultra-wide band (UWB) systems, but little attention has been paid to WiFi systems, which are far more prevalent in practice. In this study, we address the NLOS identification and mitigation problems using multiple received signal strength (RSS) measurements from WiFi signals. Key to our approach is exploiting several statistical features of the RSS time series, which are shown to be particularly effective. We develop and compare two algorithms based on machine learning and a third based on hypothesis testing to separate LOS/NLOS measurements. Extensive experiments in various indoor environments show that our techniques can distinguish between LOS/NLOS conditions with an accuracy of around 95%. Furthermore, the presented techniques improve distance estimation accuracy by 60% as compared to state-of-the-art NLOS mitigation techniques. Finally, improvements in distance estimation accuracy of 50% are achieved even without environment-specific training data, demonstrating the practicality of our approach to real world implementations.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2372341","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963485","NLOS identification and mitigation;hypothesis testing;localization;machine learning","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Testing;Training;Training data;Wireless communication","RSSI;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);time series;ultra wideband communication;wireless LAN","LOS measurement;NLOS identification technique;RSS time series statistical features;UWB system;Wi-Fi system;indoor environment;machine learning;multiple RSS measurement;nonline-of-sight identification technique;received signal strength;ultra wideband system","","13","","47","","20141120","March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Using the sensor and clinical data pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of three years, a number of measures associated with the subjects' walking speed and general activity in the home were calculated. Different time spans of these measures were used to generate feature vectors to train and test two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machines and random forests. We were able to autonomously detect MCI in older adults with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks.

These data always include large-scale of independent information with both textual and visual contents. The large numbers of images has posed increasing challenges to computer systems to store and manage data effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we proposed a method of Geo-location-based image retrieval (GLBIR). The proposed method identifies a geo location in an image using visual attention-based mechanism and represents them using its color layout descriptors and curve let descriptors. These features are extracted from geo location of query image from Flickr. The likeness between the query geo coordinates and image is ranked according to a similarity measure computed from the feature vectors. Our proposed model does not full semantic understanding of image content, uses visual metrics for example proximity, color contrast, size and nearness to image's boundaries to locate viewer's attention.

The present work is to achieve the same as accurately as possible. Emotion detection can be done either through text, speech, facial expression or gesture. In the present work the emotions are detected using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. EEG records the electrical activity within the neurons of the brain. The main advantage of using EEG signals is that it detects real emotions arising straight from our mind and ignores external features like facial expressions or gesture. Hence EEG can act as real indicator of the emotion depicted by the subject. We have employed Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Machine Learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to classify EEG signals into seven different emotions. The accuracy achieved with both the algorithms is computed and compared. We are able to recognize seven emotions using the two algorithms, SVM and LDA with an average overall accuracy of 74.13% and 66.50% respectively. This accuracy was achieved after performing a 4-fold cross-validation.

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) is one such information systems where in memory computation faces a lot challenges to manipulate and visualize the data. Scalable distributed framework broadly exhibit two design characteristics: (i) they are using memory scalability in such a manner that the amount of memory required by each process decreases as the number of processes used to solve a given problem instance increases, and (ii) they exploit coarse grain parallelism in the sense that they structure their computations into a sequence of local computation followed by communication phases in which the local computations take a non-trivial amount of time and often involve a non-trivial subset of the process' memory. In this paper we will discuss about big data, data science, different models available in the parallel paradigms, the pros and cons and the probable way out to work with high dimensional data.","","DVD:978-1-4799-4447-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-4445-3; POD:978-1-4799-4444-6","10.1109/C3IT.2015.7060186","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060186","Big Data;Data Science;High Dimensional Data;Machine Learning;Parallel Computing;Scalable framework;Semi-stochastic","Big data;Computational modeling;Data models;Mathematical model;Memory management;Parallel processing;Stochastic processes","Big Data;data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing","Big Data parallelism;computational paradigms;data visualization;machine learning;scalable distributed framework","","0","","20","","","7-8 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a method to partially automate the extraction of contextual word lists from software-engineering literature.

Assigning orthogonal channel sets to the CRs eliminates the possibility of collision among them, and allows the CRs to focus on avoiding collisions with the primary user (PU). In particular, each CR uses a learning-based dynamic channel selection (DCS) algorithm to maximize the exploitation of the assigned channels. We propose a neural network that can accurately estimate the performance of the adopted learning-based DCS algorithm on a set of channels, using the duty cycle and the complexity of the PU's behavior on the channels. Our simulations on synthetic and real measurement data sets show that the proposed channel sets allocation algorithm, together with the neural network, significantly outperforms a method that selects channels with the lowest duty cycle.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2384507","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994290","Cognitive radio;dynamic spectrum access;machine learning;opportunistic channel selection","Complexity theory;Heuristic algorithms;Markov processes;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Resource management;Sensors","channel allocation;cognitive radio;multi-access systems;neural nets;radio spectrum management;telecommunication congestion control","channel set allocation algorithm;cognitive radios;duty cycle;fungible orthogonal channel sets;learning-based DCS algorithm;learning-based dynamic channel selection algorithm;multiuser exploitation;neural network;opportunistic spectrum access;primary user","","0","","24","","20141219","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One of the well-known weaknesses of these approximation algorithms is that they do not find the global optimum but instead find one of many local optima. It is also known that initialization of the parameters affects the results of the parameter approximation process. In this paper, we hypothesize that the order of data class is also a factor that affects the parameter approximation results.

However, in the real world, most factories' conditions are normally insufficient for implementing full scale smart manufacturing. In order to increase smartness for manufacturing systems under different situations, one may observe that computational reasoning and learning, including latest machine learning methodology and traditional rule based systems, are able to offer potential powerful theoretical foundations as well as technical tools for enabling such smarter systems. Unfortunately, few studies exist to propose a practical yet systematic procedure that implements computational reason and learning to implement smartness for typical manufacturing systems. This paper proposes a general computational reasoning and learning framework to describe the key functions in smart manufacturing under the ""three Fs in one"" system framework, namely a system of interconnected data, integrated automation, and intelligent information. Among three Fs, the intelligent information plays the most important role in working towards smartness by connecting the other two Fs. Furthermore, to achieve it, a learning enabled comprehensive multi-agent decision model is developed. In particular, we first design a computational learning based architecture for analyzing support information for manufacturing processes. Then we provide an optimization architecture that enables realtime learning for a manufacturing process. At last, we employ a rule based learning system to integrate these two architectures to facilitate self-evolution of the manufacturing system. The advantages of our procedure include adaptive responses to dynamic environment, efficient computations, and abilities to fulfill complex manufacturing processes, which are demonstrated by a specific modeling procedure.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6980-7; POD:978-1-4799-6981-4","10.1109/BESC.2014.7059529","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059529","comprehensive computational learning;machine learning;rule-based learning;three Is in one","Artificial intelligence;Automation;Cognition;Computational modeling;Manufacturing processes","knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);manufacturing systems;multi-agent systems;optimisation","academia;adaptive response;complex manufacturing process;comprehensive multiagent decision model;computational learning based architecture;computational reasoning;integrated automation;intelligent information;interconnected data;key function;machine learning methodology;manufacturing system;optimization architecture;realistic condition;rule based learning system;rule based system;smart manufacturing;smarter system;systematic procedure","","0","","27","","","Oct. 30 2014-Nov. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Methods: We performed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on eight adolescents before and after CES with mean age of about nine-years old who had Tourette's syndrome with moderate to severe tics symptom. Independent component analysis (ICA) with hierarchical partner matching method was used to examine the functional connectivity between regions within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit. Granger causality was used to investigate effective connectivity among these regions detected by ICA. We then performed pattern classification on independent components with significant group differences that served as endophenotype markers to distinguish the adolescents between TS and the normalized ones after CES. Results: Results showed that TS adolescents after CES treatment had stronger functional activity and connectivity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), caudate and posterior cingulate cortex while had weaker activity in supplementary motor area within the motor pathway compared with TS before CES. Conclusion: The results suggest that the functional activity and connectivity in motor pathway was suppressed while activities in the control portions within CSTC loop including ACC and caudate were increased in TS adolescents after CES compared with adolescents before CES. Significance: The normalization of the balance between motor and control portions of the CSTC circuit may result in the recovery of TS adolescents.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2385151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6994764","Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES);Tourette’s syndrome;Tourette's syndrome (TS);cranial electrotherapy stimulation;independent component analysis;independent component analysis (ICA);machine learning;resting-state fMRI;resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI)","Brain;Cranial;Educational institutions;Independent component analysis;Indexes;Magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical MRI;brain;image classification;independent component analysis;medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;patient treatment","Granger causality;Tourette's Syndrome;alpha stim device;anterior cingulate cortex;caudate;cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit;cranial electrotherapy stimulation;hierarchical partner matching method;independent component analysis;intrinsic neural circuit normalization;pattern classification;posterior cingulate cortex;resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging","Brain;Child;Electric Stimulation Therapy;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Neural Pathways;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Tourette Syndrome","1","","57","","20141222","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The fundamental idea behind transform compression is to exploit regularity within signals such that redundancy is minimized subject to a fidelity cost. Multimedia signals, in particular images and video, are well known to contain a diverse set of localized structures, leading to many different types of regularity and to nonstationary signal statistics. The proposed method designs sparse orthonormal transforms (SOTs) that automatically exploit regularity over different signal structures and provides an adaptation method that determines the best representation over localized regions. Unlike earlier work that is motivated by linear approximation constructs and model-based designs that are limited to specific types of signal regularity, our work uses general nonlinear approximation ideas and a data-driven setup to significantly broaden its reach. We show that our SOT designs provide a safe and principled extension of the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) by reducing to the KLT on Gaussian processes and by automatically exploiting non-Gaussian statistics to significantly improve over the KLT on more general processes. We provide an algebraic optimization framework that generates optimized designs for any desired transform structure (multiresolution, block, lapped, and so on) with significantly better n-term approximation performance. For each structure, we propose a new prototype codec and test over a database of images. Simulation results show consistent increase in compression and approximation performance compared with conventional methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2015.2414879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065257","Sparse orthonormal transforms;image compression;linear representation;machine learning;nonlinear approximation;sparse lapped transforms;sparse multi-resolution transforms;sparse orthonormal transforms;transform optimization","Algorithm design and analysis;Gaussian processes;Image coding;Linear approximation;Quantization (signal);Transforms","Gaussian processes;Karhunen-Loeve transforms;approximation theory;data compression;image representation;multimedia communication;optimisation;video codecs;video coding","Gaussian process;KLT;Karhunen-Loeve transform;SOT;algebraic optimization framework;compression-optimized transform generation;data-driven setup;image codec;multimedia signal;next-generation multimedia application;non-Gaussian statistics;nonlinear approximation;nonstationary signal statistic;sparse orthonormal transform","","6","","53","","20150323","Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, besides high-level faults or noises, timing errors induced by delay faults, process variations, aging, etc. are dominating the reliability of NN accelerator under nanoscale manufacturing process. In this paper, we leverage the error resiliency of neural network to mitigate timing errors in NN accelerators.

The present paper advocates a novel approach that leverages the intrinsic low-dimensionality of (possibly large-scale) data to design a support-vector-machine (SVM) classifier from feature vectors with misses `on the fly.' Towards this end, the max-margin cost function is regularized with the nuclear-norm to jointly impute the missing features and design the SVM hyperplane. Iterative batch and online algorithms are developed. Per iteration, a low-dimensional subspace is updated to enable imputation, and the SVM hyperplane is adjusted accordingly. Lightweight first-order iterations are also devised using stochastic alternating-minimization carried out via simple updates. Preliminary numerical tests corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-8295-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-8297-4; POD:978-1-4799-8298-1","10.1109/ACSSC.2014.7094615","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094615","D.2.

Computer gaming is, with no doubt, one of the fields where such techniques have been put to good use most pervasively. For example, in order to provide better opponents in human vs. machine games, machine learning techniques are being extensively utilized to model how players behave during gaming sessions. These same ideas, however, could be put to good use when realizing completely different systems and applications, as for example when analyzing how industrial machines behave while running complex tasks. We here show that techniques that have been well accepted and deployed through entertainment technologies can also be applied to industrial ones. In particular, we will show how it is possible to model the operation of an industrial machine as a game in order to assess whether the machine is following its regular behavior path.

The DPMM is an ideal signal classification tool for wideband CR's (W-CR's) due to its non-parametric structure. However, it can incur a high computational complexity since it usually requires a large number of Gibbs sampling iterations. To address this issue, we first propose a parameter selection policy that efficiently selects the cluster parameters at each Gibbs sampling iteration, leading to a faster convergence to the stationary distribution of the underlying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Next, we propose a sequential DPMM classifier based on a recursive formulation that allows real-time classification of newly detected signals.

Fuzzy logic with better generalization capability and rapport with reality is being used in classification problems immensely. In this paper a fuzzy rule based classification system is modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. Thus the optimization power of Genetic Algorithm has been applied to select a small number of significant fuzzy rules for a compact classification system applied to multivariate dataset classification. The hybrid algorithm is used here to predict cellular localization sites of proteins in yeast. Two different fitness measures were taken to evaluate the rules generated by the algorithm during evolution process.

REPLICA has two execution modes supported by the underlying on-chip memory, PRAM and NUMA which can be switched between at runtime. PRAM mode is considered the standard execution mode and targets mainly applications with very high thread level parallelism (TLP). In contrast, NUMA mode is for sequential legacy applications and applications with low amount of TLP, but for some cases very regular applications suits NUMA mode as well. However, there is a switching cost between the modes which is not neglect able. We combine machine-learning (symbolic regression) with shortest path problem to optimize software composition of parameterized stencil-like algorithms which have regular control flow and memory access pattern. Using the tool Eureqa Pro which is based on symbolic regression and training data we can create predictors for execution time for parameterized software components. We use the predictors and formulate an optimization problem based on shortest path to map component execution on the available modes (PRAM or NUMA). When composing for three randomly selected components from an evaluation set we get speedups up to 2.9 times including overhead and an average speedup of 1.4 also including overhead. Overhead costs which includes running predictors, solving shortest path and switching to the selected runtime modes are just a few percent.","2379-1888;23791888","Electronic:978-1-4799-4152-0; POD:978-1-4799-4151-3","10.1109/CANDAR.2014.72","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052204","NUMA;PRAM;machine-learning;multicore;optimized composition;software composition","Computer architecture;Instruction sets;Optimization;Phase change random access memory;Runtime;Switches","combinatorial mathematics;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems;optimisation;parallel processing;reconfigurable architectures","Eureqa Pro tool;REPLICA architecture;TLP;VLIW architecture;control flow;execution mode selection;machine learning;memory access pattern;on-chip memory;optimization problem;parallel random access machine;parameterized stencil-like algorithm;reconfigurable PRAM-NUMA multicore architecture;sequential legacy application;shortest path problem;software composition;symbolic regression;very high thread level parallelism;very long instruction word","","0","","20","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper presents a generic approach for performing collaborative filtering using data mining techniques to discover relationships among users and items. Using generic model techniques a single recommender system can produce recommendations about a variety of items. The methodologies reported for development of recommender systems are not efficient for generic application. The difference in the implementations of recommender depends upon how they analyze the big input data to recognize the similarity between users and items that indicates the relevant preferences for that user. Generic user based recommender works with data model encapsulating recommender input data in Apache Mahout which is extensible data mining library. The recommender system framework can use any similarity metric. We have chosen Pearson correlation because the computation would be fast. One of the parameters of user based recommender is User-Neighborhood. Fixed-size Neighborhood has the advantage that the recommendations are based on fewer similar users. Hadoop software library allows distributed processing of big data across multiple clusters of nodes. The paper describes an implementation using Apache Mahout and Hadoop and also explores feasible augmentation that can enhance efficiency of recommendation.

In real-world applications, apart from data in the target domain, related data in a different domain can also be included to expand the availability of our prior knowledge about the target future data. Transfer learning addresses such cross-domain learning problems by extracting useful information from data in a related domain and transferring them for being used in target tasks.

Simulation requires three steps: mathematical modelling, numerical solution, and tuning of the model's parameters. We address Tuning because, at the state-of-the-art, the development of life-critical simulations requires months to appropriately tune the model. Our methodology can be split in Screening (identification of the relevant parameters to simulate a system) and Optimization (search of optimal values for those parameters). All techniques are fully general, because they leverage ideas from Machine-Learning and Optimization Theory to achieve their goals without directly analysing the simulator's mathematical model. Concerning screening, we show how Machine-Learning algorithms, based on Neural Networks and Logistic Regression, can be used for ranking the parameters according to their relevance. Concerning optimization, we describe two algorithms: an adaptive hill-climbing procedure and a novel strategy, specific for model tuning, called sequential masking. Eventually, we show the performances achieved and the impact on the time and effort required for tuning a helicopter flight-simulator, proving that the proposed techniques can significantly speed-up the process.","","Electronic:978-989-758-060-4; POD:978-1-4799-7921-9","10.5220/0005022600240035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7094996","Adaptive Hill-Climbing;Machine-Learning;Model Tuning;Optimization;Screening;Sequential Masking","Computational modeling;Databases;Logistics;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Optimization;Tuning","","","","0","","19","","","28-30 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Second, we define the diversity-discrimination tradeoff, which, by analogy with the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of fading vector channels, characterizes relationships between the number of discernible subspaces and the misclassification probability as the feature noise power approaches zero.

This “Smart Water” project considers the study of a region of Kenya where there is significant demand for groundwater, especially among the poor. Some of the engineering aims of this project are to determine if data acquired from accelerometers mounted in hand-pumps can be used to perform three tasks: (i) estimate the depth of the groundwater at the pump, (ii) predict pump failure, and (iii) classify the user of the pump (e.g., as being a man, woman, or child). This paper describes an initial investigation, based on one week of data collection, that demonstrates there is useful information in the accelerometer data collected from handpumps, which can be discovered using machine learning techniques. We show that features derived from the accelerometry data exhibit stable, similar behaviour suggesting that users and pump locations may be characterised. We demonstrate that a machine learning system can classify the data according to person and pump and accurately differentiate between different users. We conclude that our preliminary study suggests that information may exist in accelerometry from handpumps that could allow us to answer the three main questions of the “Smart Water” project, described above, motivating a largescale' data-collection activity.","","Electronic:978-1-84919-915-5","10.1049/cp.2014.0767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7083579","Condition Monitoring;Machine Learning;Water","","accelerometers;data acquisition;data analysis;groundwater;learning (artificial intelligence);pumps;water supply","accelerometers;data acquisition;data analysis;groundwater depth estimation;machine learning system;smart handpumps;water supply","","0","","","","","17-18 Sept. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Most of the existing DFP localization systems are based on the measurement of received signal strength (RSS) only. However, the localization accuracy is easily affected by the spatial and temporal variance of RSS due to multipath fading and noise, even in a static environment. In this paper, we propose a novel localization system for DFP localization using an array sensor, which uses an antenna array at a receiver and is mainly based on the signal eigenvector. We use a fingerprinting technique with multiclass support vector machines (SVMs) based on a combination of array signal features with spatial and temporal averaging. We evaluate the localization performance of our proposed system in different propagation environments, i.e., line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS). In addition, we analyze two types of receive antenna placement, i.e., centralized and distributed antennas. The experimental results show that the localization accuracy can be improved by the proposed system, particularly in the centralized antenna case. Moreover, they show that the proposed system can improve localization accuracy compared with the conventional RSS-only-based system.","0018-9545;00189545","","10.1109/TVT.2015.2397436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7029093","Antenna array;Device-free localization;antenna array;device-free localization;machine learning;support vector machine;support vector machine (SVM)","Accuracy;Antenna arrays;Antenna measurements;Arrays;Noise;Receiving antennas","Global Positioning System;antenna arrays;array signal processing;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;receiving antennas;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","DFP localization technique;Global Positioning System;LOS propagation environment;NLOS propagation environment;RSS;SVM;array signal processing;centralized antenna array;device-free passive localization technique;distributed antenna array;fingerprinting technique;line-of-sight propagation environment;location-based service;multiclass support vector machine;multipath fading;nonline-of-sight propagation environment;receive antenna placement;received signal strength;receiver;sensor array;signal eigenvector;spatial averaging;temporal averaging","","3","","25","","20150202","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In coarse-grained analysis, the adaptive exponential smoothing (AES) technique is used to smooth the psychophysiological data and to remove strong artifacts without requiring templates. The MWL level is classified every 30 s by using bounded support vector machine (BSVM) and tenfold cross-validation techniques. Locality preservation projection (LPP) technique is utilized to derive salient psychophysiological features by means of feature reduction. By combining the AES-LPP and BSVM methods, the accuracy of the coarse-grained MWL classification was significantly improved by 11-13%. On the other hand, to perform MWL classification with higher temporal resolution and cross-subject and cross-trial generalizability, finer-grained data analysis is also conducted to recognize MWL levels every 5 s based on a combination of adaptive BSVM (ABSVM) and AES techniques.

In linguistics valence of a verb is the number of satellite noun phrases with which a verb combines. We have used the WorldNet to get the senses of each word according to its parts of speech and SentiWordNet to get the prior valence (i.e. polarity) of each word.

"Detecting Adverse Drug Events Using Concept Hierarchies of Clinical Codes","J. Zhao; A. Henriksson; H. Boström","Dept. of Comput. & Syst. Sci. (DSV), Stockholm Univ., Stockholm, Sweden","2014 IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics","20150305","2014","","","285","293","Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a potentially valuable source of information for pharmacovigilance. However, adverse drug events (ADEs), which can be encoded in EHRs with specific diagnosis codes, are heavily under-reported. To provide more accurate estimates for drug safety surveillance, machine learning systems that are able to detect ADEs could be used to identify and suggest missing ADE-specific diagnosis codes. A fundamental consideration when building such systems is how to represent the EHR data to allow for accurate predictive modeling. In this study, two types of clinical code are used to represent drugs and diagnoses: the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Health Problems (ICD). More specifically, it is investigated whether their hierarchical structure can be exploited to improve predictive performance. The use of random forests with feature sets that include only the original, low-level, codes is compared to using random forests with feature sets that contain all levels in the hierarchies. An empirical investigation using thirty datasets with different ADE targets is presented, demonstrating that the predictive performance, in terms of accuracy and area under ROC curve, can be significantly improved by exploiting codes on all levels in the hierarchies, compared to using only the low-level encoding. A further analysis is presented in which two strategies are employed for adding features level-wise according to the concept hierarchies: top-down, starting with the highest abstraction levels, and bottom-up, starting with the most specific encoding. The main finding from this subsequent analysis is that predictive performance can be kept at a high level even without employing the more specific levels in the concept hierarchies.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5701-9; POD:978-1-4799-5702-6; USB:978-1-4799-5700-2","10.1109/ICHI.2014.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052501","ATC;Adverse drug event;Electronic health records;ICD;drug safety;machine learning;random forest","Accuracy;Diseases;Drugs;Predictive models;Safety;Surveillance;Vegetation","drugs;electronic health records;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;surveillance","ADE;Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System ATC;EHR;ICD;International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems;adverse drug event detection;clinical code;concept hierarchy;drug safety surveillance;electronic health record;machine learning system","","8","","26","","","15-17 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve this goal in automatic manner, a resource scaling mechanism is needed that maintains application performance according to Service Level Agreements (SLA) and reduces resource costs at the same time. In this paper, we present a cross-correlation prediction approach based on machine learning that predicts resource demands of multiple resources of virtual machines running in a cloud infrastructure. Based on these predictions, a proactive resource allocation scheme is applied that assigns only the required resources to virtual machines to keep their cost to a minimum. Experimental results with the web serving multi-tier application benchmark of CloudSuite show the effectiveness of our approach compared to a non-cross-correlation prediction technique in achieving better prediction accuracy and better application performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5076-8; POD:978-1-4799-5077-5","10.1109/CICSyN.2014.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7059155","cloud computing;machine learning;resource prediction;virtual machine","Accuracy;Learning (artificial intelligence);Measurement;Resource management;Support vector machines;Time series analysis;Virtual machining","cloud computing;contracts;cost reduction;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;virtual machines","CloudSuite;SLA;Web;cloud computing;cloud consumers;cloud infrastructure;cross-correlation prediction;machine learning;multitier application benchmark;pay-as-you-go fashion;proactive resource allocation scheme;resource cost reduction;resource demand;resource scaling mechanism;service level agreements;virtual machine resource allocation","","0","","16","","","27-29 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Automatic extraction of emotions from the text is a hot research issue because it minimizes the communication gap and misunderstanding between users. To become emotionally more intelligent, our previous text to emotion analyzing system should communicate with experts for suggestions of possible emotional state if it fails to analyze the text. In this research, we augment our previous system by introducing active learning approach which allows to query experts for emotional label of the given text. It makes our training dataset enriched. To build a classification model by analyzing the training dataset, we employ Naive Bayes classification technique. Our classifier updates the emotional database automatically. We also develop a prototype of our system named TEA: Text-to-Emotion-Analyzer.

This is a particular concern on monotonous roads, where a drivers attention can decrease rapidly. Although effective countermeasures dont currently exist, the development of in-vehicle sensors opens avenues for monitoring driving behavior in real time. The aim of this study is to predict driver alertness levels using surrogate measures collected from in-vehicle sensors. Electroencephalographic activity is used as a reference to evaluate alertness. Based on a sample of 25 drivers, the authors collected data in a driving simulator instrumented with an eye-tracking system, a heart-rate monitor, and an electrodermal activity device. They tested various classification models, from linear regressions to Bayesians and data mining techniques. Results indicate that neural networks were the most efficient model for detecting lapses in alertness. Findings also show that reduced alertness can be predicted up to five minutes in advance with 90 percent accuracy using surrogate measures such as time to line crossing, blink frequency, and skin conductance level.

The clustering of each matrix is done with Weka K-means algorithm: from each cluster, a new possible relation. This work present newOntExt: a new approach with new features to turn the ontology extension task feasible to NELL. This approach has also an alternative task of naming new relations found by another NELL component: Prophet. The relations are classified as valid or invalid by humans; the precision is calculated for each experiment and the results are compared to those relative to OntExt.

Exploiting the manifold regularization (MR), Belkinet al. proposed a new semisupervised classification algorithm: Laplacian support vector machines (LapSVMs), and have shown the state-of-the-art performance in SSL field. To further improve the LapSVMs, we proposed a fast Laplacian SVM (FLapSVM) solver for classification. Compared with the standard LapSVM, our method has several improved advantages as follows: 1) FLapSVM does not need to deal with the extra matrix and burden the computations related to the variable switching, which make it more suitable for large scale problems; 2) FLapSVM's dual problem has the same elegant formulation as that of standard SVMs. This means that the kernel trick can be applied directly into the optimization model; and 3) FLapSVM can be effectively solved by successive overrelaxation technology, which converges linearly to a solution and can process very large data sets that need not reside in memory. In practice, combining the strategies of random scheduling of subproblem and two stopping conditions, the computing speed of FLapSVM is rigidly quicker to that of LapSVM and it is a valid alternative to PLapSVM.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2320738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816040","Classification;machine learning;semisupervised learning (SSL);support vector machines (SVMs);support vector machines (SVMs).","Complexity theory;Kernel;Laplace equations;Manifolds;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training","Laplace equations;optimisation;pattern classification;support vector machines","FLapSVM;Laplacian support vector machine;MR;SSL problem;fast Laplacian SVM;kernel trick;manifold regularization;optimization model;random scheduling;semisupervised classification algorithm;semisupervised learning problem;successive overrelaxation;successive overrelaxation technology","","6","","33","","20140516","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In recent years, significant and serious efforts have been made towards the development of the CAD system in diagnostic radiology. Machine learning (ML) plays a vital role in CAD because objects such as organs may not be signified precisely by a simple equation and therefore pattern recognition essentially involves learning from examples. In order to reduce the dimensions of the dataset and to increase the classification accuracy rate the feature selection has to be done. Feature Selection (FS) is an important issue in building classification systems. Evolutionary algorithms are an important emergent computing methodology. Genetic Algorithm (GA) being a heuristic search algorithm is generally used to detect important features for large dimensional datasets. This paper surveys the existing literature about the GA for the feature selection. This study also comprises a snapshot of GA from the author's perspective, including variations in the algorithm, modifications and refinements introduced to prevent the local convergence and hybridization of GA with other heuristic algorithms.

Obviously, this effort requires a deep understanding of the intrinsic properties of interaction. Up to now, many researchers have focused on inferring human intents in terms of intermediate or terminal goals in physical tasks. On the other hand, working side by side with people, an autonomous robot additionally needs to come up with in-depth information about underlying haptic interaction patterns that are typically encountered during human-human cooperation. However, to our knowledge, no study has yet focused on characterizing such detailed information. In this sense, this work is pioneering as an effort to gain deeper understanding of interaction patterns involving two or more humans in a physical task. We present a labeled human-human-interaction dataset, which captures the interaction of two humans, who collaboratively transport an object in an haptics-enabled virtual environment. In the light of information gained by studying this dataset, we propose that the actions of cooperating partners can be examined under three interaction types: In any cooperative task, the interacting humans either 1) work in harmony, 2) cope with conflicts, or 3) remain passive during interaction. In line with this conception, we present a taxonomy of human interaction patterns; then propose five different feature sets, comprising force-, velocity-and power-related information, for the classification of these patterns. Our evaluation shows that using a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifier, we can accomplish a correct classification rate of 86 percent for the identification of interaction patterns, an accuracy obtained by fusing a selected set of most informative features by Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) feature selection method.","1939-1412;19391412","","10.1109/TOH.2014.2384049","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6991578","Behavior recognition;classifier design and evaluation;feature evaluation and selection;haptic collaboration;haptic interfaces;haptics-enabled virtual environments;interaction patterns;machine learning;pattern recognition;physical human-X interaction;realistic haptic human-robot interaction;support vector machine classification","Force;Haptic interfaces;Hip;Joints;Pattern recognition;Robots;Virtual environments","haptic interfaces;human-robot interaction;support vector machines","SVM classifier;autonomous robot;dyadic joint object manipulation;haptic interaction pattern recognition;human interaction patterns;human-human cooperation;human-human-interaction dataset;interaction patterns;intrinsic properties;mRMR feature selection method;minimum redundancy maximum relevance;physical tasks;robot development;support vector machine","0","0","","29","","20141218","Jan.-March 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we discuss how a cognitive engine (CE) can be potentially standardized, and we offer our latest innovations on metacognitive engine (meta-CE) design. The intelligent techniques of a CR are implemented in an agent commonly referred to as a CE. A CE manages the CR's operation. Typically, a CE is based on a primary learning and optimization algorithm that is utilized within the CE. Each of these algorithms has its own strengths and deficiencies depending on the operating scenario that makes some of them more appropriate for specific operating conditions. A meta-CE is an engine that learns which CE is more appropriate to provide the adaptation needed for the operating conditions. To make a meta-CE possible, first, we need a method for characterizing the CE algorithm's performance. Second, we should classify the operating conditions based on the CE algorithm's characteristics in order to determine the most appropriate operating condition.

But, most important than just keep evolving, in this new paradigm acquired knowledge can, in a dynamic way, be used to expand the scope and improve the performance of the learning task as a whole. The first Never-Ending Learning system reported in the literature, which is called NELL (Never-Ending Language Learner), is applied to the task of autonomously building a knowledge base as a result of reading the web. Results reported so far reveal that very good results have been achieved when NELL is reading the web in English. When trying, however, to perform the same Machine Reading task (the task of reading the web) applied to web pages written in Portuguese, the previous reported approaches could not keep up with the good performance achieved in English. In this paper we describe an approach, different from previously proposed in the literature, and we present empirical results that corroborate the hypothesis that working on the preprocessing task of a sufficiently big corpus can be key to allow us to use the very same architecture proposed in NELL, but applied to the idea of reading the web in Portuguese (reading, and extracting knowledge from web pages written in Portuguese).","2164-7143;21647143","Electronic:978-1-4799-7938-7; POD:978-1-4799-7939-4","10.1109/ISDA.2014.7066260","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7066260","Machine Learning;Never-Ending Learning;Read The Web","Blogs;ISO;Irrigation;Pipelines","Internet;Web sites;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","English;NELL;Portuguese;Web pages;World Wide Web;function approximation method;machine reading task;never-ending language learner principles;never-ending learning system","","0","","34","","","28-30 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our numerical study comparing UCB-max with other competitors (UCB-tuned, UCB-V, MOSS, KL-UCB and Thompson sampling) shows that UCB-max is remarkably efficient and stable.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4421-7; Electronic:978-1-4799-4419-4; POD:978-1-4799-4418-7","10.1109/ITAIC.2014.7065060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7065060","bandit problem;machine learning;online learning;probability matching;upper confidence bound","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Indexes;Manganese;Random variables;Stochastic processes","probability;stochastic processes","KL-UCB;MOSS;Thompson sampling;UCB-V;UCB-max;UCB-tuned method;arm UCB value;arm probability;maximal expectation;optimism principles;p-value;probability matching;stochastic multiarmed bandit problem;unified approach;upper confidence bound;upper confidence bound formula","","0","","16","","","20-21 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A syllable-based Turkish speech recognition system by using time delay neural networks (TDNNs)","B. Can; H. Artuner","Department of Computer Engineering, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey","2013 International Conference on Soft Computing and Pattern Recognition (SoCPaR)","20150305","2013","","","219","224","In this paper, we present a model for Turkish speech recognition. The model is syllable-based, where the recognition is performed through syllables as speech recognition units. The main goal of the model is to recognize as much as possible of a given continuous speech by identifying only a small set of syllables in the language. For that purpose, only the syllable types with a higher frequency are selected for the recognition. The use of longer recognition units in speech recognition systems increases the success of the recognition since it is easier to detect the endpoints of syllables when compared to phonemes. On the other side, word-based recognition requires a very large dataset that includes all the words and word forms in the language, which is also another challenge. Hereby, we take the advantage of Turkish being an ortographically transparent and syllabified language. Our model employs time delay neural networks (TDNNs) for learning syllables. We achieve an accuracy of %65.6 on our large vocabulary continuous speech corpus. In addition, we define an algorithm for the automatic detection of syllable boundaries which gives an accuracy of %44. The automatic syllable boundary detection module is used for the recognition of isolated syllables rather than a continuous speech.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3400-3; POD:978-1-4799-3401-0","10.1109/SOCPAR.2013.7054130","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7054130","artificial intelligence;artificial neural networks;machine learning;speech recognition;syllable-based speech recognition;time-delay neural networks","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Speech;Speech recognition;Training;Vectors","neural nets;speech recognition","TDNN;automatic syllable boundary detection module;ortographically transparent language;speech recognition units;syllabified language;syllable-based Turkish speech recognition system;time delay neural networks","","0","","20","","","15-18 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to this there are chances of errors, unwanted biases and also takes longer time in accurate diagnosis of disease. In case of heart disease, its diagnosis is most difficult task. It depends on the careful analysis of different clinical and pathological data of the patient by medical experts, which is complicated process. Due to advancement in machine learning, computer and information technology, the researchers and medical practitioners in large extent are interested in the development of automated system for the prediction of heart disease. In this paper we present a prediction system for heart disease using Learning vector Quantization neural network algorithm. The neural network in this system accepts 13 clinical features as input and predicts that there is a presence or absence of heart disease in the patient, along with different performance measures.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3062-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-3064-7; POD:978-1-4799-3065-4","10.1109/CSIBIG.2014.7056973","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7056973","heart disease;learning vector quantization algorithm;machine learning","Abstracts;Accuracy;Computers;Diseases;Equations;Heart;Neurons","diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;neural nets;patient diagnosis;vector quantisation","clinical features;disease diagnosis;heart disease prediction;learning vector quantization neural network algorithm;prediction system","","1","","16","","","8-9 March 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is desirable to modify the routing and security schemes adaptively in order to respond effectively to the rapidly changing Network State. Adding more complexities to the routing and security schemes increases the end-to-end delay which is not acceptable in Service Oriented WSNs which are mostly in real time. We propose an algorithm Secure Adaptive Load-Balancing Routing (SALR) protocol, in which the routing decision is taken at every hop considering the unforeseen changes in the network. Multipath selection based on Node Strength is done at every hop to decide the most secure and least congested route. The system predicts the best route rather than running the congestion detection and security schemes repeatedly. Simulation results show that security and latency performance is better than reported protocols.","","DVD:978-1-4799-1821-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-1823-2; POD:978-1-4799-1824-9","10.1109/SPICES.2015.7091379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091379","Wireless Sensor Networks;hop-by-hop routing;load-balancing;machine learning;multipath;network security;secure adaptive routing","Delays;Mathematical model;Routing;Routing protocols;Security;Wireless sensor networks","delays;multipath channels;routing protocols;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication security;wireless sensor networks","SALR;SALR protocol;congestion control;end-to-end delay;multipath selection;network state;node strength;routing decision;routing schemes;secure adaptive load balancing routing;secure data transfer;security schemes;service oriented WSN;service oriented wireless sensor networks","","0","","10","","","19-21 Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the anticipated wide scale proliferation is limited (mainly) because of two important shortcomings: (1) high false alarm rate that results in moving legitimate messages into Spam folders, and (2) inability to self-learn a user's profile, as a result, they are unable to identify useful Spam (we call it Good Spam) that might be of great interest to a user's personal or business aspirations. In this paper, we propose USpam, a system that uses ontologies to model features that are extracted rom a user's profile. The features are given to machine learning classifiers J48 and Naive Bayes -- that learn a user centric model of Good Spam or Bad Spam. As a result, the system puts a message into a user's inbox if its contents are relevant to his interests. The USpam is evaluated on NRON Spam datasets, and the results of experiments reveal that false alarms are reduced by 10% to 30% compared with existing prior art without compromising the detection accuracy.","1530-1605;15301605","Electronic:978-1-4799-7367-5; POD:978-1-4799-7368-2","10.1109/HICSS.2015.440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7070255","Adaptable;Machine Learning;Ontology;Spam;User Centered Design","Feature extraction;Malware;Ontologies;Probabilistic logic;Semantics;Unsolicited electronic mail","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);unsolicited e-mail","J48;USpam;content-based spam detection frameworks;machine learning classifiers;naive Bayes;user centric ontology;wide scale proliferation","","1","","25","","","5-8 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

E learning contains various types of media including images, video, audio, streaming videos, animation, web based learning, video based learning, audio based learning, E books etc. Distance learning can be done without school or collages, anyone can learn from their home or office. ELearning industry is economically remarkable and it was work out in 2000 to be above 50$ billion corresponding to traditionalist estimates. Lecture Audio, video data on internet is growing rapidly. Hence there is immediate need for method by which we can retrieve audio, videos on internet. In this paper we have presented a technology for video search in lecture video archive. Initially, we can introduce segmentation of videos and key frame detection for offering rules for navigation of video contents. By applying ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) on lecture audio and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on video content we can extract metadata. OCR can be used in Data entry for business document, Automatic Number plate Recognition, Extracting business card information into a contact list and so on. ICR (Intelligent character recognition) focuses on handwritten documents as well as cursive character one at a time usually it involves in Machine Learning. Speech recognition system can classify into continuous or discrete system which can be speaker independent, speaker dependent or adaptive. Discrete system focuses on a separate acoustic model for each single word, sentence, phrase etc. are said to be isolated word speech recognition (ISR). CSR (Continuous Speech Recognition) System focuses on user who speaks sentences continually.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6272-3; POD:978-1-4799-6054-5","10.1109/PERVASIVE.2015.7087169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7087169","Machine Learning;acoustic model;metadata;segmentation;streaming videos","Indexing;Optical character recognition software;Semantics;Speech;Speech recognition;Streaming media;Video signal processing","feature extraction;handwritten character recognition;image segmentation;indexing;optical character recognition;signal classification;speech recognition;video retrieval;video signal processing","ASR;CSR;ICR;OCR;acoustic model;automated video indexing;automatic speech recognition;classification;continuous speech recognition;cursive character;handwritten documents;intelligent character recognition;key frame detection;lecture audio;lecture video archives;machine learning;metadata extraction;optical character recognition;speech recognition system;video content;video search;video segmentation","","0","","16","","","8-10 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such systems, transmitters may rapidly change the selected (channel, rate) pair to opportunistically learn and track the pair offering the highest throughput. We formulate the problem of sequential channel and rate selection as an online optimization problem and show its equivalence to a structured multiarmed-bandit problem. The structure stems from inherent properties of the achieved throughput as a function of the selected channel and rate. We derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any channel and rate adaptation algorithm and propose algorithms that achieve (or approach) these limits. In turn, the proposed algorithms optimally exploit the inherent structure of the throughput. We illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms using both test-bed and simulation experiments, in both stationary and nonstationary radio environments. In stationary environments, the packet successful transmission probabilities at the various channel and rate pairs do not evolve over time, whereas in nonstationary environments, they may evolve. In practical scenarios, the proposed algorithms are able to track the best channel and rate quite accurately without the need for any explicit measurement of and feedback on the quality of the various channels.","0733-8716;07338716","","10.1109/JSAC.2014.2361084","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6914537","Cognitive radio;Machine learning;Wireless networks.;cognitive radio;wireless networks","Adaptation models;Algorithm design and analysis;Cognitive radio;Encoding;Optimization;Radio transmitters;Throughput","cognitive radio;optimisation;probability","cognitive radio systems;dynamic channel;online optimization problem;packet successful transmission probabilities;rate adaptation algorithm;rate selection;sequential channel;structured multiarmed-bandit problem","","6","","29","","20141001","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
