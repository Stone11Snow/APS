As one of the most efficient 3-D imaging approaches, the range point migration(RPM) method has been developed, which specifies target boundary extraction using measured ranges. The RPM method stills suffers from insufficient imaging area along cross-range direction, and this incurs the difficulty for target recognition using the reconstructed 3-D image, which is an essential problem in radar imaging. To tackle with this problem, an ellipsoidal aggregation based image extrapolation method, incorporating full polarimetric datasets and RPM imaging, have been already proposed. While this method retains an accurate extrapolation for smooth surface target, it suffers from inaccuracy for target shape with edge. Thus, this paper introduces an edge preserved algorithm based on eigenvector decomposition for quasi Hessian matrix obtained by RPM image. The results from finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) based simulations demonstrate that our method effectively expands a target image without sacrificing an accuracy around edge area.","","Electronic:978-4-88552-313-7; POD:978-1-4673-7960-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821367","Full polarimetric data;Image extrapolation;Machine learning;Range points migration (RPM);UWB sensor","Extrapolation;Image edge detection;Image resolution;Imaging;Radar imaging;Robot sensing systems;Ultra wideband radar","Hessian matrices;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;extrapolation;finite difference time-domain analysis;image reconstruction;matrix decomposition;object recognition;radar imaging;radar polarimetry;radar receivers;ultra wideband radar","3-dimentional sensor;3D image reconstruction;3D imaging approach;FDTD based simulation;UWB radar;edge preserved extrapolation method;eigenvector decomposition;ellipsoidal aggregation based image extrapolation method;finite-difference time-domain based simulation;polarimetric RPM imaging;quasiHessian matrix;range point migration method;target boundary extraction;target recognition;ultra wideband radar system","","","","","","","24-28 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Adaptable SLA-Aware Consistency Tuning for Quorum-replicated Datastores","S. Sidhanta; W. Golab; S. Mukhopadhyay; S. Basu","INESC-ID / IST, University of Lisbon, Portugal. (email: ssidha1@lsu.edu)","IEEE Transactions on Big Data","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Users of distributed datastores that employ quorum-based replication are burdened with the choice of a suitable client-centric consistency setting for each storage operation. The above matching choice is difficult to reason about as it requires deliberating about the tradeoff between the latency and staleness, i.e., how stale (old) the result is. The latency and staleness for a given operation depend on the client-centric consistency setting applied, as well as dynamic parameters such as the current workload and network condition. We present OptCon, a machine learning-based predictive framework, that can automate the choice of client-centric consistency setting under user-specified latency and staleness thresholds given in the service level agreement (SLA). Under a given SLA, OptCon predicts a client-centric consistency setting that is matching, i.e., it is weak enough to satisfy the latency threshold, while being strong enough to satisfy the staleness threshold. While manually tuned consistency settings remain fixed unless explicitly reconfigured, OptCon tunes consistency settings on a per-operation basis with respect to changing workload and network state. Using decision tree learning, OptCon yields 0.14 cross validation error in predicting matching consistency settings under latency and staleness thresholds given in the SLA. We demonstrate experimentally that OptCon is at least as effective as any manually chosen consistency settings in adapting to the SLA thresholds for different use cases. We also demonstrate that OptCon adapts to variations in workload, whereas a given manually chosen fixed consistency setting satisfies the SLA only for a characteristic workload.","","","10.1109/TBDATA.2017.2656121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828027","distributed databases;distributed file systems;distributed systems;machine learning;middleware;performance evaluation;reliability, availability;serviceability;storage management;storage management high availability","Big data;Electronic mail;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Runtime;Throughput;Tuning","","","","","","","","20170120","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Sentiment analysis for text is a large field of research within machine learning, as it allows the sentiment of large numbers of text instances to be determined and used to answer various questions, such as election prediction. Typically, a sentiment classifier is trained using data from the same domain it is intended to be applied to; however, there may not be sufficient training data within the given domain. Additionally, using data from multiple sources, including other related domains, may help create a more generalized sentiment classifier that can be applied to multiple domains. To this aim, we conduct an empirical study using sentiment data from two sources, online reviews and tweets. We first test the performance of sentiment analysis models built using a single data source for both in-domain and cross-domain classification. Then, we evaluate classifiers trained using instances randomly sampled from both sources. Additionally, we evaluate sampling different quantities of instances from both data sources to determine how many instances should be included in a training data set. We apply statistical tests to verify the significance of our results and find that using a combination of instances from reviews and tweets is similar to, or better than any model trained from a single domain. Also, we found no significant difference in performance for classifiers 100,000 or more combined training instances. These results are important as they indicate a more robust classifier can be trained by using a smaller number of in-domain instances augmented with instances from a related domain, rather than using purely in-domain instances. Thus, we recommend using a training data set composed of both tweets and reviews, when training a sentiment classifier for use in predicting both tweet and- review sentiment.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4607-2; POD:978-1-5090-4608-9","10.1109/CIC.2016.046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809717","Sentiment analysis;cross-domain;machine learning;reviews;tweet","Data models;Labeling;Sentiment analysis;Support vector machines;Training;Training data;Voting","data integration;pattern classification;sentiment analysis;statistical testing","cross-domain classification;data sources integration;in-domain classification;sentiment analysis models;sentiment classifier;statistical tests;tweets","","","","","","","1-3 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hyperspectral imagers, microphones, high-resolution cameras, and 3D scanning devices can easily generate gigabytes of data per day, making it impractical for many wireless sensor platforms to stream all collected data to the cloud for analysis. Furthermore, in some sensor deployments, privacy concerns may restrict the resolution or content of data leaving the devices and being routinely stored in the cloud. To address this situation, sensor platforms must reduce or transform the data in situ, sending only the analyzed results to a central server. In designing an open sensor platform capable of leveraging advances in machine learning to support edge computing, several challenges arise, including resilience, performance isolation, and data privacy. This paper describes the architecture of the Waggle platform developed at Argonne National Laboratory. As an open platform, Waggle supports a wide range of sensors, including experimental sensors to measure airborne pollutants such as hydrogen sulfide and ozone, as well as cameras intended to detect urban flooding and automobile traffic.

Given pairs of images consisting of atypical input and respective desired output, the goal is to estimate an operator that transforms the inputs into the desired outputs.

This paper proposes a Mutual Information (MI) approach, that focuses on feature selection. The approach can decrease redundancies and conflicts. In addition, it extracts an optimal subset of features from the writing samples produced by male and female writers.

This new research has the potential to give some insight in determining if, and when, physicians are acting outside the norm of their respective specialty, which could indicate misuse, fraud, or lack of knowledge around billing procedures. We use a publicly available procedure billing dataset, released by the U. S. Medicare system. Due to the large size of the dataset, we sampled the dataset to include all physicians practicing within one state only. The model uses the multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm and is evaluated by calculating precision, recall, and Fscore with 5-fold cross-validation. The model is able to successfully predict several classes of physicians with an F-score over 0.9. These results show that it is possible to effectively use machine learning in a novel way to classify physicians into their respective fields solely using the procedures they bill for.

"A Novel Density-Based Approach for Instance Selection","J. L. Carbonera; M. Abel","Inst. of Inf., Univ. Fed. do Rio Grande do Sul - UFRGS, Porto Alegre, Brazil","2016 IEEE 28th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)","20170116","2016","","","549","556","Due to the increasing of the size of the datasets, techniques for instance selection have been applied for reducing the data to a manageable volume, leading to a reduction of the computational resources that are necessary for performing the learning process. Besides that, algorithms of instance selection can also be applied for removing useless, erroneous or noisy instances, before applying learning algorithms. In the last years, several approaches for instance selection have been proposed. However, most of them have high time complexity and, due to this, they cannot be used for dealing with large datasets. In this paper, we present an algorithm called CDIS that can be viewed as an improvement of a recently proposed density-based approach for instance selection. The main contribution of this paper is a formal characterization of a novel density function that is adopted by the CDIS algorithm. The CDIS algorithm evaluates the instances of each class separately and keeps only the densest instances in a given (arbitrary) neighborhood. This ensures a reasonably low time complexity. Our approach was evaluated on 20 well-known data sets and its performance was compared with the performance of 6 state-of-the-art algorithms, considering three measures: accuracy, reduction and effectiveness. For evaluating the accuracy achieved using the datasets produced by the algorithms, we applied the KNN algorithm. The results show that our approach achieves a performance (in terms of balance of accuracy and reduction) that is better or comparable to the performances of the other algorithms considered in the evaluation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4459-7; POD:978-1-5090-4460-3","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0090","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814650","Data mining;Instance reduction;Instance selection;Instance-based learning;Machine learning;dataset reduction","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Noise measurement;Search problems;Time complexity;Training","computational complexity;data reduction;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","CDIS;KNN algorithm;computational resource reduction;data reduction;density function;instance selection;learning process;novel density-based approach;time complexity","","","","","","","6-8 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the most prominent is the in-vehicle data recorder (IVDR). There are multiple ways to assign the IVDR's data to the different drivers who share the same vehicle. Irrespective of the level of sophistication, all of these technologies still suffer considerable limitations in their accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to propose a methodology, which can identify the driver of a given trip using historical trip-based data. To do so, an advanced machine learning pipeline is proposed. The main goal is to take advantage of highly available data-such as driver-labeled floating car data collected by a IVDR-to build a pattern-based algorithm able to identify the trip's driver category when its true identity is unknown. This stepwise process includes feature generation/selection, multiple heterogeneous explanatory models, and an ensemble approach (i.e., stacked generalization) to reduce their generalization error. Our goal is to provide an inexpensive alternative to existing driver identification technologies, which can serve as their complement and/or validation purposes. Experiments conducted over a real-world case study from Israel uncover the potential of this idea: it obtained an accuracy of ~88% and Cohen's Kappa agreement score of ~74%.","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2639361","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7819486","Identification methods;classification;in-vehicle data recorders;machine learning.;stacked generalization;supervised learning","Automobiles;Cameras;Data collection;Face;Iris recognition","","","","","","","","20170116","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

It can detect fall of the human without hardware modification, extra environmental setup, or any wearable device. We implement WiFall on desktops equipped with commodity 802.11n NIC, and evaluate the performance in three typical indoor scenarios with several layouts of transmitter-receiver (Tx-Rx) links. In our area of interest, WiFall can achieve fall detection for a single person with high accuracy. As demonstrated by the experimental results, WiFall yields 90 percent detection precision with a false alarm rate of 15 percent on average using a one-class SVM classifier in all testing scenarios. It can also achieve average 94 percent fall detection precisions with 13 percent false alarm using Random Forest algorithm.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2557792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7458186","Wireless;channel state information;device-free;fall detection;machine learning","Channel state information;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Motion detection;Senior citizens;Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","biomedical communication;decision trees;geriatrics;indoor radio;medical computing;pattern classification;radio links;radio receivers;radio transmitters;support vector machines;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","802.11n NIC;WiFall;device-free fall detection;false alarm rate;health threats;indoor scenarios;one-class SVM classifier;physical layer channel state information;radio propagation model;radio signal;random forest algorithm;transmitter-receiver links;wireless networks","","","","","","20160422","Feb. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Methods: We train, test, analyze, and compare various machine learning classification approaches optimized in terms of the correct classification rate (CCR), the degenerated Youden's index (DYI) and the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). CAD system comprises five stages: electroencephalography (EEG) preprocessing, feature extraction, seven electrode groupings, discriminant feature selection, and binary classification. Results: With two optimal combinations of electrode grouping, filtering, feature selection algorithm, and classification machine, we get either a mean CCR = 93.42%, specificity = 0.9673, sensitivity = 0.8727, DYI = 0.9188, and AUC = 0.9567 (total-15 Hz-J5-MLP), or a mean CCR = 92.23%, specificity = 0.9499, sensitivity = 0.8838, DYI = 0.9162, and AUC = 0.9807 (right hemisphere-35 Hz-J5-SVM), which to our knowledge are higher than those available to date. Conclusions: We have verified that a more restrictive low-pass filtering achieves higher CCR as compared to others at higher frequencies in the P3b wave. In addition, results validate previous hypothesis about the importance of the parietal-temporal region, associated with memory processing, allowing us to identify powerful {feature,electrode} pairs in the diagnosis of schizophrenia, achieving higher CCR and AUC in classification of both right and left Hemispheres, and parietal-temporal EEG signals, like, for instance, the {PSE, P4} pair (J5 and mutual information feature selection). Significance: Diagnosis of schizophrenia is made thoroughly by psychiatrists but as any human-based decision that has a subjective component. This CAD system provides the human expert with an objective complimentary measure to help him in diagnosing schizophrenia.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2016.2558824","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460246","Area under curve;P3b wave;auditory odd-ball (AOD);classification;diagnosis;electroencephalography (EEG);machine learning;receiver operating characteristic (ROC);schizophrenia;sensitivity;specificity","Computer aided diagnosis;Design automation;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Indexes;Sensitivity","bioelectric potentials;biomedical electrodes;electroencephalography;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);low-pass filters;medical disorders;medical signal processing;signal classification","EEG preprocessing;P3b wave;auditory odd-ball task;binary classification;computer-aided diagnosis system;correct classification rate;degenerated Youden index;discriminant feature selection;electrode grouping;electroencephalography;feature extraction;hemisphere;human-based decision;low-pass filtering;machine learning classification;memory processing;parietal-temporal EEG signal;schizophrenia diagnosis","","","","","","20160427","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

An alternative approach is to use machine learning to estimate local transformations, that characterize the image operators, from pairs of input-output images. The main challenge of this approach, called W-operator learning, is estimating operators over large windows without overfitting. Current techniques require the determination of a large number of parameters to maximize the performance of the trained operators. Support Vector Machines are known for their generalization performance and their ability to estimate nonlinear decision surfaces using kernels. However, training kernelized SVMs in the dual is not feasible when the training set is large. We estimate the local transformations employing kernel approximations to train SVMs, thus with no need to compute the full Gram matrix. We also select appropriate kernels to process binary and gray level inputs. Experiments show that operators trained using kernel approximation achieve comparable results with state-of-the-art methods in 4 public datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3568-7; POD:978-1-5090-3569-4","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2016.060","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7813059","Image Processing;Kernel approximation;Machine learning;W-operator learning","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Feature extraction;Kernel;Standards;Support vector machines;Training","approximation theory;generalisation (artificial intelligence);image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical operators;support vector machines","SVM;W-operator learning;binary level inputs;generalization performance;gray level inputs;image operators;image processing;input-output images;kernel approximation;local transformation estimation;machine learning;nonlinear decision surface estimation;support vector machines;training set","","","","","","","4-7 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are many existing methods for calling deletions. At present, not a single method clearly outperforms all other methods in precision and sensitivity. A popular strategy used by several authors is combining different signatures left by deletions in order to achieve more accurate deletion calling. However, most existing methods using the combining approach are heuristic and the called deletions by these tools still contain many wrongly called deletions. In this paper, we present Concod, a machine learning based framework for calling deletions with consensus, which is able to more accurately detect and distinguish true deletions from falsely called ones. First, Concod collects candidate deletions by merging the output of multiple existing deletion calling tools. Then, features of each candidate are extracted from aligned reads based on multiple detection theories. Finally, a machine learning model is trained with these features and used to classify the true and false candidates. We test our approach on different coverage of real data and compare with existing tools, including Pindel, SVseq2, BreakDancer, and DELLY. Results show that Concod improves both precision and sensitivity of deletion calling significantly.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1611-2; POD:978-1-5090-1612-9","10.1109/BIBM.2016.7822495","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7822495","deletion calling;feature extraction;high-throughput sequencing;machine learning;structural variations","Bioinformatics;Feature extraction;Genomics;Merging;Sensitivity;Sequential analysis;Support vector machines","bioinformatics;biological techniques;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence)","BreakDancer tool;Concod method;DELLY tool;Pindel tool;SVseq2 tool;accurate consensus-based approach;deletion calling;detection theories;genome analysis;high-throughput sequencing data;machine learning based framework;short sequence;structural variations;true deletions","","","","","","","15-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, due to the complicated financial environment, it is challenging to make an accurate market prediction. Machine learning is an effective tool to make such predictions. To build an effective investment strategy, selections of input features, prediction model with high accuracy, and buy-and-sell signals are very important factors. In this paper, we firstly screened out training features that are most relevant to stock price movement by calculating maximal information coefficient (MIC), then built an ensemble prediction model named SRAVoting basing on three outstanding classifiers on stock price movement trend prediction (support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and AdaBoost (AB)), and proposed stock buy & sell strategies for day-span, week and month investing periods. Chinese stock price indexes and technical indicators were used to validate the proposed model and strategy. Result showed that SRAVoting model achieved higher prediction accuracy than SVM, while not necessarily higher annualized return rate than SVM based buy & sell strategies.

We present a self-managed platform that collects and stores data from sensor nodes, analyzes its contents and uses the built knowledge to adjust the operation of the entire network. The system architecture facilitates the incorporation of traditional WSNs into the Internet of Things by abstracting the lower communication layers and allowing decisions based on the data relevance. Finally, we demonstrate the platform optimizing a WSN's operation at runtime, based on different real-time data analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821767","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821767","Internet of Things;Machine Learning;Predictions;Sensor Networks","Computer architecture;Data analysis;Servers;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;data analysis;wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WSN;communication layers;data collection;data storage;energy resources;real-time data analysis;self-managed architecture;wireless medium occupancy;wireless sensor networks;wireless sensor nodes","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One big challenge for troubleshooting these cloud systems is to pinpoint the software bug-induced failure in large and complex log files which is a nightmare for administrators. So far, there has been little study on how to identity bug-induced failures based on log analysis. In this paper, we analyze and describe features of bug-induced failure logs from bug repository and Q&A websites, and then propose a general automatic approach to pinpoint logs of bug-induced failure from log files of open cloud platform. In the approach, two algorithms called MPIN and SPIN are presented for log classification. We evaluate our approach by applying logs collected from bug repositories of OpenStack and Hadoop, and five Q&A websites.

While many solutions for the online VNE problem exist, only few have focused on methods that can be generally applied for optimization of online embeddings. In this paper, we propose an admission control based on a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to improve the overall system performance for the online VNE problem. Before running a VNE algorithm to embed a virtual network request, the RNN predicts whether the request will be accepted by the VNE algorithm based on the current state of the substrate and the virtual network request (VNR). The RNN prevents VNE algorithms from spending time on VNRs that are either infeasible or that cannot be embedded in acceptable time. In order to train and operate the RNN efficiently, we additionally propose new representations for substrate networks and virtual network requests. The representations are based on topological and network resource features to represent the substrate network and the VNRs with low computational complexity. Via simulations, we show that our admission control reduces the overall computational time for the online VNE problem by up to 91 % while preserving VNE performance on average. Using our new substrate and request representations, the RNN achieves an accuracy ranging between 89 % and 98 % for different VNE algorithms, substrate sizes, and VNR arrival rates.","","POD:978-1-5090-3236-5","10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818395","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7818395","Virtual network embedding;admission control;machine learning;mathematical optimization;neural networks","Admission control;Communication networks;Mathematical programming;Neural networks;Prediction algorithms;Runtime;Substrates","computational complexity;optimisation;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication networks","RNN;VNR;admission control;boost online virtual network embedding;computational complexity;neural networks;online VNE;online embedding optimization;physical resource allocation;recurrent neural network;substrate networks;virtual network requests","","","","","","","Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 4 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typically algorithms used to build decision models remain as a black-box to the end user. Therefore the process of decision making appears to be opaque. At the same time, increasing the transparency of a black-box decision making model allows us to discover hidden discrimination, and hold entities accountable. Although algorithmic transparency with respect to black box classifiers requires addressing many challenges, our main objective in this paper is to investigate whether a black-box classification model is biased against certain subgroups. Specifically, we study the indirect discrimination of hidden protected features. Protected features, such as race, gender, and religious beliefs, are those that are prohibited to be legally used for making decisions. Simply removing the protected features is not enough to eliminate discrimination because there could be strong correlations between protected features and non-protected features, such as race versus zip code. In this paper, we present two techniques to measure discrimination of a black-box model as a result of data bias or algorithmic weakness. Data bias is investigated further by introducing artificial bias to the dataset under consideration. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our bias measures where bias comes from different sources.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4607-2; POD:978-1-5090-4608-9","10.1109/CIC.2016.051","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809722","Data Mining;Discrimination;Machine Learning","Bayes methods;Correlation;Data mining;Data models;Decision making;Feature extraction;Itemsets","data mining;decision making;pattern classification","algorithmic transparency;algorithmic weakness;artificial bias;black-box classification model;black-box decision making model;data bias;data mining techniques;discrimination detection","","","","","","","1-3 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

PCG for physics-based puzzles requires one to simulate the game to ensure feasibility and stability of the objects composing the puzzle. The major drawback of this simulation-based approach is the overall running time of the PCG process, as the simulations can be computationally expensive. This paper introduces a method that uses machine learning to reduce the number of simulations performed by an evolutionary approach while generating levels of Angry Birds, a physics-based puzzle game. Our method uses classifiers to verify the stability and feasibility of the levels considered during search. The fitness function is computed only for levels that are classified as stable and feasible. An approximation of the fitness that does not require simulations is used for levels that are deemed as unstable or unfeasible by the classifiers. Our experiments show that naively approximating the fitness values can lead to poor solutions. We then introduce an approach in which the fitness values are approximated with the average fitness value of the levels' parents added to a penalty value. This approximation scheme allows the search procedure to find good-quality solutions much more quickly than a competing approach-we reduce from 43 to 25 minutes the running time required to generate one level of Angry Birds.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4459-7; POD:978-1-5090-4460-3","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814699","Classification;Evolutionary Algorithm;Machine Learning;Procedural Content Generation;Video Game","Artificial intelligence;Conferences","approximation theory;computer games;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);physics computing","PCG systems;fitness approximation;fitness function;machine learning;physics-based puzzle games;procedural content generation systems;speed up evolutionary content generation;video games","","","","","","","6-8 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Quality assessment metrics for 3D images have achieved good performance on symmetric distorted 3D images, while given poor performance on asymmetric distorted 3D images. To further improve the perception consistency for symmetric and asymmetric distorted 3D images, this paper presents a machine learning-based full-reference 3D image quality assessment method that learns from multi IQA metrics. Considering that changes in left view, right view and depth information all impact human perception, our method considers the quality of two views and depth information. Since symmetric and asymmetric distortions impact left and right views of a 3D image differently, we propose different features for symmetric and asymmetric distorted 3D images. The experimental results show that our method has better performance than both 2D-based 3D quality assessment metrics and the state of the art specially designed 3D quality assessment metrics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5743-6; POD:978-1-5090-5744-3; USB:978-1-5090-5742-9","10.1109/IC3D.2016.7823452","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823452","Stereoscopic 3D image quality assessment;depth information;disparity map;machine learning;multi metrics","Distortion;Image quality;Indexes;Measurement;Stereo image processing;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","learning (artificial intelligence);optical distortion;optical images;stereo image processing","2D-based 3D quality assessment metrics;asymmetric distorted 3D images;machine learning-based full-reference stereoscopic 3D image quality assessment method;multiIQA metrics","","","","","","","13-14 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Reframing has emerged as a new machine learning technique that adapts the context changes between training and target domains. One of the advantages of reframing is that it can offer good performances with a limited amount of deployment data. Reframing has already been implemented in classification and regression by reusing labelled training data with the help of few labelled target data. However, reframing in clustering is still a challenging research problem because of its unsupervised nature. In this paper, we concentrate on building a reframing method for clustering. We also show the necessity and effectiveness of our method in contrast to retraining, which is the process of learning new model in the testing and deployment phases.

The system consists of a front end that extracts a set of features form the pulse oximeter signal. These features are based on physiological considerations. The set of features were the input of a machine-learning algorithm that determined the class of the input sample, i.e., whether the subject had diabetes or not. The machine-learning algorithms were random forests, gradient boosting, and linear discriminant analysis as benchmark. The system was tested on a database of 1157 subjects (two samples per subject) collected from five community health centers. The mean receiver operating characteristic area found was 69.4% (median value 71.9% and range [75.4-61.1%]), with a specificity = 64% for a threshold that gave a sensitivity = 65%.

Mobile wireless networks can leverage spatio-temporal information about user and network condition to embed the system with end-to-end visibility and intelligence. Big data analytics has emerged as a promising approach to unearth meaningful insights and to build artificially intelligent models with assistance of machine learning tools. Utilizing aforementioned tools and techniques, this paper contributes in two ways. First, we utilize mobile network data (big data) – call detail record (CDR) – to analyze anomalous behavior of mobile wireless network. For anomaly detection purposes, we use unsupervised clustering techniques namely k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. We compare the detected anomalies with ground truth information to verify their correctness. From the comparative analysis, we observe that when the network experiences abruptly high (unusual) traffic demand at any location and time, it identifies that as anomaly. This helps in identifying regions of interest (RoI) in the network for special action such as resource allocation, fault avoidance solution etc. Second, we train a neural-network based prediction model with anomalous and anomaly-free data to highlight the effect of anomalies in data while training/building intelligent models. In this phase, we transform our anomalous data to anomaly-free and we observe that the error in prediction while training the model with anomaly-free data has largely decreased as compared to the case when the model was trained with anomalous data.","1551-3203;15513203","","10.1109/TII.2017.2650206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7811244","5G;Anomaly detection;Next generation wireless networks;call detail record;machine learning;network analytics;network behavior analysis;wireless cellular network","5G mobile communication;Big data;Data models;Mobile computing;Predictive models;Wireless networks","","","","","","","","20170109","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, offering guaranteed Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in cloud block storage services is often not straightforward. Cloud block storage performance may be affected by physical disk background operations, like garbage collection, storage cluster features, workload interference and the chraracteristcs of the workload itself. On the other hand, the underlying physical storage drives do not expose the internal states to higher level block storage service offerings. Therefore, SLAs can only be satisfied by over-provisioning the storage resources. To address this issue, we propose a self-learning scheduler that can dynamically adapt based on the workload, and efficiently provide a scheduling decision with zero knowledge of the underlying hardware. We study two candidate algorithms based on Feedback learning and Two-Phase learning. We used workloads that were deducted from real-world block-level traces of an enterprise data center, and conducted extensive simulations. Our results indicate that the self-learning scheduling approach can reduce the SLA violations by mitigating the unexpected resource fluctuation, and the scheduler can also adapt dynamically to various workloads.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2619-7; POD:978-1-5090-2620-3","10.1109/CLOUD.2016.0115","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820352","Cloud Block Storage;Cloud Infrastructure;Machine Learning;Openstack Cinder;Scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis;Clocks;Cloud computing;Machine learning algorithms;Quality of service;Resource management;Training","cloud computing;contracts;learning (artificial intelligence);scheduling;storage management","SLA violation reduction;black-box self-learning scheduler;cloud block storage systems;enterprise data center;feedback learning;real-world block-level traces;resource fluctuation;service level agreements;storage resource over-provisioning;two-phase learning","","","","","","","June 27 2016-July 2 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One particular type of representation that is very appropriate for these situations is the NetFeatureMap, which describes by means of features the relevant aspects that are inherent to the environment where the agent actuates. In renowned intelligent agents, such features are manually selected, which certainly leads to inadequate choices. Thus, investigating adequate approaches that perform automatic selection of these features becomes a crucial task. In this way, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a new approach that automatically selects appropriate features based on the frequency at which they occur in the states explored by the agent in the course of its acting over the environment. Such an approach is based on Frequent Pattern Mining. It is interesting to point out that there also exist Genetic Algorithms-based approaches that successfully cope with the same task. Unlike Genetic Algorithms that use heuristic functions to select the features, the present proposal uses real data contained in a specialized database for performing this task. Under the intent of investigating the efficacy of such a proposal, the authors utilize the domain of Checkers player agents as their case study, since they operate in a competitive environment with a very wide state space. This investigation is performed by means of tournaments in which agents whose features are selected by the approach proposed herein face others whose features are selected either manually or by Genetic Algorithms. The superior performance of the Frequent-Pattern-based agents in the tournaments proves the efficacy of the present proposal.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4459-7; POD:978-1-5090-4460-3","10.1109/ICTAI.2016.0147","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814707","Automated Selection of Features;Checkers;Frequent Pattern Mining;Machine Learning;NetFeatureMap;State Representation","Data mining;Databases;Feature extraction;Games;Genetic algorithms;History;Proposals","data mining;genetic algorithms;multi-agent systems","NetFeatureMap-based representation;checkers player agents;frequent pattern mining;genetic algorithm;intelligent agents;specialized database","","","","","","","6-8 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These systems require sampling and significant processing on multiple streams of physiological signals. The processing typically consists of feature extraction, data fusion, and classification stages that require a large number of digital signal processing and machine learning kernels. In order to be functional, however, the processing architecture needs to be low-power and have a low-area footprint. In this paper we present such a design for a personalized stress monitoring system with a flexible, multi-modal design. Various physiological and behavioral features were explored to maximize detection accuracy with both SVM and KNN machine learning classifiers. Among 17 different features from 5 sensors, heart rate and accelerometer features were found to have the highest classification accuracy to detect stress in the given dataset. While KNN classifier accuracy outperforms by 2%, it requires significantly larger memory and computation compared to the SVM classifier. Therefore, we chose the SVM classifier for hardware implementation. The post-layout implementation results in 130 nm CMOS technology show that the SVM processor occupies 0.2 mm<sup>2</sup> and dissipates 20.2 mW at 125 MHz. The proposed processor takes 800 ns to classify each input and consumes 16.2 nJ.

While the feature data for a particular music excerpt is concrete, the emotions felt by a person are subjective. Although personal experiences can influence a person's perception of music, the combination of music features, such as timbre, tonality and rhythm all contribute to the perceived emotion. In addition, humans often associate multiple emotions with a particular piece of music making it difficult to measure the emotions evoked by music using only a small subset of emotions. This research defines a set of algorithms to map detailed feature data extracted from a group of instrumental music excerpts to a complex combination of emotion categories. In this way, feature data can be used to represent emotion as a blend of moods, simulating a more authentic flow of human emotion.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821602","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821602","Machine learning;Music information retrieval;Predictive models;Signal mapping","Bars;Data mining;Feature extraction;Linear regression;Mood;Music;Springs","feature extraction;information retrieval;music","emotion categories;feature data extraction;human emotion representation;instrumental music excerpts;music retrieval","","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We define similarity using the root mean squared error computed from the differences of the system under test output and the model output for certain inputs not used for model inference. In the paper we introduce the approach and provide results of an experimental evaluation where we compare the similarity with the mutation score.

Currently, the commonly adopted approach is based on the subtree. It is supposed that the more common structure between two trees the more similarity between them. To effectively and efficiently learn tree-structured data, this paper proposes to learn tree-structured data using the echo state network based model space. The key idea is to learn models for the complex tree-structured data and convert the original tree data into points in the model space. The similarity between the tree-structured data is then measured by the distance of the models. Kernel method is combined to improve the discrimination performance of the classifier. Experiments are carried out on benchmark data sets to evaluate our proposed approach.

By separating Network Functions (NFs) from traditional middleboxes, NFV is expected to lead to reduced CAPEX and OPEX, and to more agile services. However, one of the main challenges to achieving these objectives is on how physical resources can be efficiently, autonomously, and dynamically allocated to Virtualised Network Functions (VNFs) whose resource requirements ebb and flow. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based algorithm which exploits Virtual Network Function Forwarding Graph (VNF-FG) topology information to predict future resource requirements for each Virtual Network Function Component (VNFC). The topology information of each VNFC is derived from combining its past resource utilisation as well as the modelled effect on the same from VNFCs in its neighbourhood. Our proposal has been evaluated using a deployment of a virtualised IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), and real VoIP traffic traces, with results showing an average prediction accuracy of 90%. Moreover, compared to a scenario where resources are allocated manually and/or statically, our proposal reduces the average number of dropped calls by at least 27% and improves call setup latency by over 29%.","","POD:978-1-5090-3236-5","10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7818394","Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Network Functions Virtualisation;Neural Networks;Resource Management;Topology Awareness","Containers;Dynamic scheduling;Mathematical model;Proposals;Resource management;Servers;Topology","neural nets;telecommunication network topology;virtual private networks","CAPEX;GNN-based algorithm;IMS;NFV;OPEX;VNF-FG topology information;VNFC;VoIP traffic traces;connectionist;dynamic resource management;graph neural network;network functions virtualisation;resource utilisation;setup latency;telecommunications services;virtual network function component;virtual network function forwarding graph;virtualised IP multimedia subsystem;virtualised network functions","","","","","","","Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 4 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the large and increasing number of construction projects that are being conducted in the U.S., there is a growing necessity of developing innovative methods to automatically monitor the safety for the workers at construction sites. Since the head is the most critical area of a human body and is the most vulnerable to an impact that could cause serious injury or death, the use of a protective helmet in construction work is needed. In this paper, we aim to automatically detect the uses of construction helmets (e.g., whether the construction worker wears the helmet or not) by analyzing the construction surveillance images. Based on the collected images, we first detect the object of interest (i.e., construction worker) and further analyze whether the worker wears the helmet or not, by using computer vision and machine learning techniques. In the first step, we incorporate frequency domain information of the image with a popular human detection algorithm Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) for construction worker detection; in the second step, the combination of color-based and Circle Hough Transform (CHT) feature extraction techniques is applied to detect helmet uses for the construction worker.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4771-0; POD:978-1-5090-4772-7","10.1109/WIW.2016.045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7814495","Computer Vision;Construction Safety;Helmet Use Detection;Machine Learning","Discrete cosine transforms;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image segmentation;Safety;Surveillance","Hough transforms;computer vision;construction industry;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;occupational safety;production engineering computing","CHT feature extraction techniques;HOG;circle Hough transform;color-based feature extraction techniques;computer vision;construction safety;construction surveillance images;construction worker detection;helmet uses automatic detection;histogram of oriented gradient;image analysis;image frequency domain information;machine learning techniques;object detection","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We argue that both approaches suffer considerably in terms of practicality and propose instead the use of commercial-shelf smart watches, already owned by the users. We test the feasibility of this approach with two different smart watches of very different capabilities, on a variety of activities performed daily in a domestic environment, from brushing teeth to preparing food.

In addition, because it is crucial to maintain the detection model's updatability and incorporate new malicious files created daily, ALDOCX integrates our active-learning (AL) methods, which are designed to efficiently assist anti-virus vendors by better focusing their experts' analytical efforts and enhance detection capability. ALDOCX identifies and acquires new docx files that are most likely malicious, as well as informative benign files. These files are used for enhancing the knowledge stores of both the detection model and the anti-virus software. The evaluation results show that by using ALDOCX and SFEM, we achieved a high detection rate of malicious docx files (94.44% TPR) compared with the anti-virus software (85.9% TPR)-with very low FPR rates (0.19%). ALDOCX's AL methods used only 14% of the labeled docx files, which led to a reduction of 95.5% in security experts' labeling efforts compared with the passive learning and the support vector machine (SVM)-Margin (existing active-learning method). Our AL methods also showed a significant improvement of 91% in number of unknown docx malware acquired, compared with the passive learning and the S- M-Margin, thus providing an improved updating solution for the detection model, as well as the anti-virus software widely used within organizations.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2631905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7762928","Active learning;documents;docx;machine learning;malicious;malware;microsoft office files;structural","Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Malware;Organizations;Portable document format;Security","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","AL methods;ALDOCX;SFEM;SVM-Margin;active-learning methods;antivirus software;informative benign files;machine-learning algorithms;passive learning;structural feature extraction methodology;unknown docx malware;unknown malicious Microsoft Office documents detection;unknown malicious docx files accurate detection","","","","","","20161201","March 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Gratitude for support is examined in the context of two major disasters in the United States, the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and a May 2011 tornado that devastated Alabama. Analyzing tweets from these communities after each disaster, we identified and described six categories of support exchanged through Twitter. We found distinct difference in expressions of gratitude for different types of social support in these two communities. While some of these differences could be expected based on the nature of the disaster, others were less predictable.

The increasing quality and quantity of experimental data enable statistical approaches based on information theory for model selection and goodness-of-fit metrics. We propose an alternative data-driven method to infer networked nonlinear dynamical systems by using sparsity-promoting optimization to select a subset of nonlinear interactions representing dynamics on a network. In contrast to standard model selection methods-based upon information content for a finite number of heuristic models (order 10 or less), our model selection procedure discovers a parsimonious model from a combinatorially large set of models, without an exhaustive search. Our particular innovation is appropriate for many biological networks, where the governing dynamical systems have rational function nonlinearities with cross terms, thus requiring an implicit formulation and the equations to be identified in the null-space of a library of mixed nonlinearities, including the state and derivative terms. This method, implicit-SINDy, succeeds in inferring three canonical biological models: 1) Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics; 2) the regulatory network for competence in bacteria; and 3) the metabolic network for yeast glycolysis.","","","10.1109/TMBMC.2016.2633265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809160","Dynamical systems;biological networks;machine learning;network inference;non-convex optimization;nonlinear dynamics;sparse selection","Biochemistry;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Nonlinear dynamical systems","","","","","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Conventional active learning methods aim at labeling the most informative samples for alleviating the labor of the user. Many previous studies in active learning select one sample after another in a greedy manner. However, this is not very effective, because the classification models have to be retrained for each newly labeled sample. Moreover, many popular active learning approaches utilize the most uncertain samples by leveraging the classification hyperplane of the classifier, which is not appropriate, since the classification hyperplane is inaccurate when the training data are small-sized. The problem of insufficient training data in real-world systems limits the potential applications of these approaches. This paper presents a novel method of active learning called manifold regularized experimental design (MRED), which can label multiple informative samples at one time for training. In addition, MRED gives an explicit geometric explanation for the selected samples to be labeled by the user. Different from existing active learning methods, our method avoids the intrinsic problems caused by insufficiently labeled samples in real-world applications. Various experiments on synthetic data sets, such as the Yale face database and the Corel image database, have been carried out to show how MRED outperforms existing methods.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2016.2635440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7765115","Machine learning;active learning;content-based image retrieval;face recognition;manifold regularization","Databases;Kernel;Manifolds;Semisupervised learning;Training;Training data","design of experiments;face recognition;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);visual databases","Corel image database;MRED;Yale face database;active classification hyperplane leveraging;active learning;data classification;data mining;explicit geometric explanation;intrinsic problems;machine learning;manifold regularized experimental design;synthetic data sets;training data","","","","","","20161202","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Therefore, one of our industry partners demands the requirements engineers to manually label each content element of a requirements specification as ""requirement"" or ""information"".

Previously, we have focused on the task of identifying genes that are linked with a given disease by text mining the PubMed abstracts. We applied a word-based concept profile similarity to learn patterns between disease and gene entities and hence identify links between them. In this work, we study an alternative approach based on topic modelling to learn different patterns between the disease and the gene entities and measure how well this affects the identified links. We investigated multiple input corpuses, word representations, topic parameters, and similarity measures. On one hand, our results show that when we (1) learn the topics from an input set of gene-clustered set of abstracts, and (2) apply the dot-product similarity measure, we succeed to improve our original methods and identify more correct disease-gene links.

What structural relationship can be utilized in providing intelligence not only in capturing current status but also offering intelligent hints or guidance in getting closer to the correct target in order to find out truth? These are the questions that this paper addresses. It also explores the unique structural relationship in contextual binding, which is unfortunately not well studied.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4470-2; POD:978-1-5090-4471-9","10.1109/WI.2016.0125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7817142","Contexts;accurate attribution;contextual binding;intelligent hints;machine learning;structural relationship","Automation;Computer security;Context;Cyberspace;Information retrieval;Supervised learning;Unsupervised learning","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","automated targeting;contextual binding;cybersecurity;intelligent automation;intelligent hints;intelligent targeting;investigative search;machine learning","","","","","","","13-16 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this research is to recognize the out of plane non-frontal faces. In this paper, we used the PCA Eigen-face method for the face recognition with the help of Scale Invariant Features Transform procedure over the corner points to transform pose variant faces into virtual frontal faces.","","DVD:978-1-5090-1283-1; Electronic:978-1-5090-1285-5; POD:978-1-5090-1286-2","10.1109/INVENTIVE.2016.7823245","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7823245","Machine learning;PCA Eigen faces;Shift Invariant Featured Transformed (SIFT);Virtual frontal face;corner points;face recognition","Databases;Face;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Lighting;Principal component analysis;Three-dimensional displays","face recognition;image registration;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;surveillance;transforms","PCA Eigen-face;face recognition;facial image registration;machine learning;plane rotation;scale invariant features transform;surveillance application;virtual frontal faces","","","","","","","26-27 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Predicting Web service response time percentiles","Y. Amannejad; D. Krishnamurthy; B.

Existing techniques can be very time consuming since they involve the manual construction of complex analytic or simulation models. To address this problem, we propose Prospective, a fully automated and data-driven approach for predicting Web service response time percentiles. Prospective relies on historical response time data collected from a Web service. Given a specification for workload expected at the Web service over a planning horizon, Prospective uses this historical data to offer predictions for response time percentiles of interest. At the core of Prospective is a lightweight simulator that uses collaborative filtering to estimate response time behaviour of the service based on behaviour observed historically. Results show that Prospective is able to predict various response time percentiles of interest with high accuracy for a wide variety of workloads.","","POD:978-1-5090-3236-5","10.1109/CNSM.2016.7818402","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7818402","Machine learning;Performance prediction;Response time percentile;Software performance engineering","Analytical models;Load modeling;Planning;Predictive models;Queueing analysis;Time factors;Web services","Web services;collaborative filtering;service-oriented architecture;software performance evaluation","Web service response time percentiles;collaborative filtering;complex analytic models;data-driven approach;historical response time data;lightweight simulator;response time behaviour;service level management exercise;simulation models;software performance engineering","","","","","","","Oct. 31 2016-Nov. 4 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Resource-efficient latent fingerprint age estimation for Adhoc crime scene forensics: Quality assessment of flat bed scans and statistical features","R. Merkel; J. Dittmann; C.

University, Magdeburg, Germany","2016 Sixth International Conference on Image Processing Theory, Tools and Applications (IPTA)","20170119","2016","","","1","6","In the field of biometrics and forensics, age estimation is an important topic, for example when determining the age of human subjects or when assessing the age of a particular taken biometric sample or captured forensic trace from crime scenes. The latter case is investigated in this paper, with the focus on latent fingerprints. Here, the trace age represents the time between deposition and capture of a print, which might assist an investigation in several respects, such as forgery detection (trace freshness inconsistencies) or strengthening a prints evidentiary value in court (linking a suspect to the time of a crime). Non-invasive, high-resolution and very cost-intensive capturing devices have recently been proposed to address this 80 year old challenge of latent print age estimation by studying print time series. This approach is transferred here to a (cheap) off-the-shelf flat bed scanner, enabling a broad variety of researchers to study print aging in the future. Based on 700 time series (including 10% empty substrate series for comparison), a separation performance of 89.2% (eccrine) and 98.7% (sebaceous) was achieved for separating fresh prints and those aged for at least half a day. Results include a comparison to prior used high-resolution Chromatic White Light (CWL) sensors and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopes (CLSM), also showing the possibility of significant preprocessing simplifications due to decreased capturing distortions as well as the need for further (quantitative) studies.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8910-5; POD:978-1-4673-8911-2","10.1109/IPTA.2016.7820999","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820999","Age Estimation;Crime Scene Forensics;Flat Bed Scanner;Latent Fingerprints;Machine Learning","Aging;Estimation;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Fluctuations;Forensics;Time series analysis","fingerprint identification;image forensics;image resolution;police data processing;statistical analysis;time series","adhoc crime scene forensics;biometrics;court;evidentiary value;flat bed scanner;forensics;latent print age estimation;print time series;quality assessment;resource-efficient latent fingerprint age estimation;statistical features","","","","","","","12-15 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Progressive Semisupervised Learning of Multiple Classifiers","Z. Yu; Y. Lu; J. Zhang; J. You; H. S. Wong; Y. Wang; G.

However, conventional semisupervised ensemble learning approaches have two limitations: 1) most of them cannot obtain satisfactory results on high dimensional datasets with limited labels and 2) they usually do not consider how to use an optimization process to enlarge the training set. In this paper, we propose the progressive semisupervised ensemble learning approach (PSEMISEL) to address the above limitations and handle datasets with very small number of labeled samples. When compared with traditional semisupervised ensemble learning approaches, PSEMISEL is characterized by two properties: 1) it adopts the random subspace technique to investigate the structure of the dataset in the subspaces and 2) a progressive training set generation process and a self evolutionary sample selection process are proposed to enlarge the training set. We also use a set of nonparametric tests to compare different semisupervised ensemble learning methods over multiple datasets. The experimental results on 18 real-world datasets from the University of California, Irvine machine learning repository show that PSEMISEL works well on most of the real-world datasets, and outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches on 10 out of 18 datasets.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2017.2651114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7827073","Ensemble learning;machine learning;optimization;random subspace;semisupervised learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Boosting;Data mining;Robustness;Semisupervised learning;Training","","","","","","","","20170119","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"
