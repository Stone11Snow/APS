This paper focuses on optimizing the runtime performance of applying such models to make predictions, specifically using gradient-boosted regression trees for learning to rank. Although exceedingly simple conceptually, most implementations of tree-based models do not efficiently utilize modern superscalar processors. By laying out data structures in memory in a more cache-conscious fashion, removing branches from the execution flow using a technique called predication, and micro-batching predictions using a technique called vectorization, we are able to better exploit modern processor architectures. Experiments on synthetic data and on three standard learning-to-rank datasets show that our approach is significantly faster than standard implementations.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2013.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6513227","General;Information Storage and Retrieval;Information Technology and Systems;Learning to Rank;Scalability and Efficiency;Web Search;Web search;general information storage and retrieval;information technology and systems;learning to rank;regression trees;scalability and efficiency","Arrays;Indexes;Optimization;Predictive models;Program processors;Regression tree analysis","Internet;cache storage;information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;tree data structures","Web ranking;cache-conscious fashion;data structures;execution flow;gradient-boosted regression trees;learning-to-rank datasets;microbatching predictions;predication technique;processor architectures;runtime performance optimizations;superscalar processors;synthetic data;tree-based machine learning models;vectorization technique","","5","","36","","20130503","Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Diabetes mellitus otherwise known as a slow poison by the medical experts is a major, alarming and gradually becoming a global problem. This paper experimented and used the concept of modified extreme learning machine to identify the patients of being diabetic or non-diabetic basing on some previously given data which in turn helps the medical people to identify whether someone is affected by diabetes or not. It also describes and compares the application of two popular machine learning methods: Back propagation neural network and modified Extreme learning machine which are used as binary classifiers to address the diabetes prediction problem. These two approaches are applied on same type of multi class classification datasets and the work tries to generate some comparative inferences from training and testing results.

High temperature negatively affects different stages of plant development in rice, mainly booting and flowering. Identifying candidate genes associated with high-temperature stress response may provide knowledge for the improvement of heat tolerance in rice. As the rice genome sequencing has already been undertaken, a major work challenge is annotating proteins and decoding their functionalities. MAP kinase (MAPK) proteins are involved in signaling various abiotic and biotic stresses, like temperature stress or drought, wounding and pathogen infection. Moreover, MAPKs have also been implicated in cell cycle and developmental processes. In this study, an attempt has been made in developing a MAP kinase prediction tool for rice, MapPred. The computational approach has been developed using Sequential Minimum Optimization (SMO) algorithm in Weka workbench, and a sensitivity of 100% was obtained using dipeptide method. MapPred was also tested with three plants, namely Arabidopsis, maize and tomato to prove that developed tool has higher accuracy with rice than other plants which further proves the higher prediction accuracy of species-specific tools. Prediction performance of MapPred was evaluated using cross validation, independent data test and leave one out validation.

In the smart grid, the overall monitoring costs will be decreased, but at the same time, the risk of cyber attacks might be increased. Recently, a new type of attacks (called the stealth attack) has been introduced, which cannot be detected by the traditional bad data detection using state estimation. In this paper, we show how normal operations of power networks can be statistically distinguished from the case under stealthy attacks. We propose two machine-learning-based techniques for stealthy attack detection. The first method utilizes supervised learning over labeled data and trains a distributed support vector machine (SVM). The design of the distributed SVM is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, which offers provable optimality and convergence rate. The second method requires no training data and detects the deviation in measurements. In both methods, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to be processed, which leads to lower computation complexities. The results of the proposed detection methods on IEEE standard test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of both schemes.","1932-8184;19328184","","10.1109/JSYST.2014.2341597","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6880823","Anomaly detection;bad data detection (BDD);power system state estimation;support vector machines (SVMs)","","","","","2","","","","20140820","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this paper, a fast automatic 2D-to-3D conversion technique is proposed, which uses a machine learning framework to infer the 3D structure of a query color image from a training database with color and depth images. Assuming that photometrically similar images have analogous 3D structures, a depth map is estimated by searching the most similar color images in the database, and fusing the corresponding depth maps. Large databases are desirable to achieve better results, but the computational cost also increases. A clustering-based hierarchical search using compact SURF descriptors to characterize images is proposed to drastically reduce search times. A significant computational time improvement has been obtained regarding other state-of-the-art approaches, maintaining the quality results.","2161-2021;21612021","Electronic:978-1-4799-4758-4; POD:978-1-4799-4757-7; USB:978-1-4799-4759-1","10.1109/3DTV.2014.6874736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6874736","2D-to-3D conversion;3D inference;SURF descriptors;database clustering;fast conversion;hierarchical search;machine learning","Clustering algorithms;Color;Computational efficiency;Databases;Estimation;Image color analysis;Three-dimensional displays","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image convertors;image fusion;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;three-dimensional displays;visual databases","3D content;3D display;3D structure;analogous 3D structure;automatic 2D-to-3D conversion;clustering-based hierarchical search;compact SURF descriptor;depth images;depth map estimation;depth map fusion;machine learning;query color image;training database","","4","","7","","","2-4 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim of this study is to classify six emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutral) that human have often experienced in real life from multi-channel bio-signals using machine learning algorithms. We have measured physiological responses of three-hundred participants for acquisition of bio-signals such as electrodermal activity, electrocardiograph, skin temperature, and photoplethysmograph during six emotions induction. Also, for emotion classification, we have extracted eighteen features from the signals and performed emotion classification using five algorithms, linear discriminant analysis, Naïve Bayes, classification and regression tree, self-organization map and support vector machine. The used algorithms were evaluated by only training, 10-fold cross-validation and repeated random sub-sampling validation. We have obtained recognition accuracy from 42.4 to 100% for only training and 39.2 to 53.9% for testing. Also, the result for testing showed that an accuracy of emotion recognition by Naïve Bayes and linear discriminant analysis were highest (53.9%, 52.7%) and was lowest by support vector machine (39.2%). This means that Naïve Bayes is the best emotion recognition algorithm for basic emotions. To apply to real system, we have to discuss in the view point of testing and this means that it needs to apply various methodologies for the accuracy improvement of emotion recognition in the future analysis.","2162-9048;21629048","Electronic:978-1-4799-4441-5; POD:978-1-4799-4440-8","10.1109/ICISA.2014.6847340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6847340","","Accuracy;Emotion recognition;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Physiology;Support vector machines;Testing","","","","0","","17","","","6-9 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

National Grid expects that this will become an important tool in its emergency response preparations. This paper will discuss the predictive model which will aid National Grid in its preventative emergency planning efforts. A machine learning predictive algorithm was built by considering physical properties of the network, historical weather data, and environmental information to predict outages, and ultimately damage, based on weather forecasts.

Detecting false sharing is difficult as it does not change the program semantics. We introduce an efficient and effective approach for detecting false sharing based on machine learning. We develop a set of mini-programs in which false sharing can be turned on and off. We then run the mini-programs both with and without false sharing, collect a set of hardware performance event counts and use the collected data to train a classifier. We can use the trained classifier to analyze data from arbitrary programs for detection of false sharing. Experiments with the PARSEC and Phoenix benchmarks show that our approach is indeed effective. We detect published false sharing regions in the benchmarks with zero false positives. Our performance penalty is less than 2%. Thus, we believe that this is an effective and practical method for detecting false sharing.","2167-4329;21674329","Electronic:978-1-4503-2378-9; POD:978-1-4799-3520-8","10.1145/2503210.2503269","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6877463","False Sharing;Machine Learning;Performance Events","Accuracy;Arrays;Hardware;Instruction sets;Training;Training data;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);parallel programming;program debugging","PARSEC;Phoenix benchmarks;data analysis;false sharing detection;hardware performance event counts;machine learning;miniprograms;performance bugs;program semantics;trained classifier","","4","","33","","","17-22 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In Australia, the classification of native forest species using remote sensing data remains a particular challenge since there are many eucalyptus species that belong to the same genus and, thus, exhibit similar biophysical characteristics. This study assessed the potential of using hyperspectral remote sensing data and state-of-the-art machine-learning classification algorithms to classify Australian forest species at the leaf, canopy and community levels in Beecroft Peninsula, NSW, Australia. Spectral reflectance was acquired from an ASD spectrometer and airborne Hymap imagery for seven native forest species over an Australian eucalyptus forest. Three machine-learning classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost and Random Forest (RF) were applied to classify the species. A comparative study was carried out between machine-learning classification algorithms and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The classification results show that all machine-leaning classification algorithms significantly improve the results produced by LDA. At the leaf level, RF achieved the best classification accuracy (94.7%), and SVM outperformed the other algorithms at both the canopy (84.5%) and community levels (75.5%). This study demonstrates that hyperspectral remote sensing and machine-learning classification has substantial potential for the classification of Australian native forest species.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2282166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6626350","Forestry;remote sensing","Accuracy;Communities;Radio frequency;Remote sensing;Support vector machines;Vegetation;Vegetation mapping","geophysical image processing;hyperspectral imaging;image classification;remote sensing;vegetation","ASD spectrometer;Australia;Australian eucalyptus forest;Australian native forest species classification;Beecroft Peninsula;airborne Hymap imagery;bio-physical characteristics;ecological application;eucalyptus species;forest species mapping;forestry application;hyperspectral remote sensing;linear discriminant analysis;remote sensing data;state-of-the-art machine-learning classification algorithms","","8","","63","","20131009","June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Our approach as the variant of Locality-Sensitive support vector machine (LSSVM) not only has a lot of advantages of local learning, but also makes good use of the prior information of training examples by adding the relative density degrees of training points.

The atherosclerotic process, mainly affecting the medium- and large-size arteries, is a degenerative condition that causes thickening and the reduction of elasticity in the blood vessels. The Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) of the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) is a reliable early indicator of atherosclerosis. Usually, it is manually measured by marking pairs of points on a B-mode ultrasound scan image of the CCA. This paper proposes an automatic image segmentation procedure for the measurement of the IMT, avoiding the user dependence and the inter-rater variability. In particular, Radial Basis Function (RBF) Networks are designed and trained by means of the Optimally Pruned-Extreme Learning Machine (OP-ELM) algorithm to classify pixels from a given ultrasound image, allowing the extraction of IMT boundaries. The suggested approach has been validated on a set of 25 ultrasound images by comparing the automatic segmentations with manual tracings.","1949-3983;19493983","Electronic:978-1-4799-3990-9; POD:978-1-4799-3991-6; USB:978-1-4799-3989-3","10.1109/CBMI.2014.6849839","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849839","","Biology;Image segmentation;Instruction sets;Manuals;Monitoring;Pathology","blood vessels;cardiovascular system;diseases;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;radial basis function networks","CCA;CVD;OP-ELM algorithm;RBF networks;atherosclerosis;automatic image segmentation;blood vessels;cardiovascular diseases;carotid intima-media thickness;common carotid artery;fully automatic evaluation;machine learning;optimally pruned-extreme learning machine;radial basis function networks;ultrasound image processing","","0","","17","","","18-20 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Predictions of productivity can be useful to determine corrective actions and to assist managers in evaluating improvement alternatives. Productivity prediction models have been based on statistical regressions, statistical time series, fuzzy logic, and machine learning. Goal: To propose a machine learning model termed general regression neural network (GRNN) for predicting the productivity of software practitioners. Hypothesis: Prediction accuracy of a GRNN is better than a statistical regression model when these two models are applied for predicting productivity of software practitioners who have individually developed their software projects. Method: A sample obtained from 396 software projects developed between the years 2005 and 2011 by 99 practitioners was used for training the models, whereas a sample of 60 projects developed by 15 practitioners in the first months of 2012 was used for testing the models. All projects were developed based upon a disciplined development process within a controlled environment. The accuracy of the GRNN was compared against that of a multiple regression model (MLR). The criteria for evaluating the accuracy of these two models were the Magnitude of Error Relative to the estimate and a t-paired statistical test. Results: Prediction accuracy of an GRNN was statistically better than that of an MLR model at the 99% confidence level. Conclusion: An GRNN could be applied for predicting the productivity of practitioners when New and Changed lines of code, reused code, and programming language experience of practitioners are used as independent variables.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5604-3; POD:978-1-4799-5605-0","10.1109/SNPD.2014.6888690","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6888690","Software engineers productivity;general regression neural network;multiple statistical regression;software prediction","Accuracy;Mathematical model;Neural networks;Predictive models;Productivity;Software;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;project management;regression analysis;software development management;statistical testing;time series","GRNN prediction accuracy;code reusage;error relative magnitude;fuzzy logic;general regression neural network;information-and-communication technology;machine learning technique;productivity management;productivity prediction models;programming language;software projects;statistical regression model;statistical time series;t-paired statistical test","","0","","18","","","June 30 2014-July 2 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Some researchers have been experimenting with their own implementations of machine learning algorithms or with those available as part of the Weka machine learning software suite. There are some shortcomings to using “one off” solutions. It is the position of the authors that many problems exist in requirements engineering that can be supported by Weka's machine learning algorithms, specifically by classification trees. Further, the authors posit that adoption will be boosted if machine learning is easy to use and is integrated into requirements research tools, such as TraceLab. Toward that end, an initial concept validation of a component in TraceLab is presented that applies the Weka classification trees.

Currently, the power system operators are heavily relied on to make decisions regarding the causes of experienced disturbances and the appropriate course of action as a response. In the case of cyber-attacks against a power system, human judgment is less certain since there is an overt attempt to disguise the attack and deceive the operators as to the true state of the system. To enable the human decision maker, we explore the viability of machine learning as a means for discriminating types of power system disturbances, and focus specifically on detecting cyber-attacks where deception is a core tenet of the event.

This characteristic makes the task of traffic identification not a straightforward process. Besides that, encrypted data is being widely used by applications and protocols. There are several methods for classifying network traffic such as known ports and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), but they are not effective since many applications constantly randomize their ports and the payload could be encrypted. This paper proposes a hybrid model that makes use of a classifier based on computational intelligence, the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), along with Feature Selection (FS) and Multi-objective Genetic Algorithms (MOGA) to classify computer network traffic without making use of the payload or port information. The proposed model presented good results when evaluated against the UNIBS data set, using four performance metrics: Recall, Precision, Flow Accuracy and Byte Accuracy, with most rates exceeding 90%. Besides that, presented the best features and feature selection algorithm for the given problem along with the best ELM parameters.","2161-4393;21614393","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6627-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-1484-5; POD:978-1-4799-1482-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889935","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889935","","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Genetic algorithms;Measurement;Optimization;Ports (Computers);Protocols","Internet;computer network security;cryptography;feature selection;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;protocols;telecommunication traffic","DPI;ELM parameters;Internet;MOGA;UNIBS data set;byte accuracy;computational intelligence;computer network traffic classification;deep packet inspection;encrypted data;extreme learning machine;feature selection algorithm;flow accuracy;hybrid model;machine learning techniques;multiobjective genetic algorithms;multiobjective optimization;payload encryption;precision;protocols;recall;traffic identification","","0","","35","","","6-11 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Early and accurate plant stress detection is imperative in enabling timely and appropriate intervention. One major limitation of prior work is that, in general, only a few key inflection points of a localized section of a chlorophyll fluorescence signal are used to calculate single index values. These values yield very limited insight into stress level or type. In this paper, we present a method for plant stress classification that uses global (versus local) ChlF time-varying signal data acquired via imaging. We classify this time-varying-intensity-signal using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). While HMMs have been used in other fields, in this paper we present their first application in the field of plant stress clustering and classification. We show how the proposed selection of a low-pass filtered plant's entire chlorophyll fluorescence signal profile, as a global feature selection, improves the accuracy of plant stress classification. Additionally, we show how the rate of change-in-time of the plant ChlF intensity time-varying profiles further improves the plant stress classification accuracy. Finally, we present experimental results to show the value and potential of the proposed method to enable more accurate and specific classification of plant stressor levels and stressor types.","2377-9314;23779314","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-2613-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-2614-5; POD:978-1-4799-2615-2","10.1109/CIVEMSA.2014.6841442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841442","Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging;Clustering;Computational Intelligence;Digital Image Processing;Hidden Markov Models;Machine Learning;OJIP Transient;PSMT Transient;Pattern Representation and Classification/Recognition;Plant Stress;Unsupervised Learning","Accuracy;Chemicals;Fluorescence;Hidden Markov models;Nitrogen;Stress;Transient analysis","botany;hidden Markov models;image classification;pattern clustering;unsupervised learning","HMM;chlorophyll fluorescence signal profile;global ChlF time-varying signal data;global feature selection;hidden Markov models;imaged chlorophyll fluorescence profiles;inflection point;intensity time-varying profiles;low-pass filtered plant;plant response;plant stress classification accuracy;plant stress clustering;plant stress detection;plant stress levels;time-varying-intensity-signal;unsupervised machine learning","","2","","31","","","5-7 May 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in-field chip health monitoring is essential to track workload-induced variations at runtime in a per-chip basis. There exist a variety of monitoring circuits to track the delay changes of different on-chip components. However, existing techniques either need to stop normal execution of the chip or introduce a significant overhead unless they are carefully placed for very selective locations. Another challenge is to infer the information regarding the health of every critical paths of the chip with limited information obtained by the monitoring system. We address these challenges in this work using a representative path-selection technique based on machine learning.

We propose a manifold regularized multiple kernel machines to use the manifold regularization term to explore the inner geometry distribution of data. In fact, there are some real datasets being embedded in low dimensional manifold being undeveloped or hard to be seen. So adding the manifold regularization term to the original MKL is based on the assumption that the data geometrical distribution information may help to get a proper learning machine performance. We use properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), Representer Theorem and Laplacian Graph method to provide theoretical basis for the algorithm. In experiments, classification accuracies of the algorithm and its ability to represent potential low dimensional manifold are given.

In this paper, we evaluate this technique for measuring HR in a controlled situation, in a naturalistic computer interaction session, and in an exercise situation. For comparison, HR was measured simultaneously using an electrocardiography device during all sessions. The results replicated the published results in controlled situations, but show that they cannot yet be considered as a valid measure of HR in naturalistic human-computer interaction.

Our proposed exploration method makes use of a standard simulated annealer to generate a training set, and uses this set to implement a decision tree. Based on the outcome of the decision tree, the algorithm fixes the synthesis directives (pragmas) which contribute to minimizing/maximizing one of the cost function objectives and continues the annealing procedure using the decision tree.

A psychological wellness index integrates the survey results that measure stress, depression, anger, and fatigue. The current model is based on a multiple regression method and manually constructs a cause and effect model of the psychological wellness. However, this constructed model depends upon the survey responses. The relationship between these survey responses and psychological wellness indices are not linear due to data imbalance. When any data inconsistency exists, the reliability of the model decreases and eventually cost of maintenance on model revision increases. Also, when new variables or data entries are considered, the entire model should be constructed again. This paper examines the feasibility of machine learning algorithms to predict the psychological wellness indices based on the reconstructed responses.

Learning and optimization techniques are used to adjust the membership function of each fuzzy set. One interesting research issue is a comparison between interval partitions and fuzzy partitions. We address this issue by using an entropy-based interval discretization method in hybrid fuzzy genetics-based machine learning (GBML).

This information can be perceived by computational systems. In this work, we show that early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is possible solely from the voice signal. This is in contrast to earlier work in which we showed that this can be done using hand-calculated features of the speech (such as formants) as annotated by professional speech therapists. In this paper, we review that work and show that a differential diagnosis can be produced directly from the analog speech signal itself. In addition, differentiation can be made between seven different degrees of progression of the disease (including healthy). Such a system can act as an additional stage (or another building block) in a bigger system of natural speech processing. For example it could be used in automatic speech recognition systems that are used as personal assistants (such as Iphones' Siri, Google Voice), or as natural man-machine interfaces. We also conjecture that such systems can be extended to monitoring and classifying additional neurological diseases and speech pathologies. The methods presented here use a combination of signal processing features and machine learning techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4432-3; POD:978-1-4799-4431-6","10.1109/SWSTE.2014.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6887541","Classification;Machine Learning;Natural Speech Analysis;Parkinsons disease;Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Acoustics;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Parkinson's disease;Speech;Support vector machines","diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;natural language processing;patient diagnosis;speech processing","automatic speech recognition systems;computational diagnosis;computational systems;differential diagnosis;human voice signal;linguistic semantic information;machine learning techniques;natural speech;natural speech processing;neurological diseases;parkinson disease;signal processing features;speech pathologies;speech therapists;voice signal","","3","","21","","","11-12 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Period Segmentation for Wrist Pulse Signal Based on Adaptive Cascade Thresholding and Machine Learning","D. Wang; G. Lu","Grad.

The quantized pulse diagnosis by using the signal processing and pattern recognition technology is introduced to take over the traditional subjective judgments in recent years, and it's attracting more and more attention. However, the previous researches with pulse pre-processing mainly concentrate on the denoising and baseline wander correction procedure. The evaluation criterion isn't associated with the feature analysis, and the performance with shape classification doesn't give any contributions to the pulse diagnosis. Moreover, the signals are processed in a simulated environment by adding disturbance manually. In this paper, we propose a period segmentation method based on adaptive cascade thresholding and machine learning for extracting the information within single period. It's a novel pre-processing stage and the pulse data collected in real conditions for practical usage is analyzed. The experiments show that our method is significant in the pulse pre-processing stage and improves the accuracy for the disease classification between healthy subjects and diabetes.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4014-1; Electronic:978-1-4799-4013-4; POD:978-1-4799-4012-7","10.1109/ICMB.2014.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6845826","adaptive cascade thresholding;machine learning;period segmentation;signal normalization","Accuracy;Conferences;Diabetes;Encoding;Medical diagnostic imaging;Standards;Wrist","diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;signal classification;signal denoising","adaptive cascade thresholding;baseline wander correction procedure;denoising;diabetes;disease classification;feature analysis;information extraction;machine learning;pattern recognition technology;period segmentation;period segmentation method;physical health indicator;pulse data collection;pulse preprocessing;pulse preprocessing stage;quantized pulse diagnosis;signal processing;simulated environment;traditional Chinese medicine;traditional subjective judgments;wrist pulse signal","","2","","13","","","May 30 2014-June 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Classifiers such as the Gaussian Mixture model (GMM), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), support vector machine (SVM), and AdaBoost are analyzed for classifying retinopathy lesions from nonlesions. GMM and kNN classifiers are found to be the best classifiers for bright and red lesion classification, respectively. A main contribution of this paper is the reduction in the number of features used for lesion classification by feature ranking using Adaboost where 30 top features are selected out of 78. A novel two-step hierarchical classification approach is proposed where the nonlesions or false positives are rejected in the first step. In the second step, the bright lesions are classified as hard exudates and cotton wool spots, and the red lesions are classified as hemorrhages and micro-aneurysms. This lesion classification problem deals with unbalanced datasets and SVM or combination classifiers derived from SVM using the Dempster-Shafer theory are found to incur more classification error than the GMM and kNN classifiers due to the data imbalance. The DR severity grading system is tested on 1200 images from the publicly available MESSIDOR dataset. The DREAM system achieves 100% sensitivity, 53.16% specificity, and 0.904 AUC, compared to the best reported 96% sensitivity, 51% specificity, and 0.875 AUC, for classifying images as with or without DR.

Bewley diagrams are observed for the traveling wave patterns and the wavelet coefficients of the aerial mode voltage are used to locate the fault. The transient simulation for different fault types and locations are obtained by ATP using frequency-dependent line and cable models.

In search of practical methods, researchers have considered the use of currently deployed 802.11 networks as the basis of positioning, adopting Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as the standard distance measure. However, attempts at accurate localization have failed due to reliance on heavily distorted power measurements acquired on saturated 2.4 and increasingly crowded 5 GHz channels. In this paper, A Dual Source-Observation Weighted Localization method is proposed as a solution to the Wi-Fi positioning problem, estimating user position through Tikhonov Regularization Cost Functional Minimization. This novel solution combines a) Weighted Kernel Ridge Regression (WKRR), and b) Weighted Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernels to develop an algorithm which increases estimation accuracy by up to 1/4 meter compared to the current leading localization technology, Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors (WKNN), and substantially reduces error variance, due to the dual Empirical Loss, Complexity objective.","1934-5070;19345070","Electronic:978-1-4799-1297-1; POD:978-1-4799-1295-7","10.1109/WTS.2014.6835033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6835033","","Distortion measurement;Fingerprint recognition;Global Positioning System;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Kernel;Training","Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;distance measurement;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);radial basis function networks;wireless LAN","802.11 networks;GPS signals;IOT;Internet of Things;RBF Kernel;RSSI;WKNN;WKRR;Wi-Fi positioning;dual source-observation weighted localization method;empirical loss;frequency 2.4 GHz;frequency 5 GHz;global positioning system;high resolution position information;indoor applications;location based services;location estimation;machine learning based localization;received signal strength indicator;source-observation weighted fingerprinting;standard distance measure;weighted K-nearest neighbors;weighted Kernel ridge regression;weighted radial basis function","","0","1","","","","9-11 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The evaluation involves a modern kernel method and compares performance of three feature representations and three kernel functions. Both the force regression and movement classification problems can be learned successfully when using a nonlinear kernel function, while the exp- χ<sup>2</sup> kernel outperforms the more popular radial basis function kernel in all cases. Furthermore, combining surface electromyography and accelerometry in a multimodal classifier results in significant increases in accuracy as compared to when either modality is used individually. Since window-based classification accuracy should not be considered in isolation to estimate prosthetic controllability, we also provide results in terms of classification mistakes and prediction delay. To this extent, we propose the movement error rate as an alternative to the standard window-based accuracy. This error rate is insensitive to prediction delays and it allows us therefore to quantify mistakes and delays as independent performance characteristics. This type of analysis confirms that the inclusion of accelerometry is superior, as it results in fewer mistakes while at the same time reducing prediction delay.","1534-4320;15344320","","10.1109/TNSRE.2014.2303394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728705","Electromyography;machine learning;prosthetics","Accuracy;Delays;Electrodes;Error analysis;Force;Kernel;Thumb","biomechanics;electromyography;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;prosthetics;regression analysis;signal classification","DOF force activations;EMG-based hand movement classillcation problems;accelerometry;accelerometry inclusion;dexterity;discrete hand movements;exp-χ<sup>2</sup> kernel outperforms;force regression;independent performance characteristics;iteration;large-scale benchmark evaluation;machine learning methods;modern kernel method;movement error rate;multimodal classifier;myoelectric prostheses;ninapro database;nonlinear kernel function;radial basis kernel function;standard window-based accuracy;surface electromyography data;time reducing prediction delay;window-based classification accuracy","0","16","","36","","20140129","July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

More and more CCTVs and surveillance cameras are being installed everyday. If there is a database of facial data present then the task of recognition boils down to comparison of each and every face detected from the video with every face saved in the database. Now this process involves capturing the faces before hand. This is actually a very tedious job. So the database of images is created (/updated) as and when new faces come into the camera view. The labeling of the faces can be done at leisure (by a human) or not be done at all. The current system once deployed does not need a database of images to start with. It creates its own collection of images, and then tracks the future occurrences of those images. Eigenface, fisherface, LBP histograms and SURF are different algorithms used for face recognition. We have tried all these algorithms.but among these surf shows better result.

Using the newly proposed ten subtypes of breast cancer, we hypothesize that machine learning techniques offer many benefits for selecting the most informative biomarkers. Unlike existing gene selection approaches, in this study, a hierarchical classification approach is used that selects genes and builds the classifier concurrently.

Over the years several methodologies have been proposed in the literature. In the past couple of decades, two or three methods have been the predominant means of object recognition; namely Principal Component Analysis, Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis, and correlation. Considering that a human can easily differentiate between different objects even when the objects are partially obscured, a machine, on the other hand, has greater difficulty in differentiating between objects, even when they are un-obscured. There is important information within a given image that determines the type of object the image contains. This paper presents the usage of a 2-sample statistical t-test as a feature-reduction method to choose those feature pixels of a given image that may be more important and significant than others, and their ordering by order of significance based on a proposed performance criterion metric. The aim is to study the effect of selecting significant feature pixels on the recognition accuracy of the above-mentioned three most popular and widely used object recognition methods. We also introduce a performance criterion that we denote by saturation to evaluate the robustness of the classification/prediction accuracy of these classification methods. We show here that the use of the 2-sample t-test to choose feature pixels and reorganizing these chosen features based upon proposed performance criterion metrics results in many instances in enhancing and stabilizing the recognition results.

This is insured by performing data anonymization as required by legislation. In this context, many different anonymization techniques have been proposed in the literature. These methods are usually specific to a particular de-anonymization procedure-or attack-one wants to avoid, and to a particular known set of characteristics that have to be preserved after the anonymization. They are difficult to use in a general context where attacks can be of different types, and where measures are not known to the anonymizer. The paper proposes a novel approach for automatically finding an anonymization procedure given a set of possible attacks and a set of measures to preserve. The approach is generic and based on machine learning techniques. It allows us to learn directly an anonymization function from a set of training data so as to optimize a trade off between privacy risk and utility loss. The algorithm thus allows one to get a good anonymization procedure for any kind of attacks, and any characteristic in a given set.

However, the performance of existing IDSs does not seem to be satisfactory due to the rapid evolution of sophisticated cyber threats in recent decades. Moreover, the volumes of data to be analyzed are beyond the ability of commonly used computer software and hardware tools. They are not only large in scale but fast in/out in terms of velocity. In big data IDS, the one must find an efficient way to reduce the size of data dimensions and volumes. In this paper, we propose novel feature selection methods, namely, RF-FSR (Random Forest-Forward Selection Ranking) and RF-BER (Random Forest-Backward Elimination Ranking).

Here, feature selection is performed using random forests to avoid over-fitting. Thereafter, the extreme learning machine is employed to effectively integrate these hybrid features for predicting hot spots in protein interfaces. By the 5-fold cross validation in the training set, their method can achieve accuracy (ACC) of 82.1% and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.459, and outperforms some alternative machine learning methods in the comparison study. Furthermore, their method achieves ACC of 76.8% and MCC of 0.401 in the independent test set, and is more effective than the major existing hot spot predictors.

This necessitates the development of diagnostic tests that can determine bacterial susceptibility. For Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), this is particularly urgent given that current methods for testing susceptibility take up to two months. The decreasing cost and time required for whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers the possibility of using genome-wide mutational patterns in bacterial DNA to determine drug susceptibility. However, the computational framework for taking advantage of this data has not yet been developed. This paper describes a machine-learning approach for predicting bacterial susceptibility from genomic data. The presence or absence of over 500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in a dataset of 652 bacterial isolates from the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust and elsewhere in the UK were used as features for a number of classification algorithms. Susceptibility and resistance were defined based upon phenotypic growth patterns, and the results from the proposed machine learning method were compared to predictions based upon the presence of a set of known resistance-conferring mutations. Misclassified isolates were also examined for commonalities, revealing eleven potentially new resistance-conferring mutations. The prediction of drug susceptibility using the proposed approach was very promising. Classification accuracy of 93% was obtained for predicting resistance to isoniazid, a key first-line antibiotic drug for MTB. The proposed method was capable of particularly high sensitivity, ranging between 95-100% across the four drugs examined. There is great potential to further develop this framework to find new resistance-conferring mutations.","2168-2194;21682194","Electronic:978-1-4799-2131-7; POD:978-1-4799-2132-4","10.1109/BHI.2014.6864440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6864440","","Bioinformatics;Drugs;Genomics;Immune system;Microorganisms;Resistance;Support vector machines","DNA;antibacterial activity;diseases;drugs;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;microorganisms;molecular biophysics;polymorphism","Mycobacterium tuberculosis;antibacterial susceptibility prediction;antibiotic resistance;bacterial DNA;computational framework;drug susceptibility prediction;genome-wide mutational patterns;machine learning method;pathogens;single nucleotide polymorphisms;time 2 month;whole genome sequencing","","3","","7","","","1-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For searching a particular document from the web or any large document collection text or document categorization is most useful task. We demand some better system and enhanced machine learning classifiers to accomplish task of document categorization. We designed a multi-agent based system that consists of some software hybrid agents that obtains the category of a document and interact with each other to take final decision about the category and then data is fed to a machine learning classifier in order to enhance the performance. We analyzed the results of the system in form of performance measures such as accuracy, recall, precision and true negative rate. We analyzed the result in two scenarios: one is with decision of agents alone and another is with application of reinforcement clustering technique neural network. We observed that in first scenario the system's accuracy, precision and true negative rate is very good and recall measure is significantly good. After the application of reinforcement clustering technique there is no significant change in system's performance instead the recall is degraded. But still the system is producing good results in both scenarios.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-5171-0; Electronic:978-1-4799-5173-4; POD:978-1-4799-5174-1","10.1109/IC3.2014.6897239","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6897239","agent;machine learning;neural network;text categorization","Accuracy;Equations;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Neural networks;Probability;Text categorization","Internet;document handling;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;neural nets;pattern classification;pattern clustering","Web documents;document categorization;machine learning classifier;multiagent system;neural network;reinforcement clustering","","0","","10","","","7-9 Aug. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to predict defect-prone software components would be valuable. Consequently, there have been many empirical studies to evaluate the performance of different techniques endeavouring to accomplish this effectively. However no one technique dominates and so designing a reliable defect prediction model remains problematic. Objective. We seek to make sense of the many conflicting experimental results and understand which factors have the largest effect on predictive performance. Method. We conduct a meta-analysis of all relevant, high quality primary studies of defect prediction to determine what factors influence predictive performance. This is based on 42 primary studies that satisfy our inclusion criteria that collectively report 600 sets of empirical prediction results. By reverse engineering a common response variable we build a random effects ANOVA model to examine the relative contribution of four model building factors (classifier, data set, input metrics and researcher group) to model prediction performance. Results. Surprisingly we find that the choice of classifier has little impact upon performance (1.3 percent) and in contrast the major (31 percent) explanatory factor is the researcher group. It matters more who does the work than what is done. Conclusion. To overcome this high level of researcher bias, defect prediction researchers should (i) conduct blind analysis, (ii) improve reporting protocols and (iii) conduct more intergroup studies in order to alleviate expertise issues. Lastly, research is required to determine whether this bias is prevalent in other applications domains.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2014.2322358","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6824804","Software defect prediction;meta-analysis;researcher bias","Buildings;Correlation;Data models;Measurement;Predictive models;Software;Software engineering","learning (artificial intelligence);object-oriented programming;reverse engineering;software metrics;software performance evaluation;statistical analysis","blind analysis;classifier factor;common response variable;data set factor;defect-prone software component prediction;input metrics factor;intergroup studies;machine learning;model building factors;performance evaluation;random effects ANOVA model;reporting protocol improvement;researcher bias;researcher group factor;reverse engineering;software defect prediction","","28","","53","","20140603","June 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One critical factor for successful GSD projects is the allocation of tasks as project managers not only need to consider their workforce but also need to take into the account the characteristics of the geographically distributed sites and their relationships. In this paper, we present a task allocation model based on neural network that identifies a fit site for a given task and then finds related sites to the fit site.

An emerging and promising trend in this regard is the development of solutions that aim at maximizing the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end users. However, predicting the QoE perceived by the users in different conditions remains a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to support QoE-based Video Admission Control (VAC) and Resource Management (RM) algorithms. More specifically, we develop a learning system that can automatically extract the quality-rate characteristics of unknown video sequences from the size of H.264-encoded video frames. Our approach combines unsupervised feature learning with supervised classification techniques, thereby providing an efficient and scalable way to estimate the QoE parameters that characterize each video. This QoE characterization is then used to manage simultaneous video transmissions through a shared channel in order to guarantee a minimum quality level to the final users. Simulation results show that the proposed learning-based QoE classification of video sequences outperforms commonly deployed off-line video analysis techniques and that the QoE-based VAC and RM algorithms outperform standard content-agnostic strategies.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5258-8; POD:978-1-4799-5259-5; USB:978-1-4799-5257-1","10.1109/MedHocNet.2014.6849102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6849102","","Ad hoc networks;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile communication;Polynomials;Streaming media;Video sequences","cellular radio;quality of experience;resource allocation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication control;unsupervised learning;video coding;wireless channels","H.264-encoded video frames;QoE-based VAC;QoE-based video admission control;cellular networks;end users;machine learning;quality of experience;quality-rate characteristics;resource allocation;resource management;supervised classification;unknown video sequences;unsupervised feature learning;video traffic;video transmissions;wireless systems","","9","","26","","","2-4 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Distinguishing mucinous cystic neoplasm from serous oligocystic adenoma by using cross-sectional imaging system is very important for patients' prognosis. Gemstone spectral computed tomography (CT) can provide more information as compared with the conventional CT. Machine-learning algorithms have been employed in a great variety of applications. This preliminary study aims to verify the effectiveness of the additional information provided by spectral CT with the use of the state-of-the-art classification algorithm combined with feature-selection methods. Results show that SVM+MI achieves the highest classification accuracy (71.43%). The second highest classification accuracy is obtained by using SVM+LO (63.83%). Features selected by these algorithms are consistent with clinical observations.

In smart grid, the overall monitoring costs will be decreased but at the same time, the risk of cyber attacks might be increased. Recently a new type of attacks (called the stealth attack) has been introduced, which cannot be detected by the bad data detection using state estimation. In this paper, we show how normal operations of power networks can be statistically distinguished from the case under stealthy attacks. We devise two machine learning based techniques for stealthy attack detection. The first method utilizes supervised learning over labeled data and trains a support vector machine. The second method requires no training data and detects the deviation in measurement In both methods, principle component analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data to be processed, and thus leads to lower computation complexities. The results of the proposed detection methods on the IEEE standard test systems demonstrate effectiveness of both schemes.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4799-1353-4; POD:978-1-4799-1351-0; USB:978-1-4799-1352-7","10.1109/GLOCOM.2013.6831172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6831172","","Measurement uncertainty;Optimization;Training;Zirconium","distribution networks;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;principal component analysis;security of data;smart power grids;support vector machines;transmission networks","IEEE standard test systems;bad data detection;cyber attacks;industrial customers;machine learning;next generation power system;overall monitoring costs;policy makers;power industries;power networks;principle component analysis;residential customers;smart grid;state estimation;stealth attack;stealthy false data injection detection;supervised learning;support vector machine","","6","","20","","","9-13 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method combines machine learning with a Kalman filter to estimate instantaneous positions of a moving target. The target's accelerations, along with information from the network, are used to obtain an accurate estimation of its position. To this end, radio-fingerprints of received signal strength indicators (RSSIs) are first collected over the surveillance area. The obtained database is then used with machine learning algorithms to compute a model that estimates the position of the target using only RSSI information. This model leads to a first position estimate of the target under investigation. The kernel-based ridge regression and the vector-output regularized least squares are used in the learning process. The Kalman filter is used afterward to combine predictions of the target's positions based on acceleration information with the first estimates, leading to more accurate ones. The performance of the method is studied for different scenarios and a thorough comparison with well-known algorithms is also provided.","1530-437X;1530437X","","10.1109/JSEN.2014.2332098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6841003","Kalman filter;RSSI;Radio-fingerprinting;machine learning;target tracking;wireless sensor networks","Acceleration;Covariance matrices;Mathematical model;Sensors;State-space methods;Target tracking;Vectors","Kalman filters;learning (artificial intelligence);target tracking;wireless sensor networks","Kalman filter;kernel-based ridge regression;machine learning algorithms;radio-fingerprints;received signal strength indicators;target tracking;vector-output regularized least squares;wireless sensor networks","","7","","33","","20140620","Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The sampling method is activated when the imbalance level of the training set is higher than a preset value during iteration of the active learning. The effect of the imbalance problem is reduced. Experimental results show the active learning method with the proposed re-sampling method scarifies the true negative rate to achieve higher true positive rate, which is more important in person re-identification.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890362","Person re-identification;active learning;re-sampling;surveillance","Abstracts;Cameras;Image segmentation;Pattern matching;Support vector machines;Surveillance","image classification;image sampling;iterative methods;support vector machines;video surveillance","active learning method;classifier;imbalance dataset problem;irrelevant images;iteration;multicamera surveillance system;over-sampling method;person re-identification;re-sampling method;support vector machine;targeted images;under-sampling method","","0","","15","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
