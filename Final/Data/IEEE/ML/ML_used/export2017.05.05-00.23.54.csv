In this paper, we present a new cluster ensemble approach named as the neural gas based cluster ensemble algorithm (NGCEA) for class discovery from biological meaningful data, NGCEA first adopts the perturbed function to generate a set of new datasets. Then, it proposes to adopt the neural gas algorithm to obtain the clustering solutions from the perturbed datasets, In the following, NGCEA views the row of each clustering solution as the new features, and forms a new dataset. Finally, it adopts the neural gas algorithm as consensus function to perform clustering again on the new dataset and obtains the final result. The experiments in cancer datasets show that (i) NGCEA works well on most of cancer datasets (ii) NGCEA outperforms most of the state-of-the-art cluster ensemble algorithms when applied to gene expression data.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016705","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016705","Cancer data;Class discovery;Cluster ensemble","Argon;Biology","bioinformatics;cancer;genetic algorithms;genetics;pattern clustering;perturbation techniques","NGCEA;bioinformatics;biological meaningful data;cancer data;class discovery;clustering solutions;consensus function;gene expression data;neural gas algorithm;neural gas based cluster ensemble algorithm;pattern recognition;perturbed datasets;perturbed function","","2","","18","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In other words, the acceleration of the spherical wheel will seriously affect the attitude of the robot body. It implies that the constant speed control of the spherical wheel with zero tilt can be achieved by zero acceleration.

Initially, a self-developed color optical sensing module and a colorimeter were used to measure the colors of LED pixels. After the color matching functions from the collected data was corrected by least-squares approximation method, the calibrated measured sensing module was applied to inspect the color characteristics of LED modules. And the chrominance and luminance data are well analyzed to perform a white light chrominance correction and luminance uniformity compensation for LED display modules.

The feature circle energy (FCE) distribution map of the whole image is therefore obtained and the local maxima are corresponding to the centers of potential circles. For the detection of radius, the gradient magnitudes in assigned region are accumulated and its variation defined as the feature circle radius (FCR) is computed who has maximum when the radius of the region is equal to that of the circle. Synthetic images and natural images are used to test the capability of the proposed method.

Thus, to reduce the complexity for searching phase weight vector and to improve the PAPR statistics, we introduce the DE, an effective algorithm that solves various combinatorial optimization problems, to search the optimal phase weight factors. The simulation results show that the proposed DE-based PTS obtains the excellent PAPR performance with a low computational complexity.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016873","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016873","Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing;Partial transmit sequence and differential evolution;Peak-to-average power ratio reduction","Complexity theory;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Optimization;Partial transmit sequences;Peak to average power ratio","OFDM modulation;computational complexity;evolutionary computation;search problems;stochastic programming;vectors","OFDM system;PAPR reduction;PAPR statistics;combinatorial optimization problem;computational complexity;continuous space;differential evolution;high-dimensional vector space;optimal phase weight factors searching;orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system;partial transmit sequences scheme;peak-to-average power ratio reduction;phase weight vector searching;population-based stochastic search technique;stochastic optimization technique","","1","","20","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first layer is for document representation, which is based on topic model latent dirichlet allocation. The second one is for document clustering, which is on the basis of Markov cluster algorithm. The last layer is for topic words generation. Using this method, information in blogosphere, such as blog posts, can be organized in terms of topic. A topic is expressed by a list of topic words. Empirical study on real-world blog site CSDN shows that the proposed method is effective.

This approach provides a significant preprocessing step while computer vision is perceiving digital-world information through a computer screen. To segment the display region, a closed contour between the screen frame and display region should be found first in our approach, in which a grayscale image containing the whole screen area is required. Because of some inherent characteristics embedded in a computer screen image, a mean-C adaptive thresholding algorithm is used to obtain a binarized image that contains the wanted closed-contour boundary. Then a parallel thinning algorithm is applied to reduce the thickness of the closed contour to be 1-pixel wide. Finally, our closed-contour tracking algorithm is used to perform the display region segmentation. Experiments confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6017009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017009","Computer vision;Contour tracking;Image segmentation;Thinning","Computer vision;Computers;Cybernetics;Gray-scale;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Machine learning","computer displays;computer vision;image segmentation;object tracking;screens (display)","closed-contour boundary;closed-contour tracking;computer screen;computer screen image;computer vision;display region segmentation;mean-C adaptive thresholding algorithm","","0","","7","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, on-line new event detection system determines whether the incoming document contains a new event based on the history of all processed documents. With the improvement of processed documents, the efficiency of on-line new event detection will decrease. In this paper, we apply a time window strategy to new event detection. A group of new incoming documents in the time window are firstly clustered to obtain candidate topics. Next, these candidate topics are compared with the previously identified topics to determine whether a new topic is detected. The first story of the new detected topic, in temporal order, is regarded as a new event. By analyzing the news story documents within the time window in group, the new event detection efficiency is improved. Furthermore, the evaluations show that the time window processing strategy is helpful to improve the accuracy of new event detection.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016957","Clustering;New Event Detection;Time Window","Clustering algorithms;Cybernetics;Event detection;Machine learning;Real time systems;Time frequency analysis;Vocabulary","Internet;document handling;pattern clustering","news story document processing;on-line new event detection;temporally-ordered stream;time window strategy","","1","","14","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
