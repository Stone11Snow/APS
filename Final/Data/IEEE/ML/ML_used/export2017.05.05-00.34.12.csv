Our method extends the concept of clustering stability to a concept of hierarchical stability. The method chooses a model for the data based on analysis of clustering stability; it then analyzes the stability of each component in the estimated model and chooses a stable model for this component. It continues this recursive stability analysis until all the estimated components are unimodal. In so doing, the method is able to handle hierarchical and symmetric data that existing stability-based algorithms have difficulty with. We test our algorithm on both synthetic datasets and real world datasets.

To test the hypothesis, we trained a BN and SVM model for 2 year survival on 322 lung cancer patients and compared their performance in three separate external datasets (35, 47, 33 patients), each with their own characteristics in terms of missing data. The models used tumor size, clinical T and N stage, involved lymph nodes and WHO performance as prognostic features. We found that the BN model performed better than SVM (AUC 0.77, 0.72. 0.70 vs. 0.71, 0.68, 0.69), especially if tumor size was missing.

In this paper, we investigate the use of moments features on Kannada Kagunita. Kannada characters are curved in nature with some kind of symmetric structure observed in the shape. This information can be best extracted as a feature if we extract moment features from the directional images. To recognize a Kagunita, we need to identify the vowel and the consonant present in the image. So we are finding 4 directional images using Gabor wavelets from the dynamically preprocessed original image. We analyze the Kagunita set and identify the regions with vowel information and consonant information and cut these portions from the preprocessed original image and form a set of cut images. We then extract moments features from them. These features are trained and tested for both vowel and Kagunita recognition on Multi Layer Perceptron with Back Propagation Neural Network. The recognition results for vowels is average 85% and consonants is 59% when tested on separate test data with moments features from directional images and cut images.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460756","Gabor directional images;Kannada;Neural Network;handwriting character recognition;moments;preprocessing","Character recognition;Data mining;Feature extraction;Handwriting recognition;Image analysis;Image recognition;Information analysis;Shape;Speech recognition;Testing","backpropagation;feature extraction;handwritten character recognition;multilayer perceptrons;natural language processing;neural nets;wavelet transforms","Gabor wavelets;Indian languages;Kannada characters;backpropagation neural network;consonant information;cut images;directional images;feature extraction;handwriting character recognition;handwritten Kannada Kagunita recognition;multilayer perceptron;vowel information;vowel recognition","","1","","8","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The training part of CDF-MA has two main components: context extraction and algorithm fusion. In context extraction, the features used by the distinct algorithms are combined and clustered into groups of similar contexts. The algorithm fusion component embeds a variation of the MCE/GPD method to assigns an aggregation weight to each algorithm based on its loss function within each context.

The originality of ECON is that it automatically tunes the parameters of the features while riding the regularization path. So, ECON has the unique ability to produce optimally tuned features for each value of the constant of regularization. We illustrate the remarkable experimental performance of ECON on standard benchmark datasets; we also present a novel application of machine learning in the field of computer graphics, namely the approximation of photometric solids.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.61","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381823","application in computer graphics;automatic kernel parameter tuning;kernel method;l1 regularization;non parametric regression;regression;sparse regression;supervised classification;supervised learning","Application software;Approximation algorithms;Computer graphics;Europe;Kernel;Machine learning;Photometry;Pursuit algorithms;Solids;Tellurium","computer graphics;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;photometry;regression analysis","ECON algorithm;automatic feature parameter tuning;computer graphics;equicorrelation network;kernel basis pursuit algorithm;kernelized LARS-like algorithm;machine learning;photometric solids approximation;regression;regularization constant value;regularization path;sparse estimator;supervised classification","","0","","18","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a method called ""RBDT-1""- rule based decision tree - for learning a decision tree from a set of decision rules that cover the data instances rather than from the data instances themselves. RBDT-1 method uses a set of declarative rules as an input for generating a decision tree. The method's goal is to create on-demand a short and accurate decision tree from a stable or dynamically changing set of rules. We conduct a comparative study of RBDT-1 with three existing decision tree methods based on different problems. The outcome of the study shows that RBDT-1 performs better than AQDT-1 and AQDT-2 which are methods that create decision trees from rules and than ID3 which generates decision trees from data examples, in terms of tree complexity number of nodes and leaves in the decision tree.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.25","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381350","attribute selection criteria;data-based decision tree;decision rules;rule-based decision tree;tree complexity.","Application software;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Data mining;Databases;Decision making;Decision trees;Electronic mail;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms","data analysis;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence)","RBDT-1 rule based decision tree;data instance;decision rules;decision tree generation;decision tree learning;declarative rules","","6","","9","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

During Q-learning, an agent makes action selections in an effort to maximize a reward signal obtained from the environment. Based on reward, agent will make changes in its policy for future actions. The problem considered in this paper is the overestimation of expected value of cumulative future discounted rewards. This discounted reward is used in evaluating agent actions and policy during reinforcement learning. Due to the overestimation of discounted reward action evaluation and policy changes are not accurate. The solution to this problem results from a form Q-learning algorithm using a combination of approximation spaces and Q-learning to estimate the expected value of returns on actions. This is made possible by considering behavior patterns of an agent in scope of approximation spaces. The framework provided by an approximation space makes it possible to measure the degree that agent behaviors are a part of (''covered by'') a set of accepted agent behaviors that serve as a behavior evaluation norm.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.38","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460718","Approximate Q-learning Algorithm;Overestimation of Q-Values;Q-learning Algorithm;Reinforcement Learning","Approximation algorithms;Computer science;Extraterrestrial measurements;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Optimization methods;Paper technology;Set theory;State estimation","learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory","Q-learning algorithm;Zdzislaw Pawlak;behavior patterns;reinforcement learning;reward action evaluation;rough set theory","","3","","11","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The results show that out of the eight implementations, SVM<sub>lin</sub> and Proximal SVM perform better in terms of consistent performance and reduced training time.

First, the PNLMF (proportionate NLMF) algorithm is derived, then Krylov subspace projection technique is applied to the PNLMF algorithm to obtain the KPNLMF algorithm. While fully exploiting the fast convergence property of the PNLMF algorithm, the system to be identified does not need to be sparse in the KPNLMF algorithm due to the Krylov subspace projection technique. In our simulations, the KPNLMF algorithm converges faster than the KPNLMS algorithm when both algorithms converge to the same system mismatch value. The KPNLMF algorithm achieves this without any increase in the computational complexity. Further numerical examples comparing the KPNLMF with the NLMF and the KPNLMS algorithms support the fast convergence of the KPNLMF algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.47","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381493","Krylov subspaces;NLMF;proportional update","Adaptive filters;Convergence;Dispersion;Filtering algorithms;Least squares approximation;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Minimization methods;Signal processing algorithms;System identification","adaptive filters;computational complexity;convergence;least squares approximations","Krylov proportionate normalized least mean fourth algorithm;Krylov proportionate normalized least mean square algorithm;NLMF algorithm;adaptive filtering algorithm;computational complexity;convergence;dispersive system;nonsparse system;proportionate Krylov subspace projections","","1","","5","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article first points out a shortcoming of the SVM approach for the structured prediction; an efficient formulation is then presented to overcome the problem. The proposed algorithm exploits the fact that both the minimum and the maximum of quantities of interest are often efficiently computable even though quantities such as mean, median and variance may not be.

The available data is often noisy and may contain outliers, which requires the application of global optimization. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA's) are one class of possible global optimization methods for solving such problems. Within population based EA's, Differential Evolution (DE) is a widely used and successful algorithm. However, due to its differential update nature, given a current population, the set of possible new populations is finite and a true subset of the cost function domain. Furthermore, the update formula of DE does not use any information about the fitnesses of the population. This paper presents a novel extension of DE called Randomized and Rank based Differential Evolution (R2DE) to improve robustness and global convergence speed on multimodal problems by introducing two multiplicative terms in the DE update formula. The first term is based on a random variate of a Cauchy distribution, which leads to a randomization. The second term is based on ranking of individuals, so that R2DE exploits additional information provided by the fitnesses. In experiments including non-linear dimension reduction by autoencoders, it is shown that R2DE improves robustness and speed of global convergence.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.29","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381804","Cauchy distribution;Differential Evolution;Evolutionary optimization;Ranking","Automatic control;Convergence;Cost function;Evolutionary computation;Genetic mutations;Inverse problems;Machine learning;Optimization methods;Proposals;Robustness","evolutionary computation;learning automata;optimisation","Cauchy distribution;autoencoder;evolutionary algorithm;global optimization;inverse problem;machine learning domain;nonlinear dimension reduction;random variate;randomization;rank based differential evolution","","0","","23","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the help of this technique one can pose a hand gesture in the vision range of a robot and corresponding to this notation, desired action is performed by the robotic system. Simple video camera is used for computer vision, which helps in monitoring gesture presentation. This approach consists of four modules: (a) A real time hand gesture formation monitor and gesture capture, (b) feature extraction, (c) Pattern matching for gesture recognition, (d) Command determination corresponding to shown gesture and performing action by robotic system. Real-time hand tracking technique is used for object detection in the range of vision. If a hand gesture is shown for one second, the camera captures the gesture. Object of interest is extracted from the background and the portion of hand, representing the gesture, is cropped out using the statistical property of hand. Extracted hand gesture is matched with the stored database of hand gestures using pattern matching. Corresponding to the matched gesture, action is performed by the robot.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460699","Computer Vision;Hand gesture Recognition;Pattern Recognition;Robot arm control","Cameras;Computer vision;Computerized monitoring;Feature extraction;Object detection;Pattern matching;Pattern recognition;Real time systems;Robot control;Robot vision systems","computer vision;feature extraction;gesture recognition;object detection;pattern matching;real-time systems;robot vision","computer vision;feature extraction;gesture presentation monitoring;gesture recognition;hand gestures;object detection;object extraction;pattern matching;real-time hand tracking technique;real-time robotic hand control;robot vision;robotic system;video camera","","15","","11","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These transformations take the form of a mixture of base transformations and are learned by maximizing the kernel alignment criterion. Because the proposed optimization is nonconvex, a semidefinite relaxation is derived to find an approximate global solution. This new convex algorithm learns kernels made up of a matrix mixture of transformations. This formulation yields a simpler optimization while achieving comparable or improved accuracies to previous transformation learning algorithms based on maximizing the margin. Remarkably, the new optimization problem does not slow down with the availability of additional data allowing it to scale to large datasets. One application of this method is learning monotonic transformations constructed from a base set of truncated ramp functions. These monotonic transformations permit a nonlinear filtering of the input to the classifier. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on synthetic data, text data and image data.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381542","Kernel Alignment;Kernel Learning;Semidefinite Programming;Transformation Learning","Filtering;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Piecewise linear techniques;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Thumb","concave programming;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","approximate global solution;convex algorithm;kernel alignment;monotonic transformations;nonconvex optimization;nonlinear filtering;semidefinite relaxation;supervised classification tasks;transformation learning algorithms;truncated ramp functions","","1","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a new method for knowledge extraction, transfer and application in classification. We consider document classification where we mine correlation relationships among the words from a set of documents and compile a collection of correlation relationships as prior knowledge.

In this paper, we generalize the all-confidence by associating to any measure its corresponding all-measure. We present a formal framework which allows us to make the link between analytic and algorithmic properties of the all-measure.

In this work, cutting force measurement is used for a reliable on-line flank wear estimation and tool life monitoring.

Then the non-linear dynamic models obtained are calibrated with the actual conditions. These developed models will be used for the simulation of flank wear and using control variable such as cutting speed; the flank wear will be controlled. For model validation, the flank wear is estimated using a non-linear model. In the present work, an attempt has been made to control the flank wear during turning of on-line cutting process using the Fuzzy Logic Controller and Neural network based on self-tuning of PID controller approaches. Those approaches are treat the material as dynamic system and involve developing state space models from available material behavior model.

In wireless ad-hoc networks, a collection of nodes with wireless communications and networking capability communicate with each other without the aid of any centralized administrator. The nodes are powered by batteries with limited energy reservoir. It becomes difficult to recharge or replace the batteries of the nodes hence energy conservation is essential. An energy efficient routing protocol (EERP) balances node energy utilization to reduce energy consumption and increase the life of nodes thus increasing the network lifetime, reducing the routing delay and increasing the reliability of the packets reaching the destination. Wireless networks do not have any fixed communication infrastructure. For an active connection the end host as well as the intermediate nodes can be mobile. Therefore routes are subject to frequent disconnection. In such an environment it is important to minimize disruptions caused by changing topology for applications using voice and video. Power Aware Routing enables the nodes to detect misbehavior like deviation from regular routing and forwarding by observing the status of the node. By exploiting non-random behaviors for the mobility patterns that mobile user exhibit, state of network topology can be predicted and perform route reconstruction proactively in a timely manner. In this paper we propose an Energy Efficient-Power Aware routing algorithm where we have integrated energy efficiency with- - power awareness parameters for routing of packets.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460724","energy efficient;power aware;routing protocol","Batteries;Communications technology;Energy efficiency;High performance computing;Internet;Microcomputers;Network topology;Portable computers;Routing;Wireless communication","mobile computing;power aware computing;routing protocols","communication device;energy conservation;energy efficient routing protocol;high performance computing;mobility patterns;power aware routing algorithm;wireless communication technology","","0","","9","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The shortcomings of the currently available tools have made the use of mobile devices more appealing. In mobile computing, the issues such as low bandwidth, high latency wireless Networks, loss or degradation of wireless connections, and network errors or failures need to be dealt with. Other issues to be addressed include system adaptability, reliability, robustness, extensibility, flexibility, and maintainability.

The study is analysed for length to diameter ratio of 1,2,4 and 6. The nozzles used are De Laval type and with a Mach number of 1.74 and 2.23. The analysis based on fuzzy logic theory indicates that the length to diameter ratio of 1 is sufficient for smooth flow development if only the basis of wall static pressure variations is considered.

In this paper, an Improved Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) is proposed for face recognition. Initially the eigenspace is created with eigenvalues and eigenvectors. From this space, the eigenfaces are constructed, and the most relevant eigenfaces have been selected using IPCA. With these eigenfaces, the input images are be classified based on Euclidian distance.

Since the available bandwidth for transmission is very limited, Multimedia Applications such as video conferencing, video on demand, video telephony and remote sensing are not possible without compression. A lot of video compression techniques have been developed and the video signal transmission has followed at data rates below 64kbps. Wavelet transform based motion compensated video codec performs better compression in order to meet the rate and distortion constraint in video transmission for the available bandwidth than the block based techniques, which are followed in standard video transmissions such as H.261 and H.263. But the efficiency of those technique's depends on the way in which it estimates and compensates the object motions in the video sequence. Wavelet based embedded image coder is quite attractive in modern multimedia applications. Wavelet transform, bit plane coding and other techniques make embedded image coder practical and also provide efficient compression. In this paper, we have proposed a novel video coding using swarm intelligence in dual tree complex wavelet transform for video coding. The 3-D DDWT is an attractive video representation because it isolates motion along different directions in separate subbands. However, it is an over-complete transform with redundancy, which is going to be eliminated by choosing optimal subbands with the help of PSO. The proposed video codec does not require motion compensation and provides better performance than the 3D SPIHT (Embedded type)codec, both objectively and subjectively, and the coder allows full scalability in spatial, temporal and quality dimensions.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460747","DDWT-Dualtree Discrete Wavelet Transform;DDWTVC- Dual tree Discrete Wavelet Transform with Vector Coding;NS-NoiseShaping;PSO-Particle Swarm Optimization","Bandwidth;Image coding;Particle swarm optimization;Video codecs;Video coding;Video compression;Video on demand;Video signal processing;Videoconference;Wavelet transforms","motion compensation;particle swarm optimisation;trees (mathematics);video codecs;video coding;wavelet transforms","3-d dual tree complex wavelet transform;H.261 video standard;H.263.But video standard;PSO;bit plane coding;embedded image coder;motion compensated video codec;remote sensing;swarm intelligence;video coding technique;video compression;video conferencing;video on demand;video representation;video telephony","","4","","16","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The model produces a ranked list of tens of thousands of manholes in Manhattan, where the ranking criterion is vulnerability to serious events such as fires, explosions and smoking manholes. Con Edison set two goals for the model, namely accuracy and intuitiveness, and this tool made it possible for us to address both of these goals. The tool automatically assembles a ""report card"" or ""profile"" highlighting data associated with a given manhole. Prior to the processing work that underlies the profiling tool, case studies of a single manhole took several days and resulted in an incomplete study; locating manholes such as those we present in this work would have been extremely difficult.

The motivation is to address challenges associated with algorithm scalability, data sparsity and information loss due to the so-called curse of dimensionality. The original high dimensional feature space is randomly projected onto a number of lower-dimensional feature subspaces. Each of these subspaces constitutes the domain of a classification subtask, and is associated with a base learner within an ensemble machine-learner context. Such an ensemble conceptualization is called as random subsample ensemble. Simulation results performed on data sets with up to 20,000 features indicate that the random subsample ensemble classifier performs comparably to other benchmark machine learners based on performance measures of prediction accuracy and cpu time. This finding establishes the feasibility of the ensemble and positions it to tackle classification problems with even much higher dimensional feature spaces.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-5301-6; POD:978-0-7695-3926-3; POD:978-1-4244-5396-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2009.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5381318","curse of dimensionality;ensemble classification;high dimensional feature space;random subspace","Application software;Computational complexity;Computational efficiency;Computer science;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Performance evaluation;Principal component analysis;Scalability;Space technology","data analysis;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","algorithm scalability;base learner;benchmark machine learners;classification subtask domain;data sets;data sparsity;dimensionality curse;ensemble machine-learner context;high dimensional feature spaces;information loss;lower dimensional feature subspaces;machine learning ensembles;random subsample ensemble","","3","","21","","","13-15 Dec. 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But due to new opportunities and higher pays the strength of the labour community is getting greatly reduced. Since the farming community is unable to sustain continuation of farming, the corporate world in now becoming the caretaker of the agricultural industry. This has lead to a new era of agriculture. Today's agriculture needs to find new ways to improve efficiency. The key point here is to replace the labourers with intelligent machines. One way to achieve this goal is to utilize available robotics and artificial intelligence technologies in the form of smarter intelligent machines to reduce energy inputs in more effective ways. These machines should be able to work like humans in farms and produce results equal to or higher than the existing ones. The advent of autonomous system architecture gives us the opportunity to develop a complete new range of agricultural equipment based on smart machines. By using these machines we can increase the productivity, improve safety, and reduce costs for many agricultural purposes. The author proposes the development of a machine which can autonomously navigate through rubber plantations with obstacle detection capabilities.

The effect of uncertain factors such as the different behavior of a human society would count as an intricacy of the issue and would cause some problems for modeling. Level crossroads are one of the important sections in an urban traffic control system and are usually controlled by traffic lights. In this study, an attempt has been made to model the traffic of an important crossroads in Mashhad city using intelligent elements in a multi-agent environment and a large amount of real data. For this purpose, the total traffic behavior at the intersection was first modeled based on the Bayesian networks structures. Then, effective factors have been modeled using the probabilistic causal networks. Results of the evaluation of the model show that this model is able to measure system efficiency according to variances in the crossroads adjustments. Also, this model is cheaper and less time-consuming. On this basis, this modeling can be used for the evaluating and even predicting the efficacy of the traffic control system in the crossroads.

They derive their usefulness from their group actions, performing physical tasks and making cooperative decisions as a Coordinated Team. To improve the performance of clustering, the method based on heuristic concept is used to obtain global search. The main advantage of clustering algorithm lies in the fact that no additional information, such as an initial partitioning of the data or the number of clusters, is needed.

"Genetically Improved PSO Algorithm for Efficient Data Clustering","R. F. Abdel-Kader","Electr. Eng. Dept., Suez Canal Univ., Port-Said, Egypt","2010 Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing","20100506","2010","","","71","75","Clustering is an important research topic in data mining that appears in a wide range of unsupervised classification applications. Partitional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm are the most popular for clustering large datasets. The major problem with the k-means algorithm is that it is sensitive to the selection of the initial partitions and it may converge to local optima. In this paper, we present a hybrid two-phase GAI-PSO+k-means data clustering algorithm that performs fast data clustering and can avoid premature convergence to local optima. In the first phase we utilize the new genetically improved particle swarm optimization algorithm (GAI-PSO) which is a population-based heuristic search technique modeled on the hybrid of cultural and social rules derived from the analysis of the swarm intelligence (PSO) and the concepts of natural selection and evolution (GA). The GAI-PSO combines the standard velocity and position update rules of PSOs with the ideas of selection, mutation and crossover from GAs. The GAI-PSO algorithm searches the solution space to find the optimal initial cluster centroids for the next phase. The second phase is a local refining stage utilizing the k-means algorithm which can efficiently converge to the optimal solution. The proposed algorithm combines the ability of the globalized searching of the evolutionary algorithms and the fast convergence of the k-means algorithm and can avoid the drawback of both. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through several benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is highly forceful and outperforms the previous approaches such as SA, ACO, PSO and k-means for the partitional clustering problem.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460767","Data Clustering;Genetic Algorithm;Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm;K-means Clustering;Particle Swarm Optimization","Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Genetic mutations;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Particle swarm optimization;Partitioning algorithms","convergence;data mining;genetic algorithms;particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification;pattern clustering;search problems","PSO;convergence;data clustering;data mining;evolutionary algorithm;genetic algorithm;genetically improved particle swarm optimization algorithm;heuristic search technique;k-means algorithm;partitional clustering algorithm;position update rules;standard velocity rules;unsupervised classification","","9","","19","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel adaptive local linear embedding algorithm is employed for nonlinear dimension reduction of original dataset. The recursively applying normalized cut algorithm is used for clustering of low dimensional data. The simulation results on three UCI standard datasets show that the new algorithm maps high-dimensional data into low-dimensional intrinsic space, and perfectly solves the problem of higher dependence on the structure of datasets in the traditional methods.

Multicasting is the optimum technique for such group oriented applications with effective network resource utilization. But maintaining security is a critical issue in group oriented protocols with frequent membership changes. Confidentiality can be achieved through changing the key material, known as rekeying every time a new member joins the group or existing member leaves from the group. Many techniques have been proposed earlier for this purpose. In centralized approach, a single key server is responsible to generate and distribute keys. In decentralized approach, a hierarchy of key managers distributes the keys. In distributed key-agreement protocol, the group members collectively generate and distribute a group key. This paper uses combination of both de-centralized and key agreement approaches to prevent a single point of failures and to improve the reliability as well as the performance of the system. This paper proposes new a technique(SGKP-1), using hybrid key trees, has certain advantages like secure channel establishment for the distribution of the key material, reducing the storage requirements and burden at each member, minimization of time requirement to become a new member of a group.

The dimensions are never the same and may be never mapped on to a square grid unlike English characters. Here we propose an algorithm which can accept the scanned image of handwritten characters as input and to produce the editable Malayalam characters in a predefined format as output without applying any resizing or skeletonization methods but still can produce much accurate results. Characters are grouped in to different classes based on their HLH intensity patterns. These patterns are separated from the image and fed for recognition.

Transcribing music audio into chord sequences is essential for harmonic analysis, and would be an important component in content-based retrieval and indexing, but accuracy rates remain fairly low. In this paper, the existing 2008 LabROSA Supervised Chord Recognition System is modified by using different machine learning methods for decoding structural information, thereby achieving significantly superior results. Specifically, the hidden Markov model is replaced by a large margin structured prediction approach (SVMstruct) using an enlarged feature space. Performance is significantly improved by incorporating features from future (but not past) frames. The benefit of SVMstruct increases with the size of the training set, as might be expected when comparing discriminative and generative models. Without yet exploring non-linear kernels, these improvements lead to state-of-the-art performance in chord transcription.

Finally, it attempts to bridge the gap between the theoretical knowledge of design and programming with the practical side of software reuse and modularization when designing and implementing a robotic system for medical applications.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.70","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460693","Computer Vision;OpenCV;TelemedicineCluster;moduliraization;robotic system","Bridges;Buildings;Computer vision;Educational robots;Medical robotics;Robot programming;Robot vision systems;Software engineering;Software libraries;Telemedicine","medical computing;medical robotics;robot vision;software reusability;telemedicine;telerobotics","OpenCV;computer vision;medical application;open source vision library;robotic telemedicine cluster system;software modularization;software reuse;telemedicine system","","1","","6","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"SVM Model for Amino Acid Composition Based Prediction of MMPs and ADAMs","K. Pant; B. Pant; K. R.

They play an important role in skin aging, skin disorders, anticancer therapy and other physiological disorders. Thus there arises the need to understand the relationships among various parameters of these proteins for prediction of their classes, structures and functionality. The computational approaches for prediction of their classes are fast and economical therefore can be used to complement the existing wet lab techniques. Realizing their importance, in this paper an attempt has been made to correlate them with their amino acid composition and predict them with fair accuracy. This is a novel method where ADAMs and MMPs have been classified on the basis of amino acid composition using Support Vector Machine. The SVM has been implemented using Lib SVM package. The method discriminates MMP subfamily from ADAM proteases with Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.98 using amino acid composition. The performance of the method was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation where accuracy of 98% was obtained.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460694","Amino Acid composition;Kernel functions;Metalloproteinases;Support vector machine","Aging;Amino acids;Economic forecasting;Medical treatment;Packaging machines;Predictive models;Proteins;Skin;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biology computing;cancer;cellular biophysics;proteins;support vector machines","ADAMs;Lib SVM package;MMPs;Matthew's correlation coefficient;SVM model;amino acid composition based prediction;anticancer therapy;cell surface proteases;metalloprotease family;physiological disorders;skin aging;skin disorders;support vector machine;wet lab techniques","","0","","19","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
