The nonlinear dynamic model of DPTOC is built using Lagrangian method. The composite sliding mode function (CSMF) consists of three sliding mode functions that are used to decouple the complex DPTOC. In the CSMFC, CSMF works as the antecedent and control variable works as the consequent. The proposed control approach greatly reduces the complexity to design a controller for complex underactuated systems. The control system stability is analyzed for DPTOC through variable structure control theory.

However, there are some problems in the strong association rules mining based on support-confidence framework. Firstly, there are a great number of redundant association rules generated, then it is difficult for user to find the interesting ones in them; secondly, the correlation between attributes of given application areas is ignored. Therefore new measure criteria, which are Chi-Squared test and cover, should be introduced to association rules mining, and the more important aspect is the use of Chi-Squared test to reduce the amount of rules. In the paper, the Chi-Squared test and cover of measure criteria would be used to association rules mining for removing the itemsets, which are statistic independent, while frequent itemsets or rules are generated. Thus the number of patterns (including itemsets and rules) itemsets decreases, and it is easy for user to capture the more interesting association rules. The experimental results demonstrate that the Chi-Squared test is effective on reducing the amount of patterns via merging support and cover constrain. Pattern selection based on Chi-Squared test can eliminate some irrelevant attributes, and the efficiency and veracity of mining association rules are improved.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527320","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527320","Apriori;Association rule;Chi-Squared test;Data mining","Association rules;Data engineering;Data mining;Databases;Electronic mail;Finance;Itemsets;Merging;Statistical analysis;Testing","data mining;statistical testing;very large databases","Chi-Squared test;association rules mining;data mining;frequent itemsets;large databases;pattern selection;support-confidence framework","","1","","6","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Within a period of planning horizon, the whole procedure of the scheduling problem is composed of the pre-scheduling algorithm and the spatial planning by genetic algorithm (GA). The first part generates the initial set of blocks with respect to every working space by considering spatial constraints, due time of blocks and workload balance among the working space. In the spatial planning algorithm, GA is proposed to further realize the spatial layout of the initial set of blocks obtained in the pre-scheduling algorithm at a period in a working space. Because several locatable strategies such as rotation mechanism, edging strategy, rearrangement strategy have been designed to realize in the genetic operations, the feasible locatable point set can be found by GA.

A binary image watermark is constructed by using chaotic map to embedded in the subband of DWT.

Let it be supposed that in feature space discriminant vector can be approximated by some linear combination of a part of training samples (called nodes), then a simple and reasonable algorithm for selecting nodes is developed. Based on the algorithm, DKNRM (derived kernel-based nonlinear regression model) is proposed. When DKNRM classifies one test sample, only kernel functions between each node and the test sample should be calculated. Accordingly, it can be expected that DKNRM will perform well with superiority in classification efficiency.

After the investigation of the workflow model, we find that the cyclic structure can make the workflow model more complex. Thus, this paper aims to investigate the cyclic structure of workflow nets (WF-net). The method for establishing the transition invariant (T-invariant) subnet of WF-net is proposed, then the necessary and sufficient condition for the T-invariant subnet with sound structure is given. In further study, a verification and reduction method of cyclic structure of WF-nets is put forward. This method not only can point out the error in the cyclic structure and find what causes the error, but also can reduce the sound cyclic structure. After the reduction, a WF-net with cyclic structure is reduced to a WF-net without cyclic structure, then many reduction methods can be used to realize the sound verification of a WF-net without cyclic structure.

The improved genetic algorithm is applied to a corpus contains both legitimate spam and emails to get the initial score of each rule. During the filter process, end users' feedback is collected and used to adjust the scores of rules.

The CONDENSATION algorithm is a kind of conditional density propagation method for motion tracking. This algorithm combines factored sampling with learned dynamic models to propagate an entire probability distributes for object position and shape over time. It can accomplish highly robust tracking of object motion. However, it usually requires a large number of samples to ensure a fair maximum likelihood estimation of the current state. The important problem of the CONDENSATION algorithm is to choose proper samples to approach the actual samples position. In this paper, we use the mutation and crossover operators of the genetic algorithm to find more appropriate samples by calculating weights. Accordingly, we can solve the heavy demand of samples in the CONDENSATION algorithm.

Then, the location of fingertip was localized precisely based on circle feature matching. Experiments suggest that the proposed fingertip detection method is capable of detecting fingertip in a reliable manner even in a complex background under different light conditions without any markers. To demonstrate the strength of the method, the method was run on 5 sequences with varying light condition, different degrees of clutter background and different speeds of finger movement, experiment shows that the correct rate can reach 98.5%.

This representation captures the spatial topology information of homogeneous regions as well as their finest scale and interactions. Then, an efficient optimization scheme has been proposed to iteratively minimize the learning error to all content-identical image samples generated by an acceptable operation set defined by the user. In addition, we use the regional pixon map to remove spurious vertices and thus to establish a BaSCA hierarchy naturally.

Each pixel's gradient magnitude is adaptively adjusted according to its location. The second step is image segmentation. Watershed transform is performed on the adjusted gradient magnitude image to obtain the initial segmented regions. The last step is regions merging. Pairs of adjacent regions are merged if they have small cost function. For each pair of adjacent regions, the cost function is calculated according to the strength of their shared boundaries, the ratio of smaller region area to shared boundary length, and the homogeneity.

Every learning module includes a Q learning module and an ASPL (Action Selection Priority Level) module. ASPL module to determine the action selection priority level based on which the cooperative behaviors can be well controlled. Generalized rule base module stores the environment states, Q value and action parameters etc. information, and extracts action rules based Q value from learning process.

The patterns are then filtered by an efficient feature selection algorithm called chi-square algorithm. Each protein sequence is mapped into a high dimensional vector by the occurrence times of the selected patterns. This presentation, combined with a discriminative classification algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM), provides a powerful means for protein remote homology detection. The method, called SVM-pattern, is tested on the SCOP database and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The performance of SVM-pattern is better than that of BLAST method and comparable with other SVM-based methods such as SVM-k-spectrum and SVM-pairwise.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527523","Protein;pattern;remote homology;text categorization","Bioinformatics;Classification algorithms;Genomics;Machinery;Natural language processing;Protein sequence;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing;Text categorization","biology computing;data mining;pattern classification;proteins;support vector machines;text analysis","SVM;chi-square algorithm;discriminative classification algorithm;feature selection;genome;molecular machinery;natural language processing;pattern discovery;protein classification;protein sequence language;remote homology detection;support vector machine;text categorization","","1","","28","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to improve the algorithm's stability and the ability to search the global optimum, we propose an improved AFSA (IAFSA). When the artificial fish swarm's optimum value is not variant after defined generations, we add leaping behavior and change the artificial fish parameter randomly. By the way, we can increase the probability to obtain the global optimum. A new feed-forward neural networks optimization module based on IAFSA is presented. The comparative result between BP algorithm, AFSA and IAFSA demonstrates that the IAFSA has better global stability and avoids premature convergence effectively.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527436","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527436","Artificial fish-swarm algorithm;convergence efficiency;neural networks","Application software;Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Convergence;Feedforward neural networks;Feedforward systems;Intelligent networks;Marine animals;Neural networks;Stability","artificial life;feedforward neural nets;particle swarm optimisation;search problems","artificial fish-swarm algorithm;artificial intelligence;backpropagation algorithm;convergence efficiency;feedforward neural network optimization;global optimum search;global stability","","12","","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fingerprint matching is the key to the system and effects on the precision and efficiency of the whole system directly. Fingerprints are matched mainly based on their fingerprint texture pattern, which can be described with the orientation field of fingerprints. A fingerprint, which has the different orientation angle structure in different local area of the fingerprint and has a texture pattern correlation among the neighboring local areas of the fingerprint, can be viewed as a Markov stochastic field. A novel method of fingerprint matching, which is based on embedded hidden Markov model (HMM) that is used for modeling the fingerprint's orientation field, is described in this paper. The accurate and robust fingerprint matching can be achieved by matching embedded hidden Markov model parameters which were built after the processing of extracting features from a fingerprint, forming the samples of observation vectors and training the embedded hidden Markov model parameters.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527834","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527834","Fingerprint identification;Fingerprint matching;Hidden Markov Model (HMM);Orientation field","","feature extraction;fingerprint identification;hidden Markov models;image matching;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov stochastic field;feature extraction;fingerprint identification system;fingerprint matching;fingerprint orientation field;fingerprint texture pattern;hidden Markov model;observation vector sample;parameter training","","6","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
