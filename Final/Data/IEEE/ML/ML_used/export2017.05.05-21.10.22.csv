As we all know, the different meteorological type will cause the difference of modes of load, thus it will increase the training time of the neural network and influence the precision of predicting notably. For this reason, based on the analysis of the relationship between the climatic factor and load data, this paper adopts a new method of clustering analysis by self-study membership to choose the historical data as the samples and train them firstly, which has the most same meteorological characteristic as the predicted day, so the training time of the neural network can be shortened; then choose the Morlet wavelet to establish a wavelet neural network secondly, which means to adopt the nonlinear wavelet base to replace the commonly used nonlinear Sigmoid function to predict the historical data array; and to reach the global best approximation effect through an expansion and contraction factor and a translation factor. The WNN combines the time-frequency localization characteristic of wavelet and its self-learning ability, so it helps to overcome the defects of ANN such as the difficulty of rationally determining the network structure and the existence of partial optimal points. The practical example shows that this method possesses high forecasting accuracy and better adaptability than traditional forecasting methods.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527003","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527003","Climate factors;Peak load forecasting;Power system;Wavelet neural network","Artificial neural networks;Load forecasting;Load modeling;Meteorology;Neural networks;Power system modeling;Predictive models;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms;Weather forecasting","","Climate factors;Peak load forecasting;Power system;Wavelet neural network","","1","","15","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the traditional clustering-based intrusion detection algorithms, clustering using a simple distance-based metric and detection based on the centers of clusters, which generally degrade detection accuracy and efficiency. Our approach based on swarm intelligence can settle these problems effectively. The experiment result shows that our approach can detect unknown intrusions efficiently in the real network connections.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527630","Anomaly intrusion detection;Clustering;Swarm Intelligence","Ant colony optimization;Character generation;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Degradation;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Intrusion detection;Labeling;Particle swarm optimization","computer networks;data mining;pattern classification;pattern clustering;security of data","anomaly data clusters;data instance classification;distance-based metric;network connection;network intrusion detection;pattern clustering;swarm intelligence;unsupervised anomaly intrusion detection","","5","","17","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The HHT method is specially developed for analyzing nonlinear and non-stationary data. The method consists of two parts: (1) the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), and (2) the Hilbert spectral analysis. The EMD, which is the first part of the theory, can decompose any complicated data set into a finite and often small numbers of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). IMFs also thus admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. The law of its EMD and characteristics of the IMFs of a speech signal with unwanted sound are studied.

All the related words are then translated to the target language in finding out the correct senses of ambiguous words. The selection is based on a statistical and a mathematical model by assigning a score to each of the sense identified previously.

One end of the compound deformable body is a flexure-hinged elastic body and the other is a electromagnetic rotor, around the rotor is a 8-poles stator with eight actuation coils. The electromagnetic force between the rotor and stator can be changed by changing the currents in the coils. With the linearization of the magnetic force near the quiescent operating point, the linear relationship between the magnetic force and control current can be established, and the synchronizing control method of the electromagnetic force can be acquired. Theoretical analysis show that the rotor can get a ideal micro displacement when the actuation currents satisfy certain amplitude and phase angle conditions. Simulation tests indicate that a magnetic force rotating with the rotor synchronously can be generated, and the micro displacement between the rotor and stator is almost proportional to the control current.

It has shown great ability in modeling and forecasting nonlinear time series. This paper proposes an ARMA-GRNN model that combines ARMA and GRNN models. The combined model is proposed to make use of the advantage of ARMA and GRNN models in linear and nonlinear modeling. And ARMA model aids in improving the combined model performance by capturing statistical information of the time series. The relative tests testify that the combined model can be an effective way to improve forecasting accuracy achieved by either of the models used separately.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527274","ARMA;Forecasting;GRNN;Innovation series","Autoregressive processes;Chaos;Computer science;Economic forecasting;Educational institutions;Neural networks;Nonlinear systems;Predictive models;Technology forecasting;Testing","autoregressive moving average processes;economic forecasting;financial management;forecasting theory;radial basis function networks;regression analysis;time series","ARMA-GRNN model;RBF neural network;autoregressive moving average method;financial time series forecasting;generalized regression neural network","","1","","15","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Compared with the traditional POCS based SR methods, the proposed approach imposes additional constraints to the solution. The experimental results on frontal face images show that the proposed approach gains a better performance both on noise suppression and reconstruction quality.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527837","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527837","Super-resolution;face image;learning-based approach;projection onto convex set","","face recognition;image reconstruction;image resolution;learning (artificial intelligence);set theory;statistical analysis","deterministic set;face image super-resolution reconstruction;forensic analysis;learning-based POCS algorithm;noise suppression;projection onto convex sets algorithm;set theory;statistical characteristics;video surveillance","","2","","15","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, some hybrids are proposed and reported good denoising results. However, the basic idea about these hybrids is the parameter of the image is estimated in a set of moving windows with the context, which leads to high complexity to the algorithms. Besides this, some moving windows cannot ensure the numbers of points that have the same context are large enough to obtain reliable estimated parameters. In this paper, we proposed a novel denoising scheme, which can adjust the sizes of local windows automatically according to the numbers of the contextual points. The division of the same contextual points is obtained by dividing the subband into four equal squares if the number of the points is in a suitable extension. Then the division can be done step by step until the number of the points is not in the extension. All divisions can be obtained according to these steps. The other assumption about our framework is the parameter in the same local window is same. Therefore, we can share statistical information among these pixels. Based on these assumptions, we propose a simple example to demonstrate the power of our new scheme. The experimental results show that the new framework improves the denoising results greatly even using the simplest model.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527915","Local denoising method;MMSE;PSNR;context;image denoising;wavelet","Computer science;Image denoising;Least squares approximation;Mathematics;Noise reduction;PSNR;Parameter estimation;Pixel;Statistics;Wavelet domain","image denoising;mean square error methods;statistical analysis;wavelet transforms","contextual image denoising;contextual points;minimum mean square error;moving windows;parameter estimation;statistical information;wavelet transform","","0","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

What's more, the adaptive subtraction of the background is very difficult to achieve. This paper proposes a new detection method for moving object with complex background. First of all, the filtering is done in both the temporal field and the spatial field to reduce the influence of noise. Secondly, the probable moving regions are fast subtracted by the temporal difference method.

To solve these problems, we propose to extend the existing meta-model by presenting a generic method for the instruction of modeling process, and integrating it with the state chart of UML for the supplementary representations of internal roles’ dynamic behaviors. As is proved by practice, the proved meta-model helps designers build organization-oriented multi-agent systems more effectively and also provides richer semantic representations.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526960","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526960","MASs;UML;agent/group/role meta-model;extension","Application software;Computer science;Design methodology;Educational institutions;Intelligent agent;Multiagent systems;Object oriented modeling;Problem-solving;Systems engineering and theory;Unified modeling language","","MASs;UML;agent/group/role meta-model;extension","","0","","22","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As short-term load forecasting is a complex problem with multifactor in power system, if all these factors are used as inputs of neural network, it will not only result in complicated network structure, but also long learning time and inaccurate prediction. First, information entropy theory is used to select relevant ones from all load influential factors, the results are used as inputs of neural network. It can reduce irrelevant load influential factors and the input variables of the input layer for neural network. Next, considering the features of power load and reduced influential factors, using ant colony clustering method, the practical historical load data within one year is divided into several groups. A separate module based on neural networks models each group. Then, the typical samples in each clustered group were selected as the training set for the separate improved Elman neural network which is a kind of globally feed forward locally recurrent network model with distinguished dynamical characteristics. According to the procedures, the reduced input variables and the typical training samples for each neural network can be gotten. Thus the neural network forecasting model based on information entropy and ant colony clustering can be constructed which can effectively reduce the training time and improve convergent speed. During the forecasting process, pattern recognizing is employed to activate the corresponding module for hourly load forecasting. The presented model was tested using Hebei Province daily load data, and the satisfactory results were obtained.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527758","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527758","Short-term load forecasting;ant colony clustering;information entropy;neural network","Clustering methods;Feedforward neural networks;Hybrid power systems;Information entropy;Input variables;Load forecasting;Neural networks;Power system modeling;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks","feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;pattern recognition;power system analysis computing;recurrent neural nets","ant colony clustering theory;feed forward neural network;information entropy;load influential factors;pattern recognition;power markets;power systems;recurrent neural network;scheduling;short-term load forecasting;training set","","3","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Background suppression based-on wavelet transformation to detect infrared target","Yu-Qiu Sun; Jin-Wen Tian; Jian Liu","Sch. of Inf. & Math., Yangtze Univ., Jingzhou, China","2005 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20051107","2005","8","","4611","4615 Vol. 8","Target detection and location in infrared clutter background is very important to infrared search and track system. Especially for small target detection in infrared image in background of sea and sky, there are no geometric and structure character to use. When targets such as ship and naval vessel sailing at long distance, they always appear around the sea-level line, and it is mixed with cloud and sea-wave clutter. It is difficult to segment and locate precisely. Background suppression based-on wavelet transformation is proposed in the paper. Wavelet decomposition makes it possible to analyze a signal both in time and frequency domains. In the paper infrared sea and key background images are processed. For their SNR is low and background is complex, using wavelet transformation decomposes an original image and extract approximate feature to reconstruct an image, which mainly includes background information. A new image would be obtained using background image subtracted from original image. There are mainly target and noise points left in the new image. By setting proper threshold, the target can be detected perfectly. At last, experiment results are given and show the method is practical.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527751","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527751","Target detection;background suppression;infrared image;threshold;wavelet transform","Clouds;Image segmentation;Infrared detectors;Infrared imaging;Marine vehicles;Object detection;Signal analysis;Target tracking;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet domain","feature extraction;image reconstruction;image segmentation;infrared imaging;signal denoising;target tracking;wavelet transforms","SNR;image reconstruction;infrared clutter background suppression;infrared image;infrared sea;infrared search;infrared target detection;key background images;track system;wavelet transformation decomposition","","5","","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This can be achieved by profiling the traffic. A fully profiled traffic can contain significant information of the network's current state, and can be further used to detect anomalous traffic. Many has addressed problems of profiling network traffic, but unfortunately there are no specific profiles could lasts forever for one particular network, since network traffic characteristic always changes over and over based on the sum of nodes, software that being used, type of access, etc. This paper introduces an online adaptive system using evolving connectionist systems based connectionist model to profile network traffic in continuous manner while at the same time try to detect anomalous activity inside the network in real-time and adapt with changes if necessary. Different from an offline approach, which usually profile network traffic using previously captured data for a certain period of time, an online and adaptive approach can use a shorter period of data capturing and evolve its profile if the characteristics of the network traffic has changed.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527622","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527622","Adaptive System;Distributed Anomaly Detection;Evolvable-Neural-Based Fuzzy Inference System;Evolving Connectionist Systems","Adaptive systems;Computer network reliability;Computer networks;Computerized monitoring;Distributed computing;Intrusion detection;Mathematical model;Real time systems;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","adaptive systems;computer networks;evolutionary computation;fuzzy reasoning;neural nets;real-time systems;security of data","anomalous traffic detection;connectionist model;distributed adaptive network anomaly detection system;evolvable-neural-based fuzzy inference system;evolving connectionist system;network diagnosis;network traffic profiling;real-time detection","","3","","10","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes an intelligent multiple model approach called moving horizon Bayesian estimation (MHBE) that can estimate the states of a nonlinear plant effectively. The nonlinear plant operates in multiple regimes and makes transitions between them. It is often difficult to obtain a single nonlinear model that accurately describes the plant in all regimes. An alternative approach is presented where local linear models are identified at each different operating point, and moving horizon estimation is performed by tracking the transitions from one regime to another. In this paper, simulation results for a numerical example and comparison results with the Kalman estimator are given, the result indicate that the method of MHBE is more effective than Kalman filter for constrained system.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527000","Arrival cost;Bayesian estimation;Moving horizon estimation;constraint","Bayesian methods;Costs;Estimation theory;Kalman filters;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Nonlinear equations;Nonlinear filters;Nonlinear systems;Sampling methods;State estimation","","Arrival cost;Bayesian estimation;Moving horizon estimation;constraint","","0","","21","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
