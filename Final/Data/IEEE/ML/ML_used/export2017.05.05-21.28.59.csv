The robust pole placement approach is firstly converted to a constrained optimization problem. The objective of the optimization is to derive the most robust state-feedback gain matrix K with respect to parametric plant uncertainties. Then, GAs are introduced as efficient optimization tools to solve the problem. The search of the GA is done within the linear bounded domain in the space of parameters in matrix K. The resulting system guarantees the closed-loop poles to remain in a prescribed region in the complex plane despite of the greatest possible uncertainty in plant parameters. Finally, this method is applied to design the longitudinal stability augmentation system (SAS) for a static unsteady airship. Simulation results show that the designed system not only stabilizes the longitudinal motion of the airship, but also reduces the sensitivity to parameter uncertainties.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174500","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174500","","Constraint optimization;Control systems;Genetic algorithms;Robust control;Robust stability;Robustness;State feedback;Synthetic aperture sonar;Uncertain systems;Uncertainty","aircraft control;balloons;closed loop systems;genetic algorithms;linear systems;matrix algebra;optimal control;pole assignment;robust control;state feedback;uncertain systems","GA;LTI systems;SAS;closed-loop poles;constrained optimization problem;genetic algorithms;linear bounded domain;longitudinal stability augmentation system design;parameter uncertainties;parametric plant uncertainties;robust pole placement;robust state-feedback gain matrix;static unsteady airship","","3","","15","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

CURE employs a fixed number or representative points to describe the cluster, and the set of representative points are first chosen randomly, and then are shrunk toward the mean of cluster. The shrinking operation plays a key role in CURE, which is used for weakening the effect of outliers. However, we found that the shrinking scheme of CURE is dependent on a hidden assumption of spherical shape of cluster, therefore CURE has difficulties in dealing with databases having specific shapes. In this paper, CURE-NS (CURE with new shrinking scheme) is proposed to overcome this problem, which uses the difference of density values of the representative points to determine the direction and distance of shrinking. Our shrinking scheme has nothing to do with the shape of cluster. A range of experiments demonstrate that CURE-NS has better clustering performance than CURE.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1174512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1174512","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Computer science;Distributed computing;Noise shaping;Robustness;Scattering;Shape;Spatial databases;Working environment noise","Gaussian distribution;data mining;database management systems;pattern clustering","Gaussian density distributions;clustering with representatives;data analysis;data mining;density distribution;hierarchical clustering;large databases;outliers;shrinking operation","","4","","14","","","2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the literature on combining forecasts has almost exclusively focused on linear combined forecasts. The issues and methods of nonlinear combined forecasts have not yet been fully explored, even though forecast improvements may be possible using nonlinear combination techniques. We investigate the fuzzy neural network (FNN) as a tool for nonlinear combined forecasts. The performance of the networks is evaluated by comparing them to two individual forecasting methods and three conventional linear combining methods. The outcome of the comparison proved that the prediction by the FNN method generally performs better than those by individual forecasting methods, as well as linear combining methods. The paper suggests that the FNN method can be used as an alternative to conventional linear combining methods to achieve greater forecasting accuracy. Superiority of the FNN arises because of its flexibility in accounting for potentially complex nonlinear relationships not easily captured by traditional linear models.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175421","","Artificial neural networks;Computer science;Economic forecasting;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy systems;Mathematics;Neural networks;Predictive models;Testing","forecasting theory;fuzzy neural nets","complex nonlinear relationships;forecasting accuracy;fuzzy neural network;nonlinear combining forecast method","","1","","16","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But in some applications, such as time series forecasting including stock share forecasting, due to their preset sample sets may contain some exceptions and erroneous results, it is desired to introduce some self-adjusting and probabilistic decision-making mechanism to enhance the accuracy of classification.

The measure is determined in three steps: first, a sememe network is built from concept feature files of HowNet for preparation; then semantic similarity degrees between sememes are given by quantifying their semantic paths in the sememe network, and a sememe weighting method is also provided; finally, a system similarity based semantic similarity degree between Chinese words is presented to combine these elements into a single measure.

The original classifier, DeEPs, is an instance-based classifier that operates on all instances in real-time. It discovers maximal patterns that occur throughout the entire database and identifies JEPs by using these patterns. The necessary computational effort, though, is likely to increase when DeEPs is applied to a large database. Our proposed classifier operates on the nearest neighbors of a test instance. This reduction of instances improves scalability as the database volume increases. Moreover, our classifier imposes a restriction regarding JEPs discovery, so that it excludes patterns that cannot be identified as either correct JEPs or JEPs caused by the maximal patterns missing from nearest neighbors. These probably incorrect JEPs are specialized with additional items and participate in class determination. Our classifier perform significantly faster with these two enhancements, while it remains as accurate as the original classifier.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175372","","Association rules;Cities and towns;Databases;Electronic mail;Frequency;Laboratories;Nearest neighbor searches;Scalability;Testing;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","DeEPs;classification methodologies;classifying;jumping emerging patterns;machine leaming;nearest neighbors;scalable classifier","","0","","10","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By this structure, a forecast model can't generate an explosive number of states. All the forecast process can be performed on the MTM. During the forecast procedure, a recursive process is adopted to handle the problem of low coverage. If a higher sequence can't get a result, a lower sequence may be used.

It can be achieved in a simple and effective way with texture analysis by regarding fonts as different textures. But Gabor filters with traditional parameters, which are used to extract features in the previous approach, are not much suitable to font recognition and the RR (Recognition Rate) will decrease sharply when the similar fonts are recognized since the font textures is different from natural textures. Therefore, some adjustments are proposed in this paper to improve the RR: 1. A bank of optimized filters can be gotten by using Genetic Algorithm to optimize the orientation parameters. It can be used to extract distinct features to identify the font well. 2. For reducing the FAR (False-Accept Rate), several dictionaries are set to deal with the diversity in textures of the same font. Experiments are carried out with 899 textures of 4 frequently used Chinese fonts in newspaper, the results compared with the previous show that RR can be improved and the adjustments are useful.","","POD:0-7803-7508-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2002.1175331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1175331","","Computer science;Dictionaries;Feature extraction;Filter bank;Flowcharts;Gabor filters;Genetic algorithms;Image reconstruction;Image restoration;Optical character recognition software","character recognition;genetic algorithms;image texture","Chinese fonts;Gabor filters;OCR system;RR;font recognition;genetic algorithm;newspaper;orientation parameters;texture analysis;texture feature","","4","","9","","","4-5 Nov. 2002","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The base of this regulator is a direct digital predictive loop which has a very good dynamic performance, but the steady state performance will heavily depend on the accuracy of the model structure and plant's parameters. To reduce the steady errors and compensate the system uncertainties, a feedforward control loop and a fuzzy logic algorithm are introduced. The direct digital predictive loop with the feedforward loop, which can be seen as a hybrid current regulator, generates the command voltage based on the nominal system conditions, guarantees the system with a very fast dynamic response and a smaller system error. The fuzzy logic algorithm, by measuring the amplitude and phase angle of the system error, generates a modifying signal to correct the gains of the direct digital predictive loop and the feedforward loop. When the difference between the reference and actual signals is larger than a given threshold, therefore it minimizes the effects of system uncertainties.

However, QJK data handling in knowledge management is still a critical issue for m-Learning development because most thin-client technology is developed in Western countries that support only alphabet-based languages, while the number of QJK users Increases greatly. In this paper, a novel technique is presented to enhance the interaction and communication between the teachers and students in the m-Learning platform by using multi-agent. The Student Agents are responsible to organize and analyze the learning activities, then carry these QJK knowledge flows and report to the Instructor Agents. By using these globalized user client agents to monitor the study progress of the students in the multi-agent platform, it not only allows instructors to identify the actual need for each student beside of the student's direct request, but also help the. developer to delivery international m-Learning application.

In this paper, we present a new approach by building customer profiles based on the product hierarchy for more effective personalization in electronic commerce. We divide each customer profile into three parts: the basic profile, preference profile, and rule profile. Based on the customer profiles, two kinds of recommendations can be generated: interest recommendation and association recommendation. We also propose a special data structure: a profile tree for effective searching and matching.

The aim of this paper is to present the design of ""direct feedback linearization"" (DFL), which can solve the problems related to the nonlinear characteristic of the plant, and to apply the DFL method to a water-level nonlinear plant to improve its performance. The real time control experiments show that the DFL which linearizes the water-level nonlinear plant is valid in the large range, while the classical linearization method is valid only in the small range. Under the precondition of no steady-state error, there is no peak overshoot.
