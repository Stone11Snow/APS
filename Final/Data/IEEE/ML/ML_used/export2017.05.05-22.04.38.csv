To be precise, we extract connected components (CCs) in images by using the maximally stable extremal region algorithm. These extracted CCs are partitioned into clusters so that we can generate candidate regions. Unlike conventional methods relying on heuristic rules in clustering, we train an AdaBoost classifier that determines the adjacency relationship and cluster CCs by using their pairwise relations. Then we normalize candidate word regions and determine whether each region contains text or not. Since the scale, skew, and color of each candidate can be estimated from CCs, we develop a text/nontext classifier for normalized images. This classifier is based on multilayer perceptrons and we can control recall and precision rates with a single free parameter. Finally, we extend our approach to exploit multichannel information. Experimental results on ICDAR 2005 and 2011 robust reading competition datasets show that our method yields the state-of-the-art performance both in speed and accuracy.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2249082","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471224","CC clustering;connected component (CC)-based approach;machine learning classifier;nontext filtering;scene text detection","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Partitioning algorithms;Robustness;Training","heuristic programming;image classification;multilayer perceptrons;text detection","CC;ICDAR 2005;ICDAR 2011;component clustering;heuristic rules;machine learning classifiers;multichannel information;multilayer perceptrons;nontext filtering;normalized images;pairwise relations;scene text detection algorithm;text-nontext classifier","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Cluster Analysis;Databases, Factual;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated","61","","28","","20130226","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By research, many methods have been proposed for dimensionality reduction, beside the feature subset selection and feature-ranking methods show significant achievement in dimensionality reduction by removing irrelevant and redundant features in high-dimensional data. This improves the prediction accuracy of the classifier, reduces the false prediction ratio and reduces the time and space complexity for building the prediction model.

In the real world environment, it is often very difficult for any verification system to handle a huge collection of data, and to detect the genuine signatures with relatively good accuracy. Consequently, some artificial intelligence technique are used that can learn from the huge data set, in its training phase and can respond accurately, in its application phase without consuming much storage memory space and computational time. In addition, it should also have the ability to continuously update its knowledge from real time experiences. One such adaptive machine learning technique called a Multi-Layered Neural Network Model (NN Model) is implemented for the purpose of this work. Initially, a huge set of data is generated by collecting the images of several genuine and forgery signatures. The quality of the images is improved by using image processing followed by further extracting certain unique standard statistical features in its feature extraction phase. This output is given as the input to the above proposed NN Model to further improve its decision making capabilities. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by calculating the fault acceptance and rejection rates for a small set of data. Further possible developments of this model are also outlined.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4529-3; POD:978-1-4673-4527-9","10.1109/IAdCC.2013.6514374","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6514374","Eigen Values;Fault Rejection Rate (FRR) and Fault Acceptance Rate (FAR);Image Dispersion Matrix;Image Processing;Machine Learning Technique;Mean;Multi-Layered Neural Network Model;Rotation Matrix;Standard Deviation;Trend Coeffcients","Artificial neural networks;Feature extraction;Forgery;Image color analysis;Mathematical model;Standards","feature extraction;handwriting recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","NN model;application phase;artificial intelligence technique;fault acceptance rate;fault rejection rate;feature extraction;forgery signature;image processing;image quality;multilayered neural network model;offline signature verification system;signature authentication;signature detection;statistical feature;training phase","","1","","5","","","22-23 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In particular, vehicle verification is especially challenging on account of the heterogeneity of vehicles in color, size, pose, etc. Image-based vehicle verification is usually addressed as a supervised classification problem. Specifically, descriptors using Gabor filters have been reported to show good performance in this task. However, Gabor functions have a number of drawbacks relating to their frequency response. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and evaluation of a new descriptor based on the alternative family of log-Gabor functions for vehicle verification, as opposed to existing Gabor filter-based descriptors. These filters are theoretically superior to Gabor filters as they can better represent the frequency properties of natural images. As a second contribution, and in contrast to existing approaches, which transfer the standard configuration of filters used for other applications to the vehicle classification task, an in-depth analysis of the required filter configuration by both Gabor and log-Gabor descriptors for this particular application is performed for fair comparison. The extensive experiments conducted in this paper confirm that the proposed log-Gabor descriptor significantly outperforms the standard Gabor filter for image-based vehicle verification.","1057-7149;10577149","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2249080","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471222","Gabor filter;hypothesis verification;intelligent vehicles;log-Gabor filters;machine learning","Accuracy;Bandwidth;Feature extraction;Frequency response;Gabor filters;Standards;Vehicles","Gabor filters;frequency response;object detection;traffic engineering computing;vehicles","collision avoidance;frequency response;image-based vehicle verification;in-depth analysis;log-Gabor descriptors;log-Gabor filters;natural images;standard configuration;supervised classification problem;vehicle classification task;vehicle detection;vehicle heterogeneity","","22","","38","","20130226","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective of the transcoder is to migrate the abundant MPEG-2 video content to the emerging HEVC video coding standard. The transcoder introduces a content-based machine learning solution to predict the depth of the HEVC coding units. The proposed transcoder utilizes full re-encoding to find a mapping between the incoming MPEG-2 coding information and the outgoing HEVC depths of the coding units. Once the model is built, a switch to transcoding mode occurs. Hence, the model is content based and varies from one video sequence to another. The transcoder is compared against full re-encoding using the default HEVC fast motion estimation. Using HEVC test sequences, it is shown that a speedup factor of up to 3 is achieved, while reducing the bitrate of the incoming video by around 50%. In comparison to full re-encoding, an average of 3.9% excessive bitrate is encountered with an average PSNR drop of 0.1 dB. Since this is the first work to report on MPEG-2 to HEVC video transcoding, the reported results can be used as a benchmark for future transcoding research.","1051-8215;10518215","","10.1109/TCSVT.2013.2241352","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6415262","Codecs;high efficiency video coding (HEVC);machine learning;transcoding video","Bit rate;PSNR;Transcoding;Transform coding;Vectors;Video coding","image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);motion estimation;video coding","HEVC coding units;HEVC fast motion estimation;HEVC video coding standard;HEVC video transcoding;MPEG-2 video content;MPEG-2 video transcoding;content based machine learning solution;content based modeling;high efficiency video coding;transcoding mode;video sequence","","22","","18","","20130118","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Some of these studies have shown that it is possible to obtain satisfactory results, thereby contradicting the theory of Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) that suggests that prices are randomly generated over time. This paper proposes an intelligent system based on historical closing prices that uses technical analysis, the Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC), a selection of past values (lags), nearest neighbor classification (k-NN) and its variation, the Adaptative Classification and Nearest Neighbor (A-k-NN). A very important step for time series prediction is the correct selection of the past observations (lags). Our method uses this strategy since it uses the k-NN and A-k-NN to decide on the buy and seIl points, combined with the ABC algorithm which is used to search for the best parameter settings of system and a good set of lags. This paper compares the results obtained by the proposed method with the buy and hold strategy and with other work that performed similar experiments with the same trading model and the same stocks.

Concept drift can be sudden, gradual or reoccuring. Understanding the consequences of concept drift is particularly important in human-centric applications where changes in the underlying data and environment are common and unexpected. In order to gain a better understanding of the adverse effects of different types of concept drift on learners, we propose a novel simulation tool that is able to incrementally generate datasets with customisable concept drift by interacting with a human in a game-like setting. We illustrate our approach by generating and analysing concept drift simulations inspired by body-sensor based long-term activity recognition. Our initial results show that current unsupervised adaptation techniques can be caught in cyclic mislabelling and that a hybrid solution that is self-calibrating and semi-supervised is more robust than any of the two taken separately for this example.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5077-8; POD:978-1-4673-5075-4; USB:978-1-4673-5076-1","10.1109/PerComW.2013.6529455","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6529455","Activity Recognition;Adaptive Learners;Concept Drift;Machine Learning;Semi-supervised Learning;Unsupervised Learning","Adaptation models;Calibration;Data models;Noise;Real-time systems;Robustness;Training","learning (artificial intelligence)","body-sensor;concept drift simulation;cyclic mislabelling;game-like setting;human-centric application;interactive simulation;long-term activity recognition;machine learning;simulation tool;unsupervised adaptation","","0","","15","","","18-22 March 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Rainbow framework from Carnegie Mellon University is an example of such a capability that uses an ability to reason on and manipulate a formal model of the network architecture to decide what changes to make in response to the situation. Probes and gauges feed the reasoning capability. These probes and gauges can provide some situational awareness to both systems and human controllers, but at a low level of abstraction making it difficult to gain an understanding of the status of a large network of complex systems. We believe that a side effect of utilizing an autonomic framework is enhanced situational awareness at a higher level of abstraction. This paper describes work in progress to develop gauges for Rainbow that incorporate machine learning to allow for early recognition of situation changes. It also describes how the use of strategy selection not only allows the network to adapt, but also to inform situational awareness.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2437-3; POD:978-1-5090-0002-9","10.1109/CogSIMA.2013.6523835","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6523835","abstraction;autonomics;machine learning;reasoning","Adaptation models;Command and control systems;Computer architecture;Fuels;Monitoring;Probes;Vehicles","closed loop systems;fault tolerant computing;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence)","Carnegie Mellon University;Rainbow framework;abstraction;autonomic control system;autonomic framework;closed-loop controller;formal model;human controller;machine learning;network architecture;reasoning capability;self-management capability;situation change recognition;situational awareness","","0","","9","","","25-28 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately, the metrics are used to derive only hard decisions which are often threshold-based and therefore unable to assign a measure of likelihood to the candidate modulation schemes. Bayesian Networks are a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution for a set of variables, but have been investigated for the task of classification of an unknown and unobservable variable whose related variables can be observed and measured. Bayesian Network Classifiers (BNC) are an exciting approach to the problem of using a set of observable features to infer the distribution of a class variable like the modulation scheme. BNCs are especially attractive because they are agnostic to the types of features which are observed and because they give a measure of probability that the classification is correct as well as the probabilities for the alternatives. In this work, we extend a previous effort [1] to explicitly investigate the potential use of BNC for classification in cognitive radio applications. We present some preliminary results using a simple set of metrics to demonstrate signal classification using a Naive BNC. We show how performance can be improved with a more complex BNC known as a Tree-Augmented Bayesian Network Classifier (TAN).

Incremental Support Vector Machine is used to learn data incrementally from previous stored data and also to avoid large training time and memory consumption for face recognition. In this approach ORL (Olivetti Research Laboratory)[28] face database is used for performing experiments and the results has proved that not only the training time but also the updating time taken by Incremental SVM is very less.

Functional fault diagnosis is, therefore, necessary for board-level product qualification. However, ambiguous diagnosis results lead to long debug times and even wrong repair actions, which significantly increase repair cost and adversely impact yield. Advanced machine-learning (ML) techniques offer an unprecedented opportunity to increase the accuracy of board-level functional diagnosis and reduce high-volume manufacturing cost through successful repair. We propose a smart diagnosis method based on two ML classification models, namely, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support-vector machines (SVMs) that can learn from repair history and accurately localize the root cause of a failure. Fine-grained fault syndromes extracted from failure logs and corresponding repair actions are used to train the classification models. We also propose a decision machine based on weighted-majority voting, which combines the benefits of ANNs and SVMs. Three complex boards from the industry, currently in volume production, and additional synthetic data, are used to validate the proposed methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy, resolution, and quantifiable improvement over current diagnostic software.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2012.2234827","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6504533","Board-level;diagnosis;functional failure;machine learning (ML);neural networks;support-vector machines (SVMs)","Artificial neural networks;Circuit faults;Fault diagnosis;Maintenance engineering;Neurons;Training;Vectors","application specific integrated circuits;electronic engineering computing;fault diagnosis;integrated circuit testing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;support vector machines","ANN;SVM;artificial neural network;board-level functional fault diagnosis;board-level product qualification;classification model;decision machine;failure logs;fine-grained fault syndrome;high-volume manufacturing cost;machine-learning;smart diagnosis method;support-vector machine;volume production;weighted-majority voting","","29","","26","","","May 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Recently developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy-interference system models are set up and their performance compared with the other models, using the same data. Literature models often neglect the influence of the ambient temperature and the wind direction. The ambient temperature can influence the power output up to 20%. Nearby obstacles can lower the power output for certain wind directions. The approaches proposed in literature and the ANFIS models are compared by using wind speed only and two additional inputs. The comparison is based on the mean absolute error, root mean squared error, mean absolute percentage error, and standard deviation using data coming from three pitch regulated turbines rating 2 MW each.

A number of different approaches to PD defect diagnosis have been developed to extract defect-specific information from PD pulse data in both the time and frequency domains. Frequency-based PD pulse analysis has previously been demonstrated to offer a low-power approach to PD defect identification, where a mixture of passive and active analog electronics can be used to generate diagnostic features in a low-power device suited to wireless sensor network operation. This paper examines approaches to implementing diagnostic methods for frequency-based PD pulse diagnosis targeted at compositional frequency spectrum features in a computationally efficient manner. Dirichlet and Gaussian distributions are used to demonstrate the complex probabilistic form of fault class decision surfaces, which motivates the proposed application of the log ratio transform to frequency composition data. The results demonstrate that PD defects can be differentiated using these frequency-based methods and that employing the log ratio transform to the compositional frequency content data yields increases in classification accuracy without necessarily resorting to more complex classifiers.","0018-9456;00189456","","10.1109/TIM.2013.2247711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6477124","Condition monitoring;RF signals;fault diagnosis;machine learning;partial discharge (PD);wireless sensor networks","Frequency measurement;Monitoring;Partial discharges;Pulse measurements;Radio frequency;Substations;Wireless sensor networks","Gaussian distribution;condition monitoring;high-voltage techniques;insulation;partial discharges;pulsed power technology;time-frequency analysis;wireless sensor networks","Dirichlet distribution;Gaussian distribution;PD defect diagnosis;active analog electronics;complex probabilistic form;compositional frequency spectrum feature;defect specific information extraction;diagnostic feature generation;fault class decision surface;frequency domain analysis;frequency-based PD pulse analysis;high voltage plant;insulation health monitoring;log ratio transform;partial discharge monitoring;partial discharge pulse spectral characteristics;passive electronics;time domain analysis;wireless sensor network","","5","","48","","20130311","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Blue-green algae or cyanobacteria thrive in these eutrophic conditions, since they require little energy for cell maintenance and growth. Microcystis are a type of blue-green algae of particular concern, because they produce microcystin, a potent hepatotoxin. Microcystin not only presents a threat to the ecosystem, but it threatens commercial fishing operations and water treatment plants using the lake as a water source. In this paper, we have proposed an early warning system using Integrated Data Fusion and Machine-learning (IDFM) techniques to determine microcystin concentrations and distribution by measuring the surface reflectance of the water body using satellite sensors. The fine spatial resolution of Landsat is fused with the high temporal resolution of MODIS to create a synthetic image possessing both high temporal and spatial resolution. As a demonstration, the spatiotemporal distribution of microcystin within western Lake Erie is reconstructed using the band data from the fused products and applied machine-learning techniques.

The algorithm described in this paper, referred to as Dynamic Logic (DL), has been applied previously to radar signal processing to achieve a track-before-detect capability. This suggests that DL could improve the detection of extremely dim moving objects in image data as well. The concept of hierarchical dynamic logic is used to supervise image pre-processing and interpret and detect moving objects directly from star-field.

However, precise assessments must take into account the fact that the requirements for the given quality level are service-dependent. The backbone QoS monitoring and analysis requires processing of large amounts of data and knowledge of which kinds of applications the traffic is generated by. To overcome the drawbacks of existing methods for traffic classification, we proposed and evaluated a centralized solution based on the C5.0 Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) and decision rules. The first task was to collect and to provide to C5.0 high-quality training data divided into groups, which correspond to different types of applications. It was found that the currently existing means of collecting data (classification by ports, Deep Packet Inspection, statistical classification, public data sources) are not sufficient and they do not comply with the required standards. We developed a new system to collect training data, in which the major role is performed by volunteers. Client applications installed on volunteers' computers collect the detailed data about each flow passing through the network interface, together with the application name taken from the description of system sockets. This paper proposes a new method for measuring the level of Quality of Service in broadband networks. It is based on our Volunteer-Based System to collect the training data, Machine Learning Algorithms to generate the classification rules and the application-specific rules for assessing the QoS level. We combine both passive and active monitoring technologies.

Although photographers are able to create composites of analog pictures, this process is very time consuming and requires expert knowledge. Today, however, powerful digital image editing software makes image modifications straightforward. This undermines our trust in photographs and, in particular, questions pictures as evidence for real-world events. In this paper, we analyze one of the most common forms of photographic manipulation, known as image composition or splicing. We propose a forgery detection method that exploits subtle inconsistencies in the color of the illumination of images. Our approach is machine-learning-based and requires minimal user interaction. The technique is applicable to images containing two or more people and requires no expert interaction for the tampering decision. To achieve this, we incorporate information from physics- and statistical-based illuminant estimators on image regions of similar material. From these illuminant estimates, we extract texture- and edge-based features which are then provided to a machine-learning approach for automatic decision-making. The classification performance using an SVM meta-fusion classifier is promising. It yields detection rates of 86% on a new benchmark dataset consisting of 200 images, and 83% on 50 images that were collected from the Internet.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2013.2265677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522874","Color constancy;illuminant color;image forensics;machine learning;spliced image detection;texture and edge descriptors","Cameras;Estimation;Forgery;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Lighting","Internet;decision making;edge detection;image classification;image colour analysis;image segmentation;image texture;image thinning;learning (artificial intelligence);lighting;photography;security of data","Internet;SVM meta-fusion classiffier;analog pictures;automatic decision-making;benchmark dataset;digital image editing software;digital image forgeries;edge-based features;expert knowledge;illumination color classification;image composition;image illumination;image modification;image splicing;machine learning-based approach;photographic manipulation;photographs;physics-based illuminant estimators;real-world events;space-time events;statistical-based illuminant estimators;tampering decision;texture-based features;user interaction","","21","","49","","20130603","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We restrict our considerations to the predominant scenario in which fitness computations are based on point estimates. Three different sources of losing generalization performance when evolving learning machines, namely overfitting to training, test, and final selection data, are identified, discussed, and experimentally demonstrated. The importance of a pristine hold-out data set for the selection of the final result from the evolved candidates is highlighted.

"Evolving Diverse Ensembles Using Genetic Programming for Classification With Unbalanced Data","U. Bhowan; M. Johnston; M. Zhang; X. Yao","Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand","IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","20130524","2013","17","3","368","386","In classification, machine learning algorithms can suffer a performance bias when data sets are unbalanced. Data sets are unbalanced when at least one class is represented by only a small number of training examples (called the minority class), while the other class(es) make up the majority. In this scenario, classifiers can have good accuracy on the majority class, but very poor accuracy on the minority class(es). This paper proposes a multiobjective genetic programming (MOGP) approach to evolving accurate and diverse ensembles of genetic program classifiers with good performance on both the minority and majority of classes. The evolved ensembles comprise of nondominated solutions in the population where individual members vote on class membership. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of two popular Pareto-based fitness strategies in the MOGP algorithm (SPEA2 and NSGAII), and investigates techniques to encourage diversity between solutions in the evolved ensembles. Experimental results on six (binary) class imbalance problems show that the evolved ensembles outperform their individual members, as well as single-predictor methods such as canonical GP, naive Bayes, and support vector machines, on highly unbalanced tasks. This highlights the importance of developing an effective fitness evaluation strategy in the underlying MOGP algorithm to evolve good ensemble members.","1089-778X;1089778X","","10.1109/TEVC.2012.2199119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6198882","Classification;class imbalance learning;genetic programming (GP);multiobjective machine learning (ML)","Accuracy;Bagging;Benchmark testing;Boosting;Optimization;Silicon;Training","Bayes methods;Pareto optimisation;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","MOGP;Pareto-based fitness strategies;canonical GP;class imbalance problems;diverse ensembles evolution;genetic program classifiers;machine learning algorithms;minority classes;multiobjective genetic programming approach;naive Bayes;single-predictor methods;support vector machines;unbalanced data classification","","45","","52","","20120511","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The approach utilizes techniques drawn from the machine learning community in order to learn statistical models of human decision making. Models are fit to an experimental data set generated by remote operations of a robot subjected to time delays between 0 and 2.5 s, using the least angle regression (LARS) and sparse multinomial logistic regression (SMLR) algorithms. These algorithms make use of regularization to reduce the effects of overparameterization due to redundant or noisy environmental features. Models learned by LARS achieve an average prediction rate between 81% and 98%, depending on time delay, while those learned by SMLR achieve average rates between 68% and 86%. A novel metric of feature “importance” is used to evaluate the relative contributions of environmental features to model performance, motivated by the structure of the LARS algorithm. The degree to which human operators rely on anticipation is determined by examining how “importance” scores for features representing different prediction horizons vary with increasing time delay.","2168-2216;21682216","","10.1109/TSMCA.2012.2220541","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6425551","Decision modeling;delay systems;human–robot interaction;machine learning;predictive control;remotely operated vehicles","Cameras;Data models;Delay;Delay effects;Humans;Robot vision systems","delay systems;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;regression analysis;remotely operated vehicles;statistical analysis;telerobotics","LARS;SMLR algorithm;environmental feature;human controller;human decision making;least angle regression;machine learning;overparameterization effect;probabilistic modeling;remote vehicle control;robot;sparse multinomial logistic regression;statistical model;time delay","","2","","22","","20130201","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A brief description of some of the soft computing-based techniques, developed for RNA secondary structure prediction, is presented along with their relevance. The basic concepts of RNA and its different structural elements like helix, bulge, hairpin loop, internal loop, and multiloop are described. These are followed by different methodologies, employing genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic.

For example, transmissions between nodes that are heavily obstructed will require additional transmission power to establish connection between nodes. In some cases, heavily obstructed areas may prevent nodes from establishing a connection at all. Therefore, terrain analysis and classification of specific deployment areas should be incorporated in the methodology process for evaluation and optimization of the performance of wireless sensor networks upon deployment. Although there exists radio frequency (RF) models capable of modeling obstructions, such as vegetation, foliage, etc., automatic assignment of parameter values for these models may be troublesome, specifically in highly irregular deployments terrains, where proximity of poor and optimal conditions for signal propagation may be adjacent to each other. In these situations, parameter estimation for modeling terrain obstruction may result in overly optimistic or pessimistic results, causing characterizations or predictions that deviate from the true performance of the WSN once deployed. This paper presents the results of employing a support vector machine for automatic terrain classification. The approach can be used to automatically determine areas of high obstruction, which is essential to estimate obstruction parameters in simulations and enhancing the overall decision-making process during pre-deployment of large-scale and irregular deployment terrains.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-3108-1; POD:978-1-4673-3107-4","10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549982","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549982","deployments;image processing;machine learning;modeling and simulation;performance evaluation;wireless sensor networks","Image color analysis;Modeling;Optimization;Planning;Support vector machines;Vegetation mapping;Wireless sensor networks","decision making;geophysical image processing;image classification;parameter estimation;performance evaluation;support vector machines;terrain mapping;vegetation;wireless sensor networks","RF models;automatic assignment;automatic terrain classification;decision-making process;deployment methodology;deployments terrains;foliage;heavily obstructed areas;large-scale wireless sensor networks;methodology process;obstruction parameter estimation;on-demand deployments;performance evaluation;performance optimization;radio frequency models;signal propagation;support vector machine;terrain analysis;terrain characteristics;terrain obstruction;transmission power;vegetation","","5","","23","","","15-18 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A more realistic scenario for vision applications is “open set” recognition, where incomplete knowledge of the world is present at training time, and unknown classes can be submitted to an algorithm during testing. This paper explores the nature of open set recognition and formalizes its definition as a constrained minimization problem. The open set recognition problem is not well addressed by existing algorithms because it requires strong generalization. As a step toward a solution, we introduce a novel “1-vs-set machine,” which sculpts a decision space from the marginal distances of a 1-class or binary SVM with a linear kernel. This methodology applies to several different applications in computer vision where open set recognition is a challenging problem, including object recognition and face verification. We consider both in this work, with large scale cross-dataset experiments performed over the Caltech 256 and ImageNet sets, as well as face matching experiments performed over the Labeled Faces in the Wild set.

Its advantage is that the history of ratings and extra knowledge are not needed, so a new tourist can obtain recommendation. Focusing on the attractions on Trip Advisor, we use different machine learning methods to produce prediction of ratings, so as to determine whether these approaches and demographic information of tourists are suitable for providing recommendations.

The primary purpose of this paper is to find an alternative well-established SML-based method to estimate bulk soil moisture directly from the cosmic ray sensors that would effectively replace the current calibration equations. The second aspect of this paper is to find an alternative method to replace the cosmic ray sensor's current expensive and time-consuming field soil sample collection protocol. Data collected over 350 consecutive days from Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) database and Hydroinnova CRS-1000 cosmic ray soil moisture probe deployed in Tullochgorum, Tasmania are used in this paper. Prediction performances of the four supervised estimators, such as sugano type adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (S-ANFIS), multilayer perceptron network, probabilistic neural network, and radial basis function network are evaluated using training and testing paradigms. The best result indicates that S-ANFIS is able to match the results achieved using existing calibration equations with a 87% accuracy. Secondly, AWAP data trained S-ANFIS is able to predict bulk soil moisture directly from cosmic ray neutron counts with a 92% accuracy without using any collected field sample-based measurements.

Work on the mechanics of implementing metrics programs. The goal of this research is to help developers identify defects based on existing software metrics using data mining techniques and thereby improve software quality which ultimately leads to reducing the software development cost in the development and maintenance phase. This research focuses in identifying defective modules and hence the scope of software that needs to be examined for defects can be prioritized. This allows the developer to run test cases in the predicted modules using test cases. The proposed methodology helps in identifying modules that require immediate attention and hence the reliability of the software can be improved faster as higher priority defects can be handled first.

The expected total transmitted data during the transmitter's activation time is maximized under three different sets of assumptions regarding the information available at the transmitter about the underlying stochastic processes. A learning theoretic approach is introduced, which does not assume any a priori information on the Markov processes governing the communication system. In addition, online and offline optimization problems are studied for the same setting. Full statistical knowledge and causal information on the realizations of the underlying stochastic processes are assumed in the online optimization problem, while the offline optimization problem assumes non-causal knowledge of the realizations in advance.

In this study, publicly available data sets from different organizations are used. This permitted us to explore the impact of data from different sources on different processes for finding appropriate classification models. We propose a computational framework using data mining techniques to detect the existence of defects in software components. The framework comprises of data pre-processing, data classification and classifier evaluation. In this paper; we report the performance of twenty classification algorithms on seven publicly available datasets from the NASA MDP Repository. Random Tree Classification algorithm produced 100 percent accuracy in classifying the datasets and hence the features selected by this technique were considered to be the most significant features.

The high-throughput parallel divider in the moving-average engine is a new solution to reduce the computational time of one division operation to a single clock cycle and to calculate cumulative moving averages with no precision loss. Two hardware examples show the robustness of the proposed architecture, and the architectural analysis is performed with the 90 nm CMOS technology.

In the second example, the architecture is compared with related works, which implement the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm.

While recent research in object detection has largely been focused on objects on the ground, we have developed a layered detection algorithm to address challenges in the maritime domain by fusing cues from (1) a discriminative detection algorithm that learns a vessel target model from hundreds of vessel images, and (2) a dynamic texture-based background model that adaptively learns the spatiotemporal dynamics of sea clutter.

In such a complex environment, forecasting electricity prices is a very challenging task; nonetheless, it is of paramount importance for market participants and system operators. Day-ahead price forecasting is performed in the present paper using a kernel-based method. This machine learning approach offers unique advantages over existing alternatives, especially in systematically exploiting the spatio-temporal nature of locational marginal prices (LMPs), while nonlinear cause-effect relationships can be captured by carefully selected similarities. Beyond conventional time-series data, non-vectorial attributes (e.g., hour of the day, day of the week, balancing authority) are transparently utilized. The novel approach is tested on real data from the Midwest ISO (MISO) day-ahead electricity market over the summer of 2012, during which MISO's load peak record was observed. The resultant day-ahead LMP forecasts outperform price repetition and ordinary linear regression, thus offering a promising inference tool for the electricity market.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4896-6; POD:978-1-4673-4894-2; USB:978-1-4673-4895-9","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497797","Locational marginal prices;kriging filtering;machine learning;wholesale electricity market","Correlation;Electricity;Electricity supply industry;Forecasting;Kernel;Predictive models;Pricing","demand side management;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power markets;power system reliability;pricing;regression analysis","LMP;MISO day-ahead electricity market;day-ahead LMP forecasts;day-ahead electricity market forecasting;day-ahead price forecasting;demand response programs;electricity market puzzle;electricity price forecasting;fuel markets;kernel-based method;life cycles;locational marginal prices;machine learning approach;market participants;midwest ISO;nonlinear cause-effect relationships;nonvectorial attributes;ordinary linear regression;price repetition;reliability rules;renewable energy resources;system operators;time-series data;weather","","4","","19","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It allows to implement applications to Information Security, with major on anomaly detection Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Its key feature is the online selection of the number of mixture components together with the fitting parameter of each component. With many components the description is accurate. However, the computational burden increases as well. The best compromise between the description accuracy and the computational complexity is given by a derivation of the Minimum Message Length (MML) information criterion. The normal network behavior is assumed to be interpreted by the cluster with the highest covariance matrix, while the other smaller components are considered representing anomalies.

Twitter spammers can achieve their malicious goals such as sending spam, spreading malware, hosting botnet command and control (C&C) channels, and launching other underground illicit activities. Due to the significance and indispensability of detecting and suspending those spam accounts, many researchers along with the engineers at Twitter Inc. have devoted themselves to keeping Twitter as spam-free online communities. Most of the existing studies utilize machine learning techniques to detect Twitter spammers. “While the priest climbs a post, the devil climbs ten.” Twitter spammers are evolving to evade existing detection features. In this paper, we first make a comprehensive and empirical analysis of the evasion tactics utilized by Twitter spammers. We further design several new detection features to detect more Twitter spammers. In addition, to deeply understand the effectiveness and difficulties of using machine learning features to detect spammers, we analyze the robustness of 24 detection features that are commonly utilized in the literature as well as our proposed ones. Through our experiments, we show that our new designed features are much more effective to be used to detect (even evasive) Twitter spammers. According to our evaluation, while keeping an even lower false positive rate, the detection rate using our new feature set is also significantly higher than that of existing work. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first empirical study and evaluation of the effect of evasion tactics utilized by Twitter spammers and is a valuable supplement to this line of research.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2013.2267732","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6553246","Online social network websites;Twitter;machine learning;spam","Crawlers;Detectors;Feature extraction;Robustness;Semantics;Twitter","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);unsolicited e-mail","OSN;Twitter spammers;botnet command;botnet control;detection rate;evasion tactics;false positive rate;machine learning features;malicious goals;malware;microblogging site;online social networks;spam accounts;spam-free online communities;underground illicit activities","","35","","44","","","Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The resulting manifold is based on those features that best discriminate between given emotional classes in the target space of specified embedding dimension. A nonlinear mapping function based on generalized regression neural networks (GRNNs) provides generalization for new data. A low-dimensional manifold of emotional speech data consisting of neutral, sad, angry, and happy expressions was constructed using prosodic and acoustic features of speech. Experimental results indicate that a 3D embedding provides the best classification performance. The manifold structure can be readily visualized and matches the circumplex and conical shapes predicted by dimensional models of emotion.

As a class of simple but efficient collaborative filtering method, similarity based approaches make predictions by finding users with similar taste or items that have been similarly chosen. However, as the number of users or items grows rapidly, the traditional approach is suffering from the data sparsity problem. Inaccurate similarities derived from the sparse user-item associations would generate the inaccurate neighborhood for each user or item. Consequently, its poor recommendation drives us to propose a Threshold based Similarity Transitivity (TST) method in this paper. TST firstly filters out those inaccurate similarities by setting an intersection threshold and then replaces them with the transitivity similarity. Besides, the TST method is designed to be scalable with MapReduce framework based on cloud computing platform. We evaluate our algorithm on the public data set MovieLens and a real-world data set from AppChina (an Android application market) with several well-known metrics including precision, recall, coverage, and popularity. The experimental results demonstrate that TST copes well with the tradeoff between quality and quantity of similarity by setting an appropriate threshold. Moreover, we can experimentally find the optimal threshold which will be smaller as the data set becomes sparser. The experimental results also show that TST significantly outperforms the traditional approach even when the data becomes sparser.","","","10.1109/TST.2013.6522590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6522590","android applications;big data;cloud computing;collaborative filtering;data mining;machine learning;mapReduce;recommender systems;similaritytransitivity","","","","","5","","","","","June 2013","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

More specifically, the goal of this research was to discover the contexts that a human actor experienced, while performing a tactical task in a simulated environment, the sequence of these contexts and their temporal duration. We refer to this process as the contextualization of the performance trace. In the process of doing this, we devised a context discovery algorithm called context partitioning and clustering (COPAC). The relevant variables that were observed in the trace were selected a priori by a human. The output of the COPAC algorithm was qualitatively compared with manual (human) contextualization of the same traces. One possible use of such automated context discovery is to help build autonomous tactical agents capable of performing the same tasks as the human actor. As such, we also quantitatively compared the results of using the COPAC-derived contexts with those obtained with human-derived contextualization in building autonomous tactical agents. Test results are described and discussed.","2168-2291;21682291","","10.1109/TSMC.2013.2262272","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6548033","Context;clustering;context discovery;context-based reasoning;human behavior representation;learning from observation;machine learning","Behavioral science;Clustering;Context awareness;Human factors;Knowledge discovery;Learning (artificial intelligence);Machine learning","behavioural sciences computing;cognition;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;pattern clustering","COPAC algorithm;COPAC-derived context;context discovery;context discovery algorithm;context identification;context partitioning-and-clustering algorithm;human performance;human-derived contextualization;performance trace contextualization;tactical agent;temporal duration;time-stamped variable","","7","","25","","","July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Several groups have had qualitative success differentiating nuclei based on spatial location and fiber orientation information in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). In this paper, we extend these principles by combining these discriminating dimensions with structural MR and derived information, and by building random forest learners on the resultant multi-modal features. In training, we form a multi-dimensional feature per voxel, which we associate with a nucleus classification from a manual rater. Learners are trained to differentiate thalamus from background and thalamic nuclei from other nuclei. These learners inform the external forces of a multiple object level set model.

However, organ detection in such an abnormal dataset may have many promising potential real-world applications, such as automatic diagnosis, automated radiotherapy planning, and medical image retrieval, where new multimodal medical images provide more information about the imaged tissues for diagnosis. Here, we test the application of deep learning methods to organ identification in magnetic resonance medical images, with visual and temporal hierarchical features learned to categorize object classes from an unlabeled multimodal DCE-MRI dataset so that only a weakly supervised training is required for a classifier. A probabilistic patch-based method was employed for multiple organ detection, with the features learned from the deep learning model.

Transfer learning tackles it from a different way: borrow labeled examples from a different but related domain (source domain) by assigning weights to those examples based on their suitability on the new domain (target domain). However, it is quite challenging to figure out the suitability. In this paper, we propose a different way for utilizing the labeled examples from source domain. That is, we use them only for labelling the unlabelled examples in the target domain. In this self-labelling, we use the idea of Tri-training. We call our new algorithm: TriTransfer. In TriTransfer, three initial classifiers are generated from the source data and the originally labeled data in the target domain, and an unlabeled example is labeled and added to the labeled data for a classifier if other two classifiers agree on its label. After an expanded labeled data set is obtained, we re-train the classifier. We repeat this process until no more change can be made. At the end, the final classifier, which is a weighted combination of the three classifiers, is output.

Schmid","Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV, USA","IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","20130520","2013","8","6","1051","1060","Three practical methods to improve performance of a single biometric matcher based on vectors of quality measures associated with biometric data are described. The first two methods adaptively select probe biometric data and matching scores based on predicted values of Quality of Sample (QS) index (defined here as d-prime) and Confidence in matching Scores (CS), respectively. The third method, Quality Sample and Template features (QST), treats quality measures as weak but useful features for discriminating between genuine and imposter matching scores. The unifying theme for the three methods consists in learning a nonlinear mapping between vectors of quality measures and QS, CS, and QST for each of the three methods, respectively. For the first method, learning requires a small set of input data in the form of a vector of quality metrics per each biometric image and the output data in the form of QS estimated per image. For the second method, learning requires a small set of input data in the form of two vectors of quality metrics per each matching pair and the output data in the form of CS estimated per matching score. For the third method, learning requires a small set of input data in the form of biometric feature vector (template) concatenated with a vector of quality metrics and a set of output data in the form of matching labels. The proposed methodology is generic and is suitable for any biometric modality and for any choice of a nonlinear mapping between vectors of quality measures and QS, CS, and QST. The experimental results (obtained by means of neural nets) show significant performance improvements for all three methods when applied to iris biometrics.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2013.2259157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6506104","Biometrics;image quality;iris recognition;machine learning","Bioinformatics;Biomedical imaging;Iris recognition;Measurement;Probes;Vectors","feature extraction;image matching;iris recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","CS;QST;adaptive quality-based performance prediction;biometric data;biometric matcher;biometric modality;boosting;confidence-in-matching scores;iris authentication;neural nets;nonlinear mapping;quality measure;quality metric;quality sample-and-template feature;quality-of-sample index","","3","","33","","20130419","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The source task estimates photon-tissue interaction as a spatially localized Poisson process of photons sensed by the RGB sensor. The target task identifies vascular and non-vascular tissues using knowledge transferred from source task. The source and target domains are retinal images obtained using a color fundus camera with white-light illumination.

As-needed charging minimizes battery degradation by minimizing time spent at high state-of-charge. Preliminary results presented here indicate that the battery of a vehicle used for daily commuting and short errands could see its useable life extended by up to 150 % over unoptimized charging.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-4896-6; POD:978-1-4673-4894-2; USB:978-1-4673-4895-9","10.1109/ISGT.2013.6497818","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497818","Batteries Electric vehicles;Machine learning algorithms;Numerical simulation;Optimization","Batteries;Degradation;Mathematical model;Resistance;Sun;System-on-chip;Vehicles","battery powered vehicles;hybrid electric vehicles;lithium;secondary cells","Li;battery degradation;electric vehicles;high state-of-charge;lithium ion vehicle battery life maximization;optimized partial charging;plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","","6","","11","","","24-27 Feb. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we address the decision-making problem in diagnosing Down syndrome from the machine learning perspective aiming to decrease invasive tests. We employ Naive Bayes and Bayesian Networks classification algorithms as probabilistic methods. This probabilistic classification approach is one of the leading work in medical domain. We use George Washington University dataset in our study. We also benchmark our probabilistic classifiers with widely used non-probabilistic classifiers in machine learning literature. Finally the results of the experiments show that probabilistic classifiers enable acceptable prediction of Trisomy 21 case and the classification performance can be improved by using the proposed techniques in this study.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-5563-6; POD:978-1-4673-5562-9","10.1109/SIU.2013.6531604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6531604","Bayesian Networks;Down syndrome;Naive Bayes;Trizomi21;classification;machine learning;probabilisitc classifiers","Barium;Bayes methods;Benchmark testing;Probabilistic logic;Risk management;Software;Support vector machines","Bayes methods;decision making;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;pattern classification;risk management","Bayesian networks classification algorithms;George Washington University dataset;decision-making problem;down syndrome;invasive tests;machine learning perspective;naive Bayes;prenatal risk assessment;probabilistic classifiers;trisomy 21","","0","","8","","","24-26 April 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

High quality treatment plans maximally radiate the targets while minimally radiating healthy organs at risk. In order to judge plan quality and safety, segmentations of the targets and organs at risk are created, and the amount of radiation that will be delivered to each structure is estimated prior to treatment. If the targets or organs at risk are mislabelled, or the segmentations are of poor quality, the safety of the radiation doses will be erroneously reviewed and an unsafe plan could proceed. We propose a technique to automatically label groups of segmentations of different structures from a radiation therapy plan for the joint purposes of providing quality assurance and data mining. Given one or more segmentations and an associated image we seek to assign medically meaningful labels to each segmentation and report the confidence of that label. Our method uses random forests to learn joint distributions over the training features, and then exploits a set of learned potential group configurations to build a conditional random field (CRF) that ensures the assignment of labels is consistent across the group of segmentations. The CRF is then solved via a constrained assignment problem. We validate our method on 1574 plans, consisting of 17 579 segmentations, demonstrating an overall classification accuracy of 91.58%. Our results also demonstrate the stability of RF with respect to tree depth and the number of splitting variables in large data sets.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2013.2251421","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6475187","Data mining;decision forests;machine learning;pattern recognition and classification;radiation therapy;random forests;shape analysis","Biomedical imaging;Cancer;Heart;Lungs;Planning;Radio frequency;Shape","cancer;computerised tomography;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;radiation therapy;trees (mathematics)","CRF;automatic shape classification;cancer patients;conditional random field;constrained assignment problem;contour quality assessment;groupwise conditional random forests;high quality treatment plans;learned potential group configurations;medically meaningful labels;organ at risk segmentation;radiation dose safety;radiation therapy plan;radiotherapy planning;target segmentation;training features;treatment plan quality;treatment plan safety","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Data Mining;Heart;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Lung Neoplasms;Male;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Prostatic Neoplasms;Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","8","","48","","20130306","June 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Shallcross","Applied Communication Sciences, Basking Ridge, USA","2012 IEEE Applied Imagery Pattern Recognition Workshop (AIPR)","20130613","2012","","","1","6","Creation and selection of relevant features for machine learning applications (including image classification) is typically a process requiring significant involvement of domain knowledge. It is thus desirable to cover at least part of that process with semi-automated techniques capable of discovering and visualizing those geometric characteristics of images that are potentially relevant to the classification objective. In this work, we propose to utilize multi-scale singular value decomposition (MSVD) along with approximate nearest neighbors algorithm: both have been recently realized using the randomized approach, and can be efficiently run on large, high-dimensional datasets (sparse or dense). We apply this technique to create a multi-scale view of every point in a publicly available set of LIDAR data of riparian images, with classification objective being separating ground from vegetation. We perform “centralized MSVD” for every point and its neighborhood generated by an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm. After completion of this procedure, the original set of 3-dimensional data is augmented by 36 dimensions generated by MSVD (in three different scales), which is then processed using a novel discretization pre-processing method and the SVM classification algorithm with RBF kernel. The result is two times better that the one previously obtained (in terms of its classification error level). The generic nature of the MSVD mechanism and standard mechanisms used for classification (SVM) suggest a wider utility of the proposed approach for other problems as well.","1550-5219;15505219","Electronic:978-1-4673-4559-0; POD:978-1-4673-4558-3","10.1109/AIPR.2012.6528195","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6528195","SVM;feature construction;machine learning;multiscale;singular value decomposition","","computational geometry;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);optical radar;radial basis function networks;singular value decomposition;support vector machines;vegetation mapping","LIDAR image classification problems;RBF kernel;SVM classification algorithm;approximate nearest neighbors algorithm;centralized MSVD;centralized multiscale singular value decomposition;discretization preprocessing method;domain knowledge;feature construction;image geometric characteristics;machine learning applications;riparian images;semiautomated techniques;vegetation","","1","","17","","","9-11 Oct. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The procedure followed in this study was: (1) automatically computing a Water Quality Index to classify the datasets elements in five classes (excellent, good, medium, bad and very bad) using the Kumar method; (2) selecting best performed real time features on results of classified datasets; and (3) exploring machine learning algorithms (e.g. Decision Trees, Artificial Neural Networks and k-Nearest Neighbor) for producing DWQ classifiers.
