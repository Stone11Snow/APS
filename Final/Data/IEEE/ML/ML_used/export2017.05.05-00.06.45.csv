Unfortunately, such analyses can be heavily influenced by the choice of similarity measure.

We propose a non-parametric Bayesian generative model for structuring binary feature data that does not depend on a specific choice of similarity measure. We jointly model all combinations of binary matches and structure the data into groups at the level in which they have statistical support. The model naturally extends to structuring and aligning an arbitrary number of systems. We analyze three datasets on educational concepts and their features and demonstrate how the proposed model can both be used to structure each system separately or to jointly align two or more systems. The proposed method forms a promising new framework for the statistical modeling and alignment of structure across an arbitrary number of systems.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958905","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958905","Bayesian non-parametrics;binary similarity;knowledge structuring;relational modeling","Abstracts;Computers;Market research;Periodic structures","Bayes methods;educational administrative data processing;knowledge representation;pattern clustering;pattern matching","binary feature matches;educational concepts;knowledge systems;nonparametric Bayesian generative model;object clustering;similarity measure","","1","","20","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Incremental optimization algorithms, where the iterate is passed from node to node, have slower convergence guarantees but they can be parallelized to work on multiple tasks concurrently. When there are many tasks to solve, this approach can suffer from queuing delay. We provide an analysis of this delay which suggests that incremental algorithms may have superior performance for a moderate number of tasks. The main factor that controls this effect is the communication time.

Human-machine communication by voice becomes difficult when speech is mixed with some background noise. As a remedy, a single-channel speech enhancement is indispensable for reducing background noise from noisy speech to make it suitable for automatic speech recognition and telephony speech. While the conventional techniques for single-channel speech enhancement incorporate noisy phase in both amplitude estimation and signal reconstruction stages, in this paper we propose a probabilistic method to estimate the clean speech phase from noisy observation. Our proposed method consists of phase unwrapping followed by threshold-based temporal smoothing using von Mises phase priors.

Since the conditional independence between the variables corresponds to zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix, one can learn the structure of the graph by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix from sample data. This is usually done by solving a convex maximum likelihood problem with a l<sub>1</sub>-regularization term applied on the inverse covariance matrix. In this study, we develop an estimator for such models appropriate for data coming from several datasets that share the same set of variables and a common network substructure. We assume that there exist a few different edges among the networks while the others (edges) are common.

For compact arrays, each source is represented by its direction-of-arrival (DOA), which evolves on the unit sphere. The unique topology of this space leads to analytical intractabilities that are often resolved via costly particle-based methods. In this paper, we derive a novel, deterministic inference algorithm called the von Mises-Fisher Filter (vMFF) for a dynamical system model defined on the sphere, and extend it to the multi-source scenario in the Factorial vMFF (FvMFF). We apply sensor fusion and probabilistic data association techniques to handle clutter and data association ambiguities in the observation set. We show that the vMFF combines the computational efficiency of a Kalman filter with the tracking accuracy of a particle filter to perform well across all noise levels. Finally, we apply the FvMFF to track multiple speakers in a reverberant environment.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958891","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958891","bayesian filtering;speaker tracking;von Mises-Fisher","Approximation methods;Arrays;Bayes methods;Inference algorithms;Kalman filters;Microphones;Vectors","Kalman filters;particle filtering (numerical methods);probability;sensor fusion;speaker recognition;target tracking","FvMFF;Kalman filter;clutter handling;computational efficiency;data association ambiguities;deterministic inference algorithm;dynamical system model;factorial vMFF;factorial von Mises-Fisher filter;microphone array;multiple speaker tracking;multiple-target tracking;multisource scenario;particle filter;probabilistic data association techniques;sensor fusion","","3","","31","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The aim is to find out the unknown cluster labels and the parameters of the statistical model characterizing the processes. Thus this is a kind of a problem of spatial clustering with a time component.

The cues for depression may be present in “what is said” (content) and “how it is said” (prosody). Given the limited amounts of text data, even in this relatively large study, it is difficult to employ standard method of learning models from n-gram features. Instead, we learn models using word representations in an alternative feature space of valence and arousal. This is akin to embedding words into a real vector space albeit with manual ratings instead of those learned with deep neural networks [1]. For extracting prosody, we employ standard feature extractors such as those implemented in openSMILE and compare them with features extracted from harmonic models that we have been developing in recent years. Our experiments show that our features from harmonic model improve the performance of detecting depression from spoken utterances than other alternatives. The context features provide additional improvements to achieve an accuracy of about 74%, sufficient to be useful in screening applications.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958856","Depression;Speech analysis;Telemedicine","Abstracts;Speech","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;psychology;speech processing","clinical depression inferrence;feature extraction;harmonic models;learning models;machine learning;neural networks;openSMILE;speech processing;speech utterances;spoken utterances;word representations","","0","","30","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To drastically reduce the VAD power consumption, this paper introduces a decision tree based VAD with (1) a two-phase VAD operation to maximally reduce the power-hungry learning phase, (2) a scalable analog feature extraction block, and (3) context- and dynamic resource-cost-aware feature selection.

Then, to counter the over-weighting of a big difference term, we apply a saturation threshold transfer function to these eight pixel difference values. Finally, the image noise map is obtained through a threshold operation on the cumulative differences. To decrease the noise detection error, weighting parameters of the mean can be learned by the gradient method caste in discrete formulation. Moreover, to get higher PSNR in the corrected image, we have experienced from the training that we will select weight of 20 for noise rate smaller than 20% and 50 for noise rate greater than 20%, on erroneous noisy than that on the erroneous non-noise pixel.

Recently the ViBe (Visual background extraction) foreground extraction algorithm which is based on probability and statistics gets more and more attention due to its high speed and simplicity. However, its biggest drawback is the poor performance for videos with moving shadows. Because the process of the original ViBe algorithm is carried out in the gray space, it is against the extraction of background as existing shadow removal algorithms typically operate with a colored background image. In this paper, a background extraction and shadow removal algorithm based on clustering for ViBe is proposed. Firstly, the color background is extracted by clustering the values of each pixel in R, G, B components space. Then the background information is used to remove shadow hidden in the foreground. For indoor and outdoor videos with moving cast shadows, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is used to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results show that a good performance has been gained in shadow removal.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009091","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009091","Background extraction;Foreground detection;ROC curve;Shadow removal;ViBe","Abstracts;Classification algorithms;Lighting","computer vision;feature extraction;image colour analysis;pattern clustering;probability","ROC curve;ViBe foreground extraction algorithm;background extraction algorithm;colored background image;computer vision;gray space;moving shadows;pixel value;probability;receiver operating characteristic curve;shadow removal algorithm;statistics;visual background extraction","","0","","30","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present a modified scheme for all-pairs evolving fuzzy classifiers. Two classifier architectures are proposed for binary classifiers.

This paper proposes a dehazing algorithm with dual dark channels where the soft matting to refine the transmission map is avoided and the atmospheric light is estimated directly from a dark channel. The objective of proposed dehazing algorithm (PDA) is to alleviate or remove the two problems found in [1]. Several examples are given to verify the PDA and to compare it with the DCP scheme The simulation results show that the PDA is about 2.5 times, on average, faster than the DCP since the soft matting is avoided.

"Abnormal crowd event detection based on outlier in time series","Wei-Lieh Hsu; Yu-Cheng Wang; Chih-Lung Lin","Department of Computer Information and Network Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan County, 33306, Taiwan","2014 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20150115","2014","1","","359","363","Crowd management research shows a lack of depth in the literature insofar as most major incidents can be prevented or minimized by a proper management strategy. Specifically, if abnormal crowd events can be detected early and the relevant governing agency can take appropriate actions towards mitigating the dangers, accidental injury can be prevented or the incident can be contained. This paper presents a technical approach to gather the required crowd data using fixed cameras to collect visual data while using a grid model to describe the crowd distribution. The measured area will be divided into several unit areas and each unit area is considered to be a simple cell in a grid model. The state value of each unit area is determined by changes in the total number of active pixels within the unit area. Under the circumstances, the motion status of the measured area is represented by a dynamic state matrix, which will save computing time. Should abnormal crowd events develop, a crowd tends to attempt to quickly leave the area and the resultant crowd distribution changes accordingly. Thus, we expect the crowd distribution to have a sudden and significant change as the abnormal crowd event unfolds. According to the Uniqueness Theorem, crowd distribution in the grid model can be described by a series of different order moments. To consider the normalization, the Chebyshev moment is used to describe the status distribution in the grid model of each image and a time series is used to describe the varying features of the two adjacent images in the video data. When unusual events occur, the status distribution in the grid model between images will show more obvious changes within a short period of time. We can use an outlier detection method to detect the extreme values and also identify the type of outlier: additive outliers or innovational outliers are used to determine the cause of abnormal feature variation.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009142","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009142","Chebyshev moment;Crowd Abnormal event;Crowd analysis;Grid Model","Abstracts;Analytical models;Frequency locked loops;Motion pictures","image motion analysis;matrix algebra;time series","Chebyshev moment;abnormal crowd event detection;abnormal feature variation;additive outliers;crowd distribution;crowd motion status;dynamic state matrix;grid model;innovational outliers;order moments;outlier detection method;time series outlier;uniqueness theorem","","0","","10","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different from the classic vector quantization algorithms such as LBG and K-means, the algorithms based on information theoretic learning try to make the code book distribution similar to the original data distribution. The computational complexity of such algorithms is however very high. In this paper, a novel vector quantization algorithm is proposed, which is based on a parameter-free information theoretic quantity, namely the survival Cauchy-Schwartz divergence (SCSD). Minimizing the SCSD between code book and the original data set yields a code book that has similar distribution with the data set. The computational cost of the new algorithm is relatively small due to the computational simplicity of the survival information potential (SIP). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works well.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958924","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958924","information theoretic learning (ITL);survival Cauchy-Schwartz divergence (SCSD);survival information potential (SIP);vector quantization (VQ)","Clustering algorithms;Kernel;Machine learning algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Simulation;Vector quantization;Vectors","computational complexity;data mining;information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);vector quantisation","SCSD;SIP;code book distribution;computational complexity;computational simplicity;data compression method;data distribution;data mining;information theoretic learning;machine learning;parameter-free information theoretic quantity;survival Cauchy-Schwartz divergence;survival information potential;vector quantization algorithm","","0","","13","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
