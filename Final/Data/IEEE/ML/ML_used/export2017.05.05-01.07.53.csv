This within-class scatter matrix is used to calculate within-class and between-class distance proportion as a rule function, calculate the twice eigenface through discrete Karhunen-Loeve transform (DKLT), and use singular value decomposition (SVD) method to calculate the eigenvector.

From time to time, an easy question costs a user a lot of time to find the answer. To sooth this pain, this paper proposes a knowledge acquisition system which dynamically constructs query-based ontology to provide answers for users' queries. To construct the relationships and hierarchy of concepts in an ontology, the formal concept analysis (FCA) approach is adopted. After an ontology is built, the system can infer the answer without asking users to read the whole document sets. NBA Sport news pages are used as source documents in this paper; while the approach can be used in any domain. One of the distinguish advantages of this approach is that there is no need to construct a complete domain ontology, which is not feasible for a dynamic knowledge base, to which new documents are added with high frequency.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370656","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370656","Formal Concept Analysis (FCA);Knowledge acquisition;Ontology;World Wide Web (WWW)","Costs;Frequency;Information technology;Internet;Knowledge acquisition;Ontologies;Pain;Web pages;Web sites;World Wide Web","Web sites;data analysis;document handling;knowledge acquisition;natural languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;semantic Web","Chinese natural language;Internet;Web pages;World Wide Web;formal concept analysis;information technology;knowledge acquisition system;query-based ontology approach;semantic search","","1","","19","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This enhancement applies to the low resourceful on-board Machine Vision environment for the important surveillance applications. The overall memory consumption of the on-board codec's processor is lowered maximally by 20 percent with the use of the Precinct Partition strategy. Resolution prioritized progression ordering mode enables the immediate on-ground preview with undersized image reconstruction. Moreover, when coding larger aerial image's Region of Interest (ROI), JPEG 2000 with its layered architecture outperforms SPIHT. Using the average layer thresholds, a sequence of different aerial images can be reconstructed at the same quality. Exploring JPEG 2000 part II, i.e. 3-D Hyperspectral image coding concepts, the evaluated new parameter PSNR(ROI) (db) per band for mean bit rate of JPEG 2000 has a 5.7 percent gain over that with SPIHT. Despite its many powerful features, JPEG 2000 still lacks the directional detail filtering capability, hence, the inefficiency in curvilinear-edge reconstruction due to its inherent wavelet transforms based codec. Therefore, the novel Advanced Directional-Wavelet Packet Transform (ADWPT) is proposed for JPEG 2000, and implemented in pre-coding experiments giving a more competent curvilinear-edge coding performance than that with the existing transforms.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370380","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370380","Curvilinear-edge coding enhancement;JPEG 2000 technology;Larger aerial (3-D hyperspectral, 2-D) image coding;Novel Advanced Directional-Wavelet Packet Transform (ADWPT)","Bit rate;Codecs;Filtering;Hyperspectral imaging;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Image resolution;Machine vision;Surveillance;Wavelet transforms","codecs;computer vision;image coding;image enhancement;image reconstruction;image resolution;wavelet transforms","3-D hyperspectral image coding;JPEG 2000;advanced directional-wavelet packet transform;aerial images;codec;curvilinear edge coding enhancement;image reconstruction;machine vision;precinct partition strategy;resolution prioritized progression ordering;surveillance applications;wavelet transforms","","0","","9","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The optimization model of vehicle scheduling based on traditional shortest vehicle route is difficult to satisfy the factual requirement of logistics distribution under electronic commerce. Since it excessively emphasizes the principle of shortest route, there has a risk of good delivery delay which may cause high distribution cost or losing competition ability. Considering the characteristics of logistics distribution under electronic commerce, the traditional vehicle scheduling model is modified in order to reduce the distribution cost, and the objective function is also modified based on minimum expense. Furthermore, in order to improve the distribution service quality and market competition, maximum work time, more vehicle types, vehicle load capacity restrictions, maximum running distance and others are added in restraint conditions which will also improve the applicability and universal characteristics of model. Because vehicle scheduling problem is NP puzzle, the optimization solution is obtained by improved genetic algorithm: using customer natural number when encoding the chromosomes to simplify the problem and improve the searching efficiency of genetic algorithm; using individual amount control selection game in order to guarantee colony diversity; using partially matched crossover to improve convergent speed of algorithm so as to better solve the inconsistency between diversity and convergent speed; using 2-exchange mutation strategy to strengthen the partial searching ability of chromosome and improve the convergent speed of algorithm. Finally, the good performance of the improved algorithm can be proved by experimental results and concrete examples.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370863","2- Exchange mutation;Electronic commerce;Improved genetic algorithm;Individual amount control;Vehicle routing problem with time window","Biological cells;Cost function;Delay;Electronic commerce;Encoding;Genetic algorithms;Logistics;Routing;Scheduling algorithm;Vehicles","electronic commerce;genetic algorithms;goods dispatch data processing;graph theory;logistics data processing;scheduling","2-exchange mutation strategy;electronic commerce;genetic algorithm;logistics distribution;optimization;scheduling;shortest vehicle route;time window;vehicle routing","","0","","11","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional recommendation systems do the data mining on web access logs, discover user's access patterns, and filter the information on behalf of the user at the server side. One critical limitation of traditional recommendation system is the lack of user's private daily data, such as schedules, favorite websites and personal emails. The reason for this limitation is the privacy leak issue when the server holds much more private user data. To solve this problem, this paper presents an agent-based personalized recommendation method called Content REcommendation System based on private Dynamic User Profile (CRESDUP). The system collects and mines the private data of user at the client side, discovers, stores and updates private Dynamic User Profile (DUP) at the client side. The system fetches preferred message from the content server according to DUP. An important usage of this technology is a personalized advertising system in the RSS (Rich Site Summary, or RDF Site Summary) reader application.

The results of independent component analysis are inherently out-of-order, so robots cannot correlate the separated signals with sources. To solve this problem, we exploit the combination of optimized time-frequency representation and distance measures to reorder them, and accomplish the identification of speech signals.

An important challenge arises when more than one such self-adaptive module is employed: how can we ensure that they cooperate without conflicts in a coherent fashion? This paper describes our initial approach for harmonizing conflicting policies in the presence of multiple self-adaptive modules. The main distribution of the paper is to resolve conflicts using an extended ECA rule paradigm to coordinate self-adaptive actions among multiple external modules. The approach shares advantages with other policy languages, i.e., the declarative and domain-independent semantics of policy rules. However, a key benefit of our approach is that both conflicting actions and influence of actions are considered. We focus on the problem of harmonizing self-adaptation capability by detecting and further resolving policy conflicts using action-level meta rule and value-level meta rule. Finally, this paper illustrates the efficiency of the approach in a VOD system as a case study, and discusses our future plans.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370543","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370543","ECA rule;Policy;Policy conflict;Self-adaptation","Computer science;Computerized monitoring;Condition monitoring;Control systems;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Logic;Machine learning;Programming profession;Software systems","programming language semantics;self-adjusting systems;software architecture","action-level meta rule;adapt system behavior;conflicting policy harmonizing architecture;domain-independent semantics;extended ECA rule paradigm;multiple self-adaptive modules","","1","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, mining all the frequent itemsets will lead to a huge number of itemsets and numerous redundant association rules. Fortunately, this problem can be cured by mining only frequent closed itemsets (FCIs), which results in a much smaller number of itemsets. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to find FCIs when the database becomes too large to allow a memory-resident representation. In this paper, a methodology called hierarchical partitioning is proposed for dividing the database into a set of multi-leveled sub-databases of manageable sizes to fit into memory. The advantage of hierarchical partitioning is that the FCIs can be found directly from sub-databases without rescanning the original database for support and subset checking.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370446","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370446","Frequent closed itemset;Frequent pattern list;Hierarchical partitioning","Association rules;Cybernetics;Data mining;Data structures;Electronic commerce;Electronic mail;Frequency;Itemsets;Machine learning;Transaction databases","data mining;database management systems","data mining;frequent closed itemset mining;hierarchical partitioning;memory-resident representation;multileveled subdatabases;redundant association rules;subset checking","","1","","15","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, an approach to relevance feedback based on long-term learning strategy using the historical retrieval information is presented for the content-based image similarity retrieval. The approach adopts a semantic covering set constructed dynamically to deposit the users' historical retrieval information produced in previous retrieval processes, and predicts the semantic correlation between the images in database and query sample according to the historical retrieval information when carrying out a new query session. The performance of an experimental image retrieval system using this approach is evaluated on a database of around 3000 images.

The objective is to simultaneously minimize the expected makespan and the expected total tardiness. A new permutation-based representation method is first proposed, in which the substring related to each machine is a permutation. The conflict is eliminated by giving priority to the operation with the minimum gene value among the conflicting operations in the same permutation. An efficient multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is then presented, which archive maintenance and fitness assignment are performed based on crowding measure. The proposed algorithm is finally applied to some benchmark problems and computational results demonstrate that the proposal algorithm has promising advantage in stochastic job shop scheduling.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370264","Evolutionary algorithm;Job shop scheduling;Multi-objective optimization;Stochastic processing time","Automation;Costs;Cybernetics;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Job shop scheduling;Machine learning;Scheduling algorithm;Simulated annealing;Stochastic processes","evolutionary computation;job shop scheduling;minimisation;stochastic processes","crowding measure;expected makespan minimization;expected total tardiness minimization;fitness assignment;maintenance assignment;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;multiobjective stochastic job shop scheduling;permutation-based representation method","","2","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sequence alignment is the essential task for similar sequence search in bioinformatics. The biological sequence databases have getting larger in past decade, finding sequences similar to the query sequence is a time consuming task. By transforming sequences into numeric feature vectors, we can quickly filter out sequences whose feature vectors are distant to the feature vector of the query sequence. We proposed an adaptive weighting distance which is based on feature vector that contains three groups of features: count, extended relative position dispersion (XRPD), and extended absolute position dispersion (XAPD) of a DNA sequence. Each group has four dimensions for A, C, T, and G. When computing distance between two feature vectors, Euclidean distance and L1 distance are commonly used. In this paper, we use weighted L1 distance for computing the distance between two feature vectors. We derive weights for the four nucleotides from the count group, and apply the weights to both XRPD and XAPD. In other words, if a certain kind of nucleotide appears much frequent than the other kinds of nucleotides, the weight for the kind of nucleotide should also be large in XRPD and XAPD groups. Experiments show that such distance of feature vectors helps reflect the distance between sequences.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370523","DNA Sequence;Feature Vector;Weight Assignment","Biology;Cities and towns;Computer science;Cybernetics;Information management;Machine learning","DNA;biology computing;search problems;sequences","DNA sequence;Euclidean distance;L1 distance;adaptive weighting distance;bioinformatics;biological sequences;extended absolute position dispersion;extended relative position dispersion;feature vectors;query sequence;sequence alignment;similarity search","","0","","17","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These quadratic neurons recursively partition the feature space into hyper-ellipsoidal-shaped sub-regions.

There are a total of nine optional prediction modes for each 4 x 4 luma block. H.264 adapts Rate Distortion Optimization (RDO) technique to get high coding rate and visual quality. Because RDO is too much exhaustive, several attempts have been made to explore fast algorithms. The choice of intra prediction mode for each 4 x 4 block must be signaled to the decoder and this could potentially require a large number of bits. However, intra modes for neighbouring 4 x 4 blocks are often correlated. To take advantage of this correlation, predictive coding is used to signal 4 x 4 intra modes. But still large number of bits is required to signal nine intra prediction modes. We adaptively selected only five modes; selection of modes depends on the position of 4 x 4 block in the slice or frame. After experimental results we have come to know that the increase in the number of bits for encoding residual coefficients is approximately same as decrease in the number of bits required to signal intra prediction modes, providing same PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio). By using proposed technique, computational speed increased by ap45% without significant performance degradation.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370544","H.264;Intra prediction;Mode decision;Signaling mode numbers","Bit rate;Cybernetics;Decoding;Degradation;Electronic mail;Encoding;Machine learning;PSNR;Predictive coding;Rate-distortion","optimisation;rate distortion theory;video coding","H.264;intra prediction mode decision;luma block;peak signal to noise ratio;predictive coding;rate distortion optimization","","2","4","7","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, when source data violate the symmetric assumption, conventional ICA algorithms might not work well. According to the idea of kernel density estimation of probability density function, an adaptive density model, which incorporates with the adjusted Infomax algorithm, is proposed. A novel optimal ICA method is then obtained. There are two main steps in the presented algorithm. First, an Infomax algorithm is used to obtain initial independent source estimates, and a kernel estimator technique is utilized to calculate source densities. Second, the sources are refitted with a nonlinear function based on their own characteristics, and more precise results can be obtained. Experimental results show that the optimal ICA algorithm, comparing with the other ICA algorithms (e.g. Extended Infomax, FastICA and JADE), can improve separation performance further by incorporating a priori information into ICA analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals.

For example, if the yield of a product could not reach a certain level before a given deadline, then the competitiveness of the product will disappear and capacity will be re-allocated to other products. To prevent that from happening, some managerial actions, e.g. executing a quality engineering project, quickening the speed of mass production, etc. can be taken to accelerate yield learning. After such actions, the yield learning model has to be modified. In this study, how to incorporate the effects of such managerial actions on semiconductor yield learning is investigated. Subsequently, a new fuzzy yield learning model is developed. The proposed methodology has been applied to the data of four semiconductor products. Experimental results revealed the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370471","Fuzzy logic;Learning model;Semiconductor;Yield","Conference management;Cybernetics;Electronics industry;Engineering management;Fuzzy logic;Machine learning;Mass production;Project management;Quality management;Uncertainty","fuzzy logic;production management;semiconductor device manufacture","fuzzy logic;fuzzy yield learning model;managerial actions;semiconductor industry;semiconductor yield learning","","3","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a scheme for remedy coupling for edge neurons, in which coupling coefficient argumentation makeup lack of linking input. A brief restriction relation between dissimilar parameters is figured out in this paper, which just needs to configure one experimental parameter. Additionally, experimental data traced proves threshold exponential decaying mechanism in conventional model.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370630","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370630","Pulse;Pulse-coupled neural network;Recruit;Region growing","Cities and towns;Cybernetics;Equations;Joining processes;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Pulse modulation;Rail transportation;Recruitment","image segmentation;neural nets","PCNN model;coupling modulation mechanism;edge neurons;pulse-coupled neural network;region growing","","0","","14","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
