However, getting the global optimal solution to meet all the constraints is a comparatively tough problem. The binary coding and stochastic operators in traditional genetic algorithm (GA) are not suitable for solving large-scale UC problem. In this paper, the hybrid intelligent messy genetic algorithm (HIMGA) is proposed to solve the problem due to the characteristics of the daily generation scheduling in power system. The proposed algorithm, using operation status of unit as the genotype and combining heuristic self-adapted intelligent operators, is not only very simple but it also reduces the scale of the UC problems, improves the diversity of evolution population, enhances the searching efficiency and develops the convergence of the algorithm.

Meanwhile, some heuristic rules about the bidding languages are presented. Then with partheno-genetic operators and the fitting-first heuristic rules, a partheno-genetic algorithm is presented on the basis of the ideas of heuristic algorithm.

The HMM has also been applied to the intrusion detection. The intrusion detection method based on the HMM is more efficient than other methods. The HMM based intrusion detection method is composed by two processes: one is the HMM process; the other is the hard decision process, which is based on the profile database. Because of the dynamical behavior of system calls, the hard decision process based on the profile database cannot be efficient to detect novel intrusions. On the other hand, the profile database would consume many computer resources. For these reasons, the combined detection method was provided in This work. The neural network is a kind of artificial intelligence tool and is combined with the HMM to make soft decision.

The discovery of traversal patterns is quite useful for improving the Web site design, offering clients personalized service, carrying on e-commercial activities, constructing intelligent Web sites and so on. The discovery of user traversal patterns comprises the following three steps: 1) extracting maximal forward reference paths from server log; 2) discovering frequent reference paths based on the result of the first step; and 3) filtering to get maximal frequent reference paths from the output of the second step. The second step constitutes the core of the whole mining process. Essentially, a Web access pattern is a sequential pattern in a large set of pieces of Web logs, which is pursued frequently by users. Although some attempts have been made to mine traversal patterns from Web logs, most of the research efforts try to employ techniques of sequential pattern mining, which is based on a generate-and-test paradigm, involving multi-scan of the entire dataset.

The second step is to propose a procedure to determine the modal parameters of the system from the trained neural networks. The dynamic characteristics of the structure are directly evaluated from the weighting matrices of the trained recurrent neural network.

However, it is difficult to simulate the human ability of image fusion when algorithms of image processing are piled up merely. On the basis of the review of researches on psychophysics and physiology of human vision, this paper presents an effective multi-resolution image data fusion methodology, which is based on discrete wavelet transform theory and self-organizing features mapping neural network (SOFMNN), to simulate the processes of images recognition and understanding implemented in the human vision system. Through the two-dimensional wavelet transform, original images can be decomposed into different types of details and levels. The integration rule can be built using self-organizing neural networks, just like the automatic work in human brain.

In the FSFDTC strategy, the stator flux angle, the stator flux error, and the torque error are reasonably fuzzified into several fuzzy subsets to optimize the selection of the voltage vector.

It is first proved that user-associations about the current user mined from the whole rating table are contained in those mined only from the data set that contain the current user's rating. Then, a user-association mining frame based on two-stage count called TSCF is proposed. TSCF frame can be implemented by using existing algorithms for mining association rules.

However it has some difficulty to do this in fact. Our algorithm is comparable to the other algorithms on the recognition performance.

The wavelet function spaces at higher scales are broadband, so that the frequency content of the narrow-band phenomena hidden in the signal that occur at relatively high frequencies, cannot be diagnosed precisely, that is unsuitable for extracting mechanical fault information. This deficiency of the scalar wavelet systems can be overcome by dividing the frequency bands of different levels. Using the multiwavelet packets transform, one attains this achievement automatically and more precisely. To lessen the cost of computation, a new multiwavelet packets coefficients reduction algorithm is proposed. As an example, non-stationary vibration signature of a gearing system is analyzed.

To remedy these problems, this paper presents a novel algorithm, namely the classification based on atomic association rules. Atomic rule mining generates the smallest and simplest rule set for classification. The strong atomic rules with the highest and near-highest confidences can realize partial classification accurately. Multiple passes of partial classifications generate the concise and accurate classifier. The experiments are performed on 26 standard datasets. The new approach is compared with decision tree induction and the existing associative classification. The results show that the proposed algorithm not only achieves the highest classification accuracy but also generates the smallest classification rule set; furthermore, it runs far faster than the existing associative classification algorithm.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382031","","Association rules;Classification algorithms;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Data mining;Decision trees;Electronic mail;Humans;Induction generators;Neural networks","data mining;decision trees;pattern classification","accurate classifier;associative classification algorithm;atomic association rule mining;concise classifier;decision tree induction","","2","","6","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The spatial data ETL(extraction, cleansing, transformation and loading) plays an important roll in spatial data warehouse. The spatial data ETL should syncretize the spatial data and non-spatial data in the process, which distinguishes it from the traditional ET. The geocoding technique, which assigning geographic coordinates to the actual address is commonly used to solve the problem. To enhance the address matching ability of geocoding, we apply the dynamic programming algorithm, which contributes much to the biological sequence comparison. A full paradigm is given to illuminate the process.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382033","","Computer science;Data mining;Data warehouses;Decision making;Delta modulation;Dynamic programming;Filling;Helium;Heuristic algorithms;Spatial databases","data mining;data warehouses;dynamic programming;geographic information systems;visual databases","DP;biological sequence;data cleansing;data extraction;data loading;data processing;data transformation;dynamic programming algorithm;geocoding technique;geographic coordinates;spatial OLAP;spatial data warehouse","","1","","5","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One novel intrusion behavior forecast system based on interactive knowledge discovery, which consists of off-line interactive knowledge discovery and on-line forecast, is put forward. As to the former, the algorithm of sequential pattern discovery, WINEPI, is introduced to implement interactive knowledge discovery so as to mine frequent sequential patterns, of intrusion behavior from historical intrusion, event dataset. A novel idea of correlating discovered short sequential patterns based on intrusion prerequisite and intrusion intention is proposed to build long sequential patterns. As to the on-line part of intrusion behavior forecast system, it employs inference engine developed in this paper to forecast intrusion behavior based on intrusion preludes and to discover forecast rules. This system changes passive data storage into active data usage and helps to achieve active defense. Application in the integrated network security monitor and defense system named Net-Keeper have shown that all forecast accuracies are greater than 75%, which proves this system is feasible.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378527","","Computer security;Data security;Electronic mail;Electronics packaging;Information security;Intelligent networks;Intelligent systems;Intrusion detection;Memory;Search engines","computer networks;data mining;inference mechanisms;security of data","Net Keeper system;WINEPI algorithm;active data storage;defense system;inference engine;integrated computer network security monitor;intrusion behavior forecast system;offline interactive knowledge discovery;online forecasting;passive data storage;sequential pattern discovery","","0","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
