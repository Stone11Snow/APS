In the context of service delivery, standard lead times are often adopted by the businesses as committable, uniform timescale for fulfilling their services. Existing practice of calculating standard lead times are manual and often erroneous; regardless of the variances of demand and resource across geographical areas and time horizon, service enterprises are confined to single, universal standard lead times. Ill-defined standard lead times have two consequences: if it is too long, it would make service enterprises uncompetitive and drive customers away; if it is too short, it could incur huge compensation bills for delayed or failed services. In order to tackle this problem, we developed a service lead time calculator to work out standard lead time based on projected resource and demand. Some optimization techniques have been devised to work out the best alignment between resource and demand.

Thus, a CWWU1 base robot similar to the previous CWWU (combination of Omni wheel and spherical wheel unit) can perform the static and dynamic balancing function that a single wheel with inverse mouse-ball drive developed by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) can also achieve. However, the previous CWWU has an unwanted compromise in which the strength is inversely proportional to the smoothing motion needed to be made. That is, increase the Omni wheels to improve the smoothness of motion will reduce the spacing of Omni wheel which will weak the strength of the Omni wheels. The CWWU1 can solve this problem, and the major difference between them is that the motion of CWWU1 can be smoother than the previous CWWU due to more than one guiding wheel to contact the surface of the spherical wheel. The other difference is that the size of CWWU1 can be reduced more as compared with the previous CWWU in case of size limit applications. Both robots have several exclusive features which can resolve key problems inherited in the CMU robot. Especially, the simultaneous demand of both a high-friction and low-friction material for the spherical ball is an undesired compromise needed to make for the CMU robot.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212737","CWWU;CWWU1;Guiding wheel;Spherical wheel","Actuators;Axles;Cybernetics;Ellipsoids;Machine learning;Mobile robots;Shape;Smoothing methods;Vehicle dynamics;Wheels","mobile robots","CWWU1 base robot;Carnegie Mellon University;Omni wheel;dynamic balancing function;guiding wheel;high-friction material;inverse mouse-ball drive;low-friction material;smoothing motion;spherical ball;spherical wheel unit;static balancing function","","1","","5","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In semi-supervised learning problems, only a portion of training samples are labeled. This further reduces the effort in data collection. In the light of this situation, the number of features increases easily and the curse of dimensionality becomes a serious problem in semi-supervised pattern classification problems. In classical class separability based feature selection methods, samples in the same class are assumed to belong to a single cluster. However, this assumption does not hold true in many real life pattern classification problems. Instead, samples in a class may form several clusters (prototypes) [23]. These facts motivate us to propose the intra-prototype / inter-class separability ratio (IPICSR). Features selected by the IPICSR tend to preserve locality within a prototype while maximizing inter-class difference.

An improved loss function is proposed based on the transitivity, which reduces the complexity greatly. Also we give the bound of the complexity of the improved RSVM, from which we can see that the actual complexity is usually near the lower bound in real-world application.

In order to maximally capture common information for XML clustering, this paper investigates a novel similarity measurement - counting all common embedded subtrees of two trees, and its use for discovering latent hierarchical information for XML clustering. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm for counting all common embedded subtrees is proposed and also theoretically studied. The all common embedded subtrees similarity is employed in the definition of a dissimilarity measure for XML documents. This dissimilarity measure is evaluated in the standard hierarchical clustering framework on real XML documents. Experimental results show that all common embedded subtrees outperform the tree edit distance in clustering XML documents under the standard performance measures for clustering.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212557","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212557","XML;all common embedded subtrees;clustering;tree edit distance;tree similarity","Cybernetics;Machine learning;XML","XML;dynamic programming;pattern clustering;trees (mathematics)","XML documents clustering;dynamic programming algorithm;embedded subtrees;tree edit distance;tree structures","","0","","10","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 3PL sector in Beijing is fragmented and outsourcing is relatively infrequent. By contrast to previous country-level studies, enterprises in Beijing outsource more of value-added services, but fewer of international-related, technology services or management services, a result of the demand characteristics of the city. The managerial implications of the market quality and growth analyses suggest that the 3PLs in Beijing shall initially position themselves as local integrated logistics services providers. The short-term strategy is to improve transportation and uncomplicated valued-added services for city logistics. The medium-term strategy is to develop the real-time tracking and inter-organizational information capabilities that can integrate with basic logistics services for an effective physical operation.

The designation based on modular technology is generally used as a common method. Through the analysis of the module and the layout, the whole configuration should be scientific and rational. But in one module, there exists lots of the individuals, it could be difficult to find the one that suits the demand best, also there comes the situation that all existing individual may not match to the demand, these have become the important problems in the module design area. In this paper, as a new approach for the configurable layout design, the extension adaptive method which is based on the extension theory is proposed. The whole method could be divided into three steps. Firstly, to the customers demand, the adaptive function is introduced to evaluate the fitness of the modules and the individuals in the modules. It could see that the individual which has the biggest adaptive value to the demand could be the final result. Secondly, when there comes the situation that all the exist individual may not match to the demand as the adaptive value is less than 0, the extension transformation method is used to settle such problems. Thirdly, calculate the adaptive value of the transform individual again, the final result could be obtained. At last, a configurable layout design example for logistics enterprise is provided which shows that the adaptive design method achieves intelligent configuration in adaptive environment with significant rapidity and variety.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212181","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212181","Adaptive function;Configuration design;Extension judgment;Extension transformation","Best practices;Costs;Cybernetics;Design methodology;Educational institutions;Environmental economics;IEEE products;Logistics;Machine learning;Product design","adaptive systems;customer satisfaction;functional analysis;logistics;product customisation;product design","adaptive function;extension adaptive method;layout design;logistics enterprise;modular technology","","0","","16","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

RFID tags are a powerful mechanism for object identification, and can facilitate the compilation of detailed object histories and pedigrees. Since RFID tags communicate with the reader through open air in an automated, wireless manner, they are poor authenticators. Furthermore, they have a small microchip on board that offer functionality that can be used for security purposes. This chip functionality makes it possible to verify the authenticity of a product and hence to detect and prevent counterfeiting. In order to be successful for these security purposes, RFID tags have to be resistant against many attacks, in particular against cloning of the tag. Therefore, RFID tags are vulnerable to elementary cloning and counterfeiting attacks. In this paper, we survey and remedy the technologies used for RFID tags against counterfeiting. In the first section, we present an overview of the RFID tags counterfeiting issue. In the second section, we survey the existing methods which investigate how an RFID-tag can be made unclonable. In the third section, we compare and contrast the pros and cons of those existing methods and also identify the discrepancy areas which require further enhancement. In the fourth section, we propose some design principles and guidelines for improvement of the existing methods. Finally, we draw a conclusion and suggest further research direction in this field.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212582","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212582","Anti-counterfeiting;Authentication;Clone;EPC;RFID","Cloning;Computer science;Counterfeiting;Cybernetics;Drugs;Machine learning;Pharmaceutical technology;RFID tags;Radiofrequency identification;Security","pharmaceutical industry;product codes;radiofrequency identification;security of data;system-on-chip","RFID tags;anti-counterfeiting tool;authentication;electronic product code;microchip;object identification;security","","1","2","8","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we apply EMD analysis to decompose the synthetic shift normalization of curvature into their components, which could produce more compact features. Finally, three different classifiers, i.e. support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM), and artificial neural network (ANN), are used to discriminate similar handwritten numerals for testing the effectiveness of the extracted features. Experimental results show that the proposed approach obtains higher recognition rates compared with the traditional algorithm for extracting features.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212792","Discrimination of handwritten numerals;Empirical mode decomposition (EMD);Feature extraction;Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT)","Cybernetics;Handwriting recognition;Machine learning","edge detection;handwriting recognition;hidden Markov models;image classification;neural nets;support vector machines;wavelet transforms","HMM;SVM classifier;artificial neural network;empirical mode decomposition;grey-level invariant characterization;hidden Markov model;image contour;local maximum modulus;similar handwritten numeral recognition;support vector machine;synthetic shift normalization;wavelet transform;width-invariant characterization","","0","","15","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

ROI quality can be improved by allocating more bits on ROI regions while fewer bits are allocated to non-ROI regions for bit rate saving. Experimental results on multi-view video coding show that 11.34% and 21.41% bit rate can be saved for Ballet and Breakdancers sequences while maintaining high objective quality of ROI regions and high subjective quality of the multi-view videos.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212222","Depth map;Multi-view video coding;Multi-view video plus depth;Region of interest","Bit rate;Cybernetics;Data mining;Encoding;Layout;Machine learning;Rendering (computer graphics);Video coding;Video compression;Videoconference","data compression;feature extraction;video coding","compression efficiency;depth based region of interest extraction;macroblock level ROI;multiview video coding;semantic low-complexity rode extraction algorithm","","2","","11","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
