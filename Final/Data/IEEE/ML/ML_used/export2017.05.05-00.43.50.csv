In such cases, generating summarized information from the data set is more useful than individually analyzing every entry and the selectivity estimation is more important than exact answer. In this paper, we introduce a histogram-based grey estimator for spatiotemporal selectivity estimation, the basic idea is that although the individual object's movements has much randomness, the overall data distribution varies gradually with time, due to the continuity of movement. Using prediction models on the history and present query results, it is more accurate to get query estimate than using existing linear extrapolating spatiotemporal selectivity estimation techniques. To enhance the estimation performance, grey prediction model GM(1,1) is used, which can reduce the randomness inside the history query results sequence and generates its holistic measure. Comparisons to traditional approaches show that as randomness of history query results increasing, the near future prediction results of spatiotemporal window queries remain accurate and stable","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.259127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028388","Grey system theory;Histogram;Query Estimation;Spatiotemporal Database","Cybernetics;Data engineering;Educational institutions;Histograms;History;Information analysis;Machine learning;Predictive models;Spatial databases;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Vehicles;Weather forecasting","estimation theory;grey systems;query processing;temporal databases;visual databases","data distribution;grey prediction model;histogram-based grey estimator;linear extrapolation;spatiotemporal database;spatiotemporal selectivity estimation;spatiotemporal window query","","0","","16","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then we describe the target by introducing the target rectangle, which provides two positions coordinates of the centre point, the horizontal axis, the vertical axis and the target angle, altogether five degrees of freedom. Target angle is used to accommodate the rotation of objects while the two axes determine the size in two independent directions. Furthermore, we incorporate the Kalman particle filter (KPF) into our tracking framework to cope with a temporal occlusion of the objects.

PSO employs a collaborative population-based search, which is inspired by the social behavior of bird flocking. GA provides the optimization parameter of PSO to get a good performance during the hybrid search process. HAMPSO implements easily and reserves the generality of PSO and GA. The hybrid algorithm combines the high speed of PSO with the powerful ability to avoid being trapped in local minimum by velocity mutation.

In order to get correct lip contour, an approach for extracting precise lip contour feature points is then presented. According to the shape characteristics of lips when pronounce Chinese words, three quadratic curves are applied to represent the upper- and lower-inner contours of the lips and their parameters are computed by nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm.

Compact lattice frequent pattern tree (abbreviated as LFP-tree) saves previous results, in which the root node saves two minimum support thresholds. Besides, each node does not store frequent patterns and support information, but also index set mapped table (abbreviated as ISMT), except the root node. Rapidly, ISMT is used to mine new frequent sequential patterns without candidates generation. When to update the structure is decided by comparing the two minimum support thresholds, logistic information contained in the index set mapped table is used to fast mine new frequent sequential patterns without candidates generation.

In this paper, we present an extension of Isomap focusing on the suitable selection of landmarks even the number of landmarks is quite small. In our method, each data point is assigned a weight according to the distance between it and its neighbors and point with a higher weight has a larger probability to be selected as a landmark point. The selection of landmarks falls into two phases. In 1st phase, n' candidate landmarks are selected only by the weights of data points. And in 2nd phase, n landmarks are refined from the candidates by maximizing the sum of distances between all pairwise landmarks.

Heuristic knowledge, which is mutuality degree of a condition item with a decision part, is used to choose condition item when generating rules. In primary and modified IGRs, two kinds of mutuality degree, simple and weighted mutuality are introduced respectively. In addition, the variable precision method is used to solve the conflict problem in modified IGRs. By experiments, the effects of two kinds heuristic knowledge and different weight values in synthetic mutuality on algorithms properties are shown, such as time consumption, calculation precision etc. The performances of IGRs with the primary and new conflict solution are compared by experiments. The conclusion is that the weighted mutuality degree is more sound and the choice of appropriate weight values in it are important to optimize the quality of rules set.

A SVM constructs an optimal separating hyper-plane through maximizing the margin between two classes in high-dimensional feature space. The inverse problem is how to split a given dataset into two clusters such that the margin between the two clusters attains the maximum. It is difficult to give an exact solution to this problem, so a genetic algorithm is designed to solve this problem. But the proposed genetic algorithm has large time complexity for the process of solving quadratic programs. In this paper, we replace the quadratic programming with a linear programming. The new algorithm can greatly decrease time complexity. The fast algorithm for acquiring the maximum margin can upgrade the applicability of the proposed genetic algorithm","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028680","Support vector machines;genetic algorithms;linear programming;maximum margin","Algorithm design and analysis;Cybernetics;Decision trees;Genetic algorithms;Inverse problems;Linear programming;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Quadratic programming;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","computational complexity;genetic algorithms;inverse problems;linear programming;quadratic programming;support vector machines","classification performance;genetic algorithm;high-dimensional feature space;inverse problem;linear programming approach;quadratic programming;support vector machine;time complexity","","0","","6","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In its original design, it provided context-sensitive text classification by including 'sparse phrases' in the feature set. Although Sleeping-Experts has the capability to handle a large number of features, the combinatorial explosion of derived features like 'sparse phrases' still leads to substantial ineffectiveness and inefficiency when they are exhaustively examined.
