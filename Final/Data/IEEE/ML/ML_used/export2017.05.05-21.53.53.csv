A class of traffic classification techniques have emerged that apply machine learning technology to predict the application class of a traffic flow based on the statistical properties of flow-features. In this paper, we propose a novel iterative-tuning scheme to increase the training speed of the classification algorithm using Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning. Meanwhile we derive the equations to obtain SVM parameters by conducting theoretical analysis of iterative-tuning SVM. Traffic classification is carried out using flow-level information extracted from NetFlow data. Performance evaluation demonstrates that the proposed iterative-tuning SVM exhibits a training speed that is two to ten times faster than eight other previously proposed SVM techniques found in the literature, while maintaining comparable classification accuracy as those eight SVM techniques. In the presence of millions of flows and Terabytes of data in the network, faster training speeds is essential to making SVM techniques a viable option for real-world deployment of traffic classification modules. In addition, network operators and cloud service providers can apply network traffic classification to address a range of issues including semi-real-time security monitoring and traffic engineering.","1573-0077;15730077","Electronic:978-1-4799-8241-7; POD:978-1-4799-8242-4","10.1109/INM.2015.7140323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7140323","machine learning;network management;quality of service;support vector machine;traffic classification","Accuracy;Mathematical model;Protocols;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic;Testing;Training","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network management;telecommunication scheduling;telecommunication traffic","NetFlow data;QoS;SVM learning;SVM parameters;application-level visibility;cloud service providers;flow-features;flow-level information;iterative-tuning SVM;iterative-tuning scheme;machine learning technology;network management;network operations;network operators;network traffic classification;quality of service;semi-real-time security monitoring;statistical properties;support vector machine learning;traffic classification modules;traffic classification techniques;traffic engineering;traffic flow","","0","","42","","","11-15 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For these new HSs, empirical Rademacher complexity-based generalization bounds are derived, and are shown to be tighter than the bound of a particular HS, which has appeared recently in the literature, leading to improved performance. As a matter of fact, the latter HS is shown to be a special case of ours.

However, the amount of human annotation effort required to analyze them remains a major bottleneck. While machine learning algorithms can be used to help automate this process, they require training data, which is time-consuming to obtain manually, especially in image stacks. Furthermore, due to changing experimental conditions, successive stacks often exhibit differences that are severe enough to make it difficult to use a classifier trained for a specific one on another. This means that this tedious annotation process has to be repeated for each new stack. In this paper, we present a domain adaptation algorithm that addresses this issue by effectively leveraging labeled examples across different acquisitions and significantly reducing the annotation requirements. Our approach can handle complex, nonlinear image feature transformations and scales to large microscopy datasets that often involve high-dimensional feature spaces and large 3D data volumes. We evaluate our approach on four challenging electron and light microscopy applications that exhibit very different image modalities and where annotation is very costly.

In order to manage the complexity of such an approach, an integrated system is partitioned into multiple modules where each module can be periodically tested, diagnosed and repaired if necessary. The limitation of on-chip memory and computing capability, coupled with the inherent uncertainty in diagnosis, causes the occurrence of misdiagnoses. To address this challenge, a novel incremental-learning algorithm, namely dynamic k-nearest-neighbor (DKNN), is developed to improve the accuracy of on-chip diagnosis. Different from the conventional KNN, DKNN employs online diagnosis data to update the learned classifier so that the classifier can keep evolving as new diagnosis data becomes available. Incorporating online diagnosis data enables tracking of the fault distribution and thus improves diagnostic accuracy. Experiments using various benchmark circuits (e.g., the cache controller from the OpenSPARC T2 processor design) demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy can be more than doubled.","1093-0167;10930167","Electronic:978-1-4799-7597-6; POD:978-1-4799-7598-3","10.1109/VTS.2015.7116280","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116280","On-chip diagnosis;diagnostic accuracy;k-nearest-neighbor;lifetime reliability;machine learning","Accuracy;Benchmark testing;Circuit faults;Delays;Heuristic algorithms;System-on-chip","learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;program testing;software reliability","DKNN;OpenSPARC T2 processor design;cache controller;dynamic k-nearest-neighbor;incremental-learning algorithm;integrated system reliability;on-chip diagnosis;on-chip testing;online diagnosis data","","3","","29","","","27-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If these patterns were to be identified and classified correctly, then the root of the fabrication problem can be recognized and eventually resolved. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely accepted and are well suited for such classification-/identification problems. However, none of the existing ML model's performance exceeds 96% in identification accuracy for such tasks.

We therefore propose to use transfer learning for image segmentation. Transfer-learning techniques can cope with differences in distributions between training and target data, and therefore may improve performance over supervised learning for segmentation across scanners and scan protocols. We present four transfer classifiers that can train a classification scheme with only a small amount of representative training data, in addition to a larger amount of other training data with slightly different characteristics. The performance of the four transfer classifiers was compared to that of standard supervised classification on two magnetic resonance imaging brain-segmentation tasks with multi-site data: white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid segmentation; and white-matter-/MS-lesion segmentation. The experiments showed that when there is only a small amount of representative training data available, transfer learning can greatly outperform common supervised-learning approaches, minimizing classification errors by up to 60%.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2014.2366792","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6945865","Image Segmentation;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging;pattern recognition;transfer learning","Biomedical imaging;Image segmentation;Kernel;Protocols;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","biomedical MRI;brain;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","automatic segmentation;biomedical images;cerebrospinal fluid segmentation;classification scheme;gray matter;image variation;imaging protocols;labeled training data;magnetic resonance imaging brain-segmentation tasks;minimizing classification errors;multisite data;representative training data;standard supervised classification;supervised image segmentation;supervised-learning techniques;target data distributions;transfer classifiers;transfer learning;white-matter-MS-lesion segmentation","Brain;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Support Vector Machine","8","","44","","20141104","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many of these applications, dynamic multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning for agents' autonomous path planning, where agents could be moving randomly to reach their respective goals and avoiding topographical obstacles intelligently, becomes a challenging problem. This is specially so in a dynamic agent environment. In our prior work we presented an intelligent multi-agent hybrid reactive and reinforcement learning technique for collaborative autonomous agent path planning for monitoring Critical Key Infrastructures and Resources (CKIR) in a geographically and a computationally distributed systems. Here agent monitoring of large environments is reduced to monitoring of relatively smaller track-able geographically distributed agent environment regions. In this paper we tackle this problem in the challenging case of complex and cluttered environments, where agents' initial random-walk paths become challenging and relatively nonconverging.

Lerch","University of Virginia","2015 Systems and Information Engineering Design Symposium","20150608","2015","","","91","96","In this paper we develop a methodology for personalizing online search for fashion products. Most search functions on fashion retail sites currently rely on objective data, such as colors or brands, to filter their products. Adding a subjective component of fashion style would allow for a more personalized and relevant search experience for the end user. The proposed methodology is based upon a topic modeling technique - latent Dirichlet allocation - which has been successfully used for classifying unstructured text data. This technique is used to quantitatively define distinct fashion styles based upon text obtained from clothing product information available through APIs with affiliate networks. Using the fashion style definitions, individual clothing brands and looks are then classified. We compare the performance of the proposed methodology with Genostyle's proprietary methodology (Genostyle is a fashion styling analytics company). An experiment was executed to display custom recommendations made using each methodology to participants. The team measured performance by comparing median 5-point Likert scale responses to the recommended looks. Results indicate the latent Dirichlet allocation methodology has higher median Likert responses for the top recommended style. However, the Likert scores for Genostyle's methodology, the latent Dirichlet allocation methodology, and the control group are statistically indistinguishable (p=0.05). Given these results, further experimentation with more diverse participation or presentation of looks may give insights into how to better fashion style predictions that more closely match consumers' preferences.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1832-4; POD:978-1-4799-1833-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7117018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117018","Fashion;Latent Dirichlet allocation;MALLET;Machine learning;Topic modeling","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Clothing;Context;Industries;Machine learning algorithms;Resource management","Web sites;application program interfaces;classification;clothing industry;electronic commerce;query formulation;recommender systems;text analysis","API;Genostyle proprietary methodology;clothing product information;custom recommendations;fashion products;fashion retail sites;latent Dirichlet allocation;median 5-point Likert scale response;personalized online search;search functions;unstructured text data classification","","0","","13","","","24-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations.

Traditional methods for recovering scene properties such as shape, reflectance, or illumination rely on multiple observations of the same scene to overconstrain the problem. Recovering these same properties from a single image seems almost impossible in comparison-there are an infinite number of shapes, paint, and lights that exactly reproduce a single image. However, certain explanations are more likely than others: surfaces tend to be smooth, paint tends to be uniform, and illumination tends to be natural. We therefore pose this problem as one of statistical inference, and define an optimization problem that searches for the most likely explanation of a single image.

A growing accumulation of software errors with time causes a phenomenon called software aging. This phenomenon can result in system performance degradation and eventually system hang/crash. To cope with software aging, software rejuvenation has been proposed. Software rejuvenation is a proactive technique which leads to removing the accumulated software errors by stopping the system, cleaning up its internal state, and resuming its normal operation. One of the main challenges of software rejuvenation is accurately predicting the time to crash due to aging factors such as memory leaks. In this paper, different machine learning techniques are compared to accurately predict the software time to crash under different aging scenarios. Finally, by comparing the accuracy of different techniques, it can be concluded that the multilayer perceptron neural network has the highest prediction accuracy among all techniques studied.","","","10.1109/JSEE.2015.00047","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7111178","machine learning;software rejuvenation;software reliability","Aging;Computer crashes;Least squares approximations;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Software;Software algorithms","","","","0","","","","","April 2015","","BIAI","BIAI Journals & Magazines"

In practice, however, a user may only access limited or authorized places in a building, that causes degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based autonomous indoor war-walking scheme, which automatically constructs the location fingerprint database, even covering unvisited locations. While a smartphone user explores the target area, the proposed system tracks the user's trajectory and simultaneously trains the location fingerprint database. Furthermore, our scheme interpolates radio signals in the database with an appropriate radio propagation model, and supplements fingerprints for unvisited places. As a result, although a user may sparsely explore the target site, the scheme returns the complete database.

Some works conducted over the last years have pointed out that such algorithms are generally susceptible to deception, notably in the form of attacks carefully constructed to evade detection. Various learning schemes have been proposed to overcome this weakness. One such system is Keyed IDS (KIDS), introduced at DIMVA â10. KIDSâ core idea is akin to the functioning of some cryptographic primitives, namely to introduce a secret element (the key) into the scheme so that some operations are infeasible without knowing it. In KIDS the learned model and the computation of the anomaly score are both key-dependent, a fact which presumably prevents an attacker from creating evasion attacks. In this work we show that recovering the key is extremely simple provided that the attacker can interact with KIDS and get feedback about probing requests. We present realistic attacks for two different adversarial settings and show that recovering the key requires only a small amount of queries, which indicates that KIDS does not meet the claimed security properties. We finally revisit KIDS' central idea and provide heuristic arguments about its suitability and limitations.","1545-5971;15455971","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.39","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6598669","Adversarial classification;anomaly detection;intrusion detection systems;secure machine learning","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Machine learning algorithms;Payloads;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","KIDS;anomaly detection systems;evasion attacks;key-recovery attacks;keyed anomaly detection system;machine learning algorithms","","0","","23","","20130913","May-June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Choosing the appropriate and relevant ad for a particular query and positioning of the ad critically impacts the probability of being noticed and clicked. It also strategically impacts the revenue, the search engine shall generate from a particular Ad. Needless to say, showing the user an Ad that is relevant to his/her need greatly improves users satisfaction. For all the aforesaid reasons, its of utmost importance to correctly determine the click-through rate (CTR) of ads in a system. For frequently appearing ads, CTR is empirically measurable, but for the new ads, other means have to be devised. In this paper we propose and establish a model to predict the CTRs of advertisements adopting Logistic Regression as the effective framework for representing and constructing conditions and vulnerabilities among variables. Logistic Regression is a type of probabilistic statistical classification model that predicts a binary response from a binary predictor, based on one or more predictor variables.

The attentional landscape is a more general, dynamic and a more complex concept of an arrangement of spatial attention than the popular âattentional spotlightâ or âzoom-lensâ models of attention. Motor-priming of attention is a mechanism for prioritizing visual processing to motor-relevant parts of the visual field, in contrast to other, motor-irrelevant, parts. In particular, we present two techniques for constructing a visual âattentional landscapeâ. The first, more general, technique, is to devote visual attention to the reachable space of a robot (peripersonal space-primed attention). The second, more specialized, technique is to allocate visual attention with respect to motor plans of the robot (motor plans-primed attention). Hence, in our model, visual attention is not exclusively defined in terms of visual saliency in color, texture or intensity cues, it is rather modulated by motor information. This computational model is inspired by recent findings in visual neuroscience and psychology. In addition to two approaches to constructing the attentional landscape, we present two methods for using the attentional landscape for driving visual processing. We show that motor-priming of visual attention can be used to very efficiently distribute limited computational resources devoted to the visual processing. The proposed model is validated in a series of experiments conducted with the iCub robot, both using the simulator and the real robot.","1943-0604;19430604","","10.1109/TAMD.2015.2417353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069203","Cognitive robotics;computer vision;humanoid robots;machine learning","Adaptation models;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Grasping;Robots;Visualization","cognition;humanoid robots;learning (artificial intelligence);psychology;robot vision","attentional spotlight;computational model;computational resource;humanoid robot;iCub robot;motor information;motor plans-primed attention;motor-primed visual attentional landscape;motor-relevant part;peripersonal space-primed attention;psychology;reachable space;spatial attention;visual neuroscience;visual processing;visual resource allocation;visual saliency;zoom-lens model","","0","","70","","20150326","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A number of detection approaches and tools against such attacks have been proposed so far. Especially, it is becoming easy to specify vulnerabilities of attacks, because researchers well analyze the trend of various attacks. Unfortunately, in the previous schemes, vulnerability information has not been used in the detection/prediction approaches of drive-by-download attacks. In this paper, we propose a prediction approach of ""malware downloading"" during drive-by-download attacks (approach-I), which uses vulnerability information. Our experimental results show our approach-I achieves the prediction rate (accuracy) of 92%, FNR of 15% and FPR of 1.0% using Naive Bayes. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced approach (approach-II) which embeds Opcode analysis (dynamic analysis) into our approach-I (static approach). We implement our approach-I and II, and compare the three approaches (approach-I, II and Opcode approaches) using the same datasets in our experiment. As a result, our approach-II has the prediction rate of 92%, and improves FNR to 11% using Random Forest, compared with our approach-I.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1989-5; POD:978-1-4799-1990-1; USB:978-1-4799-1988-8","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153949","Drive-by-Download Attacks;Malware;Supervised Machine Learning","Browsers;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Malware;Predictive models;Probability;Web pages","Web sites;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);system monitoring","FNR;FPR;Opcode analysis;Web browsers;Web sites;attack vulnerabilities;drive-by-download attack prediction;dynamic analysis;malware downloading;naive Bayes;prediction rate;random forest;static approach;vulnerability evaluation;vulnerability information","","1","","14","","","24-26 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We first propose a novel data expansion technique by creating a sentiment-reversed review for each training and test review. On this basis, we propose a dual training algorithm to make use of original and reversed training reviews in pairs for learning a sentiment classifier, and a dual prediction algorithm to classify the test reviews by considering two sides of one review. We also extend the DSA framework from polarity (positive-negative) classification to 3-class (positive-negative-neutral) classification, by taking the neutral reviews into consideration. Finally, we develop a corpus-based method to construct a pseudo-antonym dictionary, which removes DSA's dependency on an external antonym dictionary for review reversion. We conduct a wide range of experiments including two tasks, nine datasets, two antonym dictionaries, three classification algorithms, and two types of features. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of DSA in supervised sentiment classification.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2015.2407371","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7050255","Natural language processing;machine learning;natural language processing;opinion mining;sentiment analysis","Analytical models;Classification algorithms;Dictionaries;Logistics;Pragmatics;Sentiment analysis;Training","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;statistical analysis;text analysis","3-class classification;BOW;DSA framework;bag-of-words;corpus-based method;data expansion technique;dual prediction algorithm;dual sentiment analysis;dual training algorithm;external antonym dictionary;polarity classification;polarity shift problem;positive-negative classification;positive-negative-neutral classification;pseudoantonym dictionary;reversed training reviews;sentiment classification problem;sentiment-reversed review;statistical machine learning approaches;supervised sentiment classification;test review;text model","","7","","49","","20150226","Aug. 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This technique is not reliable, though, in two situations: in the prediction of rare events, which do not appear in enough proportion for the algorithm to capture, and in environments where there are too many variables, as logistic regression tends to over fit on this situations, while manually selecting a subset of variables to create the model is error-prone. On this paper, we solve an industrial research case that presented this situation with a combination of elastic net logistic regression, a method that allows us to automatically select useful variables, a process of cross-validation on top of it and the application of a rare events prediction technique to reduce computation time. This process provides two layers of cross-validation that automatically obtain the optimal model complexity and the optimal model parameters values, while ensuring even rare events will be correctly predicted with a low amount of training instances.

Such networks may be self operating or linked to a larger internet and may have one or multiple different transceivers between nodes resulting in a highly dynamic and autonomous topology. The first focus is on MANET attacks followed by detection of the malicious node from MANET via Polynomial-Reduction Algorithm. Although scientists have assessed many algorithms for the detection and rectification of the malicious nodes in the MANETs, the problem still persists. Due to the unprecedented growth in technology, the unidentified vulnerabilities are also intensifying. Therefore, it is very crucial to come up with some ground-breaking ideas to prevent the MANET.

Traditional kernel based techniques, like the neural network and the support vector machine (SVM), typically can deliver higher prediction accuracy. However, the user of a kernel based techniques normally cannot get an overall picture about the distribution of the data set. On the other hand, logic based techniques, such as the decision tree and the rule-based algorithm, feature the advantage of presenting a good summary about the distinctive characteristics of different classes of data such that they are more suitable to generate interpretable feedbacks to domain experts. In this study, a real web-access log dataset from a certain organization was collected. An efficient interpretable fuzzy rule filter (iF<sup>2</sup>) was proposed as a filter to analyze the data and to detect suspicious internet addresses from the normal ones. The historical information of each internet address recorded in web log file is summarized as multiple statistics. And the design process of iF<sup>2</sup> is elaborately modeled as a parameter optimization problem which simultaneously considers 1) maximizing prediction accuracy, 2) minimizing number of used rules, and 3) minimizing number of selected statistics. Experimental results show that the fuzzy rule filter constructed with the proposed approach is capable of delivering superior prediction accuracy in comparison with the conventional logic based classifiers and the expectation maximization based kernel algorithm. On the other hand, though it cannot match the prediction accuracy delivered by the SVM, however, when facing real web log file where the ratio of positive and negative cases is extremely unbalanced, the proposed iF<sup>2</sup> of having optimization flexibility results in a better recall rate and enjoys one major advantage due to providing th- user with an overall picture of the underlying distributions.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1989-5; POD:978-1-4799-1990-1; USB:978-1-4799-1988-8","10.1109/AsiaJCIS.2015.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7153947","Fuzzy Rule Based Filter;Machine Learning;Parameter Optimization;Pattern Recognition;Post-Compromised Threat Identification;Web Log Analysis","Accuracy;Internet;Kernel;Monitoring;Optimization;Prediction algorithms;Support vector machines","Internet;data mining;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Internet address;SVM;Web log file tracking;Web log post-compromised malicious activity monitoring;Web-access log dataset;decision tree;expectation maximization based kernel algorithm;fuzzy rule filter;iF<sup>2</sup>;interpretable fuzzy rule filter;kernel based techniques;log data analysis;logic based classifiers;logic based techniques;machine learning methods;malicious activities;neural network;parameter optimization problem;recall rate;rule-based algorithm;support vector machine","","0","","21","","","24-26 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Such platforms are usually programmed using OpenCL which provides program portability by allowing the same program to execute on different types of device. As such systems become more mainstream, they will move from application dedicated devices to platforms that need to support multiple concurrent user applications. Here there is a need to determine when and where to map different applications so as to best utilize the available heterogeneous hardware resources. In this paper, we present an efficient OpenCL task scheduling scheme which schedules multiple kernels from multiple programs on CPU/GPU heterogeneous platforms. It does this by determining at runtime which kernels are likely to best utilize a device. We show that speedup is a good scheduling priority function and develop a novel model that predicts a kernel's speedup based on its static code structure. Our scheduler uses this prediction and runtime input data size to prioritize and schedule tasks. This technique is applied to a large set of concurrent OpenCL kernels. We evaluated our approach for system throughput and average turn-around time against competitive techniques on two different platforms: a Core i7/Nvidia GTX590 and a Core i7/AMD Tahiti 7970 platforms. For system throughput, we achieve, on average, a 1.21x and 1.25x improvement over the best competitors on the NVIDIA and AMD platforms respectively. Our approach reduces the turnaround time, on average, by at least 1.5x and 1.2x on the NVIDIA and AMD platforms respectively, when compared to alternative approaches.","1094-7256;10947256","Electronic:978-1-4799-5976-1; POD:978-1-4799-5977-8","10.1109/HiPC.2014.7116910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116910","GPU;OpenCL;machine learning;task scheduling","Feature extraction;Graphics processing units;Kernel;Runtime;Schedules;Throughput;Training","concurrency (computers);graphics processing units;multiprocessing programs;parallel processing;scheduling","CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms;Core i7-AMD Tahiti 7970 platform;Core i7-Nvidia GTX590 platform;OpenCL programs;OpenCL task scheduling scheme;concurrent OpenCL kernels;heterogeneous hardware resources;high performance computing;kernel speedup;scheduling priority function;smart multitask scheduling;static code structure","","4","","36","","","17-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, such diagnosis method requires a rich set of test items (syndromes) and a sizable database of faulty boards to learn from. An insufficient number of failed boards, ambiguous root-cause identification, and redundant or irrelevant syndromes can render reasoning-based diagnosis ineffective. Periodic evaluation and analysis can help locate weaknesses in a diagnosis system and thereby provide guidelines for redesigning the tests, which facilitates better diagnosis. We propose an information-theoretic framework for evaluating the effectiveness of and providing guidance to a reasoning-based functional-fault diagnosis system. Syndrome analysis based on feature selection methods provides a representative set of syndromes and suggests irrelevant syndromes in diagnosis.

"A hybrid feature subset selection by combining filters and genetic algorithm","S. Singh; S.

Hence, Feature selection is a critical step in the machine learning process. The role of feature selection is to select a subset of size `d' (d<;n) from the given set of `n' features that leads to the smallest classification error. Feature selection problem can be seen as the optimization problem where the goal is to pick the optimal or near optimal feature subset with respect to an objective function. Based on the literature, it is intuitively felt that the classifier will give its optimum performance if the high dimensional data is reduced to include only relevant attributes with low redundancy. Further, it is seen that the filter method is performance centric and the genetic algorithms are insensitive to noise data. This motivated us to combine the advantages of filter method with the genetic algorithm to make a hybrid system to select the optimal feature subset from the given original feature set. The contribution of this paper includes, simultaneous optimization of feature subset and classifier parameters, a multi-objective function that reduces the classification error with reduction in cardinality of feature subset and its cost. The vital aspect of this model is to generate an initial population through various filter approaches for the initialization stage. Further, to evaluate the effectiveness of the model, experiments were conducted using KNN and decision tree (such as cart) on various UCI machine learning and generated datasets. The experiment results show that the proposed model effectively reduces the number of features without degrading the classification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8890-7; POD:978-1-4799-8891-4","10.1109/CCAA.2015.7148389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7148389","Chi-Square;Decision tree;Dimensionality reduction;Genetic Algorithm;Machine learning;Ratio Gain","Accuracy;Decision trees;Frequency selective surfaces;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Sociology;Statistics","data reduction;decision trees;feature selection;genetic algorithms;information filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","KNN;UCI machine learning process;classification error reduction;combining filter method;data classification;decision tree;genetic algorithm;high dimensional data reduction;hybrid feature subset selection;multiobjective function;noise data;optimization problem","","0","","18","","","15-16 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The ability to predict nutrient-rich discharges, in real time, can be very valuable to enable reuse mechanisms within farm systems. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) offer an opportunity to monitor environmental systems with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. As part of our previous work, we proposed a novel framework (WQMCM) to combine increasingly common local farm-scale sensor networks across a catchment to learn and predict (using predictive models) the impact of catchment events on their downstream environments, allowing dynamic decision. Existing models use complex parameters which are difficult to extract and this, coupled with constraints on network nodes (battery life, computing power etc., availability of sensors) makes it necessary to develop simplified models for deployment within the networks. The paper investigates data-driven model for predicting daily total oxidized nitrate (TON) fluxes by seeking simplification in model parameters and using only a yearlong training data set. Data from a catchment in Ireland is used for training the model. Model simplification is investigated by abstracting details from an existing nitrate loss model. By using M5 decision tree model on the training samples of the proposed parameters, results give R2 as 0.92 and RRMSE as 0.26. The proposed novel model gives better results with fewer samples and simple parameters when compared to the traditional model. This shows promise for enabling real time nutrient control and management within the collaborative networked farm system.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6117-7; POD:978-1-4799-6118-4; USB:978-1-4799-6116-0","10.1109/SAS.2015.7133592","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7133592","M5 trees;agriculture;machine learning;nitrate losses;wireless sensor networks","Agriculture;Computational modeling;Data models;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Training;Wireless sensor networks","agriculture;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless sensor networks","M5 decision tree model;data-driven low-complexity nitrate loss model;farm management;farm-scale sensor networks;sensor information;total oxidized nitrate fluxes;wireless sensor networks","","1","","40","","","13-15 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Empirical performance models based on trial executions which require no or little human efforts show more practical feasibility if the sampling and training cost can be reduced to a reasonable level. In previous work we proposed an early version of adaptive pruning algorithm for efficient selection of training samples, a decision-tree based method for representing, predicting and selecting the fastest implementation variants for given run-time call context properties, and a composition tool for building the overall composed application from its components. For adaptive pruning we use a heuristic convexity assumption. In this paper we consolidate and improve the method by new pruning techniques to better support the convexity assumption and better control the trade-off between sampling time, prediction accuracy and runtime prediction overhead. Our results show that the training time can be reduced by up to 39 times without noticeable prediction accuracy decrease. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of combinations of pruning strategies and compare our adaptive sampling method with random sampling. We also use our smart-sampling method as a preprocessor to a state-of-the-art decision tree learning algorithm and compare the result to the predictor directly calculated by our method.","0190-3918;01903918","Electronic:978-1-4799-5615-9; POD:978-1-4799-5616-6","10.1109/ICPPW.2014.42","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7103460","Adaptive sampling;Autotuning;GPU;Heterogeneous computing;Implementation selection;Machine learning;Performance optimization","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Benchmark testing;Context;Predictive models;Training;Tuning","decision trees;parallel processing;random processes;sampling methods","adaptive off-line tuning;adaptive program optimization;decision-tree;heterogeneous computing system;pruning strategy;random sampling;sampling time;smart-sampling method","","0","","18","","","9-12 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Boosting operates by learning multiple functions with subsequent functions focusing on incorrect instances where the previous functions predicted the wrong label. Despite considerable success, boosting still has difficulty on data sets with certain types of problematic training data (e.g., label noise) and when complex functions overfit the training data. We propose a novel cluster-based boosting (CBB) approach to address limitations in boosting for supervised learning systems. Our CBB approach partitions the training data into clusters containing highly similar member data and integrates these clusters directly into the boosting process. CBB boosts selectively (using a high learning rate, low learning rate, or not boosting) on each cluster based on both the additional structure provided by the cluster and previous function accuracy on the member data. Selective boosting allows CBB to improve predictive accuracy on problematic training data. In addition, boosting separately on clusters reduces function complexity to mitigate overfitting. We provide comprehensive experimental results on 20 UCI benchmark data sets with three different kinds of supervised learning systems. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CBB approach compared to a popular boosting algorithm, an algorithm that uses clusters to improve boosting, and two algorithms that use selective boosting without clustering.","1041-4347;10414347","","10.1109/TKDE.2014.2382598","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6990607","Artificial Intelligence;Artificial intelligence;Clustering Algorithms;Machine Learning;clustering algorithms;machine learning","Accuracy;Assembly;Boosting;Clustering algorithms;Filtering;Noise;Training data","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering","CBB approach;UCI benchmark data sets;cluster-based boosting;function complexity;iterative process;predictive accuracy;supervised machine learning algorithms","","1","","37","","20141218","June 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Such long calibration times are due to the large between-user variability and thus to the need to collect numerous training electroencephalography (EEG) trials for the machine learning algorithms used in BCI design. In this paper, we first survey existing approaches to reduce or suppress calibration time, these approaches being notably based on regularization, user-to-user transfer, semi-supervised learning and a priori physiological information. We then propose new tools to reduce BCI calibration time. In particular, we propose to generate artificial EEG trials from the few EEG trials initially available, in order to augment the training set size. These artificial EEG trials are obtained by relevant combinations and distortions of the original trials available. We propose three different methods to do so. We also propose a new, fast and simple approach to perform user-to-user transfer for BCI. Finally, we study and compare offline different approaches, both old and new ones, on the data of 50 users from three different BCI data sets.

The PUF studied in this paper utilizes the variation sensitivity of static random access memory (SRAM) data retention voltage (DRV), the minimum voltage at which each cell can retain state. Prior work shows that DRV can uniquely identify circuit instances with 28% greater success than SRAM power-up states that are used in PUFs [1]. However, DRV is highly sensitive to temperature, and until now this makes it unreliable and unsuitable for use in a PUF. In this paper, we enable DRV PUFs by proposing a DRV-based hash function that is insensitive to temperature. The new hash function, denoted DRV-based hashing (DH), is reliable across temperatures because it utilizes the temperature-insensitive ordering of DRVs across cells, instead of using the DRVs in absolute terms. To evaluate the security and performance of the DRV PUF, we use DRV measurements from commercially available SRAM chips, and use data from a novel DRV prediction algorithm. The prediction algorithm uses machine learning for fast and accurate simulation-free estimation of any cell's DRV, and the prediction error in comparison to circuit simulation has a standard deviation of 0.35 mV. We demonstrate the DRV PUF using two applications-secret key generation and identification. In secret key generation, we introduce a new circuit-level reliability knob as an alternative to error correcting codes. In the identification application, our approach is compared to prior work and shown to result in a smaller false-positive identification rate for any desired true-positive identification rate.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2418288","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078918","Chip Identification;Chip identification;Data Retention Voltage;Key Generation;Machine Learning;Physical Unclonable Function;data retention voltage (DRV);key generation;machine learning (ML);physical unclonable function (PUF)","Integrated circuit modeling;Reliability;SRAM cells;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Transistors","SRAM chips;cryptography;integrated circuit reliability;learning (artificial intelligence)","SRAM cells;circuit-level reliability;data retention voltage;error correcting codes;hash function;machine learning;reliable physical unclonable functions;secret key generation;static random access memory","","4","","50","","20150402","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Numerous algorithms have been designed to perform tree-cover delineation in high-to-coarse-resolution satellite imagery, but most of them do not scale to terabytes of data, typical in these VHR data sets. In this paper, we present an automated probabilistic framework for the segmentation and classification of 1-m VHR data as obtained from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for deriving tree-cover estimates for the whole of Continental United States, using a high-performance computing architecture. The results from the classification and segmentation algorithms are then consolidated into a structured prediction framework using a discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model based on conditional random field, which helps in capturing the higher order contextual dependence relations between neighboring pixels. Once the final probability maps are generated, the framework is updated and retrained by incorporating expert knowledge through the relabeling of misclassified image patches. This leads to a significant improvement in the true positive rates and reduction in false positive rates (FPRs). The tree-cover maps were generated for the state of California, which covers a total of 11 095 NAIP tiles and spans a total geographical area of 163 696 sq. miles. Our framework produced correct detection rates of around 88% for fragmented forests and 74% for urban tree-cover areas, with FPRs lower than 2% for both regions.

This is important for chips manufactured in advanced technologies, as systematic failures are getting harder to detect by conventional structural tests. However, due to long test time and extra human efforts, the cost for SLT is high. A possible way to replace SLT without quality loss is to identify SLT failure suspects with stress tests. In this work, we apply 60,000 structural stress test patterns to the CPU blocks of a real SOC product, using 20 stressed voltage-frequency corners. We try to identify the correlation between the stress test data and SLT-pass/fail results of the CPU blocks. By the proposed differential feature-based methodology, 32 outliers are identified, which are assumed to be CPU-fail chips. Because of the lack of exact CPU-fail chip IDs for verification, the identified chip IDs are compared with the IDs identified from previous works, which use the same data but different machine-learning features and method for the same purpose. After comparison, 30 out of a total of 33 CPU-fail suspects matched. Although this does not immediately imply that the SLT can be replaced by the structural stress tests, it shows more evidence that test data mining can be further explored for test time reduction and/or quality improvement.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6275-4; POD:978-1-4799-6276-1","10.1109/VLSI-DAT.2015.7114508","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7114508","data mining;higher-than-at-speed test;low-voltage test;machine learning;structural test;system-level test","Correlation;Data mining;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits;Principal component analysis;Silicon;Stress","data mining;electronic engineering computing;failure analysis;integrated circuit manufacture;integrated circuit testing;learning (artificial intelligence);losses;silicon;stress analysis","CPU blocks;CPU-fail chip ID;IC quality loss;SLT-pass-fail results;SOC product;Si;differential feature-based methodology;extra human efforts;machine learning features;regular final test;structural stress test data mining;system-level test coverage prediction;systematic failures;test time reduction;voltage-frequency corners","","0","","19","","","27-29 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the static TSP, the dataset must be complete and never change throughout the processing of the solution. The static TSP provides a rich theoretical framework in which to study the full optimization of the shortest route for a given set of points. The points in a static dataset are fixed forever, and there is no concept of time in the traversal of the dataset. On the other hand, the dynamic TSP considers the actual traversal of the dataset with respect to time. The dynamic TSP is more suited to a wide range of real-world problems, in which the dataset is incomplete and changeable. Most of the existing high-performing TSP solvers are constrained to static TSP datasets only, and these solvers are not readily transformed to handle dynamic TSP datasets. A recently introduced TSP solver is the Tour Construction Framework (TCF), which integrates both global and local heuristics in a complementary framework in order to efficiently solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). A potential advantage of the TCF is the ability to robustly solve dynamic TSP problems. In this research, standard TSP datasets are used to formulate dynamic TSP datasets and the TCF and mainstream TSP solvers are applied to solve these large dynamic TSP datasets.

In those cases that learning fails, this capability can guide the learning mechanism towards a hypothesis that seems more promising to a domain expert. One of the main reasons for omitting such involvement is the difficulty of knowledge acquisition from experts and, also, the difficulty of combining it with induced hypothesis. One of the successful solutions to such a problem is an alternative approach in machine learning called Argument Based Machine Learning (ABML) which involves experts in providing specific explanations in the form of arguments to only specific cases that fail, rather than general knowledge on all cases. Inspired by this study, the idea of Hierarchical Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning (HFIR) is proposed in this paper as the first step towards design and development of an Argument Based Fuzzy Inductive Reasoning method capable of providing domain expert involvement in its induction process.

Severe sepsis is one of the leading causes of death among these patients. Predictive models have the potential to allow for earlier detection of severe sepsis and ultimately earlier intervention. However, current methods for identifying and predicting severe sepsis are biased and inadequate. The goal of this work is to identify a new framework for the prediction of severe sepsis and identify early predictors utilizing clinical laboratory values and vital signs collected in adult ICU patients. We explore models with logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic model trees (LMT) utilizing vital signs, laboratory values, or a combination of vital and laboratory values. When applied to a retrospective cohort of ICU patients, the SVM model using laboratory and vital signs as predictors identified 339 (65%) of the 3,446 patients as developing severe sepsis correctly. Based on this new framework and developed models, we provide a recommendation for the use in clinical decision support in ICU and non-ICU environments.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1832-4; POD:978-1-4799-1833-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7116970","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116970","ICU;Machine Learning;Prediction;Predictive Monitoring;Risk;Severe Sepsis","Blood;Data models;Logistics;Measurement;Predictive models;Regression tree analysis;Support vector machines","decision support systems;diseases;patient diagnosis;regression analysis;support vector machines;trees (mathematics)","Adult ICU patient;LMT;LR;SVM;clinical decision support;intensive care unit patient;logistic model tree;logistic regression;predictive model;sepsis detection;support vector machine","","1","","28","","","24-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, to probe human laughter perception by analyzing patterns of categorisations of natural laughter animated on a minimal avatar. Results reveal that a low dimensional space can describe perception of laughter âtypesâ. Second, to investigate observersâ perception of laughter (hilarious, social, awkward, fake, and non-laughter) based on animated avatars generated from natural and acted motion-capture data. Significant differences in torso and limb movements are found between animations perceived as laughter and those perceived as non-laughter. Hilarious laughter also differs from social laughter. Different body movement features were indicative of laughter in sitting and standing avatar postures. Third, to investigate automatic recognition of laughter to the same level of certainty as observersâ perceptions.

However the teaching-learning mode of supervised learning is not practical in real application, because it is impossible to teach a system all possible samples in one time. Therefore, incremental learning is considered to be a promising solution which supports the iteration of teaching-learning in cycles. An incremental learning based system can always be taught and can learn new samples of objects. However, from engineering perspective, incremental learning is not so practical for user in a teaching-learning cycle. For this reason, an assistant is proposed to support teaching-learning cycles. The assistant includes the following four functions: âresult monitoringâ, âauxiliary teachingâ, âincremental learningâ and âclassifier evaluationâ. With the help of an assistant, system user is able to control the whole teaching-learning cycle, and interact with the image processing system easily.

Remote Access Trojans (RAT), a kind of spyware, are used to invade the PC of a victim through targeted attacks. After the intrusion, the attacker can monitor and control the victim's PC remotely, to wait for an opportunity to steal the confidential information. Since it is hard to prevent the intrusion of RATs completely, preventing confidential information being leaked back to the attacker is the main issue. Various existing approaches introduce different network behaviors of RAT to construct detection systems. Unfortunately, two challenges remain: one is to detect RAT sessions as early as possible, the other is to remain a high accuracy to detect RAT sessions, while there exist normal applications whose traffic behave similarly to RATs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect RAT sessions in the early stage of communication. To differentiate network behaviors between normal applications and RAT, we extract the features from the traffic of a short period of time at the beginning. Afterward, we use machine learning techniques to train the detection model, then evaluate it by K-Fold cross-validation. The results show that our approach is able to detect RAT sessions with a high accuracy. In particular, our approach achieves over 96% accuracy together with the FNR of 10% by Random Forest algorithm, which means that our approach is valid to detect RAT sessions in the early stage of communication.","1550-445X;1550445X","Electronic:978-1-4799-7905-9; POD:978-1-4799-7906-6","10.1109/AINA.2015.257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7098042","Remote Access Trojan detection;machine learning;network behavior;targeted attack","Accuracy;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Rats;Support vector machines;Training;Trojan horses","","","","1","","14","","","24-27 March 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that its efficacy extends beyond HTTPS-enabled sites. Our solution enables immediate local identification of phishing sites. As such, this serves as an important complement to the existing server-based anti-phishing mechanisms which predominately use blacklists. Blacklisting suffers from several inherent drawbacks in terms of correctness, timeliness, and completeness. Due to the potentially significant lag prior to site blacklisting, there is a window of opportunity for attackers. Other local client-side phishing detection approaches also exist, but primarily rely on page content or URLs, which are arguably easier to manipulate by attackers. We illustrate that our certificate-based approach greatly increases the difficulty of masquerading undetected for phishers, with single millisecond delays for users. We further show that this approach works not only against HTTPS-enabled phishing attacks, but also detects HTTP phishing attacks with port 443 enabled.","2159-1237;21591237","Electronic:978-1-4799-8909-6; POD:978-1-4799-8910-2","10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120795","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7120795","certificates;machine learning;security","Browsers;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Public key;Servers;Uniform resource locators","Web sites;computer crime;learning (artificial intelligence);public key cryptography","HTTPS-enabled phishing attack;Web site phishing detection;machine-learning approach from;public key certificate;server-based antiphishing mechanism;site blacklisting","","0","","38","","","26-29 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper shows that chips are better understood by combining noisy measurement results and model information through a mathematical algorithm. Our proposed method learns segment delays in logic circuits from quantized path delay measurements using ridge regression. During the learning process, we take advantage of both nominal segment delays and the delay sensitivity with respect to variations. We also interpret the ridge regression in Bayesian context and in doing so, propose an analytic formula to set the regularization parameter of the ridge regression. For the silicon measurement environments where low measurement resolution is the dominant source of measurement noise, this formula allows us to predict post-silicon results more accurately and speed up the algorithm eliminating inefficient and inaccurate cross-validation. We also demonstrate our method in enhancing the resolution of already measured path delays. We learn segment delays from quantized path delay measurements and predict the path delays prior to the quantization. Our simulation results show that the predicted path delays are much closer to actual values than the measured values and the nominal values.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2419631","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7079489",", Defect Diagnosis;Defect diagnosis;Machine Learning;Post-Silicon Debug;Post-Silicon Validation;machine learning;post-silicon debug;post-silicon validation","Delays;Integrated circuit modeling;Mathematical model;Quantization (signal);Semiconductor device measurement;Silicon","Bayes methods;elemental semiconductors;learning (artificial intelligence);logic circuits;regression analysis;sensitivity analysis;silicon","Si;delay sensitivity;logic circuits;low measurement resolution;mathematical algorithm;measurement noise;model-silicon miscorrelation;path delay prediction;quantized path delay measurements;regularization parameter;ridge regression;segment delay learning process;silicon chip;silicon measurement environments","","0","","12","","20150403","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Positron emission tomography (PET) systems that require regular calibrations by qualified scanner operators are good candidates for such continuous improvements. Furthermore, for scanners employing one-to-one coupling of crystals to photodetectors to achieve enhanced spatial resolution and contrast, the calibration task is even more daunting because of the large number of independent channels involved. To cope with the additional complexity of the calibration and quality control procedures of these scanners, an intelligent system (IS) was designed to perform fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) of malfunctioning channels. The IS can be broken down into four hierarchical modules: parameter extraction, diagnosis, channel fault detection and fault prioritization. Of these modules, parameter extraction and fault detection have previously been reported and this paper focuses on diagnosis, improved fault detection and fault prioritization. The status diagnosis module will diagnose all channels and propose an explanation of the reasons that lead to the diagnosis. The purpose of the fault prioritization module is to help the operator to zero in on the faults that need immediate attention. The FDD system was implemented on a LabPET avalanche photodiode (APD)-based digital PET scanner. Experiments demonstrated a FDD Sensitivity of 99.9% (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [99.6, 100.0]) for major faults. Globally, the balanced accuracy of the diagnosis for varying fault severities is 91%. This suggests the IS can greatly benefit the operators in their maintenance task.","0018-9499;00189499","","10.1109/TNS.2015.2425794","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7117476","Artificial intelligence (AI);biomedical imaging;expert systems;fault diagnosis;fuzzy logic;machine learning;positron emission tomography (PET)","Accuracy;Expert systems;Fault detection;Fuzzy logic;Noise;Positron emission tomography;Sensitivity","avalanche photodiodes;biomedical equipment;calibration;fault diagnosis;photodetectors;positron emission tomography;quality control","FDD Sensitivity;automatic channel fault detection-diagnosis system;calibration task;enhanced spatial resolution;fault prioritization;independent channels;intelligent system;labPET avalanche photodiode-based digital PET scanner;malfunctioning channels;photodetectors;positron emission tomography;quality control procedures;small animal APD-based digital PET scanner","","2","","19","","20150603","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The online schemes process signals sequentially, and can be especially useful when dealing with big data, and for real-time, or limited latency signal processing applications. In this paper, we prove that although the associated optimization problems are non-convex, the online transform learning algorithms are guaranteed to converge to the set of stationary points of the learning problem.

Most of them rely on inference components heavily for detecting interesting activities or contexts. Existing work implements inference components using traditional models designed for balanced data sets, where the sizes of interesting (positive) and non-interesting (negative) data are comparable. Practically, however, the positive and negative sensing data are highly imbalanced. For example, a single daily activity such as bicycling or driving usually occupies a small portion of time, resulting in rare positive instances. Under this circumstance, the trained models based on imbalanced data tend to mislabel positive ones as negative. In this paper, we propose a new inference framework SLIM based on several machine learning techniques in order to accommodate the imbalanced nature of sensing data. Especially, guided under-sampling is employed to obtain balanced labelled subsets, followed by a similarity-based sampling that draws massive unlabelled data to enhance training. To the best of our knowledge, SLIM is the first model that considers data imbalance in mobile sensing. We prototype two sensing apps and the experimental results show that SLIM achieves higher recall (activity recognition rate) while maintaining the precision compared with five classical models. In terms of the overall recall and precision, SLIM is around 12 percent better than the compared solutions on average.","1536-1233;15361233","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2345053","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6868981","Mobile sensing applications;imbalanced sensing data;machine learning;semi-supervised learning;under-sampling","Data models;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Semisupervised learning;Sensors;Smart phones;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing","SLIM;imbalanced sensing data;inference components;machine learning techniques;mobile sensing apps;negative data;noninteresting data;positive data;precision;recall","","1","","40","","20140731","June 1 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In many of the real world applications, classification of imbalanced data-sets is the point of attraction. Most of the classification methods focused on two-class imbalanced problem. So, it is necessary to solve multi-class imbalanced problem, which exist in real-world domains. In the proposed work, we introduced a methodology for classification of multi-class imbalanced data. This methodology consists of two steps: In first step we used Binarization techniques (OVA and OVO) for decomposing original dataset into subsets of binary classes. In second step, the SMOTE algorithm is applied against each subset of imbalanced binary class in order to get balanced data. Finally, to achieve classification goal Random Forest (RF) classifier is used. Specifically, oversampling technique is adapted to big data using MapReduce so that this technique is able to handle as large data-set as needed.

Many state-of-the-art approaches to image segmentation use structured models whose parameters must be carefully chosen for optimal performance. A popular choice is to learn them using a large-margin framework and more specifically structured support vector machines (SSVM). Although SSVMs are appealing, they suffer from certain limitations. First, they are restricted in practice to linear kernels because the more powerful nonlinear kernels cause the learning to become prohibitively expensive. Second, they require iteratively finding the most violated constraints, which is often intractable for the loopy graphical models used in image segmentation. This requires approximation that can lead to reduced quality of learning. In this paper, we propose three novel techniques to overcome these limitations. We first introduce a method to âkernelizeâ the features so that a linear SSVM framework can leverage the power of nonlinear kernels without incurring much additional computational cost. Moreover, we employ a working set of constraints to increase the reliability of approximate subgradient methods and introduce a new way to select a suitable step size at each iteration. We demonstrate the strength of our approach on both 2-D and 3-D electron microscopic (EM) image data and show consistent performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2014.2376274","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6967781","Computer vision;electron microscopy;image processing;image segmentation;kernel methods;mitochondria;segmentation;statistical machine learning;structured prediction;superpixels;supervoxels","Approximation methods;Fasteners;Image segmentation;Kernel;Labeling;Support vector machines;Training","biological tissues;cellular biophysics;electron microscopy;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;support vector machines","2D electron microscopic image data;2D imagery segmentation;3D electron microscopic image data;3D imagery segmentation;cellular structures;large-margin framework;learning structured models;linear SSVM framework;linear kernels;loopy graphical models;microscopic data;neural tissue;nonlinear kernels;optimal performance;specifically structured support vector machines","Algorithms;Animals;CA1 Region, Hippocampal;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Machine Learning;Microscopy, Electron;Mitochondria;Models, Statistical;Models, Theoretical","1","","59","","20141126","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By comparing statistics on habitual behavior (e.g., average by time of day), one can specifically identify nonhabitual crowds, which are often very problematic for transport systems. While habitual overcrowding (e.g., peak hour) is well understood both by traffic managers and travelers, nonhabitual overcrowding hotspots can become even more disruptive and unpleasant because they are generally unexpected. By quickly understanding such cases, a transport manager can react and mitigate transport system disruptions. We propose a probabilistic data analysis model that breaks each nonhabitual overcrowding hotspot into a set of explanatory components. The potential explanatory components are initially retrieved from social networks and special events websites and then processed through text-analysis techniques. Finally, for each such component, the probabilistic model estimates a specific share in the total overcrowding counts. We first validate with synthetic data and then test our model with real data from the public transport system (EZLink) of Singapore, focused on three case study areas. We demonstrate that it is able to generate explanations that are intuitively plausible and consistent both locally (correlation coefficient, i.e., CC, from 85% to 99% for the three areas) and globally (CC from 41.2% to 83.9%). This model is directly applicable to any other domain sensitive to crowd formation due to large social events (e.g., communications, water, energy, waste).","1524-9050;15249050","","10.1109/TITS.2014.2368119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7021960","Information extraction;machine learning;smartcards;special events;travel demand modeling;web mining","Bayes methods;Data models;Facebook;Google;Intelligent transportation systems;Internet;Predictive models","Internet;behavioural sciences computing;data analysis;information retrieval;probability;public transport;smart cards;social networking (online);text analysis;traffic engineering computing","Internet data;Web sites;correlation coefficient;crowd formation;habitual behavior;nonhabitual transport overcrowding hotspot;probabilistic data analysis;probabilistic model;public transport smart card data;public transport system;social events;social networks;text-analysis techniques;traffic managers","","1","","26","","20150126","June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A possible solution is resorting to self-management, as fostered by autonomic computing. However, the abstraction layer provided by cloud computing obfuscates several details of the provided services, which, in turn, hinders the effectiveness of autonomic managers. Data-driven approaches, particularly those relying on service clustering based on machine learning techniques, can assist the autonomic management and support decisions concerning, for example, the scheduling and deployment of services. One aspect that complicates this approach is that the information provided by the monitoring contains both continuous (e.g. CPU load) and categorical (e.g. VM instance type) data. Current approaches treat this problem in a heuristic fashion. This paper, instead, proposes an approach, which uses all kinds of data and learns in a data-driven fashion the similarities and resource usage patterns among the services. In particular, we use an unsupervised formulation of the Random Forest algorithm to calculate similarities and provide them as input to a clustering algorithm. For the sake of efficiency and meeting the dynamism requirement of autonomic clouds, our methodology consists of two steps: (i) off-line clustering and (ii) on-line prediction. Using datasets from real-world clouds, we demonstrate the superiority of our solution with respect to others and validate the accuracy of the on-line prediction. Moreover, to show the applicability of our approach, we devise a service scheduler that uses the notion of similarity among services and evaluate it in a cloud test-bed.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8006-2; POD:978-1-4799-8007-9","10.1109/CCGrid.2015.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7152517","Autonomic Computing;Cloud Computing;Machine Learning;Random Forest;SImilarity Learning","Clustering algorithms;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Radio frequency;Security;Training;Vegetation","cloud computing;decision support systems;fault tolerant computing;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;scheduling;unsupervised learning","CPU load;abstraction layer;autonomic clouds;autonomic computing;autonomic management;autonomic managers;categorical data;cloud service management;cloud service optimisation;cloud test-bed;data-driven approach;machine learning techniques;off-line clustering;on-line prediction;random forest algorithm;resource usage patterns;service clustering;service scheduler","","7","","46","","","4-7 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The disadvantage of supervised methods is the requirement to calibrate them with recently acquired subject-specific training data. Here, we present a novel algorithm for dimensionality reduction (spatial filter), that is ideally suited for single-trial detection of event-related potentials (ERPs) and can be adapted online to a new subject to minimize or avoid calibration time. Methods: The algorithm is based on the well-known xDAWN filter, but uses generalized eigendecomposition to allow an incremental training by recursive least squares (RLS) updates of the filter coefficients. We analyze the effectiveness of the spatial filter in different transfer scenarios and combinations with adaptive classifiers. Results: The results show that it can compensate changes due to switching between different users, and therefore allows to reuse training data that has been previously recorded from other subjects. Conclusions: The presented approach allows to reduce or completely avoid a calibration phase and to instantly use the BCI system with only a minor decrease of performance. Significance: The novel filter can adapt a precomputed spatial filter to a new subject and make a BCI system user independent.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2402252","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7038203","Adaptation;Brain Computer Interfaces;Online Machine Learning;Spatial Filtering;brainâcomputer interfaces (BCI);online machine learning;spatial filtering","Correlation;Memory management;Noise;Standards;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","adaptive filters;adaptive signal processing;bioelectric potentials;brain-computer interfaces;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;medical signal processing;spatial filters","BCI;BCI system;RLS;adaptive spatial filter;brain-computer interfaces;event-related potentials;generalized eigendecomposition;recursive least squares;single-trial detection;spatial filter;subject-specific training data;supervised signal processing methods;training data;user-independent single trial detection;xDAWN filter","1","4","","48","","20150210","July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

This makes health-related classification more challenging. In this study, we use flu-related classification as a demonstration to propose a hybrid classification method, which combines two classification approaches: manually- defined features and auto-generated features by machine learning approaches.

The large number of methods for the EEG feature extraction demands a good feature for every task. Digging up the most unique feature would be worthy for the identification of individual using EEG signal. This research presents a novel approach for feature extraction of EEG signal using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and information-theoretic method. The EMD technique is applied to decompose an EEG signal into a set of intrinsic mode function. These decomposed signals are of the same length and in the same time domain as the original signal. Hence, the EMD method preserves varying frequencies in time. To measure the performance of the features, we have used hybrid learning for classification where we have selected learning vector quantization neural network with fuzzy algorithm. In order to test the performance of proposed classifier based on fuzzy theory, we have tested classification accuracy of each cognitive task over all participated subjects. The results are compared with the past methods in the literature for feature extraction and classification methods.

In this paper, we develop a methodology for online learning of square sparsifying transforms. Such online learning can be particularly useful when dealing with big data, and for signal processing applications such as real-time sparse representation and denoising. The proposed transform learning algorithms are shown to have a much lower computational cost than online synthesis dictionary learning.

Successful detection of adenomas is linked to reduced cancer incidence and mortality. This study focuses on evaluating the performance of endoscopists on adenoma detection rate (ADR), polyp detection rate (PDR), and scope withdrawal time. The substitution of PDR for ADR has been suggested due the reliance of ADR calculation on pathology reports. We compare these metrics to established clinical guidelines and to the performance of other individual endoscopists. Our analysis (n = 2730 screening colonoscopies) found variation in ADR for 14 endoscopists, ranging from 0.20 to 0.41. PDR ranged from 0.38 to 0.62. Controlling for age, sex, race, withdrawal time, and the presence of a trainee endoscopist accounted for 34% of variation in PDR but failed to account for any variation in ADR. The Pearson correlation between PDR and ADR is 0.82. These results suggest that PDR has significant value as a quality indicator. The reported variation in detection rates after controlling for case mix signals the need for greater scrutiny of individual endoscopist skill. Understanding the root cause of this variation could potentially lead to better patient outcomes.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1832-4; POD:978-1-4799-1833-1","10.1109/SIEDS.2015.7116968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116968","Colonoscopy;Electronic Medical Records;Health Data;Machine Learning;Physician Performance","Cancer;Colonoscopy;Endoscopes;Guidelines;Logistics;Measurement;Predictive models","cancer;endoscopes;medical image processing;object detection","ADR;PDR;Pearson correlation;adenomas detection rate;cancer incidence;cancer mortality;clinical guidelines;endoscopists;pathology reports;polyp detection rate;quality indicator monitoring;screening colonoscopies","","0","","19","","","24-24 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
