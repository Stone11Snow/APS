The symmetric values of zero-poles in the open right-half plane of the unstable process about the imaginary axis are defined as their mirror-images. An unstable process is transformed into a minimum-phase system through mirror-injection in the paper, then solving the robust controller using closed-loop gain shaping algorithm. When the plant is a pure unstable process whose all poles lie in the open right half plane it is loop-shaped through adding left half plane poles and zeros so that the system is converted into a regular unstable system, then the loop-shaped unstable process is transformed into a minimum-phase system through mirror-injection, the robust controller is acquired using closed-loop gain shaping algorithm. Because its largest singular value curves are similar before or after the unstable process is mirror-injected, and the closed-loop gain shaping algorithm constructs directly the robust controller using parameters having engineering sense according to the shape of the singular value curves of the robust performance index, the designed controller has equally robustness to the unstable process.

Taking advantage of the merit of multi-population, population size can be cut down appropriately by means of inter-population crossover. Because of the inter-population operator, the individuals' diversity will not turn worse due to the shrunken population size. The parallel strategy comprises a mapping of one (or a few) population(s) onto each processor of MIMD multiprocessing system.

Multiwavelets are extension from scalar wavelets, and have several advantages in comparison with scalar wavelets. Multiwavelet analysis can offer a more precise image analysis than wavelet multiresolution analysis. In this fusion algorithm, a feature-based fusion rule is used to combine original subimages and to form a pyramid for the fused image. When images are merged in multiwavelet space, different frequency ranges are processed differently. This image fusion algorithm can used to combine multispectral images from multisensors to obtain a single composite with extended information content.

The pursuit agents first explore the map according to the method of Artificial Potential Field. When any obstacle is detected within the neighborhood of a pursuer, it updates the map. If an evader is detected, the pursuer (initiator) sends call-for-proposals messages to other pursuers. The other pursuers use D* algorithm to calculate their steps to reach the evader and submit their proposals. The initiator picks up the proposals and evaluates, chooses the nearest ones to join the pursuit team, sends accept-proposals to the selected agents and manages the team during the process of pursuit. If the evader is within the kill radius of all pursuit team members, the task is done; otherwise, D* algorithm is applied by each pursuit member to plan a new path once the evader moves to a new position. Distributive in nature, it allows a large-scale robot fleet to perform complicated tasks in a coordinated way. The algorithm can be easily extended to 3D cases.

The attitude is expressed by three-component vector generalized Rodrigues parameters (GRPs), where only three parameters are needed to describe orientation and the singularity of the covariance matrix when using unit quaternion in attitude estimation due to unit norm constraints is also avoided. The efficiency of the dual PF estimator is verified through numerical simulation of a fully actuated rigid body with gyro and three-axis-magnetometers (TAM).

Ontology for the museum domain, based on the CIDOC concept reference model, is being developed as a semantic layer of the architecture. The challenges of developing such a global ontology model and a mapping mechanism between the global schema and data sources of local museums are discussed. Web services technology is employed to integrate heterogeneous and distributed data sources of local museums. An ontology and view based approach is adopted to the design and implementation of a user interface.

Video transmission in wireless environment is a challenging task to enable reliable, flexible, adaptive, and robust communication. Traditional error control schemes consider videos as low-level bit streams, ignoring the underlying visual content. The content-aware framework is based on the recognition of strong correlation among video content, required network resources, and resulting video quality. If video content is taken into consideration during error resilience process, the bandwidth can be utilized efficiently, and ""focus of attention"" (FOA) can be protected hierarchically, the reconstructed video can satisfy the user's demand of information maximally. The content-aware error resiliency schemes proposed in this paper divide the video content into three hierarchies according to human's attention sequence, then use content feature to classify the content of each shot into a set of shot classes, and then associate each shot class with representative error resiliency model. The corresponding model is tested to be the best one for the shot class. During video communication, shots are classified and transmitted with the associated error resiliency scheme. As a result, the most valuable information is achieved at the minim cost.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527880","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527880","Wireless multimedia;attention focus;error concealment;error resiliency;h. 264/AVC;video content;video segmentation","Bandwidth;Error analysis;Error correction;Protection;Resilience;Robustness;Streaming media;Telecommunication network reliability;Testing;Wireless networks","data communication;error compensation;multimedia communication;radiocommunication;signal classification;signal reconstruction;video coding;video communication","H.264 AVC;bandwidth constraint;content classification;content-aware error resiliency;error concealment;human attention sequence;network resources;video content;video quality;video reconstruction;video segmentation;video transmission;visual content;wireless channels;wireless communication;wireless environment;wireless multimedia","","0","","16","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For PMLM control system, the output of position control can be divided into a stable value and a changing one when the controlled system is close to stable state. A stable parameter value is acquired from the output of a traditional fuzzy controller when the controlled system comes into the stable state. And the stable parameter value can be tuned by a designed integral part so as to alleviate the static error.

To circumvent the above problems, we present a novel color calibration model based on support vector regression (SVR) method in this paper. First, a new colorchecker which provides a suitable reference for the following color calibration is produced by color clustering of 322 tongue images.

Since the shift-variant of wavelets leads to artifacts and blurred edges in the fused image, wavelets in our framework are only used to judge natures of the source images. Besides this, the new framework also provides the fusion rules based on max-likelihood theory, which is proposed by us firstly and allows fusion on a systematic statistical theory. The region-based fusion is achieved through HT. Finally, our scheme is applied to merging two images in which have two clocks with different focus.

By normalizing the shape into a standard point distribution, the new method can compare different shapes despite the shearing and scaling effect of affine transformation. Using the coarse-to-fine dynamic programming technique, the shapes are aligned to each other by iteratively seeking for correspondences and estimating relative transformations so as to prune the start points in the dynamic programming stage in turn.

There are many process parameters need to monitor and control in order to make the microbiological fermentation process successful. So it is important to measure the process variables. But the instrumentation and sensors available for fermentation control do not cover all the desirable or necessary measurements. In fermentation processes, many important internal variables can't be measured. Soft sensor has become an indispensable method to measure internal variables in fermentation processes. In this paper, we propose a new method of soft sensor constructed with generalized support vector machine for microbiological fermentation.

This task is carried out through qualitative spatial reasoning method, specifically consistency checking. We try to lay the theoretical foundation for this kind of problem. Instead of using conventional composition tables, we investigate the interactions between topological and cardinal directional relations with the aid of rules.

Word mismatches between the user's query and document contents are a main cause of retrieval failures. Expanding a user's query with related words can improve search performance, but finding and using related words is an open problem. On the basis of previous approaches to query expansion, this paper proposes a new approach to query expansion, which combines two popular traditional methods -thesauri and automatic relevance feedback.

Dimensionality of LLE representation is related to the DOF of gait and 10D LLE representation of simple gait is sufficient for gait recognition. The recognition rate is 100% on CMU MOBO database.

Introducing an extra time-delay term in system and taking the relationship between the terms in the Leibniz-Newton formula into account obtain a new delay-dependent stability criterion. Based on this stability criterion, firstly a sufficient condition is proposed for existence of the sliding mode in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Correspondingly, a sliding mode controller is also synthesized for the reaching motion. Moreover, an adaptive law is introduced to adaptively estimate the unknown external disturbances resulted by the system transformation. The control strategy guarantees the robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. A numerical example is included to demonstrate the effectiveness of this control scheme.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526989","Sliding mode control;adaptive law;delay-dependent;input delay;linear matrix inequalities","Adaptive control;Control systems;Delay systems;Programmable control;Robust control;Robust stability;Sliding mode control;Stability criteria;Sufficient conditions;Uncertain systems","","Sliding mode control;adaptive law;delay-dependent;input delay;linear matrix inequalities","","0","","9","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
