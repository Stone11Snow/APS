In the past few years, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) has been widely used to analyze epileptic EEG. However, one practical question unanswered is the optimal levels of wavelet decomposition. Deeper DWT can yield a more detailed depiction of signals but it requires substantially more computational time. In this paper, we study this problem, using the most difficult epileptic EEG classification task, focus localization, as an example. The results show that decomposition level effects the localization accuracy more significantly than mother wavelets. For all wavelets, decomposition beyond level 7 improves accuracy limitedly and even decreases accuracy. We further study what are the most effective bands and features for focus localization. An interpretation of our results is that focal and non-focal epileptic EEGs differ the most at high frequencies of EEG rhythms. The best accuracy of epileptic focus localization achieved in this research is 83.07% using sym6 from levels 1 to 7.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324317","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324317","DWT;EEG;epileptic focus localization","Accuracy;Discrete wavelet transforms;Electroencephalography;Epilepsy;Standards","discrete wavelet transforms;electroencephalography;medical signal processing;signal classification","EEG rhythms;discrete wavelet transform;electroencephalogram;epilepsy diagnosis;epileptic EEG classification;epileptic focus localization;full-level decomposition;signal classification","","","","23","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Using random sampling and random embedding techniques, the given data matrix is turned to a small compressed data. A subspace learning approach is proposed to extract the columns subspace of the low rank matrix from the compressed data. Two ideas for robust subspace learning are proposed to work under two different model assumptions. The first idea is based on the linear dependence between the columns of the low rank matrix, and the second is based on the independence between the columns subspace of the low rank matrix and the subspace spanned by the outlying columns. We derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the performance of the proposed approach with high probability. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify the outliers just by using roughly O(r<sup>2</sup>) random linear data observations, where r is the rank of the low rank matrix, and provably achieve notable speedups in comparison to existing approaches.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324346","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324346","Big Data;Low Rank Matrix;Outlier Detection;Random Embedding;Randomized Algorithm;Robust PCA;Subspace Learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Data models;Optimization;Principal component analysis;Robustness;Sparse matrices;Yttrium","Big Data;data compression;learning (artificial intelligence);randomised algorithms;sampling methods","big data;columns subspace extraction;data compression;data matrix;outliers;random embedding;random sampling;randomized PCA algorithm;randomized robust subspace recovery;robust subspace learning;subspace learning approach","","1","","16","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically recognize the concept of a vocal imitation, and then retrieve sounds of this concept. Because different acoustic aspects (e.g., pitch, loudness, timbre) are emphasized in imitating different sounds, a key challenge in vocal imitation recognition is to extract appropriate features. Hand-crafted features may not work well for a large variety of imitations. Instead, we use a stacked auto-encoder to automatically learn features from a set of vocal imitations in an unsupervised way. Then, a multi-class SVM is trained for sound concepts of interest using their training imitations. Given a new vocal imitation of a sound concept of interest, our system can recognize its underlying concept and return it with a high rank among all concepts.

In the feature extraction layer, the framework extracts lighting-invariant features to relieve the effects from lighting and shadow. In the patch classification layer, image patches are selected. In order To overcome perspective distortion, each patch was normalized. For different patch, we trained classifiers to recognize the occlusion patterns, which are treated as the middle-level feature of the parking status. In the weighted combination layer, three spaces are grouped as a unit to easily handle inter-object occlusion. Based on the middle-level features, a boosted space classifier was trained to determine the local status of a 3-space unit. In the status inference layer, we regarded these local status decisions as high-level evidences and inferred the final status of the parking lot. The results in an outdoor parking lot show our system can well handle inter-object occlusion and achieve robust vacant space detection under many environmental variations.

The model receives apriori knowledge in the form of a neighborhood graph, and maximizes the likelihood of the distribution while putting an additional L1 sparsity constraint on the model parameters. This leads to an interpretable model where the interactions of brain regions are encoded into the estimated model coefficients. The likelihoods of normal and TBI subjects under the estimated distribution are used as features to evaluate discriminatory power of model, using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Our experiments show that the addition of the neighborhood graph constraint results in significant improvements in classification compared to a model which does not take into account the brain region interactions.

What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify subsets of samples and subsets of features that jointly specify anomalous clusters. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect botnet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324326","Bonferroni approximation;Gaussian Mixture Model;botnet;dependence tree;group anomaly detection;network intrusion detection;p-value","Bayes methods;Feature extraction;Integrated circuits;Intrusion detection;Joints;Peer-to-peer computing","invasive software;pattern clustering;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic","GAD scheme;anomalies clusters detection;anomalous clusters;anomalous data samples;botnet detection;data batch;feature dependency structure;group anomaly detection problem;low-dimensional feature subsets;low-dimensional subset;network intrusion detection;peer-to-peer flow clusters;real world network traffic flow data;statistical dependencies;test independence","","","","14","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In general such underlying low-dimensional surfaces may have complicated shapes and may have to be defined locally at best. Under the premise that d-dimensional critical surfaces of a probability density function (pdf) over R<sup>n</sup> provide a natural skeleton for the data, we propose that local nonlinear coordinate transformations to unwrap the so-called manifold are based on curvilinear coordinate systems defined in a manner that is consistent with the critical surfaces. Specifically, we provide a convenient characterization of all critical surfaces in the form of the zero level set of the determinant of a matrix we introduce. This allows the characterization of the underlying manifold using only the gradient and Hessian of the pdf. Especially for the family of distributions in the form of exponential of polynomials, we show that this determinant expression is a polynomial, hence the underlying critical surfaces are zero level sets of a polynomial, and that the factorization of this polynomial will lead to a suitable curvilinear coordinate system. We demonstrate the use of these concepts in globally and locally unwrapping distributions from the family of exponential of polynomials.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324367","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324367","","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;MATLAB;Manifolds;Polynomials;Probability density function;Standards","data handling;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;polynomial approximation;probability","Hessian;complicated shapes;curvilinear coordinate systems;d-dimensional critical surfaces;data natural skeleton;determinant expression;globally unwrapping distributions;gradient;local nonlinear coordinate transformations;locally unwrapping distributions;low-dimensional underlying structures;manifold unwrapping;matrix determinant;natural high dimensional data distributions;pdf;polynomial factorization;polynomials exponential;probability density function;underlying low-dimensional surfaces;underlying manifold;zero level set","","","","18","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A separate SNN, each with the same architecture, is associated with each of the p states of the HMM. Because of the STDP tuning, each SNN implements an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to learn the particular observation probabilities for one particular HMM state.

"A Naive Bayes approach to improve histogram matching quality","F. Bouzaraa; O.

A major application is High Dynamic Range Imaging, where images with different exposures have to be color matched. HM works best when the images are aligned and the color difference is small. However, due to camera or object motion, the images may not be aligned, which can result in color artifacts. Furthermore, HM typically involves brightening dark regions of the source image, which increases the image noise. As a result, there is a need for detecting and correcting color artifacts and increased image noise. In this paper we present a novel post-processing method for improving the quality of histogram matched images using statistical properties of the reference image. The proposed method is based on ensembles of neighboring pixels.

Another closely related problem is the ability to successfully recommend images to users. An automatic image annotation and recommendation system is proposed based on Parallel Factor Analysis 2 (PARAFAC2). Here, PARAFAC2 is applied to a collection of three matrices, namely the image-feature matrix, whose columns are representations capturing the visual appearance of images, the image-tag matrix, whose columns indicate the tags associated with each image, and the image-user matrix, whose columns identify who has uploaded or is associated to each image. PARAFAC2 is able to harness the multi-tag and the multi-user information for reducing the dimensionality of the feature vectors extracted from the images. That is, by projecting the feature vector onto the semantic space derived via PARAFAC2, a sketch (i.e., a coefficient vector of reduced dimensions) is obtained. To predict the tags to be assigned to a test image, the test image sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-tag matrix, yielding a tag vector. Similarly, to recommend users who might be interested to a test image, the sketch is multiplied by the left singular vectors of the image-user matrix, yielding a recommendation vector. Promising results are demonstrated when the aforementioned framework is applied to an image dataset of Greek popular tourist landmarks extracted from Flickr, using a 10 fold cross-validation experimental protocol.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324363","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324363","Automatic Image Tagging;Image Recommendation;Multi-label Classification;PARAFAC2","Feature extraction;Measurement;Semantics;Sparse matrices;Tagging;Tensile stress;Training","feature extraction;image processing;matrix algebra;recommender systems;social networking (online)","Flickr;Greek popular tourist landmark;PARAFAC2;automatic image annotation;automatic image tagging;cross-validation experimental protocol;feature vector extraction;image recommendation;image-feature matrix;image-tag matrix;image-user matrix;multitag information;multiuser information;parallel factor analysis 2;recommendation system;recommendation vector;singular vector;social network;tag vector;test image sketch;visual appearance","","2","","20","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most analysis used to quantify functional activation requires supervised approaches as employed in statistical parametric mapping (SPM) to extract maps of task induced functional activations. This requires strong knowledge and assumptions on the BOLD response as a function of activitation while smoothing in general enhances the statistical power but at the cost of spatial resolution. We propose a fully unsupervised approach for the extraction of task activated functional units in multi-subject fMRI data that exploits that regions of task activation are consistent across subjects and can be more reliably inferred than regions that are not activated. We develop a non-parametric Gaussian mixture model that apriori assumes activations are smooth using a Gaussian Process prior while assuming the segmented functional maps are the same across subjects but having individual time-courses and noise variances. To improve inference we propose an enhanced split-merge procedure. We find that our approach well extracts the induced activity of a finger tapping fMRI paradigm with maps that well corresponds to a supervised group SPM analysis. We further find interesting regions that are not activated time locked to the paradigm. Demonstrating that we in a fully unsupervised manner are able to extract the task-induced activations forms a promising framework for the analysis of task fMRI and resting-state data in general where strong knowledge of how the task induces a BOLD response is missing.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324384","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324384","Functional connectivity;Gaussian Mixture Model;fMRI analysis","Correlation;Gaussian mixture model;Joints;Signal to noise ratio;Time series analysis","Gaussian processes;biomedical MRI;brain;image denoising;image resolution;image segmentation;medical image processing;mixture models;neurophysiology","BOLD response;brain;finger tapping fMRI paradigm;functional magnetic resonance imaging;multisubject fMRI data;noise variances;nonparametric Gaussian mixture model;resting-state data;segmented functional maps;spatial resolution;statistical parametric mapping;supervised group SPM analysis;task induced functional activations;unsupervised segmentation","","1","","18","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classification performance is constrained because the neighboring temporal or spatial information in different ways is lost in the trained NN classifier. More parameters are required to learn the complicated data structure. This paper presents a new tensor classification network (TCN) which combines the tensor factorization and the NN classification for multi-way feature extraction and classification. We generalize from NN classifier to TCN where the multi-way information is preserved through projecting the input tensors into latent tensors. The projection over tensor space is efficiently characterized so that a very compact classifier can be achieved.

Here, we propose a new regularized technique for identification of piecewise affine systems, which we dub the hybrid stable spline algorithm (HSS). HSS exploits the recently introduced stable spline kernel to model the submodels impulse responses as zero-mean Gaussian processes, embedding information on submodels predictor stability. Using the Bayesian interpretation of regularization, the problem of classifying and distributing the data to the subsystems is cast as marginal likelihood optimization. An approximated optimization is performed by a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme. Then, the stable spline algorithm is used to reconstruct each subsystem.

This framework is inspired by an analogy with rate-distortion theory, which characterizes tradeoffs in the lossy compression of random sources. In a parametric Bayesian environment, the maximum a posteriori classifier can be viewed as a random function of the model parameters. Labeled training data can be viewed as a finite-rate encoding of that source, and the excess loss due to using the learned classifier instead of the MAP classifier can be viewed as distortion. A strict bound on the loss-measured in terms of the expected total variation-is derived, providing a minimum number of training samples needed to drive the expected total variation to within a specified tolerance. The tightness of this bound is demonstrated on the classification of Gaus-sians, for which one can derive closed-form expressions for the bound.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324319","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324319","Bayesian Statistics;Binary Classification;Rate-Distortion Theory;Supervised Learning","Entropy;Interpolation;Mutual information;Rate-distortion;Training;Yttrium;Zinc","Gaussian processes;belief networks;information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","Gaussian classification;MAP classifier;closed-form expressions;expected total variation;finite-rate encoding;information-theoretic framework;learned classifier;lossy compression;maximum a posteriori classifier;parametric Bayesian environment;parametric Bayesian setting;random sources;rate-distortion framework;supervised learning","","","","19","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A lot of efficient approaches uses a cascade of classifiers which process vectors of descriptive features such as HOG. In order to take into account the variability in object dimension, features at different resolutions are often concatenated in a large descriptor vector. This prevents from taking into account explicitly the different resolutions but results in losing some valuable information. To overcome this problem, we propose to use a new method based on a SVM network. Each resolution is processed, regardless to the others, at the input layer level, by a dedicated SVM. The main drawback of using such a network is that the computational complexity for the classification phase drastically increases. We propose then to foster an incomplete exploration of the network by defining an activation path. This activation path determines an order to activate the network neurons, one after the other, and introduces a rejection rule which allows the process to end before crossing the whole network. Experimental results are obtained and assessed in an industrial application of urban object detection. We can observe an average gain of 17% in precision while the computational cost is divided by more than 5, with respect to a standard method.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324329","Aerial Imagery;Multi-Resolution;Network;Object detection;SVM","Complexity theory;Computational efficiency;Databases;Feature extraction;Neurons;Object detection;Support vector machines","computational complexity;image classification;image resolution;object detection;support vector machines","HOG;activation path;aerial images;classification phase;computational complexity;computational cost;dedicated SVM;descriptive feature;descriptor vector;multiresolution SVM network approach;object dimension;urban object detection","","","","25","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assuming that a priori information on the protein mixture is available and this prior follows a Dirichlet distribution we develop a method to estimate the relative abundances with MAP estimator.

A subset selection method that chooses an identifiable subset from these bases is developed. Using the selected subset, in Monte Carlo simulations, mixture coefficient estimation performances of MAP and maximum likelihood (which assumes uniform prior on mixture coefficients) estimators are compared.

This often results in open-loop policies that cannot take advantage of previous observations. As pointed out in past researches, these strategies lack of robustness to the prior.

We develop an online Bayesian inference procedure for blind estimation of the frequency offset, for arbitrary signal constellations. Our unified approach is built on a sequential inference procedure that leverages a novel result on conjugacy of the von Mises and Gaussian distributions. This conjugacy allows for an easily computable, closed form parametric expression for the posterior distribution of the parameters given the streaming data, in which hyperparameters are recursively updated, making the optimal sequential estimation problem mathematically tractable.

A dominant approach to this problem has been to use an ICU score system such as, for example, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system, and the Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) system, to compute a certain severity score for a patient from a set of clinical observations, and apply a logistic regression model on this score to obtain an estimate of the probability of mortality for the patient, owing to their simplicity, these methods are widely used by clinicians. However, existing ICU score systems are built from a fixed set of patient data, and often perform poorly when applied to a patient population with different characteristics, also, with changes in patient characteristics, a score system built from a given patient data set becomes suboptimal over time. Moreover, most of these score systems are built using semi-automated procedures that require some amount of manual intervention, making it difficult to adapt them to a new patient population. Thus there is a huge need for adaptive methods that can automatically learn predictive models from a given set of patient data, tailored to perform well on similar patient populations. Indeed, there has been much work in recent years on applying various machine learning methods to this problem, however these methods learn different representations from the score systems preferred by clinicians. In this work, we develop a machine learning method based on orthogonal matching pursuit that automatically learns a score system type model, which enjoys the benefits of both worlds: like other machine learning methods, it is adaptive, like standard score systems, it uses a representation that is easy for clinicians to understand. Experiments on real-world patient data sets show that our method outperforms standard ICU s- ore systems, and performs at least as well as other machine learning methods that employ more complex representations. As an added advantage of using the OMP approach, one can use a group-sparse variant of OMP which allows learning models with similar performance using a smaller number of clinical observations, we include experiments with this as well.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7415-3; POD:978-1-4799-7416-0; USB:978-1-4799-7414-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2014.20","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033097","Intensive care units;logistic regression;mortality rate prediction;orthogonal matching pursuit;score systems","Computational modeling;Kernel;Learning systems;Logistics;Matching pursuit algorithms;Sociology;Statistics","data handling;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);medical administrative data processing;patient care;probability;regression analysis","APACHE system;ICU;OMP approach;SAPS system;acute physiology and chronic health evaluation system;critical care medicine;intensive care units;learning score systems;logistic regression model;machine learning methods;orthogonal matching pursuit;patient data set;patient mortality prediction;patient mortality probability estimation;simplified acute physiology score system","","0","","28","","","3-6 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The classifier agent employs concepts of Self-Organized Maps and Multiple Instance Learning. The motivation for this proposal was the need of a classifier for the processing of signals from partial discharges (PD) in electrical power systems. The monitoring of these signals allows building a database that can be a reference for the detection of failures in equipment and thus support predictive maintenance routines. The simplicity of calculations, which are based on the Manhattan distance (City Block metric), makes it very suitable for use in embedded systems, field-programmable-logic based systems (e. g. FPGAs) and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Further improvements can be achieved with pipelining and parallelism techniques, leading to significant maximization of sample rates. The classifier can operate with multiple classes without requiring complex configurations. Other advantages include automatic fitting to the complexity of the problem, the ability to deal with input vectors with different characteristics (inheritance of multiple instance learning) and, depending on implementation, it may be easily upgraded to allow operation with new input patterns (other than those used in the initial training). To evaluate the proposal, we used a set of PD databases obtained by simulations and laboratory measurements. We performed comparisons with standard form classifiers based on Multilayer Perceptrons and Support Vector Machines. The results show that the technique gives the same orders of accuracy and generalization of those classifiers, but with the advantages of low computational costs, self-scalability, dimensional independence and high potential for parallelization.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324351","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324351","denoising;multiple-instance learning;partial discharges;self-organizing maps;signal processing;wavelets","Complexity theory;Kernel;Mathematical model;Neurons;Partial discharges;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;self-organising feature maps;signal classification;signal denoising;support vector machines;vectors","digital processing system;grid classifier;input vector;multilayer perceptron;multiple instance learning;self-organized map;signal denoising;support vector machine","","","","12","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Experimental results showed that our simulation agent responds sensitively to dynamic situations and thus can be helpful for game level designers to determine various game factors.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340900","Artificial neural network;Game level design;Game simulation;Reinforcement learning","","computer games;human factors;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification","ANN;Q-learning;action classifier;artificial neural networks;cognitive data;game design;reinforcement learning method;stealthy behavior simulations;stealthy movements simulation","","","","14","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Present methods for learning the dependence structure of hidden variable graphical models are derived from the idea of maximizing penalized likelihood, and hence are associated with the troublesome problem of regularization selection. In this paper, we show that this problem can be successfully circumvented by treating the penalty parameters as random variables and describing the hidden variable graphical models in a Bayesian formulation. An efficient variational Bayes algorithm is further developed to adaptively learn the graphical model as well as the distribution of penalty parameters. Numerical results from both synthetic and real data show that the proposed variational Bayes method yields comparable or better performance than the stability selection based maximum penalized likelihood method, yet it requires several orders of magnitude less computational time.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324335","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324335","Gaussian graphical models;hidden variables;regularization selection;variational Bayes","Bayes methods;Damping;Data models;Graphical models;Sparse matrices;Stability criteria","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);maximum likelihood estimation","Bayesian formulation;hidden variable graphical models;high-dimensional data;maximum penalized likelihood method;regularization selection;stability selection;variational Bayes learning","","","","19","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We make existing approaches scalable by using an instance of a local-to-global algorithm based on group synchronization, recently proposed in the literature in the context of sensor network localization, which we augment with a scale synchronization step. We show our approach compares favorably to the recently proposed Local Ordinal Embedding (LOE) algorithm even in the case of smaller sized problems, and also demonstrate its scalability on large graphs.

The ability of providing understandable reasons can make the system more trustable, and thus more popular and profitable. We believe that designing interpretable aware systems is extremely important to achieve the goal of AC.

The traditional offline measurement of surface roughness is time consuming and influences the performance of production. To solve this issue, many studies focus on the development of in-process surface roughness prediction system. The force signals are one of the key input factors for the system in milling operations. The purpose of this study is to apply grey relation to determine the significant force signals that would affect surface roughness. 19 force signals were analyzed, and finally the average of absolute difference of peak force in x direction was explored as the most significant factor that would be used in the in-process surface roughness prediction system.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340957","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340957","End milling;Force signal;Grey relation analysis;Surface roughness","","grey systems;milling;quality control;surface roughness","grey relation;machining operation quality index;milling;surface roughness analysis","","","","15","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To get an easy way to compute semantic similarity, we proposed a simplified approach combining two information sources: the shortest path length and depth of the least common subsumber (LCS) of compared concepts, to calculate the semantic similarity between concept pairs. The experimental results suggest that the approach obtains a relatively high correlation value compared with the related work, and there exist a nonlinear relationship between semantic similarity and the shortest path length of the compared concept pairs. In addition, the method relies on the most commonly available information sources, which makes it more feasible. The proposed method can be applied to the field of information management and knowledge engineering.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340918","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340918","Edge-counting;Ontology;Semantic similarity;The shortest path length;WordNet","","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","LCS depth;information management;knowledge engineering;least common subsumber;semantic similarity measurement;shortest path length;simplified edge-counting method","","","","12","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A generative graphical model that combines multiple modalities through common factor loadings is proposed. In this model, latent factors are like summary objects that has latent factor scores in each modality, and the observed objects are represented in terms of such summary objects. This potentially brings about a significant dimensionality reduction. It also naturally enables a powerful means of clustering based on a diverse set of observations. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to find the model parameters is provided. The algorithm is tested on a Twitter dataset which consists of the counts and geographical coordinates of hashtag occurrences, together with the bag of words for each hashtag. The resultant factors successfully localizes the hashtags in all dimensions: counts, coordinates, topics. The algorithm is also extended to accommodate von Mises-Fisher distribution, which is used to model the spherical coordinates.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4673-7454-5; POD:978-1-4673-7455-2","10.1109/MLSP.2015.7324340","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7324340","Twitter;graphical models;multimodal data fusion;unsupervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Graphical models;Load modeling;Loading;Signal processing algorithms;Tagging;Twitter","Gaussian processes;data analysis;expectation-maximisation algorithm;graph theory;social networking (online)","EM algorithm;Gaussian observation;Poisson observation;Twitter dataset;expectation-maximization algorithm;graphical model;multimodal factor analysis;multinomial observation","","1","","7","","","17-20 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a step to this goal, we study the problem of finding expansions in texts for given acronym queries by modeling the problem as a sequence labeling task. However, it is challenging for traditional sequence labeling models like the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) because of the complexity of the input sentences and the substructure of the categories. In this paper, we propose the neural conditional random fields model with latent variables (LNCRF) to deal with the aforementioned challenge. On one hand, we extend the CRF by coupling it with nonlinear hidden layers to learn better representations of the input data under the framework of the CR-F. On the other hand, we introduce latent variables to capture the fine-grained information from the intrinsic substructures within each label implicitly. Experimental results on real data show that our model achieves the best performance against the state-of-the-art baselines including the Support Vector Machines and the standard Conditional Random Fields.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7220-6; Electronic:978-1-4673-7221-3; POD:978-1-4673-7222-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2015.7340932","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7340932","","","data structures;query processing","CRF;LNCRF;acronym queries;conditional random fields;data representation;fine-grained acronym expansion identification;information retrieval;latent variables;latent-state neural structured prediction model;natural language processing;sequence labeling models;support vector machines","","","","15","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
