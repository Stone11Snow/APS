Using a state-of-the-art denoising method in this context is not trivial, and is the focus of current work. Recently, we have proposed to use a class-adapted denoiser (patch-based using Gaussian mixture models) in a so-called plug- and-play scheme, wherein a state-of-the-art denoiser is plugged into an iterative algorithm, leading to results that outperform the best general-purpose algorithms, when applied to an image of a known class (e.g. faces, text, brain MRI). In this paper, we extend that approach to handle situations where the image being processed is from one of a collection of possible classes or, more importantly, contains regions of different classes. More specifically, we propose a method to locally select one of a set of class-adapted Gaussian mixture patch priors, previously estimated from clean images of those classes. Our approach may be seen as simultaneously performing segmentation and restoration, thus contributing to bridging the gap between image restoration/reconstruction and analysis.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0746-2; POD:978-1-5090-0747-9","10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738841","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738841","Gaussian mixture models;class-adapted priors;image deblurring;image denoising;plug-and-play","Gaussian mixture model;Image restoration;Image segmentation;Imaging;Inverse problems;Noise measurement;Noise reduction","Gaussian processes;image denoising;image restoration;image segmentation;iterative methods;mixture models","Gaussian mixture models;class-adapted Gaussian mixture patch priors;class-adapted denoiser;image deblurring;image denoising operation;image reconstruction;image restoration;image segmentation;imaging inverse problems;iterative algorithm;locally selected class-adapted models;plug-and-play scheme","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On each iteration, SDC performs a hierarchical clustering producing a binary split which greedily maximizes the group dependence score. One of the advantages of SDC is the fact that division of a group into two clusters is done based on the adjustable threshold which has a clear probabilistic interpretation. Due to this property, the algorithm naturally allows fuzzy group separations which makes it also suitable for cluster overlaps analysis. SDC can be used for graph segmentation applications as well as clustering data that has notion of distance. The proposed algorithm is compared with a few selected clustering methods using simulated and real-world data sets. The results clearly demonstrate that given reasonable settings, SDC outperforms other methods in the comparison.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0746-2; POD:978-1-5090-0747-9","10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738882","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738882","Markov chain;Soft clustering;random walk;spectral analysis","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Markov processes;Probability distribution;Signal processing algorithms","fuzzy set theory;graph theory;pattern clustering;probability","SDC;adjustable threshold;binary split;data clustering;fuzzy group separations;graph segmentation;group dependence score;hierarchical clustering;overlapping clusters;probabilistic group dependence;soft dependence clustering;spectral clustering","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Specifically, we consider convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in a subject independent fashion and demonstrate that meaningful features, representing IEDs are automatically learned. The resulting model achieves state of the art classification performance, provides insights for the different types of IEDs within the group, and is invariant to time differences between the IEDs.

Traditionally, an eGFR time series is interpreted by a human expert labelling it as stable or unstable. While this approach works for individual patients, the time consuming nature of it precludes the quick evaluation of risk in large numbers of patients. However, automating this process poses significant challenges as eGFR measurements are usually recorded at irregular intervals and the series of measurements differs in length between patients. Here we present a two-tier system to automatically classify an eGFR trend. First, we model the time series using Gaussian process regression (GPR) to fill in `gaps' by resampling a fixed size vector of fifty time-dependent observations. Second, we classify the resampled eGFR time series using a K-NN/SVM classifier, and evaluate its performance via 5-fold cross validation. Using this approach we achieved an F-score of 0.90, compared to 0.96 for 5 human experts when scored amongst themselves.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0746-2; POD:978-1-5090-0747-9","10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738901","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738901","AKI;CKD;Gaussian Process Regression;K-NN;SVM;eGFR","Diseases;Frequency measurement;Gaussian processes;Ground penetrating radar;Market research;Standards;Time series analysis","Gaussian processes;diseases;kidney;medical computing;pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines;time series","GPR;Gaussian process regression;K-NN-SVM classifier;automatic classification;disease progression;eGFR measurements;fifty time-dependent observations;fixed size vector resampling;human expert labelling;irregularly sampled time series;kidney function;patient estimated glomerular filtration rate;two-tier system","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we investigate two unsupervised discriminative approaches as an alternative to the universal background model (UBM) for feature space clustering and prediction. In our first approach, a deep neural network (DNN) is directly used to estimate the mixture-wise posterior probabilities of the UBM. In this approach, while the UBM is still used for acoustic space division, the prediction is performed using DNN. The motivation for using a DNN for such prediction is the ability to learn invariant higher level features discriminatively. In our second approach, a stacked restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is used instead of the UBM for both acoustic space clustering and prediction. In this approach, the clustering is performed based on the higher level distributed representations of speech features using a stacked RBM.

Hence there is a need to develop intelligent systems to support and maintain the autonomy of the elderly at home. A high priority in this case assumes the preparation-free acquisition of vital signs and patient parameters in long-term monitoring systems to detect early changes or deterioration in health. It is thus possible to initiate treatment of a disease at an early stage. One way to carry out a long-term monitoring of vital signs at home is based on the functionalization of furniture, for example, through the use of suitable sensors in chairs [1] and beds [2, 3] to derive various patient parameters. In addition to monitoring basic parameters, e.g. the heart rate and respiratory activity, it is also possible to access information regarding motion or sleep patterns by means of pattern recognition systems. In addition to the challenge of building a suitable pattern recognition system there is a need for corresponding training data to create reference patterns. Typically, the necessary sensor data for the reference pattern training is generated in time-consuming sessions with real people. In this paper, a novel approach is presented, which provides a multi-stage model to create artificial training or test data.

The overall aim is to learn online the statistical properties of the evolving data distribution and incorporate them into the recognition mechanism for boosting its performance. The proposed CASA system encompasses: a) an approach to discriminate abrupt and gradual concept drifts b) an online adaptation module to both kinds of drifts, and c) a mechanism which automatically updates the dictionary of the audio classes if needed.

Complex topologies have been proposed, but are intractable to train on current systems. Building the topologies of the deep learning network requires hand tuning, and implementing the network in hardware is expensive in both cost and power.In this paper, we evaluate deep learning models using three different computing architectures to address these problems: quantum computing to train complex topologies, high performance computing (HPC) to automatically determine network topology, and neuromorphic computing for a low-power hardware implementation. Due to input size limitations of current quantum computers we use the MNIST dataset for our evaluation.The results show the possibility of using the three architectures in tandem to explore complex deep learning networks that are untrainable using a von Neumann architecture. We show that a quantum computer can find high quality values of intra-layer connections and weights, while yielding a tractable time result as the complexity of the network increases; a high performance computer can find optimal layer-based topologies; and a neuromorphic computer can represent the complex topology and weights derived from the other architectures in low power memristive hardware.This represents a new capability that is not feasible with current von Neumann architecture. It potentially enables the ability to solve very complicated problems unsolvable with current computing technologies.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3882-4; POD:978-1-5090-3883-1","10.1109/MLHPC.2016.009","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835814","","Computer architecture;Computers;Machine learning;Network topology;Neuromorphics;Quantum computing;Topology","complex networks;convolution;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);low-power electronics;memristors;network topology;parallel processing;quantum computing","CNN training;GPU-based computers;HPC;MNIST dataset;complex deep learning networks;convolutional neural networks;graphical processing units;high performance computing;layered network topology;low power memristive hardware;low-power hardware;neuromorphic computing;quantum computing;von Neumann architecture","","","","","","","14-14 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this context, it is useful to track moving speakers in the acoustic space by linking disjoint speech segments. Since the identity of the speakers is not known beforehand, the system must match short speech segments without having a specific speaker model or prior knowledge of the speech content, while ignoring changes in acoustic conditions. In this paper, we present a method that matches each speech segment to non-specific speaker models thereby obtaining an activation pattern, and then compares the patterns of disjoint speech segments to each other. The proposed method is low in computational complexity and memory footprint and uses mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We find that, when using MFCCs as acoustic features, the proposed speaker tracking method is robust to changes in the acoustic environment provided that sufficiently large segments of speech are available.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0746-2; POD:978-1-5090-0747-9","10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738884","GMM;speaker recognition;speaker tracking","Acoustics;Computational modeling;Context;Hearing aids;Speaker recognition;Speech;Speech enhancement","Gaussian processes;computational complexity;handicapped aids;hearing aids;microphones;mixture models;speaker recognition;speech enhancement","GMM;Gaussian mixture models;MFCC;acoustic space;computational complexity;disjoint speech segments;mel-frequency cepstral coefficients;memory footprint;multimicrophone hearing aids;spatial filtering algorithms;speaker enhancement;speaker tracking;speech content","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Instead we propose to use our multiscale basis dictionaries for graphs, i.e., the Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform. In particular, we build such dictionaries for columns and rows separately, extract the column best basis and the row best basis from the basis dictionaries, and construct the tensor product of such best bases, which turns out to reveal hidden dependency and underlying geometric structure in the given matrix data.

First, peoples' preferences and their observable manifestations as ratings evolve over time along general patterns of trajectories. Second, an individual person's preferences evolve over time through influence of their social connections. In this paper, we develop a unified process model for both types of dynamics within a state space approach, together with an efficient optimization scheme for estimation within that model. The model combines elements from recent developments in dynamic matrix factorization, opinion dynamics and social learning, and trust-based recommendation.

In this work, we leverage this interpretation and draw from recent results in the field of online adaptation to derive new tight performance expressions for empirical implementations of stochastic gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent, and importance sampling.

"Lifelong Machine Learning","Z. Chen; B. Liu","","Lifelong Machine Learning","20161123","2016","","","","","<p><i>Lifelong Machine Learning</i> (or <i>Lifelong Learning</i>) is an advanced machine learning paradigm that learns continuously, accumulates the knowledge learned in previous tasks, and uses it to help future learning. In the process, the learner becomes more and more knowledgeable and effective at learning. This learning ability is one of the hallmarks of human intelligence. However, the current dominant machine learning paradigm learns <i>in isolation</i>: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model. It makes no attempt to retain the learned knowledge and use it in future learning. Although this <i>isolated learning paradigm</i> has been very successful, it requires a large number of training examples, and is only suitable for well-defined and narrow tasks. In comparison, we humans can learn effectively with a few examples because we have accumulated so mu h knowledge in the past which enables us to learn with little data or effort. Lifelong learning aims to achieve this capability. As statistical machine learning matures, it is time to make a major effort to break the isolated learning tradition and to study lifelong learning to bring machine learning to new heights. Applications such as intelligent assistants, chatbots, and physical robots that interact with humans and systems in real-life environments are also calling for such lifelong learning capabilities. Without the ability to accumulate the learned knowledge and use it to learn more knowledge incrementally, a system will probably never be truly intelligent. This book serves as an introductory text and survey to lifelong learning.</p>","","97816270587","10.2200/S00737ED1V01Y201610AIM033","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=7748637.pdf&bkn=7748636&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2016","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

Mereology is a formalism in mathematical logic that describes the universe in terms of parts and the wholes that are formed by the parts. This is in contrast with set theory, within which the universe is described as objects and the groups they belong to. Classification and traditional machine learning fit well into the description of the universe as a set of objects and their associated properties. In the case of sound, however, pieces of sound can extend and morph in time and frequency to form other recognizable sound entities without having clear partitions in the set theoretic sense. Our reasoning is that by treating sounds as composed entirely or parts, and wholes that are formed by parts, it may become easier to formalize the descriptions, mathematical manipulations and real-world interpretations for the universe of sounds. This paper is neither an exhaustive thesis on this subject, nor does it establish any formal system of Mereology for sound. The goal of this paper is to merely show that there are some promising possibilities with existing Mereological formalisms for manipulating the world of sounds differently, and perhaps more easily.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0746-2; POD:978-1-5090-0747-9","10.1109/MLSP.2016.7738853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738853","Acoustic space;Audio objects;General Extensional Mereology;Mereological algebra;Mereology","Cognition;Computer science;Lead;Rain;Semantics;Set theory","acoustics;algebra;audio signal processing;formal logic;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","audio processing;classification;descriptions;machine learning;mathematical logic formalism;mathematical manipulations;mereological algebras;real world sounds;reasoning;sound morphing;sound processing;universe","","","","","","","13-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the present work, we instead consider the aim of predicting the intelligibility of single words. I.e. we attempt to predict whether or not a subject in a listening experiment was able to correctly repeat a particular word. We base the prediction on a noisy and potentially processed/degraded recording of the spoken word (as presented to a subject), as well as a clean reference recording of the spoken word. The problem can be treated as a supervised binary classification problem of predicting whether a specific word will or will not be understood. We investigate a number of different ways to extract features from the degraded and clean speech samples. The classification is carried out by means of Fisher discriminant analysis.

ASGD [1] is one of the most popular asynchronous distributed variant of SGD. Recent mathematical analyses have shown that with certain assumptions on the learning task (and ignoring communication cost), ASGD exhibits linear speed-up asymptotically. However, as practically observed, ASGD does not lead linear speed-up as we increase the number of learners. Motivated by this, we investigate finite time convergence properties of ASGD. We observe that the learning rate used by mathematical analyses to guarantee linear speed-up can be very small (and practically sub-optimal with respect to convergence speed) as opposed to practically chosen learning rates (for quick convergence) which exhibit sub-linear speed-up. We show that such an observation can in fact be supported by mathematical analysis, i.e., in the finite time regime, better convergence rate guarantees can be proven for ASGD with small number of learners, thus indicating lack of linear speed up as we increase the number of learners. Thus we conclude that even with ignoring communication cost, there is an inherent inefficiency in ASGD with respect to increasing the number of learners.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3882-4; POD:978-1-5090-3883-1","10.1109/MLHPC.2016.010","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835815","","Convergence;Convolution;Linear programming;Mathematical analysis;Neural networks;Servers;Training","approximation theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);mathematical analysis;stochastic programming","ASGD;asynchronous stochastic gradient descent;finite time convergence properties;large-scale machine learning;mathematical analysis","","","","","","","14-14 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Even though the big majority of the recent high recognition rate systems adopts analytical strategies, physiological scientists suggest that the holistic strategy is the key for realizing near-human performance. In what we believe is a fresh perspective on handwriting recognition, combining the two strategies results in improving recognition rate. The concept and the analysis of combining the two strategies is the first contribution of this work. The proposed approach is applied to an Arabic handwriting recognition system. We use a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based analytical recognizer, and four different methods combined as a holistic recognizer. Two of the used holistic recognition methods are novel: a method based on estimating the probability of writing in each pixel, and a method that uses the Hausdorff distance. The third holistic method is a connected components-based approach, and the fourth one uses dynamic time warping (DTW) with two modifications. These four methods and their use as a holistic recognizer are the second contribution of this work. The proposed technique is tested using the IFN/ENIT database. The combination between the holistic and the analytical recognizers has led to an evident recognition rate improvement ranging from 5% to 16% over the use of the analytical recognizer alone.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0179","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838283","Arabic handwriting recognition;Handwritten word recognition;holistic/analytical approaches","Databases;Feature extraction;Handwriting recognition;Hidden Markov models;Probability density function;Training;Writing","handwriting recognition;hidden Markov models;probability","Arabic handwriting recognition system;DTW;HMM-based analytical recognizer;Hausdorff distance;IFN-ENIT database;analytical strategy;components-based approach;dynamic time warping;hidden Markov model;holistic recognizer strategy;probability estimation;recognition rate systems","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, data in today's digitally connected world is growing at a rapid pace. Taxonomy represents theme inherent in a data set. So, taxonomy should evolve and reflect changes occurred in the data set, otherwise, it could not represent theme of the underlying data set accurately. Many automatic techniques are available that are generating taxonomy effectively for large to small data sets but, very less focus has been made on the evolution of taxonomy. In this paper, we propose a novel Taxonomy Incremental Evolution (TIE) algorithm that can incrementally evolve an existing taxonomy, whenever new documents are added in underlying data set, rather than regenerating a taxonomy from scratch. The proposed methodology can rest on top of any of the available clustering based automatic taxonomy generation techniques and incrementally evolve an existing taxonomy. We tested the TIE algorithm, in comparison to regeneration, on a text data set belonging to computing domain. The results obtained show that evolution is a better approach as compared to regeneration, as far as time efficiency is considered. Moreover, lexical and hierarchical quality of the evolved taxonomy found to be equally comparable to the regenerated taxonomy. Thus, the TIE algorithm can give an updated taxonomy in a considerably shorter period of time.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0121","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838225","Hierarchical clustering;Information extraction and retrieval;Knowledge organization and management;Taxonomy generation and evolution","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Computer science;Data models;Electrical engineering;Labeling;Taxonomy","text analysis","TIE;clustering based automatic taxonomy generation;digital world;taxonomy incremental evolution;text data set","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inspired by methods from image processing, we propose a novel way for performing hotspot analysis using localized kernel density estimation optimized with an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed method uses local learning to address three challenges associated with traditional kernel density estimation: computational complexity, bandwidth selection, and kernel function selection. We evaluate our localized kernel model on 17 crime types from Chicago, Illinois, USA. Preliminary results indicate significant improvement in prediction performance over the traditional approach.

Traditional RH mapping techniques are very time consuming, and do not work well on noisy datasets.

The main aims of using the proposed approach is: first to reduce the mapping computational complexity, thus speeding up the mapping process. And second, to filter out unreliable markers, and map the remaining reliable markers to build robust maps. The proposed approach maps RH datasets in four steps, as follows: (1) uses Jackknife resampling technique to resample the RH dataset, and groups all resampled datasets into clusters. (2) Builds consensus clusters and filters out unreliable markers. (3) Maps the consensus clusters. (4) Connects the consensus clusters' maps to form the final map. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach, we compare the accuracy of the constructed maps with the corresponding physical maps. Also, we compare the running time of our constructed maps with the Carthagene tool maps running time.

To address shortcomings in the attainment of Course Learning Outcomes (CLO's), it is often necessary to suggest Remedial Actions that vary depending on the domain of the CLO. In fact, taking a non-effective action can result in a waste of time for instructors and students missing an opportunity to overcome weaknesses related to the assessed learning outcome. In this paper, we adopt a supervised classification approach to model this problem by learning from previously applied remedial actions that showed positive results in the improvement of students' attainment of a given CLO. Firstly, a Remedial Actions dataset has been created from different sources and multiple semesters. Then several well-known classification techniques were applied to the dataset showing positive classification accuracy.

Therefore, a centralized High Performance Computing (HPC) environment is often not suitable or simply non-existing. Instead, there is a need for a scalable HPC model that supports the deployment of applications on the decentralized but resource constrained devices of the IoT. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have been used for decision making within applications by directly interacting with the environment. However, most RL algorithms are designed for centralized environments and are time and resource consuming. Therefore, they are not applicable to such constrained decentralized computing environments. In this paper, we propose a scalable Parallel Q-Learning (PQL) algorithm for resource constrained environments. By combining a table partition strategy together with a co-allocation of both processing and storage, we can significantly reduce the individual resource cost and, at the same time, guarantee convergence and minimize the communication cost. Experimental results show that our algorithm reduces the required training in proportion of the number of Q-Learning agents and, in terms of execution time, it is up to 24 times faster than several well-known PQL algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3882-4; POD:978-1-5090-3883-1","10.1109/MLHPC.2016.007","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835792","","Algorithm design and analysis;Convergence;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Scalability;Training","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-agent systems;parallel algorithms","Internet of Things;IoT;Q-learning agents;communication cost minimization;convergence;decentralized resource constrained devices;execution time;processing co-allocation;resource constrained decentralized computing environment;resource cost reduction;scalable HPC model;scalable PQL algorithm;scalable parallel Q-learning algorithm;storage co-allocation;table partition strategy","","","","","","","14-14 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Extracting the maximum possible information from fewer measurements is cost-effective and often necessary due to malfunctions or terrain limitations. Compressive Sensing (CS) is an emerging framework that allows reconstruction of sparse signals from fewer measurements than conventional sampling rates. In seismic CS, the utilization of sparse solvers has proven to be successful, however, algorithms lack predictive uncertainties. We apply the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) to seismic CS and propose a novel utilization of multi-scale dictionaries of basis functions that capture different variations in the data. Furthermore, we propose the use of a new predictive uncertainty measure using the information from the neighbours of each estimation to produce accurate uncertainty maps. We apply the RVM to different seismic signals and obtain state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy.

From a biological perspective, localization of sound sources, and the perceptual separation of sound mixtures by the human hearing organ are two closely interrelated processes. From a signal processing perspective, both localization and separation may be treated as two separate problems. This paper presents a novel method to localize and separate the sound sources, which are situated in high reverberation areas through the adaptation of a Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output system (MIMO) with a Bayesian network. It is shown that, taking account of connections between blind system identification and blind source separation, the sound sources are not only efficiently separated, they can also be accurately localized in the 3D space surrounding the humanoid head. This artificial head is equipped with two inner microphones and two outer microphones. The presented algorithm deploys a non-causal filter system using the known neural networks based principle of information propagation in combination with the machine learning based technique of Bayesian networks.

The objective of the present work is to perform a cross validation of a federation of collaborative rational agents for the diagnosis of ACS in a population with high probability exhibiting chest pain. A study of diagnostic tests was performed, the diagnostic standard criterion was the third redefinition of infarction or some strategy for coronary stratification. The index test was the result of a system based on a federation of collaborative rational agents based on the assembly of neural networks by means of a weighted voting system in accordance with positive likelihood ratios.

With the development of satellite and sensor technologies, remote sensing images attain very high spatial resolution, giving rise to the employment of many computer vision algorithms. Therefore, the object detection is usually formalized as a supervised classification task. In this paper, we propose to apply the Gaussian process (GP) classification algorithm for our detection problem. Among different classifiers, the GP classifier is a Bayesian classification method that is able to make estimations in a probabilistic way. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, we experiment the proposed framework with different feature extraction schemes and classification methods. We carry out a cross-validation experiment over an image dataset that consists of objects and non-objects to train an object detector, and apply the trained detector in an unobserved image scene to search for the objects of interest. Our results show that the GP classifier is competitive to support vector machines (SVM), which is considered state-of-the-art.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0180","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838284","Bag of visual words;Gaussian process classification;High resolution aerial images;Object detection;Remote sensing","Detectors;Feature extraction;Object detection;Remote sensing;Spatial resolution;Support vector machines;Training","Gaussian processes;computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;object detection","Bayesian classification;GP classification algorithm;GP classifier;Gaussian processes;SVM;computer vision algorithms;feature extraction;high resolution remote sensing images;image dataset;object detection;object detector;satellite technologies;sensor technologies;supervised classification task;support vector machines;unobserved image scene","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By projecting the data onto the lower-dimensional signal subspace prescribed by DCA, high performance of face recognition is achievable without compromising privacy of the data owners. We evaluate our approach on three image datasets: Yale, Olivetti and Glasses datasets - the last is derived from the former two.

Therefore, existing work on grammar induction has not fully utilized much available information that can be used to enhance the performance of the algorithms. In this work, an iterative framework based on grammar induction is proposed. In each iteration, a revision operator called Noise Reduction Operator is applied to revise the symbolized time series string based on the rules returned from a base grammar induction algorithm.

The paper proposes a method of combining a series of Sparse Representation Classifier models using a network of Linear Support Vector Machines (LSVMs). One of the core ideas of the paper is that there exists a symbiosis between Sparse Representation Classifier and Linear Support Vector Machine. This symbiosis, we believe makes this ensemble of classifiers a very effective combination. This central argument of the paper is buttressed by empirical evidence, which displays the efficacy of the network of LSVMs in helping SRCs overcome their breakdown points. The paper discusses two important aspects of the ensembling framework: namely, diversity and percolation rate. Diversity is a measure of the ability of the series of SRCs to make uncorrelated errors, and percolation rate is the measure of the ability of the ensembling/combining scheme to pass the correct label as the final predicted label. The classification accuracy of the proposed ensembling framework compares favourably with traditional ensembling frameworks such as Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks on standard datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838261","Ensembling technique;Sparse Representation Classifier;Support Vector Machine","Data models;Electric breakdown;Mathematical model;Optimization;Support vector machines;Symbiosis;Training","pattern classification;support vector machines","LSVM;SRC;classification accuracy;linear support vector machines;sparse representation classifiers","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These global models and their assumptions are at odds with evidence that the relationship between crime and criminogenic factors is not homogeneous across space. In response to this gap, we present area-specific crime prediction models based on hierarchical and multi-task statistical learning.

The challenges stem from a variety of issues, but recent literature has shown that this task is hard to solve with high accuracy when only a restricted set of features, like permissions or similar fixed sets of features, are used. The opposite approach of including all available features is also problematic, as it causes the features space to grow beyond reasonable size. In this paper we focus on finding an efficient way to select a representative feature space, preserving its discriminative power on unseen data. We go beyond traditional approaches like Principal Component Analysis, which is too heavy for large-scale problems with millions of features. In particular we show that many feature groups that can be extracted from Android application packages, like features extracted from the manifest file or strings extracted from the Dalvik Executable (DEX), should be filtered and used in classification separately. Our proposed dimensionality reduction scheme is applied to each group separately and consists of raw string preprocessing, feature selection via log-odds and finally applying random projections. With the size of the feature space growing exponentially as a function of the training set's size, our approach drastically decreases the size of the feature space of several orders of magnitude, this in turn allows accurate classification to become possible in a real world scenario. After reducing the dimensionality we use the feature groups in a light-weight ensemble of logistic classifiers. We evaluated the proposed classification scheme on real malware data provided by the antivirus vendor and achieved state-of-the-art 88.24% true positive and reasonably low 0.04% false positive rates with a significantly compressed feature space on a balanced test set of 10,000 samples.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0041","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838145","Android;dimensionality reduction;feature selection;logistic regression;malware classification;random projection","Androids;Feature extraction;Humanoid robots;Logistics;Malware;Principal component analysis;Sparse matrices","Android (operating system);feature extraction;feature selection;invasive software;pattern classification","Android application packages;Android malware detection;DEX;Dalvik executable;classification scheme;feature extraction;feature selection;log-odds;logistic classifiers;manifest file;mobile devices;random projections;raw string preprocessing;representative feature space;useful representations","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By construction, the complexity of the proposed nonlinear estimator is comparable to that of its linear counterpart since the nonlinear mapping can be implemented efficiently in hardware by means of look-up tables (LUTs). The proposed structure lends itself to neural networks and iterative shrinkage/thresholding-type algorithms restricted to a single iteration (e.g. due to imposed hardware or latency constraints).

In this paper, the neural network is adopted to improve the transient response of output voltage of the dc-dc converter under the consideration of its computational burden. The neural network computation part has a longer computation period than the PID main control part. It can be possible since the neural network gives more than one predictions which are required for the reference modification for each main control period.

It has achieved better performance on the well-known yet hard to make improvement benchmark MINIST compared with other methods in the same category, i.e. Autoencoder [4], Invariant Mapping for Dimensionality Reduction [1], Neighborhood Component Analysis [3], and Fixed Bi-Margin Pairwise Encoding [11].","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0119","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838223","Side-information;deep auto-encoder;dimensionality reduction;metric learning;semi-supervised learning","Adaptation models;Encoding;Image coding;Labeling;Semisupervised learning;Supervised learning;Training data","adaptive codes;learning (artificial intelligence)","bidirectional adaptive pairwise encoding;classic supervised learning methods;deep autoencoder;dimensionality reduction;feature learning;fixed bimargin pairwise encoding model;invariant mapping;neighborhood component analysis;pairwise similarity information;semisupervised learning;side-information encoding","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

On microtask platforms no worker is fully reliable for a task and it is likely that some workers are spammers, in the sense that they provide a random answer to collect the financial reward. Existence of spammers is harmful as they increase the cost of microtasking and will negatively affect the answer aggregation process. Hence, to discriminate spammers and non-spammers one needs to measure worker reliability to predict how likely that a worker put an effort in solving a task. In this paper we introduce a new reliability estimation algorithm works based on bee colony algorithm called REBECO. This algorithm relies on Gaussian process model to estimate reliability of workers dynamically. With bees that go in search of pollen, some are more successful than the others. This maps well to our problem, where some workers (i.e., bees) are more successful than other workers for a given task thus, giving rise to a reliability measure. Answer aggregation with respect to worker reliability rates has been considered as a suitable replacement for conventional majority voting. We compared REBECO with majority voting using two real world datasets. The results indicate that REBECO is able to outperform MV significantly.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0127","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838231","Bee colony;Crowdsourcing;Gaussian process model;Worker reliability estimation","Australia;Business;Crowdsourcing;Estimation;Gaussian processes;Heuristic algorithms;Reliability","Gaussian processes;evolutionary computation;information retrieval;personnel;production engineering computing;reliability","Gaussian process model;REBECO algorithm;bee colony based worker reliability estimation algorithm;financial reward;microtask crowdsourcing platform","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Accurately detecting cyberbullying helps prevent it. However, the noise and errors in social media posts and messages make detecting cyberbullying very challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel pronunciation based convolutional neural network (PCNN) to address this challenge. Upon observing that the pronunciation of misspelled words in informal online conversations is often unchanged, we used the phoneme codes of the text as the features for a convolutional neural network. This procedure corrects spelling errors that did not alter the pronunciation, thereby alleviating the problem of noise and bullying data sparsity. To overcome class imbalance, a common problem in cyberbullying datasets, we implement three techniques that include threshold-moving, cost function adjusting, and a hybrid solution in our model. We evaluate the performance of our models using two cyberbullying datasets collected from Twitter and Formspring.me. The results of our experiment show that PCNN can achieve improved recall and precision compared to baseline convolutional neural networks.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0132","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838236","","Artificial intelligence;Convolutional codes;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Twitter","convolution;feature extraction;neural nets;social aspects of automation;social networking (online);speech processing","CNN features;Formspring.me;Twitter;bullying data sparsity;cost function adjusting;cyberbullying detection;informal online conversations;misspelled words;phoneme codes;pronunciation based convolutional neural network;social media posts;spelling errors;threshold-moving","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These constraints are limitations of resource types and connection availabilities, which may make the collaboration between agents infeasible. We discuss the notion of distributed resource fairness under these constraints. Then we propose a game theory and reinforcement learning based solution for collaborative resource allocation, so that resources are assigned to users fairly and tasks are assigned to resource agents efficiently. We utilize data from Google data center as our input to simulations. Results show that our learning approach outperforms a greedy and random explorations in terms of resource utilization and fairness.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0043","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838147","","Computer science;Electrical engineering;Games;Learning (artificial intelligence);Resource management;Robot sensing systems","computer centres;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation","Google data center;collaborative resource allocation;connection availabilities;decentralized resource allocation game;distributed resource fairness;game theory;multiagent system;multitype resource allocation;reinforcement learning based solution;resource types","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Bayesian Unification of Gradient and Bandit-Based Learning for Accelerated Global Optimisation","O. C. Granmo","Dept. of ICT, Univ. of Agder, Grimstad, Norway","2016 15th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)","20170202","2016","","","222","226","Bandit based optimisation schemes have a remarkable advantage over gradient based approaches due to their global perspective, which eliminates the danger of getting stuck at local optima. However, for continuous optimisation problems or problems with a large number of actions, bandit based approaches can be hindered by slow learning. Gradient based approaches, on the other hand, navigate quickly in high-dimensional continuous spaces through local optimisation, following the gradient in fine grained steps. However, apart from being susceptible to local optima, these schemes are also less suited for online learning due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error before the optimum can be identified. In contrast, bandit algorithms seek to identify the optimal action (global optima) in as few steps as possible. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that unifies the above two distinct paradigms in one single framework, with the aim of combining their advantages. At the heart of our approach we find a stochastic linear approximation of the function to be optimised, where both the gradient and values of the function are explicitly captured. This model allows us to learn from both noisy function and gradient observations, as well as predicting these properties across the action space to support optimisation. We further propose an accompanying bandit driven exploration scheme that uses Bayesian credible bounds to trade off exploration against exploitation. Our empirical results demonstrate that by unifying bandit and gradient based learning, one obtains consistently improved performance across a wide spectrum of problem environments. Furthermore, even when gradient feedback is unavailable, the flexibility of our model, including gradient prediction, still allows us outperform competing approaches, although with a smaller margin. Due to the pervasiveness of bandit based optimisation, our scheme opens up for improved performance both in meta-optimisation and in app- ications where gradient related information is readily available.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0044","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838148","Global Optimization;Multi-armed Bandits;Multi-strategy Learning;On-line Learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Gaussian processes;Linear approximation;Optimization","Bayes methods;approximation theory;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","Bayesian unification;accelerated global optimisation;bandit algorithms;bandit based learning;continuous optimisation problems;fine grained steps;gradient based learning;gradient feedback;gradient observations;local optimisation;noisy function;online learning;optimal action;stochastic linear approximation","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
