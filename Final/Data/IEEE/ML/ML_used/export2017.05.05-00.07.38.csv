Images are partitioned into many regions with the same color, intensity, or texture homogeneity. However conventional image segmentation methods can make the segmentation on blur images inaccurate. Recently, superpixels have become an essential and fundamental preprocess in many computer vision algorithms. By using the superpixels, the accurate region boundaries in the blur images can be obtained. However, the region completeness is still a problem to overcome. In this study, by extending the superpixel segmentation method, the method of Iterative Super Pixels Grouping (ISPG) is proposed to overcome the inaccurate segmentation problem and guarantee the region completeness on the blur images. Furthermore, the proposed ISPG method can partition the image flexibly according to the region completeness measures.

Knowing the predicted position of the target, image template matching is used to get the measured position around the predicted position. Discrete cosine transform (DCT) has a strong energy compaction property, so it can be used to extract features of the target effectively. In this paper, we use DCT to extract features and this does improve the speed of image template matching.

Given that the protein-ligand binding sites are demonstrated to relate with the cavities in the protein structure, Fpocket was used to identify the pockets on the proteins. Then based on the hydrogen bond model, the protein pockets as well as the ligand can be transformed to a series of objects and labels representing potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. In order to find the potential hydrogen bonds made up of those donors and acceptors, a relaxation labeling is carried out. The local patch histogram is introduced for the estimation of initial probability and the coexistence hydrogen bond criterion according to the geometric constraint is used to compute the compatible coefficient. As a result, the matching pairs can be identified after the relaxation labeling. Then the ligand position can be located based quaternion framework for each matching. 92 flexible complexes with at least one intermolecular hydrogen bond are taken into consideration of our experiment and the result shows a high successful docking rate of the proposed algorithm.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890391","Hydrogen bond;Protein-ligand Docking;Relaxation labeling","Abstracts;Accuracy;Hydrogen;Labeling;Proteins;Shape","hydrogen bonds;probability;proteins;proteomics","geometric constraint;intermolecular hydrogen bond;local patch histogram;local shape complementarity;probability estimation;protein pockets;protein structure;protein-ligand binding sites;protein-ligand docking;quaternion framework;relaxation labeling;searching algorithm","","0","","13","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Assuming that a PC powers on or off after it's user brushing fingerprint, then the NCFDT will add it's IP to the scanning list after booting up or remove it's IP from the scanning list after shutdown. The NCFDT uses the data fusion technology to detect whether a machine's connection is good. If a connection fault is detected, an alarm SMS will be sent to the administrator, so that the administrator can deal with it quickly. The experimental results showed that this model can effectively and timely detect the connection faults of any machine in LAN, and send alarm SMS to the administrator in the case that the monitoring host (Host-A) could connect to the Internet.

Detecting the focus of interest such as co-occurring objects in video frames automatically can benefit the tedious manual labelling process. However, detecting the co-occurring objects that is visually salient in video sequences is a challenging task. In this paper, in order to detect co-salient video objects efficiently, we first use the preattentive scheme to locate the co-salient regions in video frames and then measure the similarity between salient regions based on KL-divergence. In addition, to update preattentive patch set for co-salient objects, sparse coding is used for dictionary learning and further discrimination among co-salient objects. Finally a set of primary co-salient objects can be found across all video frames using our proposed filtering scheme. As a result, a video sequence can be automatically parsed based on the detection of co-occurring video objects. Our experiment results show that the proposed co-salient video objects modeling achieves high precision value about 85% and reveals its robustness and feasibility in videos.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890814","Sparse coding;Spatiotemporal analysis;Video abstraction","Abstracts;Encoding","object detection;video coding;video retrieval","automatic abstraction;cosalient object detection;dictionary learning;sparse coding;video abstraction;video frames;video retrieval;video sequences","","0","","21","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"Relevance feedback using semi-supervised learning algorithm for image retrieval","Gui-Zhi Li; Ya-Hui Liu; Chang-Sheng Zhou","Computer Center, Beijing Information and Science and Technology University, 100192, China","2013 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20140908","2013","02","","820","824","Relevance feedback (RF) based on support vector machine (SVM) has been widely used in content-based image retrieval (CBIR) to bridge the semantic gap between low-level visual features and high-level human perception. However, the conventional SVM based RF uses only the labeled images for learning, which gives rise to the small sample problem, i.e., when the training data is insufficient, the performance of SVM may drop dramatically. In this paper, we alleviate the small sample problem in SVM based RF by adopting semi-supervised active learning algorithm that builds better models with a large amount of unlabeled data and the labeled data. Active learning is used to alleviate the manual effort for labeling by selecting only the informative data.

Using these automatically labeled samples, fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) is trained, which takes into account the fuzzy nature of some training samples.

The objective of this model is to get a more reasonable result of clustering through minimizing the uncertainty (fuzziness and non-specificity) of similarity matrix. To solving this optimization model effectively, we propose a new searching approach which integrates together multiple evolution strategies of both differential evolution and dynamic differential evolution. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that the performance of the proposed method is significantly improved compared to that of gradient-descent-based approach in terms of five selected clustering evaluation indices, i.e., fuzziness of similarity matrix, intra-class similarity, inter-class similarity, ratio of intra-class similarity to inter-class similarity.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890399","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890399","Differential Evolution;Dynamic Differential Evolution;Feature weights learning;Similarity-based clustering","Abstracts;Noise measurement","feature selection;matrix algebra;optimisation;pattern clustering","dynamic differential evolution;feature selection;feature weights;optimization model;similarity based clustering;similarity matrix;uncertainty minimization","","0","","32","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

"A dictionary learning algorithm for sparse coding by the normalized bilateral projections","T.

A good dictionary is the one that sparse codes most vectors in a given class of possible input vectors. There are currently several proposals to learn a good dictionary from a set of input vectors. Such methods are termed under the title of dictionary learning. We propose a new dictionary learning algorithm, called K-normalized bilateral projections (K-NBP), which is a modification to a widely used dictionary learning method, i.e., K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD). The main idea behind this was to standardize and normalize the input matrix as a preprocessing stage, and to correspondingly normalize the estimated source vectors in the dictionary update stage. The experimental results revealed that our method was fast, and when the number of iterations was limited, it outperformed K-SVD. Also, if only a coarse approximation was needed, it provided results that were almost like those from K-SVD, but with fewer iterations. This indicated that our method was particularly suited to large data sets with many dimensions, where each iteration took a long time.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958892","Dictionary learning;K-NBP;K-SVD;bilateral projections;sparse coding","Approximation methods;Dictionaries;Encoding;Matrix decomposition;Sparse matrices;Standardization;Vectors","encoding;sparse matrices","K-normalized bilateral projections;K-singular value decomposition;codebook;dictionary learning algorithm;linear combination;source vectors;sparse coding","","0","","17","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Nodes corresponding to an anomalous interval (if one exists) receive samples generated by a distribution q, which is different from the distribution p that generates samples for other nodes. If an anomalous interval does not exist, then all nodes receive samples generated by p. It is assumed that the distributions p and q are arbitrary, and are unknown. In order to detect whether an anomalous interval exists, a test is built based on mean embeddings of distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and the metric of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). It is shown that as the network size n goes to infinity, if the minimum length of candidate anomalous intervals is larger than a threshold which has the order O(log n), the proposed test is asymptotically successful.

For multi-class classification problems, the standard hyperplane-based SVMs are made by constructing and combining several hyperplanes. Instead of using maximal-margin hyperplanes, maximal-margin hyperspheres that each tightly encloses all examples from one class but excludes all examples from the rest class can be used. Since the class-specific hyperspheres are constructed for each class separately, the spherical-structured SVMs can be used to deal with the multi-class classification problem easily. In addition, the center and radius of the class-specific hypersphere characterize the distribution of examples from that class, and may be useful for dealing with imbalance problems. In this paper, we incorporate the concept of fuzzy set theory into the maximal-margin spherical-structured multi-class SVMs (MSM-SVM). The parameters to be estimated in the MSM-SVM, such as the components within the spherical center vector and the radius, are set to be the fuzzy numbers. This integration preserves the benefits of SVMs learning theory and fuzzy set theory, where the SVMs learning theory characterizes the properties of learning machines which enable them to effectively generalize the unseen data and the fuzzy set theory might be very useful for finding a fuzzy structure in an evaluation system.

The dictionary which drives the prediction and coding is assumed given and is learnable by a range of available prior algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on a classification and anomaly detection task on three-phase low-voltage time-series. In this case, we manually design our dictionary based on basic knowledge of common faults that affect low-voltage powerlines.

In this paper, we propose two extended methods based on the RPCA algorithm for more effective vocal separation. First, we extend the conventional RPCA and propose to use in the spectrogram decomposition framework Schatten p- and l<sub>p</sub>-norms, which are generalized versions of the nuclear norm and l<sub>1</sub>-norm used in RPCA, respectively. Second, we apply proper scale compression to the magnitude spectrogram, making it a more appropriate representation for the decomposition.

In this paper we set out to analyze gene expression across brain regions in multiple subjects based on data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas [1] with more than 40 % data missing in our problem. Our analysis is based on the non-negativity constrained Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition where we handle the missing data using marginalization considering three prominent alternating least squares procedures; multiplicative updates, column-wise, and row-wise updating of the component matrices. We examine three gene expression prediction scenarios based on data missing at random, whole genes missing and whole areas missing within a subject. We find that the column-wise updating approach also known as HALS performs the most efficient when fitting the model. We further observe that the non-negativity constrained CP model is able to predict gene expressions better than predicting by the subject average when data is missing at random. When whole genes and whole areas are missing it is in general better to predict by subject averages. However, we find that when whole genes are missing from all subjects the model based predictions are useful. When analyzing the structure of the components derived for one of the best predicting model orders the components identified in general constitute localized regions of the brain. Non-negative tensor factorization based on marginalization thus forms a promising framework for imputing missing values and characterizing gene expression in the human brain. However, care also has to be taken in particular when predicting the genetic expression levels at a whole region of the brain missing as our analysis indicates that this requires a substantial amount of subjects with data for this region in order for the model predictions to be reliable.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958919","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958919","CP;Cande-Comp/PARAFAC;Marginalization;Missing Values;Non-negative Matrix Factorization;Non-negative Tensor Factorization","Abstracts;Genetics;Loading;Noise;Tensile stress;Training;Vectors","biology computing;data analysis;genetics;least mean squares methods;matrix algebra","Allen human brain atlas;CP;HALS;alternating least squares procedures;column-wise component matrix updating;gene expressions modeling;high dimensional multiway structured data analysis;human brain;missing data;multiplicative updates;nonnegative tensor factorization;nonnegativity constrained canonical polyadic decomposition;row-wise component matrix updating","","1","","25","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Working under a Bayesian framework, the impulse response is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian vector, with covariance given by the so called stable spline kernel. Such a prior model encodes smoothness and exponential stability information, and depends just on two unknown parameters that can be determined from data via marginal likelihood optimization. It has been shown that this new regularized estimator may outperform classical system identification approaches, such as prediction error methods. This paper extends the stable spline estimator to identification of time-varying linear systems. For this purpose, we include an additional hyperparameter in the model noise, showing that it plays the role of a forgetting factor and can be estimated via marginal likelihood optimization. Numerical experiments show that the new proposed algorithm is able to well track time-varying systems, in particular effectively detecting abrupt changes in the process dynamics.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958894","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958894","","Heuristic algorithms;Kernel;Noise;Optimization;Splines (mathematics);Time-varying systems;Vectors","Bayes methods;Gaussian processes;asymptotic stability;identification;linear systems;time-varying systems","Bayesian framework;classical system identification approaches;exponential stability information;forgetting factor;hyperparameter;kernel-based approach;noise modelling;prediction error methods;smoothness information marginal likelihood optimization;stable spline kernel;time-invariant linear systems;time-varying linear systems identification;zero-mean Gaussian vector","","2","","34","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is of particular importance for implementing classifiers in embedded systems where memory and computation capabilities are limited. In this paper, decomposition methods for SVM classification functions are developed and discussed, using polynomial approximation methods. The SVM decision function is expanded into a polynomial form and consolidated into classification function with a significantly lower memory footprint and computational cost. The amount of reduction is analyzed for polynomial kernels, and in three demonstrated example systems, the classifier is made two orders of magnitude faster, with a memory requirement that is two orders of magnitude smaller.

Secondly, k nearest neighbors of each KPC are found and the sum of k nearest neighbor squared distances is computed as monitoring statistic for each KPC. Then kernel density estimation method was used to set statistical threshold of the monitoring statistic. KPCs can extract nonlinear feature of batch process and its dimensions are lower than the one of raw data. So using KPCs to build model can reduce computation complexity and memory requirement. kNN can solve nonlinear and multi-modes questions of batch process.

For this setting, we provide a theoretical analysis for the performance mismatch between the error associated with a classifier trained in the SSML setting and a classifier trained in the direct supervision setting.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958877","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958877","Performance bounds;multi-view learning","Approximation methods;Charge coupled devices;Correlation;Covariance matrices;Minimization;Training;Training data","Gaussian distribution;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;vectors","Gaussian data;SSML;feature vectors;linear classifiers;performance analysis;surrogate supervision multiview learning","","0","","9","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A novel feature of the method is the use of two bandwidths, one for the mean shift algorithm in the first stage and another for the spectral clustering in the second. The first bandwidth should describe the local details, while the second captures the global structure of the dataset. Compared to traditional spectral clustering, our method may handle larger data sets, and the proposed MSSC procedure is shown to provide good clustering results in general when following some basic principles for selecting parameters.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958923","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958923","Spectral clustering;eigenvalues (spectrum) and eigenvectors;information theoretic clustering;kernel density estimation;mean shift","Accuracy;Bandwidth;Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Entropy;Kernel;Vectors","data handling;pattern clustering;statistical distributions","KECA;data set handling;kernel entropy component analysis;mean shift spectral clustering","","0","","9","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These charts can be stitched to form an atlas to define a global map of the data space, providing a base for data classification or clustering. A given point is projected to the ridges of the probability density by solving a differential equation which forces the gradient to be in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian. A curvilinear coordinate is then determined as the curve length along each ridge from the projection point to the mode. Since solving such differential equations numerically could be computationally prohibitive for large number of samples to be projected, we also present a diffeomorphic coordinate transformation model to approximate these Cartesian-to-curvilinear coordinate mappings. The model is primarily conceived as an interpolator, and the landmark training data are transformed exactly. The interpolation model is regularized in the Tikhonov sense using a user-specified differential operator. The proposed interpolation methodology is adapted from landmark-matching-based deformable image registration literature.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958878","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958878","","Approximation methods;Data models;Kernel;Manifolds;Mathematical model;Numerical models;Training","image classification;image matching;image registration;interpolation","Cartesian-to-curvilinear coordinate mappings;Hessian;Tikhonov sense;curve length;data classification;data density;data space;diffeomorphic coordinate transformation model;differential equation;eigenvector flow;interpolation methodology;interpolation model;interpolator;invertible nonlinear cluster unwrapping;landmark training data;landmark-matching-based deformable image registration;orthogonal curvilinear coordinate systems;probability density;user-specified differential operator","","1","","17","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A powerful tool for this is Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) where substrates form localized areas of electromagnetic “hot spots” where the signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio is greatly amplified. However, at low concentrations hot spots with target molecules bound are rare. Furthermore, traditional detection relies on having uncontaminated sensor readings which is unrealistic in a real world detection setting. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) approach to identify locations of target molecules. The proposed method is able to successfully analyze the spectra and extract the target spectrum. A visualization of the loadings of the basis vector is created and the results show a clear SNR enhancement. Compared to traditional data processing, the NMF approach enables a more reproducible and sensitive sensor.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958925","17β-Estradiol;Biosensing;Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF);Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS);Unsupervised Learning","Abstracts;Spectroscopy","Bayes methods;biosensors;matrix decomposition;molecular biophysics;optical sensors;proteins;surface enhanced Raman scattering","Bayesian nonnegative matrix factorization;SERS;diagnostics;electromagnetic hot spots;environmental safety;localized areas;low-concentrations hot spots;molecule concentration detection;real world detection setting;signal-to-noise ratio;surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy based sensors;uncontaminated sensor readings","","0","","25","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An algorithm for the compression of Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations is presented. Compression is achieved by embedding the factorization in an encoding routine. Its performance is investigated using two standard test images, Peppers and Barbara. The compression ratio (18:1) achieved by the proposed Matrix Factorization improves the storage-ability of Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations without significantly degrading accuracy (≈ 1-3dB degradation is introduced).

"Joint audio source separation and dereverberation based on multichannel factorial hidden Markov model","T. Higuchi; H.

For monaural source separation, one successful approach involves applying non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to the magnitude spectrogram of a mixture signal, interpreted as a non-negative matrix. Several attempts have recently been made to extend this approach to a multichannel case in order to utilize the spatial correlation of the multichannel inputs as an additional clue for source separation. The multichannel NMF assumes that an observed signal is a mixture of a limited number of source signals each of which has a static power spectral density scaled by a time-varying amplitude. We have previously proposed an extension of this approach, in which the variations over time of the spectral density and the total power of each source is modeled by a hidden Markov model (HMM). This has allowed us to solve source activity detection and source separation simultaneously through model parameter inference. While this method was based on an anechoic mixing model, the aim of this paper is to further extend the above approach to deal with reverberation by incorporating an echoic mixing model into the generative model of observed signals. Through an experiment of underdetermined source separation under reverberant conditions, we confirmed that the proposed method provided a 9.61 dB improvement compared with the conventional method in terms of the signal-to-interference ratio.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4799-3694-6; POD:978-1-4799-3695-3","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958927","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958927","audio event detection;dereverberation;multichannel factorial hidden Markov model;non-negative matrix factorization;source separation","Arrays;Hidden Markov models;Microphones;Optimization;Source separation;Spectrogram;Time-frequency analysis","acoustic convolution;audio signal processing;blind source separation;echo;hidden Markov models;matrix decomposition;reverberation;signal detection;spectral analysis;time-varying channels","NMF;anechoic mixing model;audio event detection;audio source dereverberation;audio source separation;convolutive mixture dereverberation;echoic mixing model;mixture signal spectrogram;multichannel factorial hidden markov model;multichannel spatial correlation utilization;nonnegative matrix factorization;observed signal generative model;reverberation;signal-to-interference ratio;source activity detection;spectral density time variation;static power spectral density;time-varying amplitude","","4","","10","","","21-24 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
