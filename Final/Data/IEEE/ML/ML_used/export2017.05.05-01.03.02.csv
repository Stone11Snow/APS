This paper introduces the notion of flexible constraint into conformant planning and introduces a novel flexible conformant planning problem, namely conformant flexible planning problem. We also put forward a Graph plan-based algorithm to solve this problem.

The spectral feature and the texture feature are composed together to form a new feature vector, which can represent the most effective features of the given remote sensing image. In this way we can overcome shortcomings of only using the single feature and raise the classification accuracy.

The sampling method depends on sample distribution. HSC can directly solve the nonlinear multi-class classification problems and observe the sample distribution. The sample distribution is obtained by adaptively dividing the sample space, and the classification model of hyper surface is directly used to classify large database based on Jordan curve theorem in topology while sampling for MCSC. The number of MCSC is calculated. MCSC has the same classification model with the entire sample set and can totally reflect its classification ability. For any subset of the sample set that contains MCSC, the classification ability remains the same. Moreover, a formula is put forward that can predict the testing accuracy exactly when some samples are deleted from MCSC. So MCSC is the best way of sampling from the original sample set for Hyper Surface Classification method.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370107","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370107","Disjoint Cover Set;Hyper Surface Classification;Minimal Consistent Subset;Sampling","Cybernetics;Helium;Iterative algorithms;Laboratories;Machine learning;Merging;Nearest neighbor searches;Neural networks;Prototypes;Sampling methods","classification;sampling methods","Jordan curve theorem;disjoint cover set;hyper surface classification;judgmental sampling method;minimal consistent subset;sample distribution","","1","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are two core ideas in the proposed method: (1) The robust fuzzy c-means (RFCM) algorithm is proposed to greatly mitigate the influence of data noise and outliers; and (2) A fuzzy-based data sifter (FDS) is proposed to locate good turning-points to partition a given nonlinear data domain into piecewise clusters so that a Takagi and Sugeno fuzzy model (TS fuzzy model) can be constructed with fewer rules.

And it also has pivotal function in evaluating the quality of the project and judging whether the crack of the dam appears. The initial omission settlement is a popular problem in the observation of the earth-rock distortion. Because of the constructing schedule, the settlement observation dot is usually set at the time of the revetment accomplished simultaneously or after it finished. And at this time, it will be longer than the time which the dam spend reaching its elevation. Thus, a time difference existed. The quickest phase is just formed during this longer time when the settlement has grown. Usually, more than half of the total settlement has been accomplished during this time. The result shows that not only can the measure not reflect the whole process of the settlement, but the value of the measurement is far away from the fact as well, which makes the value of the observation result discounted greatly. Therefore, whether the calculation for the Initial Omission Settlement of Earth-rock Dam is right appears. The accuracy of these data has a direct influence on the reliability of the conclusion. In the paper, the initial omission settlement of earth-rock dam is optimized based on Hierarchic Genetic Algorithm by setting the omission settlement as new regression gene and optimizing the three parameters in different GA layers. The result has been testified that the value obtained from the HGA model is better than the one from early model which is far away from the real settlement process.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370282","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370282","Earth-rock dam;Hierarchic Genetic Algorithm;Initial omission settlement","Agriculture;Civil engineering;Cybernetics;Earth;Educational institutions;Equations;Genetic algorithms;Machine learning;Reservoirs;Testing","construction;dams;genetic algorithms","constructing schedule;earth-rock dam;earth-rock distortion;hierarchic genetic algorithm;initial omission settlement;settlement observation dot","","0","","7","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It was proved that some traditional calibration methods, such as the method of Zhengyou Zhang, were inconvenient and their accuracy were also low.

In this scheme, when the effects of untrusted program execution is undesirable, system can be easily rolled back to the initial state where the checkpoint is set before the program executed. In high level security systems, only the trustworthy programs, whose names are listed in a whitelist, are allowed to execute. However forbidding all the anonymous programs is unacceptable. In order to reduce the risk of running the uncertified program, many solutions has been proposed to solve the problem, most of which can be categorized into three kinds: detection, protection or recovery. As a recovery scheme, the system doesn't change the program and its context at runtime, and just monitors the process of its execution, records the access it made to system resources, and simultaneously backs up the modification it made to file system. When the record shows the effect of the program is unexpected, the administrator can undo what the program has modified to the file system according to the record. We have implemented a prototype system for Linux operating system using Linux Security Modules (LSM), which can be integrated into other security modules seamlessly. Key advantages of our scheme are that it requires no changes to the untrusted programs or its execution context; it doesn't do anything to hinder the execution process, and only has negligible performance overhead.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370497","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370497","LSM;Log-based recovery;Untrusted programs","Costs;Cryptography;Cybernetics;File systems;IP networks;Linux;Machine learning;Protection;Runtime;Security","security of data;system monitoring","Linux Security Modules;Linux operating system;anonymous programs;high level security systems;log-based recovery scheme;trustworthy programs;uncertified program;untrusted programs safe execution","","0","","6","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The system consisted of two main parts, namely, recognition training and recognition testing. The printed character images fed to the first part were derived from standard character patterns widely used in a computer currently totalling 72, 864 characters. As for the images used for recognition testing, they were captured from a computer screen and stored in BMP pattern, amounting to 1,015 characters. The findings in this research revealed that the database used was of large size and data was transformed from a table frame of 64 x 64 pixels to be stored in the form of bit strings. A table size of 64 x 64 pixels was used to enable a wide variety of distribution patterns of the stable state of each character, making its identity more obvious. This, of course, caused a modification process in each generation till the final generation which took a long time while the database was used to represent the population of the final generation of each character must be large enough for the bit string used to represent these characters. This would enable the system to recognize a character based on its frequency with the largest number of those bit string patterns. Out of 1,015 printed Thai characters tested, it was found that the system could recognize (accept) 986 characters or 97.14 %, while rejecting 6 characters or 0.59 % and misrecognizing 23 characters or 2.27 %.

Extending Euclidean distance to Mahalanobis distance, Gustafson-Kessel (GK) clustering algorithm and Gath-Geva (GG) clustering algorithm were developed to detect non-spherical structural clusters, but these two algorithms fail to consider the relationships between cluster centers in the objective function. Yin-Tang-Sun-Sun (YTSS) clustering algorithm solved the relationships between cluster centers question, unfortunately, they did not consider the distance between the center of all data points and the center of each cluster. This problem was solved and presented in this paper. In this paper, a new fuzzy clustering algorithm (FPCM-S) was developed based on the conventional fuzzy c-means (FCM) to obtain more accurate clustering results with new separable criterion.

Compared to frequent itemsets, the objects in a hyperclique pattern have a guaranteed level of global pairwise similarity to one another as measured by the cosine or Jaccard similarity measure. Since hypergraph partitioning is mainly based on vertex similairty on the hyperedge, hypercliques may serve as better quality hyperedges. Besides, due to the additional confidence constraint, we can cover more items in the mined patterns while keep the pattern size reasonable. Hence, the difficulty in partitioning dense hypergraphs, which is often encountered in frequent itemset based hypergraph partitioning, is alleviated considerably. Finally, experiments with real-world datasets show that, with hyperclique patterns as hyperedges, we can improve the clustering results in terms of various external validation measures.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370256","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370256","Document categorization;Frequent itemset;Hyperclique;Hypergraph partitioning","Association rules;Clustering algorithms;Cybernetics;Frequency;Itemsets;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern analysis;Transaction databases","document handling;graph theory;pattern clustering","Jaccard similarity;clustering;cosine similarity;document categorization;frequent itemsets;global pairwise similarity;hypercliques;hyperedges;hypergraph partitioning;mined patterns;vertex similairty","","0","","20","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We consider the particularly challenging form of this problem, where we assume that the previously generated data points are no longer available, even if some of those points may still be relevant in the new environment. The algorithm employs a strategic weighting mechanism to determine the error of each classifier on the current data distribution, and then combines the classifiers using a dynamically weighted majority voting.

Moreover, the speedup (the running time of original DBSCAN algorithm divided by the running time of improved algorithm) increases with the size and dimension of dataset, and the parameter Eps of our algorithm does not have a strong influence on the clustering result.

With increasing network traffic, detecting network anomaly would require solving a large-scale pattern classification problem that often contains millions of training vectors. Each training vector may represent a particular signature of network traffic pattern and some of them may be linked to security breaching activities that need to be detected and eradicated. In this paper, a popular statistical learning algorithm known as the support vector machine (SVM) was consider to solve the network anomaly detection problem. However, it is well known that SVM would require excessively long computing time and exceedingly large amount of memory when number of training vectors becomes huge. Hence, direct application of the standard SVM algorithm to solve large-scale network anomaly detection problems is impractical. In this paper, based on computational geometry theory, a new algorithm called convex-hull SVM (CH-SVM) was proposed, which can yield the same solution as original SVM while using significantly less training data, and hence less computing time. Then experiments were done on KDD'99 intrusion detection dataset to compare the performance of the proposed algorithm to a standard SVM and observed reduced training time and improved classification accuracy.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370710","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370710","Anomaly detection;Convex hull;Support vector machine","Computer networks;Cybernetics;Intrusion detection;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Quadratic programming;Statistical learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Telecommunication traffic","authorisation;computational geometry;statistical analysis;support vector machines;telecommunication security","computational geometry theory;convex-hull SVM;network anomaly detection;network security;statistical learning algorithm;support vector machine","","5","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the main drawback of Apriori algorithm is the large amount of candidate itemsets it generates. Several hash-based algorithms, such as DHP and MPIP, were proposed to deal with the problem. DHP employs hash functions to filter out potential-less candidate itemsets. MPIP further improves DHP by employing minimal perfect hashing functions to avoid generation of candidate itemsets. Though MPIP results in a very promising mining efficiency, the memory space required in MPIP increases rapidly as the number of items grows. To obtain even better mining efficiency while reducing the memory space required, a sorting-indexing-trimming (SIT) algorithm for mining association rules is proposed in this paper. SIT uses the sorting, indexing, and trimming techniques to reduce the amount of itemsets to be considered. Then, to utilize both the advantages of Ariori and MPIP, a revised MPIP algorithm is employed to deal with 2-itemsets, and a revised apriori algorithm to deal with Mtemsets for k>2.

Second, the proposed model learns from historical data and predicts future trends. This helps us obtain accurate weather forecasts. Third, through the prediction of weather trends, CAMEL gives us a better understanding of agro-meteorological data. When we compare the predicted results with the observed data, any significant difference between them may be an indication of equipment malfunction or other problems.

So a new image scrambling algorithm based on queue transformation is proposed in this paper. This algorithm only needs one step instead of two steps to complete the scrambling. Meanwhile, reference point can change in every stage. If the attackers want to decode the hiding image, the step, the reference point and the direction should all been known.

Experimental results revealed that our proposed algorithm provides near optimal solutions and outperforms the existing design algorithms. In addition, a significant framework which is based on extractive support vector algorithm is proposed for image restoration. In the framework, input patterns are classified by three filters: median filter, alpha-trimmed mean filter and identity filter. Our proposed filter can achieve three objectives: noise attenuation, chromaticity retention, and preservation of edges and details. Extensive simulation results illustrate that our proposed filter not only achieves these three objectives but also possesses robust and adaptive capabilities, and outperforms other proposed filtering techniques.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370441","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370441","Alpha-terimmed mean filter;Image restoration;Median filter;Support vector machines;Unwieldy storage","Algorithm design and analysis;Cybernetics;Data mining;Filtering;Filters;Image restoration;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Smoothing methods;Support vector machines","filtering theory;image restoration;support vector machines","alpha-trimmed mean filter;extractive support vector algorithm;filtering techniques;identity filter;image restoration;learning speed performance;median filter;nonlinear separating surface;support vector machines","","1","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although wavelet transform well decorrelates images, there still exist dependencies between coefficients. Hence the features extracted from the coefficients may be correlated. If the features from one sub-band are dependent on the features from another sub-band, the later one can be removed. Rough set approach is utilized to remove the correlated or redundant features.

The experimental results show that this algorithm can obtain better results than traditional ones.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370406","Blocking artifacts;Fuzzy rule;Human visual system","Cybernetics;Decoding;Discrete cosine transforms;Fuzzy systems;Humans;Image processing;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Transform coding;Visual system","artificial intelligence;fuzzy set theory","adaptive filter;fuzzy blocking artifacts reduction algorithm;fuzzy logic technique;human visual system","","0","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The new algorithm assumes that the particles tend to fly towards two directions. One is flying toward the global best particle. The other is flying toward the vertical direction. And there is a random value produced in every iteration step to measure the probability of flying into two directions. Both VPSO and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) are used to train neural network (NN) and applied in soft-sensor of acrylonitrile yield. Finally, simulation results show that the method proposed by this paper is feasible and effective in soft-sensor of acrylonitrile yield.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370472","Acrylonitrile;Optimization;Particle swarm optimization algorithm;Soft-sensing","Birds;Computational modeling;Convergence;Cybernetics;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Optimization methods;Particle swarm optimization;Stochastic processes","chemical engineering;chemical sensors;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;random processes","acrylonitrile yield;iteration process;neural network training;random value;soft-sensor modeling;vertical particle swarm optimization algorithm","","1","","5","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main problem is that it is difficult to make the learning satisfy rationality and convergence at the same time. Here, the typical learning algorithms are analyzed firstly, and then a new method called Pareto-Q is prompted with the concept of Pareto optimum, which is rational. At the same time, social conventions are also introduced to promise the convergence of learning. At the last, experiments are presented to prove the good learning result of this algorithm.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370114","MAS;Pareto optimum;Reinforcement learning;Social conventions","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Convergence;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multiagent systems;Pareto analysis;Stochastic processes","Pareto optimisation;convergence;cooperative systems;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic games","Pareto optimum;Pareto-Q method;cooperative agents;general-sum games;learning algorithm;learning convergence;multiagent reinforcement learning;stochastic game","","0","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
