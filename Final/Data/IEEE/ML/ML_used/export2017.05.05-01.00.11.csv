Condition number of a matrix is an important measure in numerical analysis and linear algebra. However, the direct computation of the condition number of a matrix is very expensive in terms of CPU and memory cost, and becomes prohibitive for large size matrices. We use data mining techniques to estimate the condition number of a given sparse matrix. In our previous work, we used support vector machine (SVM) to predict the condition numbers. While SVM is considered a state-of- the-art classification/regression algorithm, kNN is usually used for collaborative filtering tasks. Since prediction can also be interpreted as a classification/regression task, virtually any supervised learning algorithm (such as kNN) can also be applied. Experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset. We conclude that modified kNN (MkNN) performs much better than SVM on this particular dataset.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.8","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457235","","Classification algorithms;Costs;Data mining;Filtering algorithms;Linear algebra;Numerical analysis;Prediction algorithms;Sparse matrices;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","data mining;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);linear algebra;mathematics computing;number theory;numerical analysis;pattern classification;prediction theory;sparse matrices;support vector machines","classification algorithm;collaborative filtering tasks;condition number estimation;condition number prediction;data mining;linear algebra;modified K-nearest neighbor algorithm;numerical analysis;regression algorithm;sparse matrices;supervised learning algorithm;support vector machine","","0","","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Of Montreal, Montreal","Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)","20080225","2007","","","73","80","A pattern is a collection of events/features that occur together in a transaction database. Previous studies in the field are often dedicated to the problem of frequent pattern mining where only patterns that appear frequently in the input data are mined. As a result, patterns involving events/features that appear in few data sets are not captured. In some domains, such as the detection of computer attacks, fraudulent transactions in financial institutions, those patterns, also known as rare patterns, are more interesting than frequent patterns. We propose a framework to represent different categories of interesting patterns and then instantiate it to the specific case of rare patterns. Later on, we present a generic framework to mine patterns based on the Apriori approach. In this paper we are interested by the patterns composed of a set of items, also called itemsets. Thus, we instantiate the generalized Apriori framework to mine rare itemsets. The resulting approach is Apriori-like and the mine idea behind it is that if the itemset lattice representing the itemset space in classical Apriori approaches is traversed on a bottom-up manner, equivalent properties to the Apriori exploration of frequent itemsets are provided to mine rare itemsets. This include an anti-monotone property and a level- wise exploration of the itemset space. As demonstrated by our experiments, our approach is effective in identifying all rare itemsets and is more efficient than the existing approach.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457211","","Application software;Computer science;Data mining;Data security;Databases;Frequency;Itemsets;Machine learning;Operations research;Software engineering","data mining;pattern recognition","computer attacks;financial institutions;fraudulent transactions;pattern mining;rare itemset mining;transaction database","","10","","12","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The effect of such corrections in random forests of PETs is investigated, and the use of the relative class frequency is compared to using two corrected estimates, the Laplace estimate and the m-estimate. An experiment with 34 datasets from the UCI repository shows that estimating class probabilities using relative class frequency clearly outperforms both using the Laplace estimate and the m-estimate with respect to accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Brier score. Hence, in contrast to what is commonly employed for PETs and ensembles of PETs, these results strongly suggest that a non-corrected probability estimate should be used in random forests of PETs. The experiment further shows that learning random forests of PETs using relative class frequency significantly outperforms learning random forests of classification trees (i.e., trees for which only an unweighted vote on the most probable class is counted) with respect to both accuracy and AUC, but that the latter is clearly ahead of the former with respect to Brier score.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.64","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457233","","Area measurement;Classification tree analysis;Frequency estimation;Informatics;Machine learning;Positron emission tomography;Probability distribution;Voting","probability;trees (mathematics)","Brier score;Laplace estimate;ROC curve;class probabilities;m-estimate;observed relative class frequencies;random forests;single probability estimation trees","","6","2","16","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In such a context, so-called ""soft"" failures, where a device silently starts working in degraded mode, may easily go un-noticedfor a long time, resulting in potential productivity loss. It is therefore advantageous to enable system administrators to identify soft failures at an early stage. We propose here a probabilistic method using variational inference on a factorial hidden Markov model to automatically discover soft failures, based on the analysis of simple usage information which is normally logged by the network infrastructure. We propose to mine these logs in order to discover statistically significant deviations in the usage behavior of the overall infrastructure, and we identify such deviations with soft failures, or, in any case, situations of interest to an administrator.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.79","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457225","","Degradation;Europe;Failure analysis;Floors;Hardware;Hidden Markov models;Information analysis;Machine learning;Printers;Productivity","computer network reliability;fault diagnosis;hidden Markov models;probability;variational techniques","digital network;factorial hidden Markov models;network infrastructure;probabilistic method;soft failure detection;usage behavior;variational inference","","1","","20","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RBCM utilizes rough set theory to significantly reduce the number of attributes, discretation to partition the domain of attribute values, and Boolean predicates to generate the decision rules that comprise the model. When the domain values of an attribute are continuous and relatively large, rough set theory requires that they be discretized. The subsequent discretized domain must have the same characteristics as the original domain values. However, this can lead to a large number of partitions of the attribute's domain space, which in turn leads to large rule sets. These rule sets tend to form models that over-fit. To address this issue, the proposed rule-based model adopts a new model selection strategy that minimizes over-fitting for the RBCM. Empirical validation of the RBCM is accomplished through a case study on a large legacy telecommunications system. The results demonstrate that the proposed RBCM and the model selection strategy are effective in identifying the classification model that minimizes over-fitting and high cost classification errors.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.69","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457232","","Application software;Classification tree analysis;Costs;Fault diagnosis;Machine learning;Phase measurement;Set theory;Software measurement;Software metrics;Software quality","classification;knowledge based systems;rough set theory;software quality","Boolean predicates;rough set theory;rule-based classification model;rule-based model selection technique;software quality classification","","0","","19","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By minimizing such energy using the tabu search method, an approximately optimal sequence could be found with ease, and further different manifolds are separated by detecting some crucial points, boundaries between manifolds, along the optimal sequence.

An inductive logic programming algorithm generalises observations and deduced knowledge, allowing the agent to execute a good plan. We show results of using PROGOL learning algorithm to distinguish ""bad"" plans early in the reasoning process, before too many resources are wasted on considering them. We show that additional knowledge needs to be provided before learning can be successful, but argue that the benefits achieved make it worthwhile.

One of the major contributors to OCR errors is smeared characters. Several factors lead to the smearing of characters such as bad scanning quality and a poor binarization technique. Typical approaches to character segmentation falls into three major categories: image-based, recognition-based, and holistic-based. Among these approaches, the segmentation path can be linear or non-linear. Our paper proposes a non-linear approach to segment characters on grayscale document images. Our method first determines whether characters are smeared together using general character features. The correct segmentation path is found using a shortest path approach.

Mostly building on the work of Winston on near-misse examples, we show that, on the same set of problems, a top-down data-driven strategy can cross any plateau if near-misses are supplied in the training set, whereas they do not change the plateau profile and do not guide a generate-and-test strategy.

By doing so, we set up the problem by introducing a parameterized probabilistic model for the agent dynamics: the acts of an agent are determined by micro-laws with unknown parameters. Our approach is to identify the appropriate parameters in the model. To solve the problem, we develop heuristic expectation-maximization style algorithms for determining the micro-laws of a community based on either observed communication links between actors, or the observed evolution of social groups.

To analyze users' preferences we propose a dynamic K-means clustering algorithm. The dynamic K-means clustering algorithm clusters the pieces in the music list dynamically adapting the number of clusters. We recommend pieces of music based on the clusters. The previous recommendation systems analyze a user's preference by simply averaging the properties of music in the user's list. So those cannot recommend correctly if a user prefers several genres of music. By using our K-means clustering algorithm, we can recommend pieces of music which are close to user's preference even though he likes several genres. We perform experiments with one hundred pieces of music.

Determining the optimum number of clusters is an ill posed problem for which there is no simple way of knowing that number without a priori knowledge. In this paper we propose a new two-level clustering algorithm based on self organizing map, called S2L-SOM, which allows an automatic determination of the number of clusters during learning. Estimating true numbers of clusters is related to the cluster stability which involved the validity of clusters generated by the learning algorithm. To measure this stability we use the sub-sampling method. The great advantage of our proposed algorithm, compared to the common partitional clustering methods, is that it is not restricted to convex clusters but can recognize arbitrarily shaped clusters. The validity of this algorithm is superior to standard two-level clustering methods such as SOM+k-means and SOM+Hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This is demonstrated on a set of critical clustering problems.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.71","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457250","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Data visualization;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Organizing;Partitioning algorithms;Stability;Testing;Unsupervised learning","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;sampling methods;self-organising feature maps","S2L-SOM;arbitrarily shaped clusters;automatic cluster determination;automatic model selection;cluster stability;convex clusters;learning algorithm;model selection problem;partitional clustering methods;self organizing map;simultaneous two-level clustering algorithm;sub-sampling method","","5","3","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach augments the search space exponentially, in the number of nodes, relatively to trees, yet keeping a polynomial-time bound. The proposed algorithm can be applied to scores that decompose over the network structure, such as the well known LL, MDL, AIC, BIC, K2, BD, BDe, BDeu and MIT scores.

It becomes a challenge to extract information from the large amount of data through data mining. One important application of gene expression microarray data is cancer classification. However, gene expression data collected for cancer classification usually has the property of the number of genes far exceeding the number of samples. Work in such a high dimensional space is extremely difficult. Previous researches have used two-stage classification method to deal with the gene expression data. Such approaches select genes to reduce problem dimension in the first stage and classify tumors in the second stage. In the study, the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is introduced to select genes relevant to cancers first, then the multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) neural network and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers are used for cancer classification. Experimental results show that selecting genes by using ACO algorithm can improve the accuracy of BP and SVM classifiers.

The mathematical model describes how the integrated approach to decision making can achieve global optimum as compared to independent decision by the supplier, the distributor, and the retailer. Due to the complexity of the non-linear problems, it is not possible to find the global optimum analytically. Annealing is the physical process of heating up a solid until it melts followed by cooling it down until it crystallizes into a state with perfect lattice. Following this physical phenomenon, a soft computing method, simulated annealing (SA), has been developed to find the global optimum for a complex cost surface through stochastic search process. A computer program in C-language has been developed for this purpose and is implemented to derive the optimum decision for the decision maker. Numerical examples and a sensitivity analysis are given to validate the results of the system.

The experimental result shows that the application of the designed hybrid image compression method can increase the signal-to-noise ratio of an image while the high compression ratio of the image is guaranteed.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620900","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620900","Fractal Image Encoding;Hybrid Encoding;IFS (Iterative Function System);Wavelet Decomposition","Fractals;Frequency;Image analysis;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Iterative decoding;Signal design;Signal to noise ratio;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","data compression;image coding;image reconstruction;wavelet transforms","IFS;fractal image compression method;hybrid encoding analysis;iterative function system;signal-to-noise ratio;subimage reconstruction;wavelet transform","","1","","9","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most of existing methods measure the similarity among video frames based on its low-level feathers. However, they are sensitive to the change in not only brightness, color, motion of object, but also camera motions and the quality of video. This paper proposes an innovative shot boundary detection method for news video based on video object segmentation and tracking. It combines three main techniques: the partitioned histogram comparison method, the video object segmentation and tracking based on wavelet analysis. The partitioned histogram comparison is used as the first filter to effectively reduce the number of video frames which need object segmentation and tracking. The unsupervised video object segmentation and tracking based on wavelet analysis is robust to those problems mentioned above. The efficacy of the proposed method is extensively tested with more than 3 hours of CCTV and CNN news programs, and that 96.4% recall with 97.2% precision have been achieved.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620823","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620823","Object tracking;Shot boundary detection;Video object segmentation;partitioned histogram","Brightness;Cameras;Feathers;Filters;Gunshot detection systems;Histograms;Object detection;Object segmentation;Robustness;Wavelet analysis","image segmentation;object detection;tracking;video signal processing;wavelet transforms","innovative shot boundary detection method;news video;object segmentation;object tracking;partitioned histogram comparison method;video frames;wavelet analysis","","1","","10","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, in a binary classification problem it is often the case that examples of one class are abundant, while examples of the other class are in short supply. Examples from one class, typically the positive class, can be limited due to the financial cost or time required to collect these examples. This work presents a comprehensive empirical study of learning when examples from one class are extremely rare, but examples of the other class(es) are plentiful. Specifically, we address the issue of how many examples from the abundant class should be used when training a classifier on data where one class is very rare.

Polysomnography (PSG) is a diagnostic test that a number of physiologic variables are measured and recorded during sleep. Although PSG is treated as the golden standard for diagnosing OSA, it is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, clinical prediction of high-risk OSA patients using questionnaires and application of cheap home diagnostic devices has a great potential in reducing healthcare cost and in eliminating environmental variation for some patients tested in the sleeping center. A total of 699 patients with possible OSA had been recruited and tested using PSG for overnight attending at the Sleep Center of China Medical University Hospital from Jan. 2004 to Dec. 2005. Subjects with age less than 20 or more than 85 years old were excluded. Therefore only the data obtained from 566 patients were used for further analysis. After statistical analyses and feature selection, support vector machine (SVM) was used to discriminate normal subjects and patients with different stages of severity. The results show that oxygen desaturation index (ODI) alone has the best prediction outcome for the patients with severe OSA with a sensitivity as high as 83.51%. The sensitivity is only 42.86% in discriminating the normal from abnormal subjects. From cost-benefit analysis, we propose that home-styled oximeter can be used for sifting severe patients among all suspected patients and then PSG applied for discriminating normal from mild and moderate subjects. A cost reduction of NT$1563 in average can be achieved for each subject under the current Taiwanese insurance setting.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620964","Obstructive Sleep Apnea;Oximetry;Polysomnography (PSG);Support Vector Machine (SVM)","Costs;Diseases;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Medical tests;Recruitment;Sleep apnea;Support vector machines;Vehicle crash testing;Vehicles","diseases;health care;oximetry;patient diagnosis;support vector machines","clinical prediction;healthcare cost;home diagnostic devices;home-styled oximeter;motor vehicle crashes;obstructive sleep apnea;oxygen desaturation index;patients diagnosis;polysomnography;support vector machine","","0","","36","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then residual error vector can be computed by using the estimated state vector and the state vector measured by GPS. Finally, two nerve cells are introduced to guarantee real-time estimation reliability: one nerve cell can real-timely distinguish whether the GPS signal includes multi-path error using residual error vector; the other real-timely diagnoses the current precision of vehicle state vector.

In this paper, we combine both approaches in a family of Bayesian models for continuous data that are able to handle univariate as well as multivariate nodes, different types of distributions, e.g. Gaussian as well as Poisson distributed nodes, and dependencies between nodes. The models we introduce can be used for unsupervised, semi-supervised as well as for fully supervised learning tasks.

Here, with the introduction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) domain analysis using minimum statistics, the proposed algorithm effectively reduces high levels of noise generated by the electrolarynx. Unlike existing methods, the proposed algorithm does not require the use of a voice activity detector and the Discrete Cosine Transform domain is more proficient at isolating speech signal energy.
