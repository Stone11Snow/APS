In this paper, the communication requirement for distributed learning is studied in the scenario of multiple data storage nodes having the capability of learning and a fusion center. Lower bounds for communications are derived based on VC-entropy of modeling in the machine learning.

The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive. A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses. However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on chip storage of a multi-chip system. This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost. In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines. We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system.

In addition, it obtained a higher accuracy than the baseline methods in the experiments using two paragraphs of an article. We performed feature analysis and we found that adnominals, conjunctions, and dates were effective for the order estimation of the first two paragraphs, and the ratio of new words and the similarity between the preceding paragraphs and an estimated paragraph were effective for the order estimation of all pairs of paragraphs. Moreover, we compared the order estimation of sentences and paragraphs and clarified differences. For the order estimation of the first two paragraphs, paragraph order estimation would be easier than sentence order estimation because paragraphs have more information than sentences.

We are exploring the problem of semantic heterogeneity in a data space system as a part of our PhD work. In this paper, we have addressed the semantic heterogeneity in the context of a data space system, and presented an abstract framework to model the semantic heterogeneity in data space. The proposed model is based on machine learning and ontology approaches. The machine learning technique analyzes the semantically equivalent data items (or entities) in data space, and the ontology conceptualizes the structural entities in a data space. This model resolves the semantic heterogeneity of a data space system, and creates a conceptual model using ""from-data-to-schema"" approach. The proposed approach implicitly creates the domain ontology by finding the most similar concepts comming from different data sources and enriches the performance of the system by finding the semantic relationships among them.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8084-0; POD:978-1-4799-8133-5","10.1109/ICIT.2014.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033336","Dataspace;Semantic Heterogeneity;User Feedback;from-data-to-schema;on-the-fly","Data mining;Data models;Distributed databases;Ontologies;Prototypes;Semantics","learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing;relational databases","abstract framework;data sources;dataspace system;distributed-autonomous heterogeneous data sources;domain ontology;from-data-to-schema approach;information integration;information sharing;machine learning approach;ontology approach;semantic heterogeneity modeling;semantic relationships;semantically equivalent data item analysis;structural entity conceptualization;user query answering","","0","","30","","","22-24 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

GFS can generate simple and accurate classifiers with a number of fuzzy if-then rules by evolutionary computation (EC). One general concern is how to discretize numerical attributes into fuzzy partitions. Most GFS use homogeneous fuzzy partitions without considering the class distribution of each attribute. This is the simplest idea, but more accurate classifiers could be obtained by optimizing fuzzy partitions. There are three approaches. One is pre-processing where inhomogeneous fuzzy partitions are specified according to the class distribution before applying EC. Another approach is to simultaneously optimize both a set of fuzzy if-then rules and fuzzy partitions by EC. The other is post-processing where fuzzy partitions used in the obtained classifier are optimized afterward. In this paper, we examine the effect of post-processing where fuzzy partition optimization is applied to the obtained classifier by GFS. In computational experiments, we first use our hybrid fuzzy genetics-based machine learning with homogeneous fuzzy partitions for standard data sets and its parallel distributed implementation for large data sets.

Therefore, a novel method to extract apparent features of face images by convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) without relying on artificial features selection is proposed. Massive beautiful and ugly training samples are required by traditional machine learning methods, and it is hard to be satisfied because most face images are actually neutral beauty. A better method of relaxing strict restrictions of training samples is self-taught learning, which automatically improves CRBM to understand the characteristics of data distribution even if the requirements of the class and number of training samples are not satisfied, thus the facial beauty prediction model could be established reasonably. Experimental results show that the proposed facial beauty prediction model can achieve recognition rate of 87.3% on three classes of beautiful, ordinary and unbeautiful face images, and 95% on two classes of beautiful and unbeautiful face images. Meanwhile, the extracted apparent features can effectively characterize feature information of beautiful faces.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4217-6; Electronic:978-1-4799-4215-2; POD:978-1-4799-4214-5","10.1109/ICMLC.2014.7009719","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009719","Apparent features;Convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine;Facial beauty prediction model;Self-taught learning","Abstracts;Arrays;Databases;Feature extraction;Image resolution;Manuals;Training","Boltzmann machines;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);prediction theory","artificial features selection;beautiful training samples;convolutional restricted Boltzmann machine;facial beauty prediction model;feature extraction;landmark facial features;machine learning methods;self-taught learning;ugly training samples;unbeautiful face images","","0","","18","","","13-16 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

At many stages of the design process, it is important to estimate how application performance and power are impacted by these options. This paper describes a GPU performance and power estimation model that uses machine learning techniques on measurements from real GPU hardware. The model is trained on a collection of applications that are run at numerous different hardware configurations. From the measured performance and power data, the model learns how applications scale as the GPU's configuration is changed. Hardware performance counter values are then gathered when running a new application on a single GPU configuration. These dynamic counter values are fed into a neural network that predicts which scaling curve from the training data best represents this kernel. This scaling curve is then used to estimate the performance and power of the new application at different GPU configurations. Over an 8× range of the number of CUs, a 3.3× range of core frequencies, and a 2.9× range of memory bandwidth, our model's performance and power estimates are accurate to within 15% and 10% of real hardware, respectively.

More and more applications are being deployed in cloud environments. Malware detection or antivirus software has been recently provided as a service in the cloud. A cloud antivirus provider hosts a number of virtual machines each running the same or different antivirus engines on potentially different sets of workloads (files). From the provider's perspective, the problem of optimally allocating physical resources to these virtual machines is crucial to the efficiency of the infrastructure. We propose a search-based optimization approach for solving the resource allocation problem in cloud-based antivirus deployments. An elaborate cost model of the file scanning process in antivirus programs is instrumental to the proposed approach. The general architecture is presented and discussed, and a preliminary experimental investigation into the antivirus cost model is described. The cost model depends on many factors, such as total file size, size of code segment, and count and type of embedded files within the executable. However, not a single parameter of these can be reliably used alone to predict file scanning time. Thus, a machine-learning approach that combines all these parameters as features is used to build a classifier for antivirus file scanning time. The best results we obtained were using the Decision Tree classifier. The highest F-measure value was 0.91, the highest F-measure value using logitboost was 0.87, the highest F-measure value using support vector machine was 0.85 and the highest F-measure value using naïve Bayes was 0.82. We evaluated the accuracy of the classification model versus linear regression model using the Root Mean Square (RMS) measure. We found that the classification model is more accurate than linear regression model, whereas the values average of RMS were 0.988 second and 2.44 second for classification model and linear re- ression model, respectively.","","CD-ROM:978-977-403-689-7; Electronic:978-977-403-695-8; POD:978-1-4799-4018-9","10.1109/INFOS.2014.7036708","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036708","Antivirus;Cost Model;Machine Learning;Resource Allocation;Virtualization;cloud Antivirus","Decision support systems","Bayes methods;cloud computing;computer viruses;embedded systems;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;pattern classification;regression analysis;resource allocation;support vector machines;virtual machines;virtualisation","F-measure value;RMS measure;antivirus engine;antivirus file scanning time;antivirus program;antivirus software;classification model;cloud antivirus cost model;cloud antivirus provider;cloud computing;cloud environment;cloud-based antivirus deployment;code segment;decision tree classifier;embedded file;file scanning process;linear regression model;logitboost;machine learning;malware detection;naïve Bayes;physical resources allocation;resource allocation problem;root mean square measure;search-based optimization approach;support vector machine;virtual machine;virtualization technology","","0","","21","","","15-17 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has attracted considerable attention in the past. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in the study of localization algorithm for WSN. Self-localization of nodes is one of the key technologies for application of WSN. The localization accuracy is a significant criterion to evaluate the practical utility of localization algorithm. In most of the localization algorithms, increasing the density of anchor nodes is one of the main strategies to improve the localization accuracy. But the number of anchor nodes is always limited due to the hardware limitations, such as energy consumption, cost, and so on. In this paper, a novel machine learning algorithm is developed to improve the accuracy. Specifically, we propose a DV-Hop self-localization algorithm using extreme learning machine (ELM), called DV-Hop-ELM, which achieves the objective by virtually increasing the number of anchor nodes. The ELM-based single-hidden layer feedforward network (SLFN) is firstly designed to find the appropriate sub-anchor nodes. Moreover, the improved DV-Hop localization algorithm utilizes those anchor nodes and sub-anchor nodes to localize remaining sensor nodes. We test the algorithm DV-Hop-ELM to demonstrate its performance. Compared to classic DV-Hop algorithm, the proposed method improves the localization accuracy while reducing the costs of WSN.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5825-2; POD:978-1-4799-5826-9; USB:978-1-4799-5824-5","10.1109/WCICA.2014.7052775","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052775","DV-Hop;autonomous systems;extreme learning machine;sub-anchor nodes;wireless sensor network","Accuracy;Ad hoc networks;Algorithm design and analysis;Artificial neural networks;Feedforward neural networks;Simulation;Wireless sensor networks","ad hoc networks;energy consumption;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless sensor networks","DV-hop self-localization algorithm;DV-hop-ELM;ad hoc network;anchor nodes;autonomous system;energy consumption;extreme learning machine;machine learning algorithm;nodes self-localization;single-hidden layer feedforward network;wireless sensor network","","1","","21","","","June 29 2014-July 4 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three different kinds of models are designed based on back-propagation (BP) neural network, generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and support vector machine (SVM) respectively. The experimental results show that the improved BP algorithm and SVM work better than GRNN methods, and the models based on SVM present the best performance in terms of goodness-of-fit measures, but need to be further improved in the running time. We develop these prediction models with different lead time (7-day and 14-day) to study further.

Additionally, according to recent studies, the amount of time spent on sitting is a highly important determinant of health and wellbeing. In fact, sedentary lifestyle can lead to many diseases and, what is more, it is even found to be associated with increased mortality. In this study, a data set consisting of self-reported questionnaire, medical diagnoses and fitness tests was studied to detect sedentary young men from a large population and to create a profile of a sedentary person. The data set was collected from 595 young men and contained altogether 678 features. Most of these are answers to multi-choice close-ended questions. More precisely, features were mostly integers with a scale from 1 to 5 or from 1 to 2, and therefore, there was only a little variability in the values of features. In order to detect and profile a sedentary young man, machine learning algorithms were applied to the data set. The performance of five algorithms is compared (quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), C4.5, random forests, and nearest neighbours (kNN)) to find the most accurate algorithm. The results of this study show that when the aim is to detect a sedentary person based on medical records and fitness tests, LDA performs better than the other algorithms, but still the accuracy is not high. In the second part of the study the differences between highly sedentary and non-sedentary young men are searched, recognition can be obtained with high accuracy with each algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4518-4; POD:978-1-4799-4517-7","10.1109/CIDM.2014.7008681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008681","","Accuracy;Diseases;Educational institutions;Feature extraction;Machine learning algorithms;Medical diagnostic imaging;Sociology","learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing","fitness test;health-enhancing physical activity;machine learning algorithms;medical diagnosis;sedentary young men","","1","","26","","","9-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The forecasting model is built using six and eleven weeks of data from five building substations. The external factors and internal factors influencing the heat load in substations are parameters used as our model's input. Short-term forecast models are generated using four supervised Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Support Vector Regression (SVR), Regression Tree, Feed Forwards Neural Network (FFNN) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Performance comparison among these ML methods was carried out. The effects of combining the internal and external factors influencing heat load at substations was studied.

The paper describes a system that uses a set of data pre-processing activities which includes Feature Selection and Discretization. Feature selection and dimension reduction are common data mining approaches in large datasets. Here the high data dimensionality of the dataset due to its large feature set poses a significant challenge. In Pre-processing with the help of Feature selection algorithm the various required features are selected, these activities helps to improve the accuracy of the classifier. After this step various classifiers are used such as Naive Bayes, Hidden Naive Bayes and NBTree. The advantage of Hidden Naive Bayes is a data mining model that relaxes the Naive Bayes Method's conditional Independence assumption. Also the next Classifier used is NBTree which induces a hybrid of decision tree classifiers and Naïve Bayes classifiers which significantly improves the accuracy of classifier and decreases the Error rate of the classifier. The output of the proposed method are checked for True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative. Based on these values the Accuracy and error rate of each classifier is computed.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5522-0; POD:978-1-4799-5523-7","10.1109/ICCICT.2015.7045674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7045674","Feature selection;Hidden Naïve Bayes;NBTree;Naïve Bayes;classification;discretization","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Computers;Data mining;Error analysis;Intrusion detection;Training","data mining;decision trees;feature selection;hidden Markov models;pattern classification","NBTree classifiers;NSL-KDD dataset;Naive Bayes method conditional independence assumption;data dimensionality;data mining approach;data mining model;data preprocessing activities;decision tree classifiers;dimension reduction;feature discretization;feature selection algorithm;hidden Naive Bayes classifiers;machine learning algorithms;record class label identification","","0","","20","","","15-17 Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In spite of their attractive applications, MANET poses high security problems compared to conventional wired and wireless networks due to its unique characteristics such as lack of central coordination, dynamic topology, temporary network life and wireless nature of communication. Attack prevention measures, such as the use of encryption and authentication techniques, have been proposed as a first line of defense to reduce the risk of security problems. However such risks cannot be completely eliminated, there is a strong need of intrusion detection systems (IDS) as a second line of defense for securing MANET. Intrusion detection on MANET is a challenging task due to its unique characteristics such as open medium, dynamic topology, lack of centralized management and highly resource constrained nodes. Conventional intrusion detection system developed for wired networks cannot be directly applied to MANET. It needs to be redesigned to suit the ad hoc technology. The proposed system introduces new architecture that uses machine learning approach to maximize the detection accuracy. Proposed IDS architecture uses the combination of Rough Set Theory (RST) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to make use of the excellent accuracy of SVM and better performance of RST.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3834-6; POD:978-1-4799-3698-4","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7033949","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033949","Intrusion Detection;Machine Learning;Mobile ad hoc Networks;Rough Set Theory and Support Vector Machine;Security issues","Approximation methods;Intrusion detection;Mobile ad hoc networks;Set theory;Support vector machines;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security of data;support vector machines","IDS architecture;MANET;RST;SVM;ad hoc technology;attack prevention measures;authentication techniques;centralized management;dynamic topology;encryption;highly resource constrained nodes;instant wireless networking;intrusion detection systems;machine learning;mobile ad hoc networking;mobile ad hoc networks;rough set theory;security problems;support vector machine;temporary network life;wired networks;wireless devices","","0","","10","","","27-28 Feb. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To accurately collect data for a volume model of atmospheric explosions requires building a 3D representation from 2D images. The majority of 3D reconstruction algorithms use the SIFT (scale-invariant feature transform) feature detection algorithm which works best on feature-rich objects with continuous angular collections. These assumptions are different from the archive of nuclear explosions that have only 3 points of view. This paper reduces 300 dimensions derived from an image based on Fourier analysis and five edge detection algorithms to a manageable number to detect hotspots that may be used to correlate videos of different viewpoints for 3D reconstruction. Furthermore, experiments test whether histogram equalization improves detection of these features using four kernel sizes passed over these features. Dimension reduction using principal components analysis (PCA), forward subset selection, ReliefF, and FCBF (Fast Correlation-Based Filter) are combined with a Mahalanobis distance classifiers to find the best combination of dimensions, kernel size, and filtering to detect the hotspots.

Forty-one young students participated the experiment. For each trial, a total of 33 gait features were extracted, of which 11 were derived from the entire walking trial and 22 were computed for each stride cycle. Statistics analysis showed that 7 out of 11 features extracted from each trial were significantly different across the five environments. The obtained results suggested that different environments have various impacts on gait features extracted from accelerometer data. To further access the impact, a multi-layer perceptrons based hierarchical classification approach was proposed to discriminate stride cycles taken from different walking environments.

This technique is independent of driving capabilities of vehicle and provides simple directional instructions for navigation. Using this method, an autonomous driving vehicle can be made to learn to navigate between locations in a known region.

We address the problem of learning the weights which characterize the structure and the performance of the standard Weighted Stego-image (WS) detector. In this paper we propose a new Hybrid Weighted Stego-detection (HWS) algorithm. We assume that the WS weights are related to the image pixels variance through an unknown function which is decomposed onto a set of known basis functions. This yields a linear detector which consists of a linear combination of parametric features derived from the structure of the standard WS detector. The coefficients of the linear combination are learnt by minimizing calibrated losses using stochastic gradient descent or a more efficient stochastic Newton descent approach. Thus, the HWS algorithm benefits from two fundamental advantages: the posterior probability of detection is well estimated and the numerical complexity of the algorithm is linear with the number of samples and the dimension of the features. The benchmark on real images shows that HWS method outperforms standard WS baseline method.","1522-4880;15224880","Electronic:978-1-4799-5751-4; POD:978-1-4799-5752-1","10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025853","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7025853","Machine learning;Natural images;Statistical detection;Steganalysis;Stochastic descent algorithm","Detectors;Error analysis;Media;Security;Standards;Support vector machines;Vectors","Newton method;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;steganography;stochastic processes","HWS algorithm;LSB replacement mechanism;hidden bits;hidden information detection;hybrid weighted-stego detection;image pixels variance;image steganalysis;least significant bit replacement mechanism;linear combination;linear detector;machine learning;natural images;numerical complexity;parametric features;posterior probability;standard WS baseline method;stochastic Newton descent approach;stochastic gradient descent approach","","0","","22","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As the HPC systems move towards exascale, the storage space and time costs of check pointing threaten to overwhelm not only the simulation but also the post-simulation data analysis. One common practice to address this problem is to apply compression algorithms to reduce the data size. However, traditional lossless compression techniques that look for repeated patterns are ineffective for scientific data in which high-precision data is used and hence common patterns are rare to find. This paper exploits the fact that in many scientific applications, the relative changes in data values from one simulation iteration to the next are not very significantly different from each other. Thus, capturing the distribution of relative changes in data instead of storing the data itself allows us to incorporate the temporal dimension of the data and learn the evolving distribution of the changes. We show that an order of magnitude data reduction becomes achievable within guaranteed user-defined error bounds for each data point. We propose NUMARCK, North western University Machine learning Algorithm for Resiliency and Check pointing, that makes use of the emerging distributions of data changes between consecutive simulation iterations and encodes them into an indexing space that can be concisely represented. We evaluate NUMARCK using two production scientific simulations, FLASH and CMIP5, and demonstrate a superior performance in terms of compression ratio and compression accuracy. More importantly, our algorithm allows users to specify the maximum tolerable error on a per point basis, while compressing the data by an order of magnitude.","2167-4329;21674329","Electronic:978-1-4799-5500-8; POD:978-1-4799-5501-5","10.1109/SC.2014.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013047","","Approximation algorithms;Approximation methods;Checkpointing;Computational modeling;Data models;Error analysis;Machine learning algorithms","checkpointing;data analysis;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);parallel processing;software fault tolerance","HPC system;NUMARCK;Northwestern University machine learning algorithm for resiliency and check pointing;data analysis;fault tolerance technique;high performance computing;simulation iteration","","3","","26","","","16-21 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A conventional hearing screening test's applicability is limited as it requires a feedback response from the subject under test. To overcome such problems, the primary focus of this study is to develop an intelligent hearing ability level assessment system using auditory evoked potential signals (AEP). AEP signal is a non-invasive tool that can reflect the stimulated interactions with neurons along the stations of the auditory pathway. The AEP responses of fourteen normal hearing subjects to auditory stimuli (20 dB, 30 dB, 40 dB, 50 dB and 60 dB) were derived from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Higuchi's fractal method is applied to extract the fractal features from the recorded AEP signals. The extracted fractal features were then associated to different hearing perception levels of the subjects. Feed-forward and feedback neural networks are employed to distinguish the different hearing perception levels. The performance of the proposed intelligent hearing ability level assessment found to exceed 85% accuracy. This study indicates that AEP responses to the auditory stimuli to the normal hearing persons can predict the higher order auditory stimuli followed by the lower order auditory stimuli and consequently the state of auditory development of subjects.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4084-4; POD:978-1-4799-4083-7","10.1109/IECBES.2014.7047661","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047661","EEG;auditory evoked potential;feed forward network;feedback network;hearing perception level","Accuracy;Auditory system;Biological neural networks;Ear;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Fractals","associative processing;auditory evoked potentials;electroencephalography;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;fractals;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal processing;neurophysiology;paediatrics;recurrent neural nets;signal classification","AEP response;AEP signal recording;EEG recording;Higuchi fractal method;auditory development state;auditory evoked potential signal;auditory loss;auditory pathway;conventional hearing screening test applicability;electroencephalogram recording;feedback neural network;feedback response;feedforward neural network;fractal feature association;fractal feature extraction;hearing perception level;higher order auditory stimuli;infant disability;intelligent hearing ability level assessment system;lower order auditory stimuli;machine learning approach;newborn disability;noninvasive tool;stimulated neuron interaction","","0","","26","","","8-10 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

How to effectively incorporate new annotated data into the learning step is crucial for enhancing the performance of a bioinformatics prediction model. Although machine-learning-based methods have been extensively used for dealing with various biological problems, existing approaches usually train static prediction models based on fixed training datasets. The static approaches are found having several disadvantages such as low scalability and impractical when training dataset is huge. In view of this, we propose a dynamic learning framework for constructing query-driven prediction models. The key difference between the proposed framework and the existing approaches is that the training set for the machine learning algorithm of the proposed framework is dynamically generated according to the query input, as opposed to training a general model regardless of queries in traditional static methods. Accordingly, a query-driven predictor based on the smaller set of data specifically selected from the entire annotated base dataset will be applied on the query. The new way for constructing the dynamic model enables us capable of updating the annotated base dataset flexibly and using the most relevant core subset as the training set makes the constructed model having better generalization ability on the query, showing “part could be better than all” phenomenon. According to the new framework, we have implemented a dynamic protein-ligand binding sites predictor called OSML (On-site model for ligand binding sites prediction). Computer experiments on 10 different ligand types of three hierarchically organized levels show that OSML outperforms most existing predictors. The results indicate that the current dynamic framework is a promising future direction for bridging the gap between the rapidly accumulated annotated biological data and the effective mach- ne-learning-based predictors.

As for aerospace computer, a common challenge is the Single Event Upset (SEU) effect, which would change the state of some information bits stochastically and lead to error results. Due to the time-consuming and data-intensive computation of aerospace computer, digital signal processing (DSP) is the most suitable for aerospace computation. In this paper, we first implement representative RBM learning algorithm in a power efficient DSP platform. Then, we explore the possible SEU effects in our hardware architecture and RBM learning algorithm. Further, we integrate three software fault detection techniques (i.e. duplication, increasing data diversity, shortening life cycle of variable) into RBM learning.

Compared with the current state of the art in image coding, such as JPEG, JPEG2000 or the new JPEG XR, the new Intra Frame coding performs a high compression process in the ""All-Intra"" mode. All these improvements are at expense of a high computational cost, making it considerably difficult to implement in real time.

We use a combination of support vector machines (SVMs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) with down sampling, a preprocessing step that is unbiased and suitable for real-time analysis and detection. We perform modified cross-validation experiments with 129 examples of Greenland GPR imagery from 2012, collected by a lightweight robot towing a GPR. In order to minimize false positives, an HMM classifier is trained to prescreen the data and mark locations in the GPR files to evaluate with an SVM, and we evaluate the classification results with a similar modified cross-validation technique. The combined HMM-SVM method retains all of the correct classifications by the SVM, and reduces the false positive rate to 0.0007. This method also reduces the computational burden in classifying GPR traces because the SVM is evaluated only on select prescreened traces. Our experiments demonstrate the promise, robustness, and reliability of real-time crevasse detection and classification with robotic GPR surveys.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2332872","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6858016","Geophysical signal processing;ground penetrating radar (GPR);robotic sensing systems","Ground penetrating radar;Hidden Markov models;Ice;Machine learning;Real-time systems;Snow;Support vector machines","geophysical image processing;glaciology;ground penetrating radar;hidden Markov models;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);remote sensing by radar;support vector machines","AD 2012;GPR images;Greenland GPR imagery;crevasse detection;down sampling;ground penetrating radar;hidden Markov models;ice sheets;machine learning;modified cross validation technique;support vector machines","","1","","27","","20140717","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Machine learning methods can be used to create more effective antimalware software, capable of detecting even zero-day attacks. Some studies have investigated the plausibility of applying machine learning to malware detection, primarily using features from n-grams of an executables file's byte code. We propose an approach that primarily learns from metadata, mostly contained in the headers of executable files, specifically the Windows Portable Executable 32-bit (PE32) file format. Our experiments indicate that executable file metadata is highly discriminative between malware and benign software. We also employ various machine learning methods, finding that Decision Tree classifiers outperform Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes in this setting. We analyze various features of the PE32 header and identify those most suitable for machine learning classifiers. Finally, we evaluate changes in classifier performance when the malware prevalence (fraction of malware versus benign software) is varied.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6070-5; POD:978-1-4799-6071-2","10.1109/WATeR.2014.7015757","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015757","","Databases;Decision trees;Feature extraction;Logistics;Malware;Software;Training","decision trees;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis","Windows Portable Executable file format;antimalware software;decision tree classifiers;logistic regression;machine learning classifier;malicious software threat;malware detection;malware prevalence;meta data;naive Bayes;signature-based antivirus software;zero-day attacks","","6","","12","","","23-23 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As fish liver is a good bioindicator for detecting water chemical pollution, the proposed approach utilizes fish liver microscopic images in order to detect water pollution. The proposed approach consists of three phases; namely pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification phases. Since color and texture are the most important characteristics of microscopic fish liver images, the proposed system uses colored histogram and Gabor wavelet transform for classifying water quality degree. Also, it implemented Principal Components Analysis (PCA) along with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms for feature extraction and water quality degree classification, respectively. Collected datasets contain colored JPEG images of 125 images as training dataset and 45 images as testing dataset, respectively. Training dataset is divided into 4 classes representing the different histopathlogical changes and their corresponding water quality degrees. Experimental results showed that the proposed classification approach has obtained water quality classification accuracy of 93.3%, using SVMs linear kernel function with 37 images per class for training.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6594-6; POD:978-1-4799-6595-3","10.1109/ICCES.2014.7030968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7030968","classification;features extraction;fish liver;histopathology;microscopic images;principal component analysis (PCA);support vector machines (SVMs);water pollution","Biomedical imaging;Chemicals;Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Pipeline processing;Recurrent neural networks;Water pollution","environmental science computing;feature extraction;image classification;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;water pollution control;wavelet transforms","Gabor wavelet transform;SVM algorithm;bioindicator;colored JPEG images;feature extraction;fish liver histopathology;fish liver microscopic image analysis;image color;image texture;linear kernel function;machine learning;support vector machine algorithm;water chemical pollution detection;water quality degree classification","","1","","30","","","22-23 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It has been widely used in scenarios such as e-commerce, friend recommendation and trust-based access control system. Several trust computing methods have been proposed from different perspectives, however, most of them just quantify certain trust related factors and integrate them into a trust value by setting a weight for each factor. On the one hand, the weight is difficult to select since the influence that each factor has on trust is uncertain. On the other hand, the trust values generated by these methods might not be in accordance with users' subjective judgements and they are not straightforward for users to understand. It is necessary for a trust evaluation method to provide accurate and intuitive trust levels for the social network users. Therefore, in this paper, trust evaluation is formalized as a classification problem and a novel approach utilizing machine learning method is presented. Firstly, the trust feature vector is constructed according to the trust related factors. Then by training with collected sample data which contains trust feature vectors and trust ratings, a trust classifier can be established. Based on this approach, a general trust evaluation framework is proposed for network-level trust evaluation. The experiments in real social networks verify the feasibility of our framework and show that the trained trust classifier has a relatively high predicting accuracy.","2324-898X;2324898X","Electronic:978-1-4799-6513-7; POD:978-1-4799-6514-4","10.1109/TrustCom.2014.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7011235","Machine Learning;Online Social Networks;Trust Evaluation","Accuracy;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Social network services;Training;Training data;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online);trusted computing","classification problem;e-commerce;friend recommendation system;machine learning based trust evaluation framework;machine learning method;network-level trust evaluation;online social networks;social computing;social network users;trust computing methods;trust evaluation method;trust feature vector;trust related factors;trust-based access control system","","4","","14","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents an approach that uses timed hybrid automata of the machines normal behavior for a predictive maintenance of industrial plants. This hybrid model reduces discrete and continuous signals (e.g. energy data) to individual states, which refer to either the present condition of the machines.

They can be private to a retailer/concern or publicly used by a number of retailers. Whenever the user queries these databases using keywords, most of the times the user will be deviated by the search results returned. The reason is no relevance exists between the keyword and SRs (Search Results). A typical web page returned from a WDB has multiple Search Result Records (SRRs). An easier way is to group the similar SRRs into one cluster in such a way the user can be more focused on his demand. The key concept of this paper is XML technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel system called CSR (Clustering Search Results) which extracts the data from the XML database and clusters them based on the similarity and finally assigns meaningful label for it.

One of the most prevalent network attacks that can threaten computers connected to the network is brute force attack. In this work we investigate the use of machine learners for detecting brute force attacks (on the SSH protocol) at the network level. We base our approach on applying machine learning algorithms on a newly generated dataset based upon network flow data collected at the network level. Applying detection at the network level makes the detection approach more scalable. It also provides protection for the hosts who do not have their own protection. The new dataset consists of real-world network data collected from a production network. We use four different classifiers to build brute force attack detection models. The use of different classifiers facilitates a relatively comprehensive study on the effectiveness of machine learners in the detection of brute force attack on the SSH protocol at the network level. Empirical results show that the machine learners were quite successful in detecting the brute force attacks with a high detection rate and low false alarms. We also investigate the effectiveness of using ports as features during the learning process. We provide a detailed analysis of how the models built can change as a result of including or excluding port features.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-7502-0; POD:978-1-4799-7503-7","10.1109/BIBE.2014.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033609","Brute force attack;machine learning;network flow;network-level attack detection","Data models;Feature extraction;Force;Internet;Ports (Computers);Protocols","Internet;bioinformatics;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols","Internet usage;SSH protocol;brute force attacks;computer network;machine learning;network level;network security;production network","","2","","16","","","10-12 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Effective methods for assessment and early prediction of learning effectiveness in SE teamwork are not only a critical part of teaching but also of value in industrial training and project management. This paper presents a novel analytical approach to the assessment and, most importantly, the prediction of learning outcomes in SE teamwork based on data from our joint software engineering class concurrently taught at San Francisco State University (SFSU), Florida Atlantic University (FAU) and Fulda University, Germany (Fulda). Our approach focuses on assessment and prediction of SE teamwork in terms of ability of student teams to apply best SE processes and develop SE products. It differs from existing work in the following aspects: a) it develops and uses only objective and quantitative measures of team activity from multiple sources, such as statistics of student time use, software engineering tool use, and instructor observations; b) it leverages powerful machine learning (ML) techniques applied to team activity measurements to identify quantitative and objective factors which can assess and predict learning of software engineering teamwork skills at the team level. In this paper we provide the following contributions: a) we present in detail for the first time the full team activity measurement data set we developed, consisting of over 40 objective and quantitative measures extracted from student teams working on class projects; b) we present a ML framework which applies the Random Forest (RF) algorithm to the team activity measurements and team outcomes, focusing on predicting teams that are likely to fail; c) we describe in detail our now fully implemented and operational data processing pipeline, consisting of data collection methods from multiple sources, ML train- ng database creation, and ML analysis subsystems; and finally d) we present very preliminary results of ML analysis results based on the data from our joint software engineering classes in Fall 2012, and Spring 2013, with the data from 17 student teams.

Hierarchical DSA networks aim at allowing secondary users to efficiently utilize licensed spectrum, while still protecting primary users and ensuring them first priority to spectrum access. However, these networks are often multi-tiered and the concept of different operating policies for secondary users has arisen. In this study we consider the idea of two operating modes in a stochastically modeled DSA network. Observations from the radio frequency (RF) environment are classified using self organizing maps (SOMs). The discretized observations are then utilized to develop hidden Markov models (HMMs) of each type of radio. These models are developed for a variable number of map sizes and hidden states then sequence matched against unknown radios in order to determine identification performance. The system is shown to perform extremely well for certain combinations of SOM sizes and HMM states.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3512-3; POD:978-1-4799-3513-0; USB:978-1-4799-3511-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2014.7036946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7036946","Cognitive Radio;Dynamic Spectrum Access;Machine Learning","Cognitive radio;Hidden Markov models;Neurons;Radio frequency;Sensors;Training;Vectors","frequency allocation;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;telecommunication computing","DSA network;HMM;SOM;dynamic spectrum access radio identification;hidden Markov models;licensed spectrum;machine learning;primary users;radiofrequency environment;secondary users;self organizing maps;spectral crowding;static frequency allocation;two operating modes","","1","","11","","","8-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many applications do not need the high precision that is being used today. In particular, large gains in area and power efficiency could be achieved by dedicated analog realizations of approximate computing engines. In this work we explore the use of memristor networks for analog approximate computation, based on a machine learning framework called reservoir computing. Most experimental investigations on the dynamics of memristors focus on their nonvolatile behavior. Hence, the volatility that is present in the developed technologies is usually unwanted and is not included in simulation models. In contrast, in reservoir computing, volatility is not only desirable but necessary. Therefore, in this work, we propose two different ways to incorporate it into memristor simulation models. The first is an extension of Strukov’s model, and the second is an equivalent Wiener model approximation. We analyze and compare the dynamical properties of these models and discuss their implications for the memory and the nonlinear processing capacity of memristor networks. Our results indicate that device variability, increasingly causing problems in traditional computer design, is an asset in the context of reservoir computing. We conclude that although both models could lead to useful memristor-based reservoir computing systems, their computational performance will differ. Therefore, experimental modeling research is required for the development of accurate volatile memristor models.</para>","0899-7667;08997667","","10.1162/NECO_a_00694","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7047945","","","","","","0","","","","","March 2015","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

Our proposed framework can take into account diverse individual and team features, and accommodate various cost or feature functions. We introduce a team quality metric based on a weighted linear combination of these features, the weights of which are learned using a machine learning approach by leveraging historical project outcomes. A combinatorial optimization algorithm is finally applied to search the possible solution space for the approximate best team.

Consequently, there is a demand for automating the scoring, which could significantly reduce the time, expense and cognitive resources spent in the process. Any algorithm that could achieve the above with a reasonable accuracy could assist in the development of intervention systems for reducing the potential for aggression, systems for recruitment processes and even training personnel for improving group disparity in the corporate world.

The method consists of two main processes including the building of the shape and appearance models and support vector machine (SVM) classifier, and the segmentation of test image. In the former process, the shape (or appearance) model is built by extracting the mean shape (or appearance) and a number of modes of variation from training images, and a SVM is trained to classify an image into object pixels or non-object pixels. In the latter process, the predicted object contour (represented with discrete landmarks) starts from the average shape, evolves to a new position as the result of the maximization of the probability of the profile of the landmark being centered at object contour and the minimization of the Mahalanobis distance between a new profile and the profile appearance model, and finally is fitted to the shape model. The method is novel in that the probability of the profile of the landmark being centered at object contour, accurately calculated by SVM classifier, is used in evolving the contour, giving better segmentation result than the original active shape and appearance models where Mahalanobis distance only was used. Experiments of applying the method to segment liver in computed tomography (CT) images were conducted with promising results.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-3901-5; Electronic:978-1-4799-3903-9; POD:978-1-4799-3904-6","10.1109/ICALIP.2014.7009813","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7009813","active appearance model;active shape model;segmentation;support vector machine","Active shape model;Computed tomography;Image segmentation;Liver;Shape;Support vector machines;Training","image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;pattern classification;shape recognition;support vector machines","CT;Mahalanobis distance minimization;SVM;accurate object segmentation;appearance features;appearance models;average shape;computed tomography images;nonobject pixels;novel active shape models;object contour;object pixels;profile probability maximization;shape landmarks;support vector machine classifier;support vector machine learning;training images","","3","","16","","","7-9 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of Extreme Learning Machines - the Annular ELM, with RANSAC multi model response regularization for pruning large number of hidden nodes to acquire better optimality, generalization and classification accuracy. Experimental evaluation of the proposed ELM formulation on different benchmark datasets showed that the algorithm optimally prunes the hidden nodes, with better generalization and higher classification accuracy as compared to other algorithms, including the well-known SVM, OP-ELM for binary and multi-class classification and regression problems. Also, we extended the proposed algorithm to a more complex application context involving MRI Brain Image classification.

"Automatic UAV Forced Landing Site Detection Using Machine Learning","X. Guo; S. Denman; C. Fookes; L. Mejias; S.

However, the lack of an automated UAV forced landing site detection system has been identified as one of the main impediments to allow UAV flight over populated areas in civilian airspace. This article proposes a UAV forced landing site detection system that is based on machine learning approaches including the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Support Vector Machine. A range of learning parameters are analysed including the number of Guassian mixtures, support vector kernels including linear, radial basis function Kernel (RBF) and polynormial kernel (poly), and the order of RBF kernel and polynormial kernel. Moreover, a modified footprint operator is employed during feature extraction to better describe the geometric characteristics of the local area surrounding a pixel. The performance of the presented system is compared to a baseline UAV forced landing site detection system which uses edge features and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) region type classifier. Experiments conducted on aerial image datasets captured over typical urban environments reveal improved landing site detection can be achieved with an SVM classifier with an RBF kernel using a combination of colour and texture features. Compared to the baseline system, the proposed system provides significant improvement in term of the chance to detect a safe landing area, and the performance is more stable than the baseline in the presence of changes to the UAV altitude.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5409-4; POD:978-1-4799-5410-0","10.1109/DICTA.2014.7008097","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008097","","Feature extraction;Gray-scale;Image segmentation;Kernel;Polynomials;Q-factor;Support vector machines","Gaussian processes;autonomous aerial vehicles;feature extraction;image colour analysis;image processing;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;neural nets;support vector machines","ANN region type classifier;Gaussian mixture model;RBF kernel;UAV altitude;UAV flight;aerial image datasets;aerial image processing commercialization;artificial neural network region type classifier;automated UAV forced landing site detection system;automatic UAV forced landing site detection;civilian airspace;colour features;feature extraction;geometric characteristics;machine learning;machine learning approaches;modified footprint operator;polynormial kernel;radial basis function kernel;support vector kernels;support vector machine;texture features;unmanned aerial vehicles","","1","","22","","","25-27 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
