Map Reduce performance analysis and modeling is needed to guide performance optimization and job scheduling. However, we observed that it is difficult to build a performance model due to various aspects of workload behavior and heterogeneity among cluster nodes in heterogeneous Map Reduce Environments. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel performance prediction model for Map Reduce in heterogeneous environments. This model consists of two components: (1) performance prediction model based on machine learning and (2) optimal parameters selection based on immune algorithm. Experiment results show that our model can accurately forecast the performance of Map Reduce jobs that run in heterogeneous Map Reduce systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6239-6; POD:978-1-4799-6240-2","10.1109/CIT.2014.122","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984660","Heterogeneity;MapReduce;cloud computing;machine learning;performance prediction","Analytical models;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Load modeling;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Vectors","cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;parallel processing;scheduling","MapReduce modeling;MapReduce performance analysis;cloud computing;cluster nodes;computing model;heterogeneous MapReduce environment;heterogeneous environment;immune algorithm;job scheduling;machine learning;optimal parameters selection;parallel processing;performance optimization;performance prediction model;workload behavior","","0","","20","","","11-13 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considering the trade-off among accuracy and speed, our system is based on a modular architecture and combination of some expert's opinions. Moreover we extract the best features for each application group in order to achieve an accurate system. Experimental results indicates that our proposed system has accuracy comparable to more sophisticated system and its learning cost is 10 times less than these systems. In addition we can customize our proposed system according to the needs and goals of network administrator. Our system is robust and adaptable to network changes such as the appearance of new applications. In such a case, our system labels new flow as “unknown” instead of misclassifying.

Currently, many of applied machine learning techniques in data mining aim to utilize online feedbacks by making model updates faster and quicker. However, Mahout and Massive Online Analysis (MOA) existing solutions are not supported for streaming machine learning, and consequently, not suitable for scalable multiple machines. In this paper enhanced the machine learning algorithms for extracting the words and generating topic models based on the continuing data which was initially proposed. One of the great advantages of the proposed algorithm was the capability to be scaled into multiple machines, in which made it very suitable for real-time processing of streaming data. In general, the algorithm includes two main methods: (a) the first method introduces a principle approach to pre-process documents in an associated time sequence. It implements a class to detect identical files from input files so as to reduce computation time. (b) The second method suits real time monitoring and control of the process from multiple asynchronous text streams. In the experiment, these two methods were alternatively executed, and subsequently after iterations a monotonic convergence was guaranteed. The study conducts the experiments based on a real-world dataset collected from TREC KBA Stream Corpus in 2012. Finally, the accuracy of the proposed method resulted in greater robustness towards the ability to deal with noise and reduce the computation.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4963-2; POD:978-1-4799-4962-5","10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978204","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6978204","Big Data;Data Streaming;Machine Learning;Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis (SAMOA)","Analytical models;Computer architecture;Data mining;Data models;Distributed databases;Machine learning algorithms;Real-time systems","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence)","MOA;automatic extraction;big data streams;data mining;data patterns;machine learning algorithms;machine learning streaming;machine learning techniques;massive online analysis;real-time processing;scalable advanced analysis;topic models;word extraction","","3","","27","","","July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conventional image processing system using machine learning is not able to learn and then recognize these new objects. In this paper, an incremental learning based image processing system is presented. The overall system consists of three layers: execution, learning and user. The conventional image processing system is constructed in execution layer. In learning layer, adviser and incremental learning are applied to generate a new classifier. The incremental learning is differentiated into different methodologies: data accumulation and ensemble learning. Through the adviser, a proper methodology can be recommended.

However, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the increase of the number of fungicides combined and their concentrations. It is thus extremely challenging to identify effective fungicide combinations by trial and error from all possible combinations. In this paper, a systematic approach based on a support vector machine, a machine learning algorithm, is proposed to searching for the optimal combinations using only a limited number of measurements. The constructed model also incorporates information related to the inhibition rate (IR) and the cost of each composing fungicide into the optimization process. With this method, we show that only around 130 measurements on a coarse grid of concentrations out of thousands of possible experiments are sufficient to reconstruct the response model and to obtain the optimal fungicide combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized combinations can achieve an IR greater than 90%, while the required concentrations and the cost of individual fungicides are dramatically reduced. We anticipate that this method should be equally effective in the search for optimal combinations of multiple compounds in other diseases.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2014.2339295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6858065","Bipolaris maydis;data-driven model;fungicide combination;machine learning algorithm;systematic approach","Data models;Mathematical model;Optimization;Pathogens;Predictive models;Support vector machines","biochemistry;biomedical measurement;cellular biophysics;chemical variables measurement;diseases;microorganisms;support vector machines","Bipolaris maydis;chemical fungicide;concentration measurements;diseases;inhibition rate;machine learning algorithm;maize fungal pathogen;southern corn leaf blight;support vector machine;systematic quantitative approach","0","3","","31","","20140717","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Because of PV's nonlinear characteristics, a variety of faults may be difficult to detect by conventional protection devices, leading to safety issues and fire hazards in PV fields. To fill this protection gap, machine learning techniques have been proposed for fault detection based on measurements, such as PV array voltage, current, irradiance, and temperature. However, existing solutions usually use supervised learning models, which are trained by numerous labeled data (known as fault types) and therefore, have drawbacks: 1) the labeled PV data are difficult or expensive to obtain, 2) the trained model is not easy to update, and 3) the model is difficult to visualize. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a graph-based semi-supervised learning model only using a few labeled training data that are normalized for better visualization. The proposed model not only detects the fault, but also further identifies the possible fault type in order to expedite system recovery. Once the model is built, it can learn PV systems autonomously over time as weather changes. Both simulation and experimental results show the effective fault detection and classification of the proposed method.","0885-8993;08858993","","10.1109/TPEL.2014.2364203","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6933939","Fault classification;fault detection;machine learning;semi-supervised learning;solar photovoltaic (PV) system","Arrays;Circuit faults;Data models;Data visualization;Fault detection;Inverters;Semisupervised learning","fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;solar cell arrays","PV array current;PV array voltage;PV fields;PV nonlinear characteristics;PV system reliability;PV system safety;fault classification;fault detection;fire hazards;graph-based semisupervised learning;machine learning techniques;protection gap;safety issues;solar photovoltaic arrays;system recovery","","9","","31","","20141022","May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus it's hard to set a global consistent application-layer management policy for the whole network. The idea of separating the control plane and the data plane comes up with Software Defined Network have opened a gate for solving this problem. In the SDN paradigm, the control plane have a global view over the whole network, thus it can do application-layer classification and set policies globally. In this paper, we identify problems with the current application-layer classification in campus network and analyze the advantage of doing application-layer classification with SDN.

The database is a publicly available resource that aims to support research on advanced myoelectric hand prostheses.

Besides describing the acquisition protocol, overall features of the datasets and the processing procedures in detail, we present benchmark classification results using a variety of feature representations and classifiers. Our comparison shows that simple feature representations such as mean absolute value and waveform length can achieve similar performance to the computationally more demanding marginal discrete wavelet transform. With respect to classification methods, the nonlinear support vector machine was found to be the only method consistently achieving high performance regardless of the type of feature representation. Furthermore, statistical analysis of these results shows that classification accuracy is negatively correlated with the subject's Body Mass Index. The analysis and the results described in this paper aim to be a strong baseline for the Ninapro database.

By investigating hierarchical topics and their correlations with respect to the lexical co-occurrences of words, the proposed contextual topic model can determine the relevance of sentences more effectively, and recognize latent topics and arrange them hierarchically as well.

The working hypothesis was that the more complex the needed grammatical processing needed, the more difficult it should be to perform the classification at the level of temporal and spatial resolution given by an fMRI signal. We were able to accomplish the first task completely. The second and third task did not succeed when all the data is used simultaneously. However, the third task was successful when training and testing was done within a continuous scanning run. (The experimental protocol did not allow this for the second task.) This does establish that complex linguistic information is decodable from fMRI scans.

A database with keystroke dynamics patterns has been analysed.

Features as pressure, finger size, times, linear an angular acceleration are extracted and processed. Supervised classification methods are widely used in different kind of biometrics. A discussion about their use in keystroke biometrics is presented. A preprocessing of the acquired data is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and a reduction of the amount of information applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA).

The framework is used to transfer knowledge from a source domain to a target one by reusing as much information from the source domain. This way, the efforts of training activity models for new users in the target domain can be effectively reduced. This paper presents one instantiation of the framework and its implementation details.

Body movements occurring when a subject performs activities of daily living (ADLs) are also major causes of high false alarm rates. This paper presents a hybrid framework for false alarm reduction in continuous cardiac monitoring, where classification models constructed using machine learning algorithms are used for labeling input signals and a rule-based expert system is used for combining the classification results into make a final decision. From their extracted low-level features, ECG signal portions are labeled with heartbeat types and also signal quality levels. Meanwhile, low-level features from 3D acceleration signals are used for predicting types of activities. Taking signal quality levels and activity types into considerations, the rule-based expert system then determines whether abnormal ECG portions should trigger alarms or should be ignored. The proposed framework is validated using two datasets: one is obtained from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database and the other is acquired from 10 subjects while they are performing ADLs. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework can reduce false alarm rates in continuous cardiac monitoring and potentially assist physicians in diagnosing a vast amount of data acquired from wireless sensors.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-4963-2; POD:978-1-4799-4962-5","10.1109/ICSEC.2014.6978218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6978218","Arrhythmia classification;activity classification;body sensor network;machine learning;rule-based expert system;signal quality classification","Computer science;Conferences","biomedical equipment;body sensor networks;data acquisition;electrocardiography;feature extraction;gait analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal detection;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;signal classification","3D acceleration signals;ADL;ECG signal portions;MIT-BIH arrhythmia database;body movements;continuous cardiac monitoring;daily living activity;data acquisition;false alarm reduction;heartbeat;high false alarm rates;low-battery power factors;low-level feature extraction;machine learning algorithms;network transmission problems;noise factors;patient diagnosis;signal classification models;signal quality;wireless BSN;wireless body sensor networks","","0","","15","","","July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Often times, the distributed monitoring systems are not capable of detecting a problem well in advance when a large-scale Hadoop cluster starts to deteriorate i n performance or becomes unavailable. Thus, inc o m i n g workloads, scheduled between the time when cluster starts to deteriorate and the time when the problem is identified, suffer from longer execution times. As a result, both reliability and throughput of the cluster reduce significantly. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a system called Astro, which consists of a predictive model and an extension to the Hadoop scheduler. The predictive model in Astro takes into account a rich set of cluster behavioral information that are collected by monitoring processes and model them using machine learning algorithms to predict future behavior of the cluster. The Astro predictive model detects anomalies in the cluster and also identifies a ranked set of metrics that have contributed the most towards the problem. The Astro scheduler uses the prediction outcome and the list of metrics to decide whether it needs to move and reduce workloads from the problematic cluster nodes or to prevent additional workload allocations to them, in order to improve both throughput and reliability of the cluster. The results demonstrate that the Astro scheduler improves usage of cluster compute resources significantly by 64.23% compared to traditional Hadoop. Furthermore, the runtime of the benchmark application reduced by 26.68% during the time of anomaly, thus improving the cluster throughput.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5666-1; POD:978-1-4799-5667-8","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004315","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004315","Hadoop;anomaly;cluster;distributed systems;machine learning;predictive model;scheduler;self-remediation","Data models;Hidden Markov models;Measurement;Monitoring;Predictive models;Training;Yarn","distributed processing;pattern clustering;scheduling","Astro scheduler;Hadoop;anomaly detection;cluster behavioral information;distributed systems;feedback-based scheduling;predictive model","","1","","33","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this research area still suffers from resource scarcity. A POS tagged corpus is a cardinal element for language processing. POS tagging is the process of categorizing a particular word to a particular part of speech or syntactic category. In Bangla, we do not have any large POS tagged dictionary. In this paper we develop an automated way to make a POS tagged dictionary of Noun, Verb and Adjective. Initially, a suffix (or postfix) list is created manually for Bangla language. Based on this suffix list the POS tagged dictionary is developed. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using a paragraph consisting of manually tagged 10,000 words with 11 tags.

We point out that the obtained solution corresponds to a single point on the Pareto Front (PF) of a multiobjective optimization problem, which considers the concurrent optimization of all task objectives involved in the Multitask Learning (MTL) problem. Motivated by this last observation and arguing that the former approach is heuristic, we propose a novel support vector machine MT-MKL framework that considers an implicitly defined set of conic combinations of task objectives. We show that solving our framework produces solutions along a path on the aforementioned PF and that it subsumes the optimization of the average of objective functions as a special case. Using the algorithms we derived, we demonstrate through a series of experimental results that the framework is capable of achieving a better classification performance, when compared with other similar MTL approaches.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2309939","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6775340","Machine learning;optimization methods;pattern recognition;supervised learning;support vector machines (SVM);support vector machines (SVM).","Information management;Kernel;Linear programming;Minimization;Optimization;Support vector machines;Vectors","Pareto optimisation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","MT-MKL method;MTL problem;PF;Pareto front;Pareto-path multitask multiple kernel learning;concurrent optimization;information sharing;multiobjective optimization problem;partially shared kernel function;support vector machine MT-MKL framework","","1","","36","","20140319","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Manual analysis using existing 3-D tools is unable to keep up with vastly increased 4-D data volume, automated processing and analysis are thus needed to process 4DCT data effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we applied ideas and algorithms from image/signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning to 4DCT lung data so that lungs can be reliably segmented in a fully automated manner, lung features can be visualized and measured on the fly via user interactions, and data quality classifications can be computed in a robust manner. Comparisons of our results with an established treatment planning system and calculation by experts demonstrated negligible discrepancies (within ±2%) for volume assessment but one to two orders of magnitude performance enhancement. An empirical Fourier-analysis-based quality measure-delivered performances closely emulating human experts. Three machine learners are inspected to justify the viability of machine learning techniques used to robustly identify data quality of 4DCT images in the scalable manner.

We present an approach that enables efficient representations based on sparsity to be utilized throughout a signal processing system, with the aim of reducing the energy and/or resources required for computation, communication, and storage. The representation we focus on is compressive sensing. Its benefit is that compression is achieved with minimal computational cost through the use of random projections; however, a key drawback is that reconstruction is expensive. We focus on inference frameworks for signal analysis. We show that reconstruction can be avoided entirely by transforming signal processing operations (e.g., wavelet transforms, finite impulse response filters, etc.) such that they can be applied directly to the compressed representations. We present a methodology and a mathematical framework that achieve this goal and also enable significant computational-energy savings through operations over fewer input samples. This enables explicit energy-versus-accuracy tradeoffs that are under the control of the designer. We demonstrate the approach through two case studies. First, we consider a system for neural prosthesis that extracts wavelet features directly from compressively sensed spikes. Through simulations, we show that spike sorting can be achieved with 54× fewer samples, providing an accuracy of 98.63% in spike count, 98.56% in firing-rate estimation, and 96.51% in determining the coefficient of variation; this compares with a baseline Nyquist-domain detector with corresponding performance of 98.97%, 99.69%, and 97.09%, respectively. Second, we consider a system for detecting epileptic seizures by extracting spectral-energy features directly from compressively sensed electroencephalogram. Through simulations of the end-to-end algorithm, we show that detection can be achieved with 21× fewer samples, providing a sensitivity of 94.43%, f- lse alarm rate of 0.1543/h, and latency of 4.70 s; this compares with a baseline Nyquist-domain detector with corresponding performance of 96.03%, 0.1471/h, and 4.59 s, respectively.","1063-8210;10638210","","10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2301733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6742615","Compressed sensing;digital signal processing;linear systems;machine learning;seizure detection;seizure detection.;spike sorting","Accuracy;Compressed sensing;Feature extraction;Measurement;Sensors;Signal processing;Vectors","FIR filters;compressed sensing;electroencephalography;feature extraction;filtering theory;inference mechanisms;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;signal reconstruction;signal representation;wavelet transforms","compressive sensing;compressively sensed electroencephalogram;compressively sensed spikes;computational-energy savings;direct computations;end- to-end algorithm;energy reduction;energy-versus-accuracy tradeoffs;epileptic seizure detection;finite impulse response filters;firing-rate estimation;inference frameworks;mathematical framework;minimal computational cost;neural prosthesis;random projections;resource reduction;signal analysis;signal processing systems;sparsity;spectral-energy feature extraction;spike count;spike sorting;throughput utilization;variation coefficient determination;wavelet feature extraction;wavelet transforms","","9","","41","","20140217","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The aim of this paper is to offer a complementary study to previous works, focusing on the performance of different supervised classifiers, such as the Normal Bayesian Classifier, Neural Architectures or distance-based algorithms. In addition, we analyse all the proposed algorithms' efficiency over public face databases (ORL, FERET, NIST and the Face Recognition Data from the Essex University). Each one of these databases contains a different number of individuals and particular samples and they present variations among images from the same user (scale, pose, expression, illumination, ...). We expect to simulate many different situations which take place when dealing with face recognition on mobile phones. In order to get a complete comparison, all the proposed algorithms have been implemented and run over all the databases, using the same computer. Different parametrizations for each algorithm have also been tested. Bayesian classifiers and distance-based algorithms turn out to be the most suitable, as their parametrization is simple, the training stage is not as time consuming as others' and classification results are satisfying.","1071-6572;10716572","Electronic:978-1-4799-3532-1; POD:978-1-4799-3533-8; USB:978-1-4799-3531-4","10.1109/CCST.2014.6987036","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6987036","Biometrics;LDA;PCA;face recognition;machine learning;supervised classifiers","Databases;Face;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;NIST;Training;Vectors","Bayes methods;face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;neural net architecture","Essex University;FERET database;NIST database;ORL database;biometrics;computer recognition;correct identification rates;device features;device limitations;distance-based algorithm;face recognition data;human face recognition;image classification;mobile phones;neural architectures;normal Bayesian classifier;overall elapsed time;parametrization;portable devices;public face databases;supervised classifiers;training stage","","0","","20","","","13-16 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hierarchical Bayesian models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We propose a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters), corresponding to a second layer of hierarchy.

What makes these tasks hard is that often we do not have a natural representation with which to model the domain and use for choosing actions; we must learn about the domain’s properties while simultaneously performing the task. Learning a representation also involves trade-offs between modeling the data that we have seen previously and being able to make predictions about new data. This article explores learning representations of stochastic systems using Bayesian nonparametric statistics. Bayesian nonparametric methods allow the sophistication of a representation to scale gracefully with the complexity in the data. Our main contribution is a careful empirical evaluation of how representations learned using Bayesian nonparametric methods compare to other standard learning approaches, especially in support of planning and control. We show that the Bayesian aspects of the methods result in achieving state-of-the-art performance in decision making with relatively few samples, while the nonparametric aspects often result in fewer computations.

Many popular tensor decomposition approaches—such as the Tucker decomposition and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP)—amount to multi-linear factorization. They are insufficient to model (i) complex interactions between data entities, (ii) various data types (e.g., missing data and binary data), and (iii) noisy observations and outliers. To address these issues, we propose tensor-variate latent nonparametric Bayesian models for multiway data analysis. We name these models InfTucker. These new models essentially conduct Tucker decomposition in an infinite feature space. Unlike classical tensor decomposition models, our new approaches handle both continuous and binary data in a probabilistic framework. Unlike previous Bayesian models on matrices and tensors, our models are based on latent Gaussian or <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$t$ </tex-math></inline-formula> processes with nonlinear covariance functions. Moreover, on network data, our models reduce to nonparametric stochastic blockmodels and can be used to discover latent groups and predict missing interactions. To learn the models efficiently from data, we develop a variational inference technique and explore properties of the Kronecker product for computational efficiency. Compared with a classical variational implementation, this technique reduces both time and space complexities by several orders of magnitude. On real multiway and network data, our new models achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy than state-of-art tensor decomposition methods and blockmodels.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2013.201","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6629993","Algorithms for data and knowledge management;Gaussian process;Machine learning;Multiway analysis;network modeling;nonparametric Bayes;random graphs and exchangeable arrays;stochastic blockmodel;tensor/matrix factorization","Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Data models;Gaussian processes;Matrix decomposition;Noise;Tensile stress","","","","8","","40","","20131011","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With fast development of social networks, spamming problem emerged and became more complex in social network service. Spammers post feeds containing typical phrases of a trending topic and URLs that usually are uncorrelated with feeds content. These URLs will lead users to certain websites that usually are Taobao shop sites, so spammers can earn money. It is an urgent task to construct mechanisms to automaticly detect and stop spammers. Researches about this have been done. But because of the game between spammers and antispam systems, behavior parttens of spammers changes constantly. In this paper we present an adaptive framwork to detecting spammers dynamiclly by using incremental learning of machine learning algorithm. To access to the identification of spammers we analyze Weibo user behaviors systematically, and find different behavior parttens between spammers and legitimate users. To collect a large set of Weibo user samples, we apply for a high privilege developer account and devise an effective method using Weibo open platform. We collected a large dataset of Sina Weibo which includes 30 million users and 46 million feeds and 980 million links. By checking users' tweeting behaviors, we gathered training user samples including spammers and legitimate users manually.

The main purpose of a network forensics system is reconstructing evidences of network attacks. In order to reconstruct evidence, the network attack is firstly identified. Therefore, network attack detection solutions play an important role in network forensics. There are two main types of network attacks: network level and application level. Network level attack detection solutions focus on the information in the headers of network packets.

In this paper we deal with this problem as a classification problem based on reputation features of the target trustee. Reputation refers to the opinion that a third person (a witness) may have about the target trustee. Second and higher order reputation information comes from witnesses which have no direct contact with the trustee. The differences in the spread of relationships among users produce variable size reputation feature vectors, according to the relationships of each user. We propose probabilistic descriptors of the reputation information in order to reduce the feature vectors to the same size. In this paper we explore the prediction of Trust training some classifiers with reputation features extracted from first and second order relationships. We conclude that second order reputation features do not improve classification significatively.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-6914-2; POD:978-1-4799-6915-9; USB:978-1-4799-6913-5","10.1109/ENIC.2014.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6984891","Machine Learning;Probabilistic reputation features;Trust Prediction","Databases;Electronic publishing;Encyclopedias;Internet;Social network services;Vectors","security of data;social networking (online)","Wikipedia vote network;classification problem;feature vector reduction;high order reputation information;higher order reputation information;probabilistic descriptors;reputation feature extraction;second order reputation information;social network;trust prediction problem;trust training;trustee behavior;variable size reputation feature vectors","","0","","21","","","29-30 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a cardiovascular-patient classifier we developed to identify HCM patients using standard 10-seconds, 12-lead ECG signals. Patients are classified as having HCM if the majority of the heartbeats are recognized as HCM. Thus, the classifier's underlying task is to recognize individual heartbeats segmented from 12-lead ECG signals as HCM beats, where heartbeats from non-HCM cardiovascular patients are used as controls. We extracted 504 morphological and temporal features - both commonly used and newly-developed ones-from ECG signals for heartbeat classification. To assess classification performance, we trained and tested a random forest classifier and a support vector machine classifier using 5-fold cross validation. The patient-classification precision of both classifiers are close to 0.85. Recall (sensitivity) and specificity are approximately 0.90. We also conducted feature selection experiments by gradually removing the least informative features; the results show that a relatively small subset of 304 highly informative features can achieve performance measures comparable to that achieved by using the complete set of features.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5669-2; POD:978-1-4799-5670-8","10.1109/BIBM.2014.6999159","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6999159","Electrocardiogram;Feature selection;Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy;Machine learning methods;Patient classification","Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Heart beat;Sensitivity;Standards;Support vector machines","cardiovascular system;decision trees;diseases;electrocardiography;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical signal detection;medical signal processing;muscle;random processes;signal classification;support vector machines","12-lead ECG signal;5-fold cross validation;HCM beat;HCM heartbeat recognition;HCM patient classification precision;blood flow obstruction;cardiovascular-patient classifier;classification performance assessment;classifier testing;classifier training;complete feature set performance measure;early HCM patient detection;electrocardiogram;feature selection experiment;feature subset performance measure;heart electrical activity;hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patient identification;individual heartbeat classification;individual heartbeat recognition;individual heartbeat segmentation;morphological feature extraction;nonHCM cardiovascular patient heartbeat;partial heart muscle thickening;random forest classifier;standard 10-second ECG signal;support vector machine classifier;temporal feature extraction;time 10 s","","0","","22","","","2-5 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The OILA predicts the health parameters using a regression based approach with a feedback mechanism to reduce error. An alert is generated when an anomaly is seen in the health parameters, thus alerting the doctor to be cautious. The algorithm is compared with Kalman Filter for comparing the prediction capabilities of OILA with Kalman Filter.

On the one hand, the need for efficient Machine Learning algorithms and tools that scale on large datasets is continuously growing. On the other, parallel or distributed solutions have proven to conceal many pitfalls. The MapReduce programming model has quickly emerged as the de facto model for executing simple algorithmic tasks over huge volumes of data, since it is simple, highly abstract and efficient. However, due to its unidirectional communication model and the inherent lack of support for iterative execution, few Machine Learning algorithms can easily be implemented on MapReduce. In this paper, we present a classification rule discovery algorithm, namely RuleMR, which despite its iterative nature, can capitalize on MapReduce. In order to construct quality rules in less iterations, the algorithm exploits the distributed nature of MapReduce to explore only the promising areas in the search space. We conduct a series of experimental evaluations which indicate that the proposed approach not only scales well with respect to the size of the training dataset, but also, in many cases, the resulting model is comparable to many well known algorithms in matters of accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5666-1; POD:978-1-4799-5667-8","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004440","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004440","big data;classification;machine learning;mapreduce;rule induction","","data mining;pattern classification","MapReduce programming model;RuleMR;classification rule discovery algorithm;quality rules","","1","","31","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

MMT systems are subject to the same controls as those required for financial institutions, including the detection of Money Laundering (ML) - a source of concern for MMT service providers. In this paper we focus on an often practiced ML technique known as micro-structuring of funds or smurfing and introduce a new method for detection of fraud chains in MMT systems. Whereas classical detection methods are based on machine learning and data mining, this work builds on Predictive Security Analysis at Runtime (PSA@R), a model-based approach for event-driven process analysis.

Predictive analytics (using advanced machine learning) is particularly valuable in manufacturing, as it leads to production improvement with respect to the cost, quantity, quality and sustainability of manufactured products by anticipating changes to the manufacturing system states. Many small and medium manufacturers do not have the infrastructure, technical capability or financial means to take advantage of predictive analytics. A domain-specific language and framework for performing predictive analytics for manufacturing and production frameworks can counter this deficiency. In this paper, we survey some of the applications of predictive analytics in manufacturing and we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed.

A common scenario is to use the defects from prior releases to build the prediction model for the upcoming release, typically through a supervised learning method. As software development is a dynamic process, fault characteristics in subsequent releases may vary. Therefore, supplementing the defect information from prior releases with limited information about the defects from the current release detected early seems to offer intuitive and practical benefits. We propose active learning as a way to automate the development of models which improve the performance of defect prediction between successive releases. Our results show that the integration of active learning with uncertainty sampling consistently outperforms the corresponding supervised learning approach. We further improve the prediction performance with feature compression techniques, where feature selection or dimensionality reduction is applied to defect data prior to active learning. We observe that dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly multidimensional scaling with random forest similarity, work better than feature selection due to their ability to identify and combine essential information in data set features. We present the improvements offered by this methodology through the prediction of defective modules in the three successive versions of Eclipse.","1071-9458;10719458","Electronic:978-1-4799-6033-0; POD:978-1-4799-6034-7","10.1109/ISSRE.2014.35","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982637","Active learning;Complexity measures;Dimensionality reduction;Machine learning;Software defect prediction","Computational modeling;Measurement;Predictive models;Radio frequency;Software;Supervised learning;Uncertainty","configuration management;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);program verification;software fault tolerance;uncertainty handling","Eclipse;active learning;data set features;defect information;defect prediction;defect prone modules;defective modules;defects detection;dimensionality reduction;fault characteristics;feature compression techniques;feature selection;multidimensional scaling;prediction model;random forest similarity;software development;software versions;supervised learning method;uncertainty sampling;verification activities","","6","","42","","","3-6 Nov. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence the performance of BP neural network is very unstable in practical applications. This paper combines an advanced machine learning paradigm named ensemble learning with BP neural network to build neural network ensemble for tourism demand prediction. The state-of-art methods for predictive modeling used in tourism research include traditional statistical methods, soft computing methods, and artificial intelligence methods. Note that artificial intelligence methods, which were introduced to tourism research in 1990s, have greatly improved the predictive accuracy of modeling methods. This study conducts tourism demand modeling of three important tourist source countries of US, Britain and Australia. The results show that, neural network ensemble significantly improves the predictive accuracy over traditional statistical methods and traditional machine learning methods including single BP neural network.

Through several clinical studies, more and more IOP-related profiles have been recorded by those sensors and made available for elaborating data-driven experiments. The objective of such experiments is to analyse and detect IOP pattern differences between ill and healthy subjects. The potential is to provide medical doctors with analysis and detection tools allowing them to better diagnose and treat glaucoma.

Knowledge discovery in data streams is valuable task for research, business and community. The fundamental step of knowledge discovery in data stream is the classification of the data streams in target classes. In this paper we have proposed classification mechanism for the data streams, conventional classification algorithm are of little significance in data streams due to the complex nature, unbounded memory requirements and concept drifting problem in data streams. The proposed method takes a novel approach towards the classification of the data streams through applying unsupervised classification techniques such as clustering followed by supervised classifier such as Support Vector Machine. The high volume data is sampled and reduced with Simple Aggregation and Approximation (SAX) Density based clustering algorithm DB Scan is applied on the data stream to reveal the number of classes present and subsequently label the data. Support vector Machine (SVM) is a well-known and proven supervised classification algorithm, SVM are applied to classify the label data. We tested our proposed method on the Intel Lab Data set, a data set of four environmental variables (Temperature, Voltage, Humidity, light) collected through 54 Mica2Dot sensors over 36 Days at per second rate. We have sampled the data stream in days and window of certain size n is trained on the SVM classifier.

The information is extracted to gain insights that assist explanation and identification of diverse pathological conditions. This was traditionally done by an expert through visual inspection of ECGs. The complexity and tediousness of this onus hinder long-term monitoring and rapid diagnosis, computerised and automated ECG signal processing are therefore sought after. In this paper an algorithm that uses independent component analysis (ICA) to improve the performance of ECG pattern recognition is proposed. The algorithm deploys the basis functions obtained via the ICA of typical ECG to extract ICA features of ECG signals for further pattern recognition, with the hypothesis that components of an ECG signal generated by different parts of the heart during normal and arrhythmic cardiac cycles might be independent. The features obtained via the ICA together with the R-R interval and QRS segment power are jointly used as the input to a machine learning classifier, an artificial neural network in this case. Results from training and validation of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database shows significantly improved performance in terms of recognition accuracy. This new method also allows for the reduction of the number of inputs to the classifier, simplifying the system and increasing the real-time performance.

In recent years, real-time analytics on stream data has formed into a new research field, which aims to answer queries about “what-is-happening-now” with a negligible delay. The real challenge with real-time stream data processing is that it is impossible to store instances of data, and therefore online analytical algorithms are utilized. To perform real-time analytics, pre-processing of data should be performed in a way that only a short summary of stream is stored in main memory. In addition, due to high speed of arrival, average processing time for each instance of data should be in such a way that incoming instances are not lost without being captured. Lastly, the learner needs to provide high analytical accuracy measures. Sentinel is a distributed system written in Java that aims to solve this challenge by enforcing both the processing and learning process to be done in distributed form. Sentinel is built on top of Apache Storm, a distributed computing platform. Sentinel's learner, Vertical Hoeffding Tree, is a parallel decision tree-learning algorithm based on the VFDT, with ability of enabling parallel classification in distributed environments. Sentinel also uses SpaceSaving to keep a summary of the data stream and stores its summary in a synopsis data structure.

For a given query, the search operation results in a ranking of the enzymes in the database, from very similar to dissimilar enzymes, while information about the biological function of annotated database enzymes is ignored. In this work, we show that rankings of that kind can be substantially improved by applying kernel-based learning algorithms. This approach enables the detection of statistical dependencies between similarities of the active cleft and the biological function of annotated enzymes. This is in contrast to search-based approaches, which do not take annotated training data into account. Similarity measures based on the active cleft are known to outperform sequence-based or structure-based measures under certain conditions. We consider the Enzyme Commission (EC) classification hierarchy for obtaining annotated enzymes during the training phase.

This paper presents a method using probabilistic machine-learning techniques to extract latent factors from semantically enriched service descriptions. The latent factors are used to construct a model to represent different types of service descriptions in a vector form. With this transformation, heterogeneous service descriptions can be represented, discovered, and compared on the same homogeneous plane. The proposed solution is scalable to large service datasets and provides an efficient mechanism that enables publishing and adding new services to the registry and representing them using latent factors after deployment of the system.

However, from the perspective of information security, the user control of sensitive information has been shadowed by the fast development and rich variety of the applications. In the recent state of the art, users are subject to responding numerous requests for permission about using their private data to be able run an application. The awareness of the user about data protection and its relationship to permission requests is crucial for protecting the user against malicious software. Nevertheless, the slow adaptation of users to novel technologies suggests the need for developing automatic tools for detecting malicious software. In the present study, we analyze two major aspects of permission-based malware detection in Android applications: Feature selection methods and classification algorithms.

In this context, the notion of compactness of a social group is particularly relevant. While the literature usually refers to compactness as a measure to merely determine how much members of a group are similar among each other, we argue that the mutual trustworthiness between the members should be considered as an important factor in defining such a term. In fact, trust has profound effects on the dynamics of group formation and their evolution: individuals are more likely to join with and stay in a group if they can trust other group members. In this paper, we propose a quantitative measure of group compactness that takes into account both the similarity and the trustworthiness among users, and we present an algorithm to optimize such a measure. We provide empirical results, obtained from the real social networks EPINIONS and CIAO, that compare our notion of compactness versus the traditional notion of user similarity, clearly proving the advantages of our approach.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2323892","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6869022","Decision support systems;machine learning;multiagent systems;social network services;social trust","Communities;Context;Distance measurement;Gold;Multi-agent systems;Reliability;Social network services","","","","11","","49","","20140731","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Thus, it is still relevant to explore this task. In this paper, we introduce a part-of-speech tagger based on the Structure Learning framework that reduces the smallest known error on the Portuguese Mac-Morpho corpus by 7.8%. We also apply our tagger to a recently revised version of Mac-Morpho. Our system accuracy on this latter version is competitive with a semi-supervised Neural Network trained on Mac-Morpho plus a very large non-annotated corpus.

The proposed methodology provides a more accurate classification structure by identifying and isolating conflictive regions in the classification space and by specialized feature reduction and classification stages for them. The proposed Hierarchical Classification Scheme is composed by sequential layers, in which the clear membership regions are identified first, and the conflictive regions of classification are tackled in upper levels. Such treatment of the conflictive regions is based on new feature space transformation to provide an optimized data understanding and, then, better chances of classification. Improving classification with this method compared to other alternatives implies the avoidance of over-fitting the classification training.

Some hyper-heuristic frameworks tend to be highly constrained, their limited instruction sets prevent the state-of-the-art algorithms from being expressed. In addition, often the generated algorithms are not human-readable. In this paper, we propose a possible extension of some existing hyper-heuristic formulations, so that some of the current open issues can be addressed and it becomes possible to produce self-organizing heuristics that adapt themselves automatically to the environment when the class of problems changes.

Based on Kolmogorov complexity theory, there should be some simple Turing machines that write out such sequences; here simple means the complexity of the Turing machine is simpler than the data. The primary goal of this paper is to approximate such simple Turing machines by SFA. We use SFA, via ALERGIA algorithm (in the light granular computing), to capture and analyze the translation process (DNA to protein) based on amino acids' chemical property viz., polarity.

In this paper, we propose a new approach called reframing to handle dataset shift. The main objective of reframing is to build a model once and make it workable without retraining. We propose two efficient reframing algorithms to learn the optimal shift parameter values using only a small amount of labelled data available in the deployment. Thus, they can transform the shifted input attributes with the optimal parameter values and use the same existing model in several deployment environments without retraining. We have addressed supervised learning tasks both for classification and regression.

However, knowledge is usually built from scratch and learning to behave may take a long time. Here, we improve the learning performance by leveraging prior knowledge; that is, the learner shows proper behavior from the beginning of a target task, using the knowledge from a set of known, previously solved, source tasks. In this paper, we argue that building stochastic abstract policies that generalize over past experiences is an effective way to provide such improvement and this generalization outperforms the current practice of using a library of policies. We achieve that contributing with a new algorithm, AbsProb-PI-multiple and a framework for transferring knowledge represented as a stochastic abstract policy in new RL tasks. Stochastic abstract policies offer an effective way to encode knowledge because the abstraction they provide not only generalizes solutions but also facilitates extracting the similarities among tasks. We perform experiments in a robotic navigation environment and analyze the agent's behavior throughout the learning process and also assess the transfer ratio for different amounts of source tasks. We compare our method with the transfer of a library of policies, and experiments show that the use of a generalized policy produces better results by more effectively guiding the agent when learning a target task.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2319733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6814802","Knowledge transfer;machine learning","Abstracts;Buildings;Learning (artificial intelligence);Libraries;Markov processes;Stationary state","knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic processes","AbsProb-PI-multiple;RL task;agent behavior;dynamic environment;knowledge representation;learning performance;learning process;reinforcement learning;robotic navigation environment;stochastic abstract policy;trial-and-error interaction","1","3","","36","","20140513","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
"PhishStorm: Detecting Phishing With Streaming Analytics","S. Marchal; J. François; R. State; T. Engel","Interdiscipl.

This technique is inefficient due to the short lifetime of phishing Web sites, making recent approaches relying on real-time or proactive phishing URL detection techniques more appropriate. In this paper, we introduce PhishStorm, an automated phishing detection system that can analyze in real time any URL in order to identify potential phishing sites. PhishStorm can interface with any email server or HTTP proxy. We argue that phishing URLs usually have few relationships between the part of the URL that must be registered (low-level domain) and the remaining part of the URL (upper-level domain, path, query). We show in this paper that experimental evidence supports this observation and can be used to detect phishing sites. For this purpose, we define the new concept of intra-URL relatedness and evaluate it using features extracted from words that compose a URL based on query data from Google and Yahoo search engines. These features are then used in machine-learning-based classification to detect phishing URLs from a real dataset. Our technique is assessed on 96 018 phishing and legitimate URLs that result in a correct classification rate of 94.91% with only 1.44% false positives. An extension for a URL phishingness rating system exhibiting high confidence rate ( $>$ 99%) is proposed. We discuss in this paper efficient implementation patterns that allow real-time analytics using Big Data architectures such as STORM and advanced data structures based on the Bloom filter.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2014.2377295","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975177","Big Data;Machine Learning;Mining and Statistical Methods;Phishing Detection;STORM;Search Engine Query Data;Security Management;Security management;URL Rating;URL rating;Word Relatedness;big data;machine learning;mining and statistical methods;phishing detection;search engine query data;word relatedness","Feature extraction;Google;Market research;Media streaming;Phishing;Search engines;Uniform resource locators","Big Data;Web sites;computer crime;data analysis;data structures;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;search engines;unsolicited e-mail","Bloom filter;Google search engines;HTTP proxy;PhishStorm;STORM;URL blacklisting;URL phishingness rating system;Yahoo search engines;advanced data structures;automated phishing detection system;big data architectures;email server;feature extraction;intraURL relatedness;legitimate URLs;machine-learning-based classification;phishing Web sites;prevention techniques;proactive phishing URL detection techniques;query data;real-time analytics;real-time phishing URL detection techniques;streaming analytics","","7","","48","","20141204","Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Existing defense solutions prevent executables from entering organizational networks via emails, therefore recent attacks tend to use non-executable files such as PDF. Machine learning algorithms have recently been applied for detecting malicious PDF files. These techniques, however, lack an essential element - they cannot be updated daily. In this study we present ALPD, a framework that is based on active learning methods that are specially designed to efficiently assist anti-virus vendors to focus their analytical efforts. This is done by identifying and acquiring new PDF files that are most likely malicious, as well as informative benign PDF documents. These files are used for retraining and enhancing the knowledge stores. Evaluation results show that in the final day of the experiment, Combination, one of our AL methods, outperformed all the others, enriching the anti-virus's signature repository with almost seven times more new PDF malware while also improving the detection model's performance on a daily basis.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-6363-8; Electronic:978-1-4799-6364-5; POD:978-1-4799-6365-2","10.1109/JISIC.2014.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975559","Active Learning;Machine Learning;Malware;PDF","Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Malware;Organizations;Portable document format;Support vector machines;Training","computer viruses;digital signatures;learning (artificial intelligence)","ALPD;PDF malware;active learning framework;antivirus signature repository;attack vector;email communication;emails;informative benign PDF documents;machine learning algorithms;malicious PDF file detection;malicious attachments;organizational networks","","4","","27","","","24-26 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposed the tattoo skin recognition using cross - correlation neural network. This method has been designed into two steps: (1) the pre - processing part is keypoints feature extraction to distinguish tattoos from human skin and (2) the recognition process applies with cross-correlation neural network to classify and recognize the familiar tattoos. The tattoos database collected from prisoners in prison ministry, THAILAND.

"Identification of the Dynamic Operating Envelope of HCCI Engines Using Class Imbalance Learning","V. M. Janakiraman; X. Nguyen; J. Sterniak; D.

HCCI engine operation is constrained by combustion instabilities, such as knock, ringing, misfires, high-variability combustion, and so on, and it becomes important to identify the operating envelope defined by these constraints for use in engine diagnostics and controller design. HCCI combustion is dominated by complex nonlinear dynamics, and a first-principle-based dynamic modeling of the operating envelope becomes intractable. In this paper, a machine learning approach is presented to identify the stable operating envelope of HCCI combustion, by learning directly from the experimental data. Stability is defined using thresholds on combustion features obtained from engine in-cylinder pressure measurements. This paper considers instabilities arising from engine misfire and high-variability combustion. A gasoline HCCI engine is used for generating stable and unstable data observations. Owing to an imbalance in class proportions in the data set, the models are developed both based on resampling the data set (by undersampling and oversampling) and based on a cost-sensitive learning method (by overweighting the minority class relative to the majority class observations). Support vector machines (SVMs) and recently developed extreme learning machines (ELM) are utilized for developing dynamic classifiers. The results compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive nonlinear ELM and SVM classification algorithms are well suited for the problem. However, the SVM envelope model requires about 80% more parameters for an accuracy improvement of 3% compared with the ELM envelope model indicating that ELM models may be computationally suitable for the engine application. The proposed modeling approach shows that HCCI engine misfires and high-variability combustion can be predicted ahead of time, gi- en the present values of available sensor measurements, making the models suitable for engine diagnostics and control applications.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2311466","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6781632","Class imbalance learning;dynamic classification;engine control;engine diagnostics;extreme learning machine;homogeneous charge compression ignition;misfire prediction;operating envelope model;support vector machine;system identification;system identification.","Combustion;Data models;Fuels;Internal combustion engines;Predictive models;Support vector machines","control system synthesis;fuel economy;internal combustion engines;learning systems;pattern classification;pressure measurement;support vector machines","ELM envelope model;HCCI combustion;HCCI engines;SVM envelope model;automotive engine technology;class imbalance learning;complex nonlinear dynamics;controller design;cost-sensitive learning method;dynamic classifiers;dynamic operating envelope identification;emission reduction;engine diagnostics;engine in-cylinder pressure measurements;extreme learning machines;first-principle-based dynamic modeling;fuel economy;homogeneous charge compression ignition engines;machine learning approach;nonlinear ELM classification algorithms;nonlinear SVM classification algorithms;support vector machines","","4","","35","","20140401","Jan. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
