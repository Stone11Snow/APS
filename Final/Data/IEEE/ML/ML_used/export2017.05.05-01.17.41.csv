This spatial domain watermarking scheme generates a watermarking template from image channels data, and then this watermarking template is embedded into the image. Because both the watermarking template and watermarking image undergo a similar geometric attack, self-synchronization can be obtained in the procedure of detecting watermarking. Experimental results demonstrate that this spatial watermarking produced by the multi-channel framework achieves a high performance of robustness even if an image undergoes some serious geometric distortion attacks.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527842","Multi-channel framework;geometrical attacks;image watermarking;robustness","","computational geometry;watermarking","geometric distortion attack;multichannel image watermarking;self-synchronization;spatial domain watermarking","","0","","11","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Web documents relevant to the requested concepts and individuals specified in these triples are then retrieved by a document retriever. And finally, the retrieved documents are ranked according to their relevance to the user's query. An extended term-document matrix is built to reflect the relevance between documents, concepts/individuals, and terms.

In addition, in order to reduce computational costs of estimators, a better-behaved sigma point selection strategy of unscented transformation (UT) for UKF, spherical simplex sigma, is investigated. The UKF estimator is tested through numeric simulation of a fully actuated rigid body with only magnetometer. For comparison, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) estimator is also developed and is used to gauge the performance of UKF estimator. The results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate the UKF is superior to EKF in coping with the nonlinearity of attitude dynamics in the presence of model uncertainties.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1526998","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1526998","Estimation;magnetometer;spacecraft;unscented Kalman filter","Calibration;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Covariance matrix;Magnetometers;Numerical simulation;Position measurement;Quaternions;Space vehicles;Testing","","Estimation;magnetometer;spacecraft;unscented Kalman filter","","2","","13","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The essence of the presented solution is both in the encapsulation of many known searching algorithms inside separate filtering agents, and in the integration of flexible resource aware coordination mechanisms into one manager agent. The flexibility of the realised coordination scheme in facilitating an easy integration of novel strategies is practically demonstrated in a system serving as an intelligent personal information assistant.

However, in many fields, an attribute value for an object may be a set or a bag of values, such as the result set of a database query, which can be looked on as a set of attributes, whose values also can be a set or a bag of data. So the clustering problems of queries can be expressed as intersection problems of sets whose element also can be a set or a bag.

Considering these properties, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is applied to estimate line of sight (LOS) rate. The UKF propagates statistics of random variable more accurately than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) does for nonlinear system.

In view of this, we introduce the concept of location values of fuzzy numbers with rule pools, and then develop a new way of ranking fuzzy numbers. Moreover, we give further descriptions for the location values by using coincidence degrees of fuzzy numbers with rule pools, and present the technique of composite quantification for fuzzy information.

The method is to separate ROI and background data, and to place them to individual code blocks, ROI code block and background code block, which are put to entropy encoder independently. In the bit-stream allocation phase, a weight is assigned to the distort-length slope of ROI code block, which is intended to change the order by which the respective code blocks are assembled to stream. To transfer the information of the separated ROI and background, each original code block is duplicated logically in packet header. By assigning the same value as original code block to the number of bit planes of logical code block which has no data actually, the length of tag tree code is reduced. Because the separated code block can be assembled flexibly, the method enables the dynamic stream allocation according to the content of image.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527907","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527907","JPEG2000;Region of Interest;Separated Code Block","Assembly;Computer science;Decoding;Discrete wavelet transforms;Entropy;Image coding;Phase distortion;Propagation losses;Tiles;Transform coding","block codes;data compression;entropy;image coding;tree codes","JPEG 2000;ROI coding;bit-stream allocation;code block duplication;code block selection;code block separation;distort-length slope;dynamic stream allocation;entropy encoder;image content;image quality;tag tree code","","2","3","8","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It aids to diagnose diseases of the urology system. Because the particles such as urinary sediments are irregular in shape and fuzzy in edge, it is much more difficult to automatically detect particles in microscopic images. Texture segmentation involves subdividing an image into differently textured regions. Many segmentation based on Gabor filters are derived from Gabor elementary functions. We present a new robust method for the problem of automatically detecting the particles' location in images. We have devised a more rigorously Gabor-based method enhancing the edge information for designing Gabor filters.

Therefore, there is a need for robust procedures to estimate quantities, which can be applied to relatively generic processes and easy to implement. The paper briefly discusses the algorithm and the implement of some familiar probability distribution quantiles, such as, standardized normal distribution, β distribution, X<sup> 2</sup> distribution, t distribution and F distribution.

Cluster-based server architectures combine good performance and low cost, and are widely used for Web service. In this paper, we propose a parallel Web mining (PWM) algorithm for link prediction in the environment of Web cluster server consisting of several nodes that act as independent Web servers. According to the PWM algorithm, the transition probability matrixes are firstly obtained from the Web log flies of each node by adopting the Markov chain model, compressed under the constraint of the probability threshold c and parallel threshold a, and then sent to the central node which combine these independent results to get an integrated result by some rules. By different accuracy requirement, the PWM algorithm can be divided into simple PWM algorithm (S-PWM), faster but less accurate, and complex PWM algorithm (C-PWM), slower but more accurate. Furthermore, a related incremental parallel Web mining (I-PWM) algorithm is put forward too. The experimental results show that PWM algorithm can not only alleviate the communication cost by sending the mined transition probability matrix and decrease the time complexity by disposing in parallel but also hardly affect the accuracy of the Web mining result.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527326","Markov chain model;Parallel Web mining;cluster server;link prediction","Clustering algorithms;Computer architecture;Concurrent computing;Costs;Data mining;Network servers;Predictive models;Pulse width modulation;Web mining;Web server","Internet;Markov processes;client-server systems;computational complexity;data mining;file servers;parallel algorithms;workstation clusters","Markov chain model;Web log file;Web server;Web service;cluster server architecture;link prediction;parallel Web mining algorithm;parallel threshold;probability threshold;transition probability matrix","","0","","8","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The user's intention to operate and control the networked robot is incrementally inferred based on Bayesian techniques so that task of the robot defined by the user's intention can be recognized. Consequently, the robot can autonomously execute this task without frequent interaction with the user, which decreases data transmission to a great extent. So long the robot has a correct inference on task, the efficiency of the whole system can be improved to a remarkable extent.

However, algorithms developed for transaction database will generate invalid candidate pairs due to fundamental property of the itemsets in relational table (i.e. 1NF, they cannot contain more that one item per table column) and hence encounter additional and unnecessary computation cost. In this paper, using this property, the join step in the candidate generation phase is adapted to reflect this and to prune candidate set by not taking into itemsets which are not in 1NF. Furthermore, we propose other techniques to reduce the number of candidate pairs that are to be examined in the refinement step, even when the upper bound based pruning technique is useless in case of very low correlation threshold. Experimental results from real data sets exhibit that our algorithm can produce smaller candidate set and be faster than previous algorithms.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:0-7803-9091-1","10.1109/ICMLC.2005.1527206","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1527206","Association Rule;Correlation;Data Mining;Relational Table;Transactions","Association rules;Computational efficiency;Computer science;Data mining;Electronic mail;Itemsets;Relational databases;Statistics;Transaction databases;Upper bound","correlation methods;data mining;relational databases","Pearson correlation coefficients1;all attribute value pairs;all-strong correlated pairs;association rules;data mining;minimum correlation threshold;relational table;strongly correlated pairs;upper bound based pruning","","0","","12","","","18-21 Aug. 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
