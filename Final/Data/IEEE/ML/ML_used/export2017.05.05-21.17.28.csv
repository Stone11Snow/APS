This paper suggests a new architecture for fuzzy controller to handle the high order process control by using low dimensional rule bases. And the new controller uses the rule base to solve the stable error problem that bothering conventional fuzzy logic controller also.

Least mean kurtosis CMA (LMKCMA) has to estimate the MSE, and this estimation has a bad influence on its expectation behavior. For greatly overcoming these disadvantages, a new cost function based on kurtosis of error signals is defined and analyzed, a least square kurtosis constant modulus algorithm (LSKCMA) for updating weight vectors of blind equalizer is proposed. In the LSKCMA, the kurtosis factor based on error signals can improve convergence rate and make the algorithm converge to global minima. Thus, the LSKCMA has much faster convergence rate than the LMKCMA and the CMA.

Data information including the weather and day-ahead electric prices are preprocessed through the Fourier wave filter. A new wavelet based on neural network study programming, in which the Sigmoid function in the ANN is substituted by wavelet function, is presented to solve this problem.

The author proposed a parallelized protein secondary structure prediction method namely mpiPSSP, using message passing interface (MPI) on a multi-node compute cluster. A preprocess mpiSEQ processes and converts the fasta-like database to the format preferred by mpiPSSP, and a post process mpiRES collects and reports the result as well. mpiPSSP can self-determine the appropriate number of processors according to the size of the querying database or also run using the user-desired number of processors.

We first focus on discussing the market segmentation problem by applying clustering technique in data mining discipline. The partition of market is based on users' preference data and not on the commonly used one, users' attribute data. In that way, the definition of distance between two customers by their preference to a set of specified competing products is given. Instead of starting from scratch, the self-organization feature map is adopted as a basic clustering framework. In order to process the preference data, some necessary modifications are made. Both theoretical analysis and practical experiment are presented in this paper, which make us confident of that the algorithm we proposed has excellent performance and could discover the potential clustering patterns in the complex datasets. The second part focuses on displaying market segmentation structure. We apply visualization technique to represent the market structure clearly in a two-dimensional plane so that the marketers can make their market strategies easier. The two main parts are organized as an integrated approach. Such an approach includes three core steps: preference data collecting step, preference data clustering step by SOM neural networks and visualization step by ideal point model. There are three main advantages of the approach: firstly, the approach is based on well-defined mathematic models and can be supported by a series of numeral methods. Secondly, it does not have to face the tough market variable selection problem because we focus on preference data, not on evaluators' attribute data (demographic or geographic data etc.). Finally, the approach can produce multi-scale view of market segmentation results. The experiments show that the approach yields meaningful results and is comparable and complemented to the most general ones.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382050","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382050","","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Data visualization;Input variables;Mathematical model;Mathematics;Neural networks;Pattern analysis;Performance analysis","consumer behaviour;data mining;data visualisation;marketing data processing;numerical analysis;pattern clustering;self-organising feature maps;simulated annealing;statistical analysis","consumer preference data;data clustering;data collection;data mining;demographic data;geographic data;ideal point model;integrated method;market segmentation structure;market structure representation;market visualization technique;mathematic models;neural networks;numeral methods;pattern clustering technique;real datasets;self-organization feature map;two dimensional plane","","1","3","31","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Aiming at the water level control in power station, an internal model control based on neural networks is presented in this paper. It adopts the steam flux signal to the internal model controller considering the influence of load changing, which has the ability of feed-forward compensation for steam flux disturbance and can avoid ""false water level"" phenomenon. At the same time, the whole input signal of controlled object is combined by NNC and a robust controller (RC), which make up of a changing robust controller to control the object. Thus, good regulating performance is guaranteed in the initial control stage, even when the controlled object varies later. Simulation results show that this strategy is more effective and practicable compared with general cascade PID control.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378607","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378607","","Boilers;Control systems;Intelligent networks;Level control;Neural networks;Power generation;Radio control;Robust control;Three-term control;Turbines","boilers;compensation;feedforward;level control;neurocontrollers;predictive control;robust control;steam turbines;thermal power stations","boiler drum;false water level phenomena;feedforward compensation;internal model controller;neural network controller;power station;robust controller;steam flux disturbance;steam flux signal;turbine-generator unit;water level control","","1","","5","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to improve the tracking control performance under uncertainty, This work presents a new hybrid control scheme for manipulator, which consists of a neural network controller, a sliding mode controller and PID compensation controller.

First system designs path planning for every robot and formation control planning off-line based on centralized strategy. When robot will arise collision in moving, every robot plans its motion character respectively and design collision-avoidance control strategy using priority strategy based on distributed approach.

According to cluster hypothesis, the documents from the same class are more similar to each other when they are represented in vector space model (VSM), so many of the words from these documents are always in company with each other. We find these words by word co-occurrence, and then construct reduced feature space for clustering. Experiments show that the selected features are more salient.

In this paper, an algorithm based on a chaotic neural network is proposed to solve the relational structure matching problem by finding the maximum clique in the association graph. From detailed analysis, we draw the conclusion that, unlike the conventional Hopfield neural network, the chaotic neural network can avoid getting stuck in local minima and thus yield excellent solution in finding the maximum clique in a given graph.

We train SOFM to exploit the normal profile distributions of network traffic, and then the test data with attack-instances embedded is utilized. It is shown that the network attacks are detected with more efficiency and relatively low false alarms.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378297","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378297","","Computer networks;Data preprocessing;Detection algorithms;Feature extraction;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Quantization;Telecommunication traffic;Traffic control","computer networks;feature extraction;security of data;self-organising feature maps;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DARPA intrusion detection;TCP states;anomaly detection algorithm;data preprocessing method;feature extraction;network traffic flow;quantization model;self organising feature maps","","0","1","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conception of network management and intrusion detection is introduced firstly. Then, SIDS an integrated design is analyzed, and the shortcomings of SIDS are also pointed out. Finally, NM-IDS, a new integrated design, in which the intrusion detection and the network management are integrated into a whole in the high layer, is put forward. NM-IDS not only can overcome the shortcomings of the SIDS, but also improves the ability of the network management and intrusion detection greatly.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380672","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380672","","Computer network management;Computer security;Engineering management;Engines;Information security;Intrusion detection;Protocols;Resource management;Technology management;Waste management","computer architecture;computer network management;security of data","intrusion detection system;network management design;simple intrusion detection system;system architecture","","2","","5","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
