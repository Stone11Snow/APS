This paper uses well-known machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Means clustering and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to develop an efficient ECD model. The process normality is checked by SVM following by decomposing the process dynamics via K-Means. The abnormal observations are then projected into normal models built by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Finally, by calculating the contribution values of out-of-control observations, different fault fingerprints with corresponding fault root are extracted again by K-Means. The impact of clustering techniques is investigated by comparing K-Means, SOM, and hierarchical clustering. An empirical study was conducted in collaboration with the leading semiconductor company in France to validate the methodology. The result shows that the proposed approach can effectively detect abnormal observations as well as automatically classify the fault fingerprints to give evident guidelines in explaining the detected faults.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0094","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838198","Equipment Condition Diagnosis (ECD);Fault Detection and Classification (FDC);K-Means;clustering;fault fingerprint extraction;machine learning;semiconductor manufacturing","Circuit faults;Fingerprint recognition;Kernel;Manufacturing;Principal component analysis;Semiconductor device modeling;Support vector machines","fault diagnosis;manufacturing systems;principal component analysis;production engineering computing;self-organising feature maps;semiconductor industry","ECD model;France;K-means clustering;PCA;SOM;SVM;equipment condition diagnosis;fault detection and classification;fault fingerprint extraction;hierarchical clustering;high-tech production system;principal component analysis;self-organizing map;semiconductor company;semiconductor manufacturing;support vector machine","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to achieve this objective, an application with several intuitive user interfaces was implemented and used to capture user data. The results presented here are based upon the data from fifty users. These captured data are integrated or fused, pre-processed, analyzed, and used as training data for a supervised machine learning predictive approach. The data reduction methods are based upon principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). PCA/LDA were implemented to reduce the data feature dimensions and to improve the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) supervised classification predictions. The results of our experiment indicate that high accuracy is achieved from this method.

Determining whether reviews are truthful is imperative to the consumer, as to not get misled by false recommendations. Unfortunately, it is often difficult, or impossible, for humans to ascertain the validity of a review through reading the text, however, studies have shown machine learning methods perform well for detecting untruthful reviews. Previously, no studies have examined the effects of ensemble learners on the detection of untruthful reviews, despite these techniques being effective in related text classification domains. We seek to inform other researchers of the effects of ensemble techniques on the detection of spam reviews. To this aim, we evaluate four classifiers and three ensemble techniques using those four classifiers as base learners. We compare the results of Multinomial Naïve Bayes, C4.5, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest with 100, 250, and 500 trees, and Boosting and Bagging using the base learners.

In this paper, we propose trace norm regularized CCA(SRCCA) that not only tackles the problem of small sample size but also uncover the underlying structures between target classes.

AVAs are vital lines for hemodialysis patients. Clinically, when the AVA lumen is reduced to less than 50% of normal lumen, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgical intervention must be performed to restore normal AVA function. A method based on the Burg AR model combined with the fractional-order dynamic error (FODE) was proposed for evaluating the relationship between the power spectral density and vascular access DOS. However, in a clinical trial of 42 patients, the coefficients of determination was 0.3842 at the V-site anastomosis.

Automatically recognizing the emotions consequently contributes towards the advances in the areas such as human computer interaction, clinical psychology and data-driven animations. Deriving a relevant and reduced set of features is a vital step for effective facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose a co-clustering based approach to the selection of distinguished and interpretable features to deal with the curse of dimensionality issue. First, the features are extracted from images using a bank of Gabor filters.

Thus, it is believed that the cut set can be used in the research of fuzzy concept lattice. In this paper, a preliminary exploration to use the cut set is carried out. In particular, the cut set is employed to construct the discernibility matrix of L-fuzzy formal context and then all the reducts can be obtained via the use of discernibility function.

Due to the growing size and volatile nature of LP data, development and evaluation of clustering approaches has been of high demand in recent energy research, whereas the classification techniques receive less attention. This study is the first to address the effect of LP time-series data temporal dimension on the classification performance using the most popular classification algorithms in machine learning including decision trees, support vector machines (SVM), discriminant analysis, and ensemble methods. Results indicate a decline in the classification accuracy as the temporal dimension increases.

Researchers always use bottom-up low-level features and straightforward rules for salient object detection. However these rules are unreliable in common scenes. As a result, most salient object detection technologies can gain a fine performance in limited situation. While in a more complex scene (such as PASCAL-S dataset), they may miss the really wanted salient objects. Fixation prediction is a technology of predicting the regions which can attract human's attention. Most fixation prediction technologies are based on the discoveries of neuroscience and cognitive psychology. Their rules for fixation prediction more accord with human's sensory mechanism. Thus, fixation map can provide a more reliable salient priori. Based on above reasons, we propose a novel salient object detection method with fixation priori. We refine fixation map to gain a reliable priori, and conduct salient object detection based on the priori. We perform experiment on two datasets, and find that our method outperforms the comparative state-of-art salient object detection technologies.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860915","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860915","fixation prediction;salient object detection","Cybernetics;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Neuroscience;Object detection;Psychology;Reliability","object detection","PASCAL-S dataset;cognitive psychology;fixation map;fixation prediction;fixation priori;human sensory mechanism;neuroscience;region prediction;salient object detection","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The presented formula, which is based on Taylor expansion instead of polynomial-interpolation theory, achieves an error of O(g<sup>2</sup>), where g denotes the sampling period. Moreover, different from the traditional central/backward numerical differentiation formula, the ZFD formula 4NgSFD makes use of an ahead node, a target node and two back nodes in the approximation of the first-order derivative at the target node.

This work aims to automate the process of correlating CAN bus messages with specific Electronic Control Unit (ECU) functions in a new vehicle, by creating a machine learning classifier that has been trained on a dataset of multiple vehicles from different manufacturers.

Multiple sine functions decomposition (MSFD) method is an effective forecasting method, which has been applied to long-term temperature trend forecasting. Generally, the original mode of MFSD method is to decompose a historical temperature sequence into multiple sine waveforms; then, by adding up those sine functions, a temperature model is constructed to forecast future temperature trend. In this paper, in order to achieve more accurate forecasting results, an improvement of MSFD method with mode of learning-checking and core functions (LCCF) is proposed. Differing from the original mode, the LCCF mode adds a checking step after the learning step for selecting core functions, and then use them to do the temperature trend forecasting work.

In this paper, we proposed a density peak based semi-supervised clustering algorithm, which is able to leverage label information of some seed objects for obtaining a better clustering result. Specifically, we first adopted a density based clustering algorithm to identify density peaks as the possible cluster centers for a dataset, and then proposed a graph-based algorithm to assign each center a class label by utilizing some given seed objects. Finally, we leveraged the label information of seed objects and identified centers to generate must-link and cannot-link constraints for clustering.

They are responsible for serious problems such as dissatisfaction, irritation, exposure to unpleasant or malicious content, and financial loss. Despite different machine learning approaches have been used to detect web spam, many of them suffer with the curse of dimensionality or require a very high computational cost impeding their employment in real scenarios. In this way, there is still a big effort to develop more advanced methods that at the same time are able to prevent overfitting and fast to learn. To fill this gap, we present the MDLClass, a classifier technique based on the minimum description length principle, applied to the context of web spam filtering. The proposed method is very efficient, lightweight, multi-class, and fast. We also evaluated a new approach to detect web spam that combines the predictions obtained by the classifiers using content-based, link-based, and transformed link-based features. In our experiments, we employed two real, public and large datasets: the WEBSPAM-UK2006 and the WEBSPAM-UK2007.

Daytime images are simulated with various degrees of contrast and Poisson noise using MATLAB. CE algorithm is applied in three scales to obtain good brightness and contrast of the images. Images are denoised by using bilateral filter that smoothes the noise while preserving edges. The brightness and contrast of the night images have been enhanced significantly and the noise is reduced effectively, preserving the details of the images.

Traditional event detection and type recognition methods were majorly based on text processing techniques while few research considers the financial time-series features. As we know, there are large amount of financial time-series data available such as stock transaction data. These data may be regarded as the capital market response to specific financial events. By taking these factors into consideration, this paper presents a financial event recognition approach by incorporating text and time-series features. By following the event study method, the influences of specific type of event to stock index are estimated by analyzing the changes of average abnormal returns and average cumulative abnormal returns. In this way, the time-series features related to specific financial event types are obtained. These features are incorporated with text features in a support vector machine based classifier to recognize the types of financial events.

Many current approaches have achieved high accuracy on simple actions, but still struggled to recognize interactive behaviors. This work targets on interactive actions between human and objects in some complex real-world situations. Although an action recognition algorithm using high-level ground-truth pose features outperforms the one using low/mid-level global statistical features, pose estimation algorithms which is critical for high-level feature are not reliable enough to interactive actions. In this paper, we propose a novel confidence-based action recognition method. The rationale underlying our method is to make a credible choice of the different-level features between the popular Dense Trajectories based on statistical representations and the high-level pose features based on estimated pose during the classification process according to the predefined confidence.

Investigating this commonality will help us not only better understand the diseases but also identify new molecular targets for therapy. In our study, we make use of genomic profile data together with clinical information and propose a statistical approach to detect the common gene set that is reflective of the common mechanism in the multiple diseases. Our paired sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (psCCA), utilizes multiple clinical variables that measure different aspects of the disease severity or progress. Simultaneously assessing relationships between multiple clinical variables and genomic profiles for given diseases, psCCA provides the overall picture of the relationships, thus is a more adequate approach to explore multiple diseases than performing millions of individual tests. Using lasso penalty, psCCA identifies the sparse linear combination of genes that is highly correlated with the corresponding clinical variables. It maximizes the correlation within diseases and restricts the model such that the selected genes are common for all given diseases. Our simulation shows that psCCA is able to select a common gene set underlying clinical phenotype for multiple diseases. We also demonstrate this new method on data sets of burn and trauma patients.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860887","Diseases;Genomics;Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis","Bioinformatics;Correlation;Data structures;Diseases;Gene expression;Genomics;Injuries","diseases;genomics;medical computing;optimisation;statistical analysis","acute inflammatory diseases;burn patients;clinical information;clinical phenotype;common gene set detection;common genomic mechanism detection;correlation maximization;disease aspect measurement;etiologies;genomic profile data;human diseases;lasso penalty;molecular targets;paired sparse canonical correlation analysis;psCCA;sparse linear gene combination;statistical approach;therapy;trauma patients","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, in this paper an unmanned aerial vehicle is utilized to provide real time images of the structural site. A gradient of temporal range of images is used for such applications but the uncertainties caused by the camera locations make it quite difficult to evaluate the images from a same position on the structure to reveal any apparent structural damage. These images are, therefore, pre-processed for registration and are then classified automatically.

In particular, most of the previous methods often use softmax activation for prediction, while instead of utilizing a softmax layer, we present a linear support vector machine (SVM) to be a part of the learning model, minimizing a margin-based loss to obtain a lower level feature representation.

Our method uses a one-hidden layer RBM to perform unsupervised feature reduction. The resultant weights from this RBM are passed to another RBM producing a deep belief network. The pre-trained weights are passed into a fine tuning layer consisting of a Logistic Regression (LR) classifier with multi-class soft-max. We have implemented the deep learning architecture in C++ in Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and we use the DARPA KDDCUP'99 dataset to evaluate its performance. Our architecture outperforms previous deep learning methods implemented by Li and Salama in both detection speed and accuracy. We achieve a detection rate of 97.9% on the total 10% KDDCUP'99 test dataset. By improving the training process of the simulation, we are also able to produce a low false negative rate of 2.47%.

CAD algorithms rely on machine learning methods to classify regions of interest in images into cancerous and healthy regions. In cancer screening, the foremost problem to solve is whether a patient has cancer, regardless of the location of cancerous regions in the organ. This allows early detection of the disease leading to a right course of action in terms of treatment to be taken. In machine learning, this problem has been formulated as multi-instance learning (MIL) where bags of instances are classified rather than the individual instances. In this paper, we propose a bag of bags (BoB) nested MIL algorithm where high-level bags (or parent bags), each contains multiple smaller bags of instances. We applied the proposed BoB MIL algorithm to prostate cancer detection problem using magnetic resonance imaging data to first detect which patients have cancer and consequently, to detect which slices in the 3D volume imaging data of the detected patients contain cancerous regions. Experimental results obtained from the imaging data of 30 patients with ground-truth data based on biopsy results show that the proposed algorithm is not only capable of detecting prostate cancer at patient level, it is also able to detect the cancerous regions at slice level of imaging data with high accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0032","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838136","Cancer Detection;Computer-Aided Detection (CAD);Multi Instance Classification","Magnetic resonance imaging;Prostate cancer;Three-dimensional displays;Training;Vocabulary","biomedical MRI;cancer;image classification;medical image processing","3D volume imaging data;BoB nested MIL algorithm;CAD algorithm;bag-of-bags;biopsy;cancer screening;cancerous region detection;computer-aided detection;disease detection;ground-truth data;high-level bags;imaging data slice level;machine learning;magnetic resonance imaging data;nested multiinstance classification;parent bags;patient level;prostate cancer detection","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Electrode shift is usually caused by repositioning, donning or doffing of a prosthetic device. Accuracy of gesture recognition may significantly drop since a pattern of collected signals may change after electrode shift. Although re-training a recognition system after every reposition is able to maintain accurate recognition, collecting labeled samples is inconvenient to users. In this paper, we apply an online semi-supervised learning in which a classifier is trained with a small amount of labeled samples and then is updated with unlabeled samples online to hand gesture recognition. A well-known online semi-supervised learning algorithm, online multi-channel semi-supervised growing neural gas (OSSMGNG) algorithm, is used in this preliminary study. OSSMGNG is compared with an intuitive method which learns from the initial label training set only in experiments. The data is collected from able-bodied individuals across three days for experiments. The results indicate OSSMGNG achieves a higher classification accuracy than others. It suggests that the online semi-supervised learning algorithm enhances robustness of hand gesture identification against electrode shift.","","CD:978-1-5090-0388-4; Electronic:978-1-5090-0390-7; POD:978-1-5090-0391-4","10.1109/ICMLC.2016.7860925","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860925","Electrode shift;Growing neural gas;Hand gesture recognition;Online Semi-supervised learning","Classification algorithms;Electrodes;Gesture recognition;Prosthetics;Robustness;Semisupervised learning;Training","electrodes;electromyography;gesture recognition;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","OSSMGNG algorithm;classifier training;electrode shift;hand gesture recognition;online multichannel semisupervised growing neural gas;online semisupervised learning;prosthetic device;sEMG;surface electromyography","","","","","","","10-13 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The computations for different reducts of the original inconsistent decision tables are converted into the computations for their corresponding reducts of the derived consistent datasets.

Domain class imbalance is different from ""class imbalance"". Class imbalance refers to the condition of a single domain having unequal class probabilities. In traditional machine learning, the training and testing data are drawn from a single domain. The effects of class imbalance in traditional machine learning are well studied, however, the issue of domain class imbalance in the field of transfer learning has received little research attention.

Finally, we conduct large-scale experiments on cross-model adversarial portability. We find that adversarial examples are mostly transferable across similar network topologies, and we demonstrate that better machine learning models are less vulnerable to adversarial examples.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6167-9; POD:978-1-5090-6168-6","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838149","","Agriculture;Computational modeling;Error analysis;Measurement;Neural networks;Robustness;Training","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","adversarial example generation approach;cross-model adversarial portability;deep convolutional neural networks;image quality;machine learning models;residual networks","","","","","","","18-20 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
