"Identifying Infeasible GUI Test Cases Using Support Vector Machines and Induced Grammars","R. Gove; J. Faytong","Human-Comput.

In the context of GUIs, a test case is a sequence of events to be executed which may detect faults in the application. However, a test case may be infeasible if one or more of the events in the event sequence are disabled or made inaccessible by a previously executed event (e.g., a button may be disabled until another GUI widget enables it). These infeasible test cases terminate prematurely and waste resources, so software testers would like to modify the test suite execution to run only feasible test cases. Current techniques focus on repairing the test cases to make them feasible, but this relies on executing all test cases, attempting to repair the test cases, and then repeating this process until a stopping condition has been met. We propose avoiding infeasible test cases altogether by predicting which test cases are infeasible using two supervised machine learning methods: support vector machines (SVMs) and grammar induction. We experiment with three feature extraction techniques and demonstrate the success of the machine learning algorithms for classifying infeasible GUI test cases in several subject applications. We further demonstrate a level of robustness in the algorithms when training and classifying test cases of different lengths.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4345-1; POD:978-1-4577-0019-4","10.1109/ICSTW.2011.73","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5954411","GUI testing;event based testing;grammar induction;machine learning;software testing;support vector machines","Grammar;Graphical user interfaces;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Software;Support vector machines;Testing","grammars;graphical user interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);program testing;software fault tolerance;support vector machines","GUI test case;event sequence;fault detection;feature extraction;grammar induction;model-based GUI software testing;supervised machine learning;support vector machine;test case repair;test suite execution","","3","","24","","","21-25 March 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Notwithstanding, only a few distributed learning algorithms have been proposed so far in the literature. One of them is DEvoNet, which uses artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. DEvoNet shows a good performance on many datasets but several limitations were pointed out in connection with its poor performance on nonuniform class-probability distributions of data.

The main advantage of MoGFS approaches is that a large number of non-dominated fuzzy rule-based systems are obtained by their single run. Each of the obtained fuzzy rule-based systems has a different tradeoff with respect to conflicting objectives such as accuracy and complexity. One controversial issue in the MoGFS field (and also in the field of multi-objective optimization in general) is how to choose the final solution from the obtained non-dominated ones. Since this selection is supposed to be done by human users, it is very difficult to rigorously discuss the generalization ability of the finally-selected fuzzy rule-based system. To tackle this difficulty, we propose the use of double cross-validation in the performance evaluation of MoGFS approaches. Double cross-validation has a nested structure of two cross-validation loops. The inner loop is used to determine the best complexity of fuzzy rule-based systems with the highest generalization ability for the training data in each run in the outer loop. That is, the inner loop plays the role of validation data. The determined best complexity is used to choose the final fuzzy rule-based system in each run in the outer loop. We explain the proposed idea by applying it to the performance evaluation of fuzzy rule-based classifiers designed by our multi-objective fuzzy genetics-based machine learning algorithm.","","Electronic:978-1-61284-050-5; POD:978-1-61284-049-9","10.1109/GEFS.2011.5949503","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5949503","Multi-objective genetic fuzzy systems;fuzzy genetics-based machine learning;fuzzy rule-based classification;multi-objective genetic algorithms;repeated double cross-validation","Accuracy;Complexity theory;Error analysis;Fuzzy systems;Machine learning algorithms;Performance evaluation;Training data","fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms","double cross-validation;fuzzy rule-based classifiers;generalization ability;machine learning;multiobjective genetic fuzzy systems;multiobjective optimization;nondominated fuzzy rule-based systems;performance evaluation","","4","","40","","","11-15 April 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we proposed a speed pattern model, called two phase piecewise linear speed model (2PEED), to estimate traffic condition and represent speed pattern in a road network using GPS data collected vehicles. With the estimated traffic condition and speed pattern, a proposed classification-based route guidance approach using machine learning technique provides dynamic routing for drivers. Using both current traffic data and the experience learned from history data, our route guidance approach is able to accurately predict the future traffic condition and selects a best route.

Prior works on traffic classification mainly focus their attentions on dividing Internet traffic into different categories based on application layer protocols (such as HTTP, Bit Torrent etc.). Making traffic classification from another point of view, we divide Internet traffic into different content types. Our technology is an attempt to solve the classification problem of network traffic, which contains unknown and proprietary protocols (i.e., no publicly available protocol specification). In this paper, we design a classifier which can distinguish Internet traffic into different content types using machine learning techniques. Features of our classifier are entropy of consecutive bytes and frequencies of characters. Our method is capable of classifying real-world traces into different content types (including Text, Picture, Audio, Video, Compressed, Base 64-encoded image, Base 64-encoded text and Encrypted). The chief features of our classifier are small computing space (about 1K Bytes) and high classification accuracy (about 81%).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4509-7; POD:978-1-4577-1172-5","10.1109/NAS.2011.18","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005446","entropy vector;file content;machine learning;traffic classification","Accuracy;Cryptography;Entropy;Internet;Machine learning;Payloads;Protocols","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","64-encoded image;Audio;Bit Torrent;HTTP;ISP;Internet service providers;Internet traffic;Picture;QoS;Text;Video;machine learning techniques;network community;traffic classification","","5","","27","","","28-30 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We formulate both the selection of the dictionary columns and the sparse representation of signals as a joint combinatorial optimization problem. The proposed combinatorial objective maximizes variance reduction over the set of training signals by constraining the size of the dictionary as well as the number of dictionary columns that can be used to represent each signal. We show that if the available dictionary column vectors are incoherent, our objective function satisfies approximate submodularity. We exploit this property to develop SDS<sub>OMP</sub> and SDS<sub>MA</sub>, two greedy algorithms with approximation guarantees.

One uses an analytically derived formula based on the minimal safety gap required to avoid a collision. The other method uses a machine learning approach. The application works by disseminating reports about vehicles that are performing emergency deceleration in effort to warn drivers about the need to perform emergency braking. Vehicles receiving such reports have to decide whether the information contained in the report is relevant to the driver, and warn the driver if that is the case. Common ways to determine relevance are based on the lane or direction information, but using only these attributes can still lead to many false warnings, which can desensitize the driver. Desensitized drivers may ignore warnings or turn off the system completely, thus eliminating any safety benefits of the application. We show that the machine learning method, in comparison to the analytically derived formula, is able to significantly reduce the number of false warnings by learning from the actions drivers take after receiving a report.

Based on this model, we formulate the random PU network detection problem in which the CR network detects the presence of a PU receiver within a given detection area. To address this problem, we propose a location-aware cooperative sensing algorithm that linearly combines multiple sensing results from secondary users (SUs) according to their geographical locations. In particular, we invoke the Fisher linear discriminant analysis to determine the linear coefficients for combining the sensing results. The simulation results show that the proposed sensing algorithm yields comparable performance to the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) detector and outperforms the existing ones, such as equal coefficient combining, OR-rule-based and AND-rule-based cooperative sensing algorithms, by a very wide margin.","1536-1276;15361276","","10.1109/TWC.2011.040411.101430","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5751185","Cognitive radio;Fisher linear discriminant analysis;cooperative spectrum sensing;energy detection;location awareness;machine learning;opportunistic spectrum access;random geometric network","Algorithm design and analysis;Detectors;Fading;Linear discriminant analysis;Network topology;Vectors","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;maximum likelihood detection;mobility management (mobile radio);radio spectrum management","cognitive radio;cooperative spectrum sensing;fisher linear discriminant analysis;geographical locations;location aware algorithm;maximum likelihood detector;network detection problem;primary user;random geometric network","","23","","35","","20110415","June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Despite this, current network management ignores the information from social networks. On the other hand, due to their limited and fluctuating bandwidth, mobile ad hoc networks are inherently resource-constrained. As traffic load increases, we need to decide when and how to throttle the traffic to maximize user satisfaction while keeping the network operational. The state-of-the-art for making these decisions is based on network measurements and so employs a reactive approach to deteriorating network state by reducing the amount of traffic admitted into the network. However, a better approach is to avoid congestion before it occurs, by (a) monitoring the network for early onset signals of congestive phase transition, and (b) predicting future network traffic using user and application information from the overlaying social network. We use machine learning methods to predict the amount of traffic load that can be admitted without transitioning the network to a congestive phase and to predict the source and destination of near future traffic load. These two predictions when fed into an admission control component ensure better management of constrained network resources while maximizing the quality of user experience.","1573-0077;15730077","Electronic:978-1-4244-9221-3; POD:978-1-4244-9219-0; USB:978-1-4244-9220-6","10.1109/INM.2011.5990558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990558","Communication Networks Resource Utilization and Management;End-to-end Network Load Prediction;Machine Learning;Network Phase Transition;QoS;Social Network;Support Vector Machine","Ad hoc networks;Mobile computing;Monitoring;USA Councils","computer network management;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online);telecommunication traffic","admission control component;communication network management;computer networks;congestive phase transition;constrained network resources;demand prediction;machine learning methods;mobile ad hoc networks;network measurements;quality of user experience;resource estimation;social network;traffic load;user satisfaction","","3","1","37","","","23-27 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Current pay-as-you-go pricing schemes typically charge on the incurred virtual machine hours. Our case studies demonstrate significant variations in the user costs, indicating significant unfairness among different users from the micro-economic perspective. Further studies reveal the reason for such variations is interference among concurrent virtual machines. The amount of interference cost depends on various factors, including workload characteristics, the number of concurrent VMs, and scheduling in the cloud. In this paper, we adopt the concept of pricing fairness from micro economics, and quantitatively analyze the impact of interference on the pricing fairness. To solve the unfairness caused by interference, we propose a pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme, which charges users according to their effective resource consumption excluding interference. The key idea behind the pay-as-you-consume pricing scheme is a machine learning based prediction model of the relative cost of interference.

When a test instance has a missing value of a certain attribute, we regard the attribute as the aiming attribute and apply the instance to the network, it will produce a prediction value . This paper uses real datasets from the telecom industry as the test datasets. The result shows that the algorithm can be used to predict the missing value of telecom industry with good performance.","","DVD:978-1-4244-9761-4; Electronic:978-1-4244-9763-8; POD:978-1-4244-9762-1","10.1109/CSSS.2011.5974714","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5974714","BP neural network;K-means;data prediction;machine learning","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Neurons;Prediction algorithms;Telecommunications;Training","backpropagation;data mining;neural nets;pattern clustering;telecommunication industry","BP neural network;K-means algorithm;data mining technology;data prediction algorithm;missing value prediction method;telecom industry","","0","","6","","","27-29 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three different CRF models are proposed for our task, for different choices of tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Three types of features are used, characterizing the local harmony, note attacks and tempo. We also propose a novel hierarchical approach, which takes advantage of the score structure for an approximate decoding of the statistical model. This strategy reduces the complexity, yielding a better overall efficiency than the classic beam search method used in HMM-based models. Experiments run on a large database of classical piano and popular music exhibit very accurate alignments. Indeed, with the best performing system, more than 95% of the note onsets are detected with a precision finer than 100 ms. We additionally show how the proposed framework can be modified in order to be robust to possible structural differences between the score and the musical performance.","1558-7916;15587916","","10.1109/TASL.2011.2134092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5752828","Audio signal processing;Viterbi algorithm;conditional random fields (CRFs);machine learning;music;music-to-score alignment","Complexity theory;Concurrent computing;Context;Decoding;Hidden Markov models;Real time systems;Robustness","audio signal processing;decoding;hidden Markov models;music","HMM-based models;approximate decoding;beam search method;classical piano;conditional random field framework;flexible dependency structures;popular music exhibit;robust audio-to-score matching;scalable audio-to-score matching;statistical models","","24","","43","","20110421","Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

After testing a set of services, there is typically a very large quantity and variety of test results to be analyzed, which poses a challenge to the developer that has to manually process all results and identify the out-puts that indicate the presence of bugs in the code. Previous research indicates that well-known automatic classification algorithms can be used to automate this step. However, the applicability of such algorithms is also limited, as they are frequently unable to deal with the large diversity of outputs present in typical WS scenarios, thus producing incorrect results. In this paper we propose an approach that allows the automatic classification of the results of WS robustness tests. The technique integrates rule-based classification (including domain rules) and conventional machine-learning algorithms trained using generic data. The proposed approach was used to classify a large set of results of tests performed over publicly available WS and also over in-house implementations of several TPC benchmarks. Results show the effectiveness of the technique, indicating that it can be integrated in the robustness testing procedure, enabling, in this way, the delivery of a full end-to-end automatic approach for WSs robustness testing.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4462-5; POD:978-1-4577-0863-3","10.1109/SCC.2011.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6009259","classification;machine learning;robustness testing;web services","Classification algorithms;Computer crashes;Robustness;Simple object access protocol;Testing;Training","Web services;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program testing","TPC benchmarks;Web services;automatic classification;machine learning algorithms;robustness testing;rule-based classification","","1","","26","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Due to these characteristics of the game, a competitive agent must manage luck and use opponent modeling to be successful at short term and therefore be profitable. In this paper we propose the creation of No Limit Hold'em Poker agents by copying strategies of the best human players, by analyzing past games between them. To accomplish this goal, first we determine the best players on a set of game logs by determining which ones have higher winning expectation. Next, we define a classification problem to represent the player strategy, by associating a game state with the performed action. To validate and test the defined player model, the HoldemML framework was created. This framework generates agents by classifying the data present on the game logs with the goal to copy the best human player tactics. The created agents approximately follow the tactics from the counterpart human player, thus validating the defined player model. However, this approach proved to be insufficient to create a competitive agent, since the generated strategies were static, which means that they are easy prey to opponents that can perform opponent modeling. This issue can be solved by combining multiple tactics from different players. This way, the agent switches the tactic from time to time, using a simple heuristic, in order to confuse the opponent modeling mechanisms.","2166-0727;21660727","Electronic:978-989-96247-5-7; POD:978-1-4673-0175-6","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5974356","Artificial Intelligence;Data Mining;Machine Learning;Opponent Modeling;Poker","Clocks;Computational modeling;Games;Generators;Rivers","computer games;data analysis;data mining;pattern classification;software agents","HoldemML;No Limit Hold'em Poker agents;artificial intelligence;best human player tactics;competitive agent;computer game;computer program;data classification;game logs;game state;human player strategy;human players;luck management;opponent modeling;past game analysis;player model;winning expectation","","1","","19","","","15-18 June 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The first algorithm is a semi-supervised sentiment classifier which combines knowledge of the sentiment labels for a few documents and words with information present in unlabeled data, which is abundant online. The second algorithm assumes existence of a set of labeled documents in a domain related to the domain of interest, and leverages these data to estimate sentiment in the target domain. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods by showing they outperform several standard techniques for the task of inferring the sentiment of online movie and consumer product reviews.

This paper proposes a novel cascade face detection architecture based on a reduced two-field feature extraction scheme for faster integral image calculation and feature extraction. This scheme reduces the required memory for storing integral images by 75%, and employs multiple register files instead of a single SRAM to speed up the integral image updating and feature extraction processes. The reduced integral images have only 5% of the features of original images.

In this paper, we will look at detecting spam and phishing over the Twitter network. We argue that spammers and phishers use specific keywords to entice a twitter to click on a link. This link could lead them to a malicious web form. A phishing or spam message has both words and a URL. Twitter is also limited to 140 characters per message. This makes the words used in the message much more important. Bayesian is a popular spam email approach that uses the absence or presence of a word to indicate what to label the message as a whole. We will eliminate Bayesian as a viable option and propose the use of logistic regression model. Current studies place emphases on the follower/followee ratio. We are going to prove that ratio is wrong.

These techniques are also applied on this database to develop expert systems to diagnose the diseases affected to sheep and goat animals. The system diagnoses the diseases for the different symptoms entered by the user dynamically. If the symptoms entered by the user matches to the rules already available in the Knowledge base designed by the expert, it displays the actual disease with which sheep is suffering with. Else it displays a message saying that the knowledge is insufficient. In this case the system calls the technique called, Particle Swarm Optimization. Using this system determines the narrowest probabilistic disease with which the animal is suffering.

However, the high dimensionality and intrinsically low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of fMRI data poses great challenges to such techniques. The problem is aggravated in the case of multiple subject experiments because of the high inter-subject variability in brain function. To address these difficulties, in this paper we propose using an ensemble of classifiers for decoding visual stimuli from fMRI data. Each classifier in the ensemble specializes in one stimulus by using an optimized feature set for that particular stimulus. The output for each individual stimulus is therefore obtained from the corresponding classifier and the final classification is achieved by simply selecting the best score. The proposed method was applied to two empirical fMRI datasets from multiple subjects performing visual tasks with 4 classes of stimuli. Our results indicate that an ensemble of classifiers may provide an advantageous alternative to commonly used single classifiers, particularly when decoding stimuli associated with specific brain areas.","1945-7928;19457928","Electronic:978-1-4244-4128-0; POD:978-1-4244-4127-3","10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872410","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872410","Ensemble of classifiers;brain decoding;fMRI;machine learning;visual localizer","Accuracy;Brain;Decoding;Humans;Machine learning;Training;Visualization","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;decoding;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;visual perception","brain activity;classifier ensembles;cognitive states;fMRI;functional magnetic resonance imaging;intersubject variability;machine learning;optimized feature selection;perceptual states;signal-to-noise ratio;visual stimuli decoding","","0","","18","","","March 30 2011-April 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The analysis of biological high content images often requires segmentation as a first step. We propose ilastik as an easy-to-use tool which allows the user without expertise in image processing to perform segmentation and classification in a unified way. ilastik learns from labels provided by the user through a convenient mouse interface. Based on these labels, ilastik infers a problem specific segmentation. A random forest classifier is used in the learning step, in which each pixel's neighborhood is characterized by a set of generic (nonlinear) features. ilastik supports up to three spatial plus one spectral dimension and makes use of all dimensions in the feature calculation. ilastik provides realtime feedback that enables the user to interactively refine the segmentation result and hence further fine-tune the classifier. An uncertainty measure guides the user to ambiguous regions in the images. Real time performance is achieved by multi-threading which fully exploits the capabilities of modern multi-core machines. Once a classifier has been trained on a set of representative images, it can be exported and used to automatically process a very large number of images (e.g. using the CellProfiler pipeline). ilastik is an open source project and released under the BSD license at www.ilastik.org.","1945-7928;19457928","Electronic:978-1-4244-4128-0; POD:978-1-4244-4127-3","10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872394","Interactive classification;image segmentation;machine learning;software tools","Biomedical imaging;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Neurons;Observers;Retina;Three dimensional displays","biomedical optical imaging;feature extraction;graphical user interfaces;image classification;image segmentation;medical image processing;neurophysiology;pipeline arithmetic;spectral analysis","3D neuron data;CellProfiler pipeline;Ilastik;feature calculation;graphical user interface;image classification;image classifier;image processing;interactive learning;mouse interface;multicore machines;open source project;partitioning digital images;random forest classifier;segmentation toolkit;spectral dimension;uncertainty measure guides","","71","","16","","","March 30 2011-April 2 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed algorithm can automatically adapt its internal parameters and model structure to obtain new patterns, depending on the current dynamics of the data stream. SAIRT can monitor the usefulness of nodes and can forget examples from selected regions, storing the remaining ones in local windows associated to the leaves of the tree. On these conditions, current regression methods need a careful configuration depending on the dynamics of the problem.

Effective use of nematicides at a variable rate is the only economic counter measure. It requires the nematode population in the field to be known, which in turn depends on the collection of soil samples from the field and analyzing them in the laboratory. This process is economically prohibitive. Hence there is a need to develop alternative methods through which the actual numbers of reniform nematode present in the field can be determined. In this paper we propose a methodology in which a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) is inverted using machine learning approaches to retrieve the biophysical parameters, and relate the key variables to the nematode levels, so that it is possible to quantify at all multi-temporal intervals the nematode infestation at geographically distributed fields. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) Regression method is used for the inversion and retrieval of key biophysical parameters which help to understand and quantify the nature of the nematode infested vegetation. The performance of this approach is analyzed by the accuracy measures of RMSE and N-fold cross validation average on a considerable data set. Finally, a graphical web portal is being developed to facilitate the end users to use their field collected data to determine the extent of the nematode infestation in their crop and retrieve other spatio-temporal statistics.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1203-6; POD:978-1-4577-1202-9","10.1109/Multi-Temp.2011.6005095","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005095","Kernel Principal Component Analysis;Rotylenchulus reniformis;machine learning;support vector machines","Biological system modeling;Cotton;Data models;Predictive models;Reflectivity;Support vector machines","crops;ecology;geophysical techniques;geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);portals;principal component analysis;regression analysis;soil;support vector machines","Rotylenchulus reniformis;biophysical parameters;canopy reflectance model;cotton crop;geographically distributed fields;graphical web portal;hyperspectral reflectance data;kernel principal component analysis;machine learning approaches;model inversion methodology;multitemporal intervals;nematode infestation;nematode infested vegetation;nematode levels;nematode population;nematode species;reniform nematode;soil samples;southeastern United States;spatiotemporal statistics;support vector machine regression method","","0","","7","","","12-14 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that the optimization problem can be reformulated and decomposed into small-scale sub optimization problems by using the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method. Generally speaking, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can only be used for convex optimization problems, where the duality gaps are zero. Although, the considered optimization problem in this paper is non-convex, we prove that the duality gap goes to zero, as the problem size goes to infinity. Therefore, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can be applied here. In the proposed approach, the clustering problem is iteratively solved by a group of computers coordinated by one center processor, where each computer solves one independent small-scale sub optimization problem during each iteration, and only a small amount of data communication is needed between the computers and center processor.

In this article we introduce a novel approach to this problem that treats a state space as a collection of data from which latent information can be extrapolated. From this data, we classify actions as leading to a high reward or low reward, and formulate behaviors based on this information.

This architecture-centric approach uses prior knowledge from offline training and applies it across benchmarks. This allows our model to predict the performance of any new program across the entire microarchitecture configuration space with just 32 further simulations. First, we analyze our design space and show how different microarchitectural parameters can affect the cycles, energy, energy-delay (ED), and energy-delay-squared (EDD) of the architectural configurations. We show the accuracy of our predictor on SPEC CPU 2000 and how it can be used to predict programs from a different benchmark suite. We then compare our approach to a state-of-the-art program-specific predictor and show that we significantly reduce prediction error. We reduce the average error when predicting performance from 24 percent to just seven percent and increase the correlation coefficient from 0.55 to 0.95.

This paper surveys Constrained Conditional Models (CCMs), a framework that augments probabilistic models with declarative constraints as a way to support decisions in an expressive output space while maintaining modularity and tractability of training. We show how CCMs are a very natural choice for modeling an information fusion system which aims to coherently predict multiple output variables with very little information. We also present and discuss an information fusion scenario in detail and show how CCMs can be applied to this scenario.

The first method is a bipartite graph-based machine learning algorithm which enables information concerning previous attacks to be “transferred” for application against novel attacks, thereby substantially increasing the rate with which defense systems can successfully respond to new attacks. The second approach involves exploiting basic threat information (e.g., from cyber security analysts) to generate “synthetic” attack data for use in training defense systems, resulting in networks defenses that are effective against both current and (near) future attacks. The utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated by showing that they outperform standard techniques for the task of detecting malicious network activity in two publicly-available cyber datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-0085-9; POD:978-1-4577-0082-8","10.1109/ISI.2011.5984062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5984062","cyber security;machine learning;predictive analysis;proactive defense;security informatics","Glass;Niobium","computer network security;evolutionary computation;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence)","attack data;attack strategy;bipartite graph-based machine learning algorithm;coevolutionary relationship;computer network protection;cyber defense;cyber security analysis;defense design;defense system training;evolving cyber threats;intrusion;malicious network activity detection;previous attack information;proactive network defense;threat information","","12","","18","","","10-12 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Maurer","Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., McLean, VA, USA","2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","20110908","2011","","","597","601","This paper presents a prototype system for generalized searching of cloud-scale biometric data as well as an application of this system to the task of matching a collection of synthetic human iris images. First, we discuss growth trends in the biometric technology market that warrant the application of new data storage and retrieval technologies. Next, we discuss the considerations that motivated our decisions when designing our prototype framework. We then discuss the underlying open source components that we selected for the prototype, its API design, and the relationship between the API and the underlying architecture. We provide details of our implementation of human iris matching within our prototype framework. Finally, we discuss opportunities for future research.","2378-3818;23783818","Electronic:978-0-7695-4461-8; POD:978-1-4577-0879-4","10.1109/SERVICES.2011.95","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012798","Hadoop;biometrics;cloud computing;distributed key-value stores;iris matching;machine learning","Distributed databases;Iris recognition;Organizations;Prototypes;Servers","application program interfaces;biometrics (access control);cloud computing;image matching;information retrieval;iris recognition;public domain software;software prototyping","API design;cloud scale biometric data;data retrieval;data storage;next generation biometric system;open source components;performance requirements;prototype system;synthetic human iris image matching","","17","","21","","","4-9 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
