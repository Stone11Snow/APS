Problematic characteristics of current biomedical tokenizers include idiosyncratic tokenizer output and poor tokenizer extensibility and reuse. To address these problematic characteristics, we identified and completed a novel tokenizer design pattern for biomedical tokenizers. We separated a tokenizer into three components: a token lattice and lattice constructor, a best lattice-path chooser and token transducers. Token transducers create tokens from text. These tokens are assembled into a token lattice by the lattice constructor. The best path (tokenization) is selected from the token lattice, tokenizing the text. We applied our design pattern and our token transducer identification guidelines in the creation of a tokenizer for SNOMED CT concept descriptions and compared our tokenizer to three other tokenizer methods. Medpost and our adapted Viterbi tokenizer perform best with a 90.1% and 93.7% accuracy respectively.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708873","Machine Learning;Medicine and Science;Natural Language Processing;Patterns","Guidelines;Helium;Lattices;Software;Tagging;Transducers;Viterbi algorithm","medicine;natural language processing;text analysis","adapted Viterbi algorithm;biomedical text;biomedical tokenizer;idiosyncratic tokenizer;lattice constructor;lattice-path chooser;token lattice design pattern;token transducer identification guidelines;tokenization;tokenizer design pattern;tokenizer extensibility","","0","","25","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Existing policies that address this tradeoff typically have parameters that are set a priori to control the amount of exploration. In finite-time problems, the optimal values of these parameters are highly dependent on the problem faced. In this paper, we propose adapting the amount of exploration performed on-line, as information is gathered by the agent. To this end we introduce a novel algorithm, e-ADAPT, which has no free parameters. The algorithm adapts as it plays and sequentially chooses whether to explore or exploit, driven by the amount of uncertainty in the system. We provide simulation results for the one armed bandit with covariates problem, which demonstrate the effectiveness of e-ADAPT to correctly control the amount of exploration in finite-time problems and yield rewards that are close to optimally tuned off-line policies. Furthermore, we show that e-ADAPT is robust to a high-dimensional covariate, as well as misspecified models. Finally, we describe how our methods could be extended to other sequential decision making problems, such as dynamic bandit problems with changing reward structures.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.74","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708871","Exploration-exploitation tradeoff;on-line learning;one-armed bandit problem;sequential decision making","Approximation methods;Estimation;Games;Machine learning;Optimized production technology;Radio frequency;Uncertainty","covariance analysis;decision making;decision theory;iterative methods;multi-agent systems;optimisation","Îµ-ADAPT;decision making;exploitation;exploration;finite-time problems;one-armed bandit;online adaptation","","3","","20","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm, which we call greedy RLS, starts from the empty feature set, and on each iteration adds the feature whose addition provides the best leave-one-out cross-validation performance. Our method is considerably faster than the previously proposed ones, since its time complexity is linear in the number of training examples, the number of features in the original data set, and the desired size of the set of selected features. Therefore, as a side effect we obtain a new training algorithm for learning sparse linear RLS predictors which can be used for large scale learning. This speed is possible due to matrix calculus based short-cuts for leave-one-out and feature addition.

Classifier models have to be adapted online to maintain a high recognition performance. Typical approaches for online learning are either unsupervised and potentially unstable, or require ground truth information which may be expensive to obtain. As an alternative we propose a teacher signal that can be provided by the user in a minimally obtrusive way. It indicates if the predicted activity for a feature vector is correct or wrong. To exploit this information we propose a novel incremental online learning strategy to adapt a k-nearest-neighbor classifier from instances that are indicated to be correctly or wrongly classified. We characterize our approach on an artificial dataset with abrupt distribution change that simulates a new user of an activity recognition system. The adapted classifier reaches the same accuracy as a classifier trained specifically for the new data distribution. The learning based on the provided correct - error signal also results in a faster learning speed compared to online learning from ground truth. We validate our approach on a real world gesture recognition dataset.

The straightforward implementation of the algorithm is often referred to as `brute force' since it computes a proximity measure from each data point to each centroid at every iteration of the K-Means process. Efficient implementations of the K-Means algorithm have been predominantly based on multi-dimensional binary search trees (KD-Trees). A combination of an efficient data structure and geometrical constraints allow to reduce the number of distance computations required at each iteration. In this work we present a general space partitioning approach for improving the efficiency and the scalability of the K-Means algorithm. We propose to adopt approximate hierarchical clustering methods to generate binary space partitioning trees in contrast to KD-Trees. In the experimental analysis, we have tested the performance of the proposed Binary Space Partitioning K-Means (BSP-KM) when a divisive clustering algorithm is used. We have carried out extensive experimental tests to compare the proposed approach to the one based on KD-Trees (KD-KM) in a wide range of the parameters space. BSP-KM is more scalable than KDKM, while keeping the deterministic nature of the `brute force' algorithm. In particular, the proposed space partitioning approach has shown to overcome the well-known limitation of KD-Trees in high-dimensional spaces and can also be adopted to improve the efficiency of other algorithms in which KD-Trees have been used.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.46","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708851","Clustering;K-Means;Space Partitioning Trees","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data structures;Force;Indexes;Partitioning algorithms","pattern clustering;tree data structures;tree searching","KD-tree;approximate hierarchical clustering;binary space partitioning k-means;binary space partitioning trees;brute force algorithm;centroid;data partition;data point;data structure;distance computation;geometrical constraint;iterative refinement procedure;multidimensional binary search tree;scalable k-means clustering algorithm","","5","","16","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We compare this technique to the state-of-the-art, a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), showing that the DBN outperforms the SVM by the F<sub>1</sub> measure for our EEG dataset. We also show how the outputs of a DBN-based detector can be used to aid visualization of anomalies in large EEG data sets and propose a method for using DBNs to gain insight into which features of signals are characteristically anomalous.

The use of correlation has been inspired by the concept of regression whereas the use of mutual information has been largely motivated by information theory. In a statistical sense, however, the concept of dependence is much broader, and extends beyond correlation and mutual information. In this paper, we explore the fundamental notion of statistical dependence in the context of variable selection.

The MEA is capable of recording at a very high sampling rate (30 KHz) producing an avalanche of time series data. We explore subsets of this data to build seizure detectors - we discuss several methods for extracting univariate and bivariate features from the channels and study the effectiveness of using high dimensional clustering algorithms such as K-means and Subspace clustering for constructing the model.

On one hand, SiLA is interested in directly reducing the leave-one-out error or 0-1 loss by reducing the number of mistakes on unseen examples. On the other hand, it has been shown that RELIEF could be seen as a distance learning algorithm in which a linear utility function with maximum margin was optimized. We first propose here a version of this algorithm for similarity learning, called RBS (for RELIEF-Based Similarity learning). As RELIEF, and unlike SiLA, RBS does not try to optimize the leave-one-out error or 0-1 loss, and does not perform very well in practice, as we illustrate on two UCI collections. We thus introduce a stricter version of RBS, called sRBS, aiming at relying on a cost function closer to the 0-1 loss. Experiments conducted on several datasets illustrate the different behaviors of these algorithms for learning similarities for kNN classification. The results indicate in particular that the 0-1 loss is a more appropriate cost function than the one implicitly used by RELIEF.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708831","RELIEF algorithm;SiLA algorithm;kNN classification;machine learning;similarity learning","Cost function;Equations;Machine learning algorithms;Nearest neighbor searches;Support vector machine classification;Symmetric matrices;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","0-1 loss;RELIEF-based similarity learning;SiLA;cost function closer;distance learning;feature reweighting algorithm;kNN classification;learning similarities;leave-one-out error;linear utility function;maximum margin;nearest neighbor;relief algorithm","","1","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The RTC approach is used to build a prototypes matrix which contains continuous variables, where each prototype vector represents correlated categorical data. Thereafter, the statistical ScreeTest is used to detect relevant and correlated features (or modalities) for each prototype.

The main idea is to divide the decision into several partial decisions and then to aggregate these to get the final one. The adaptation is the result of the aggregation process which aims at selecting and summarizing the partial decisions which are based on coherent information according to learnt models. The suggested method is presented. Experiments on a two-class image segmentation problem are performed and analyzed.

With this method, a Bayesian Network is learned from traces of program execution that allows both constructive and destructive dependencies between instructions to be determined and a joint distribution over the number of cache hits to be found.

In fact, most correlated users have similar ratings only on a subset of items. In this paper, we consider a kernel-based classification approach for collaborative filtering and propose several kernel matrix construction methods by using biclusters to capture pair wise similarity between users. In order to characterize accurate correlation among users, we embed both local information and global information into the similarity matrix.

The core idea is to initially make predictions with one network (the observable or O net) based on a time delay embedding, following this with a gradual reduction in the temporal scope of the embedding that forces a second network (the latent or L net) to learn to approximate the value of a single hidden variable, which is then input to the O net based on the original time delay embedding.

Despite the notable progress made in the field, there remains a need for an architecture that can represent temporal information with the same ease that spatial information is discovered. In this work, we present new results using a recently introduced deep learning architecture called Deep Spatio-Temporal Inference Network (DeSTIN). DeSTIN is a discriminative deep learning architecture that combines concepts from unsupervised learning for dynamic pattern representation together with Bayesian inference. In DeSTIN the spatiotemporal dependencies that exist within the observations are modeled inherently in an unguided manner. Each node models the inputs by means of clustering and simple dynamics modeling while it constructs a belief state over the distribution of sequences using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that information from the different layers of this hierarchical system can be extracted and utilized for the purpose of pattern classification. Earlier simulation results indicated that the framework is highly promising, consequently in this work we expand DeSTIN to a popular problem, the MNIST data set of handwritten digits. The system as a preprocessor to a neural network achieves a recognition accuracy of 97.98% on this data set.

The expression data of a large number of genes from small numbers of subjects are used to identify informative biomarkers that may predict or help in diagnosing some disorders. More recently, increasing amounts of information from underlying relationships of the expressed genes have become available, and workers have started to investigate algorithms which can use such a priori information to improve classification or regression based on gene expression. In this paper, we describe three novel machine learning algorithms for regularizing (smoothing) micro array expression values defined on gene sets with known prior network or metric structures, and which exploit this gene interaction information. These regularized expression values can be used with any machine classifier with the goal of better classification. In this paper, standard smoothing (denoising) techniques previously developed for functions on Euclidean spaces are extended to allow smoothing of micro array expression feature vectors using distance measures defined by biological networks. Such a priori smoothing (denoising) of the feature vectors using metrics on the index space (here the space of genes) yields better signal to noise ratios in the data. When tested on two breast cancer datasets, support vector machine classifiers trained on the smoothed expression values obtain better areas under ROC curves in two cancer datasets.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708883","Clustering;Gene Expression;Smoothing;Support Vector Regression","Gene expression;Kernel;Measurement;Noise reduction;Smoothing methods;Support vector machines","bioinformatics;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);patient diagnosis;pattern classification;regression analysis;support vector machines","Euclidean spaces;a priori smoothing;bioinformatics;biological network;breast cancer dataset;classification improvement;denoising technique;disorder diagnosing;gene expression smoothing;gene interaction information;informative biomarker;machine learning algorithm;micro array expression feature vector smoothing;regression improvement;signal to noise ratios;support vector machine classifier","","0","","34","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Scale 1 consists of components that are made up of large populations of HH neurons whose topological structure evolves according to a Hebbian-plasticity rule based on synchronous firing. The component's state is captured by the variance of phase synchrony for the population. Many such components are sparsely connected to form a large network, whose state can be captured by the n-tuple consisting of the individual states of each member component. Scale 2 takes the state of the overall network and upon examining the particular interrelationships of each component (determining how the state of one component affects the state of others) is able to generate a class of trajectories that is multistationary and stable periodic. Such a class we consider a memory, the encoding of many such memories leads to the creation of a robust associative memory.

This is accomplished by first determining a quantitative relationship between a forcing function, such as temperature, and the modern for aminiferal response using a calibration data set based on environmental data from an oceanographic atlas and faunas generally extracted from sediment core tops. The method can be employed with a variety of environmental variables, but reconstruction of surface temperature is often the objective. The relationship developed using this training or calibration data set is then applied to down core data to infer past environmental conditions. The statistical methods that have been previously applied in this area can be grouped into three categories: linear regression based approaches, locally weighted regressions and neural networks. In addition to introducing some other learning algorithms including regression trees, bagging trees, random forest and support vector regression to this domain, in this study we suggest the use of model combination approaches to enhance the precision of estimation. By initializing with a pool of diverse predictors using a variety of learning algorithms and different samplings from the training and attribute set, a genetic algorithm was applied to select the best team of predictors.

Recently, wrapper methods have been proposed as an improvement over traditionally used filter based feature selection methods. In wrapper methods, the goodness of a feature set is often measured using the cross-validation performance of a machine learning method trained with the features. This can lead to over fitting, meaning that the cross-validation performance on the final selected feature set may be high even in cases when the selected features in fact are not informative. Evaluating the statistical significance of gained results is therefore of major concern. Non-parametric permutation tests have been previously used as a univariate filter for selecting individual features. In contrast, we propose using such tests to measure the statistical significance of the whole selection process, which is carried out by a wrapper method. We achieve computational efficiency by using a regularized least-squares based wrapper method, which combines a state-of-the-art classifier with matrix calculus based computational shortcuts for greedy forward feature selection. Permutation tests prove to be a practical tool for estimating the significance of gained results, as shown in simulations and experiments on two DNA micro array data sets.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.158","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708982","feature selection;permutation test;wrapper methods","Breast cancer;Colon;DNA;Prediction algorithms;Training;Training data","bioinformatics;data mining;feature extraction;greedy algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;statistical analysis","DNA micro array data;bioinformatics applications;cross validation performance;filter based feature selection methods;gene selection;greedy forward feature selection;machine learning method;nonparametric permutation test;permutation tests;regularized least squares based wrapper method;selection process;statistical significance;wrapper based feature selection;wrapper methods","","0","","21","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important problem that has been widely studied is that of autonomous navigation systems, through which attempts have been made to create mechanisms with their own decision making in complex environments. Ideally, an autonomous navigation agent must have an ability to learn while working in its environment. This acquisition of knowledge may be based on a history of actions taken to make decisions without the guidance of a tutor. The performance of the agent may depend on its ability to learn and adapt. This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based method applied to a navigation problem. Using a Q-Learning algorithm, we propose a model to provide autonomous navigation with a policy modified by information from a greedy heuristic. The model aims to improve the performance of the agent with regard to its navigation task.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4300-0; POD:978-1-4244-9211-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.13","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708810","Autonomous Navigation;Dynamic Environments;Reinforcement Learning","Adaptation model;Equations;Heuristic algorithms;Learning;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Navigation","knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;path planning;software agents","Q-learning algorithm;autonomous navigation agent;autonomous navigation system;dynamic environment;greedy heuristic;knowledge acquisition;reinforcement learning","","3","","15","","","12-14 Dec. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Moreover, most of the techniques presented so far in the literature can generate ambiguous regions. All-at-Once methods have been proposed to solve this issue.

Our models are advantageous when within-component class proportions are not constant over the feature space region ""owned by'' a component. In this paper, we develop an active learning extension of our fine-grained labeling methods. We propose two new uncertainty sampling methods in comparison with traditional entropy-based uncertainty sampling. Our experiments on a number of UC Irvine data sets show that the proposed active learning methods improve classification accuracy more than standard entropy-based active learning.

It is the antigen that inducing immune responses and currently be used as the influenza vaccine potency marker. Epitope are some segments in the antigen which could be recognized by the immune system specifically and induce immune response. The T-cell epitopes of protein antigens are some peptides that presented on the cell surface by MHC molecules via the MHC class I pathway or the MHC class II pathway. The antigen presentation mechanisms are different in these two pathways. The MHC class I pathway is used to present endogeneous antigens to cytotoxic T cell, while the MHC class II pathway is used to present the extracellular antigens to helper T cell. The epitope with strong immune response is good target for vaccine design. Recently, the type of H2N2 influenza has a tendency towards popular again. To understand the immunogenicity variation among the HA proteins of H2N2 influenza for the past decade is important for deciphering the infection tendency. It is also a clue to design effective vaccine in advance. Fuzzy measure considers a series of special classes of measures and defined by a special property, respectively. The concept of fuzzy measure theory was introduced by Choquet in 1953 and independently defined by Sugeno in 1974 in the context of fuzzy integrals. The Choquet integral is a fuzzy integral based on any fuzzy measure that provides a computational scheme for information aggregation. In this study, we proposed a novel algorithm with high accuracy in immunogenicity prediction based on fuzzy measure and SVM classifier. Accordingly, we applied this prediction method to assess the immunogenicity variation on the HA protein of H2N2 influenza virus for the past three decades. The results show that the immunogenicity strength decreased for MHC class II response that implied the increasing tendency of influenza outbreak by H2N2 virus.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016797","Hemagglutinin;SVM;epitope;fuzzy integral;fuzzy measure;influenza immunogenicity","Current measurement;Immune system;Proteins;Support vector machines;Tiles","biology;fuzzy set theory;microorganisms;proteins;support vector machines","Choquet integral;H2N2 influenza virus;HA protein;SVM classifier;T-cell epitopes;antigen presentation mechanism;extracellular antigens;fuzzy integral;fuzzy measure theory;hemagglutinin;immune response;immune system;immunogenicity prediction;immunogenicity variation;infection process;influenza vaccine potency marker;information aggregation;protein antigens;surface protein;vaccine design","","0","","17","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This FCMAC is used as the main controller for the trajectory tracking control of the robot. In this robotic system, an inertial navigation system (INS) including gyroscopes and accelerometers is used to measure the robot's attitude and acceleration for modifying the dynamic attitude of the robot. Moreover, a zero moment point (ZMP) compensator is used to on-line adjust the gait trajectories to improve the walking stability. The control system is implemented based on system on a programmable chip (SoPC) technology. Thus, this intelligent control system can achieve real-time on-line closed-loop feedback control of the humanoid robot. Experimental results show that the developed system can achieve favorable control performance for a high-order nonlinear humanoid robot.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016883","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016883","Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC);Fuzzy system;Humanoid robot;System on Programmable Chip (SoPC);Zero moment point (ZMP)","Adaptive systems;Humanoid robots;Intelligent control;Legged locomotion;Trajectory","accelerometers;attitude control;attitude measurement;cerebellar model arithmetic computers;closed loop systems;compensation;control system synthesis;feedback;fuzzy control;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;generalisation (artificial intelligence);gyroscopes;humanoid robots;inertial navigation;learning systems;neurocontrollers;nonlinear control systems;position control;robot dynamics;stability;system-on-chip","SoPC technology;acceleration emeasurement;accelerometers;closed-loop feedback control;control performance;fuzzy cerebellar model articulation controller;fuzzy neural network;fuzzy system inference rule;gait trajectory adjustment;generalization network;gyroscopes;high-order nonlinear humanoid robot;inertial navigation system;intelligent control system design;learning ability;robot attitude emeasurement;robot dynamic attitude;system on a programmable chip;trajectory tracking control;walking stability;zero moment point compensator","","1","","13","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To analyze the performance of proposed 3D reconstruction method, some simulated data, including the points on surfaces of a plane, a cylinder and a sphere, is generated to test this approach.

However, as the number of consumer reviews expands rapidly, it becomes more difficult for users to obtain a comprehensive view of consumer opinions pertaining to the products of interest through a manual analysis. The development of techniques capable of automatic analysis and summary of the sentiments of consumer reviews pertaining to specific products becomes desirable and essential. In this study, we concentrate on the sentiment classification of consumer reviews. To address the problem of domain dependency commonly encountered by existing techniques, we proposed a gloss-based sentiment classification technique which is domain-independent in nature.

Therefore, in this paper, a computational system, which is referred to as the dynamic visual system, is proposed to detect and analyze the taillights of the vehicles in front in spatiotemporal domain, and then extract corresponding contextual information.

To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative client/server based web crawling system. This system consists of a crawler server and a crawler client which work in the search engine and website end respectively. The crawler server registers itself to the client and joins into a temporary peer-to-peer network to cooperate and share downloaded data with other crawler servers. Different from the classical crawlers, the data downloading procedure is initialized by a client. So for the crawler server, this is a âpassiveâ web crawling system. The main benefits of this system include the capability of timely management web changes for a crawler, the saving of website bandwidth resources, the capability of downloading large files or multimedia content features, and the capability of protection intellectual properties while indexing and searching the content.

ECG signal measured from the surface of human body is badly effected by different noises like power line noise, muscle noise, lung noise baseline noise. The main causes of baseline noise are breathing, lose sensor contact and body movements. Baseline noise is a low frequency signal. Baseline will disturb the whole cycle of ECG signal but mainly the low frequency part. T-wave is a part of ECG signal related to a phenomenon associated with increased risk of death and baseline wandering may prevent its correct detection. Different algorithm were applied for removal of this noise by different researchers like Kalman filter, Cubic spline, Moving average. We apply projection pursuit gradient ascent algorithm in a previous paper and observe the results in term of standard deviation of the error signal for different types of baseline noises. In this paper I am comparing the results of projection pursuit gradient ascent algorithm (PPGAA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) FASTICA algorithm for removing this noise.
