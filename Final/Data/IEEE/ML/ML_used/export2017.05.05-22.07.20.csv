Applying hierarchical-interpolative fuzzy rule bases has proved an efficient way of reducing the complexity of knowledge bases, whereas memetic techniques often ensure a relatively fast convergence in the learning process.

Several approaches that have attracted attention as promising ways of detecting such malware include employing various blacklists. However, these conventional approaches often fail to detect new attacks owing to the versatility of malicious websites. Thus, it is difficult to maintain up-to-date blacklists with information regarding new malicious websites. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method for detecting malicious websites using the characteristics of IP addresses. Our approach leverages the empirical observation that IP addresses are more stable than other metrics such as URL and DNS. While the strings that form URLs or domain names are highly variable, IP addresses are less variable, i.e., IPv4 address space is mapped onto 4-bytes strings. We develop a lightweight and scalable detection scheme based on the machine learning technique. The aim of this study is not to provide a single solution that effectively detects web-based malware but to develop a technique that compensates the drawbacks of existing approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by using real IP address data from existing blacklists and real traffic data on a campus network. The results demonstrate that our method can expand the coverage/accuracy of existing blacklists and also detect unknown malicious websites that are not covered by conventional approaches.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5640-8; POD:978-1-4673-2001-6; USB:978-0-7695-4737-4","10.1109/SAINT.2012.14","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305258","Blacklist;Drive-by-download;IP address;Machine learning;Web-based malware","Browsers;Feature extraction;IP networks;Malware;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","Web sites;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence)","4-bytes strings;DNS;IP address features;IPv4 address space;URL;Web-based malware attacks;blacklists;campus network;machine learning technique;malicious Websites detection;traffic data","","3","","","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose a tool-based process to parse natural language documents, learn which statements signify policy, and then generate appropriate policy representations. To evaluate the initial work on our process, we analyze four data use agreements for a particular project and classify sentences as to whether or not they pertain to policy, requirements, or neither. Our k-nearest neighbor classifier with a unique distance metric had a precision of 0.82 and a recall of 0.81, outperforming weighted random guess, which had a precision of 0.44 and a recall of 0.46.

However, due to the rapidly growing number of service offerings and the lack of a standard for their specification, manual service selection is a costly task, preventing the successful implementation of ubiquitous computing on demand. In order to counteract these issues, automatic methods for matching SLAs are necessary. In this paper, we introduce a method for finding semantically equal SLA elements from differing SLAs by utilizing several machine learning algorithms.

In general, machine-learning-based business process automation is still viable with reduced classification accuracy due to such false decisions, thanks to business models that replace human decision processes with automated decision processes covering the costs of introducing automation and the losses from rare mistakes by the automation with the profits from relatively large savings in human-factor costs. However, under certain conditions, it is possible for attackers to outsmart a classifier at a reasonable cost and thus destroy the business model that the learner system depends on. Attackers may eventually detect the misclassification cases they can benefit from and try to create similar inputs that will be misclassified by the unaware learner system. We call adversaries of this type ""opportunistic adversaries"". This paper specifies the environmental patterns that can expose vulnerabilities to opportunistic adversaries and presents some likely business scenarios for these threats. Then we propose a countermeasure algorithm to detect such attacks based on change detection in the post-classification data distributions.

To incorporate the constraints, we propose a modified constrained K-Means algorithm. A variety of real-world traffic traces are used to show that the constraints are widely available.

Especially when classification is to be performed over many categories, providing enough training samples for each category is infeasible. This paper describes new ideas in multiclass active learning to deal with the training bottleneck, making it easier to train large multiclass image classification systems. First, we propose a new interaction modality for training which requires only yes-no type binary feedback instead of a precise category label. The modality is especially powerful in the presence of hundreds of categories. For the proposed modality, we develop a Value-of-Information (VOI) algorithm that chooses informative queries while also considering user annotation cost. Second, we propose an active selection measure that works with many categories and is extremely fast to compute. This measure is employed to perform a fast seed search before computing VOI, resulting in an algorithm that scales linearly with dataset size. Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives sublinear time scaling, allowing application to very large datasets. The approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude speedups with little loss in accuracy. Thorough empirical evaluation of classification accuracy, noise sensitivity, imbalanced data, and computational performance on a diverse set of image datasets demonstrates the strengths of the proposed algorithms.","0162-8828;01628828","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.21","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6127880","Active learning;multiclass classification;object recognition;scalable machine learning","Accuracy;Couplings;Learning systems;Noise;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","feedback;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","VOI algorithm;active selection measure;category label;classification accuracy;computer vision;image dataset;informative query;interaction modality;locality sensitive hashing;machine learning technique;magnitude speedup;multiclass active learning;multiclass image classification;noise sensitivity;object recognition;scalable active learning;scene classification;sublinear time scaling;user annotation cost;value-of-information;yes-no type binary feedback","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","37","","45","","20120110","Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"Ensemble based face recognition using discriminant PCA Features","R. Mallipeddi; M. Lee","School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, Korea","2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","20120802","2012","","","1","7","Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used subspace projection technique for face recognition. In subspace methods like PCA, feature selection is fundamental to obtain better face recognition. However, the problem of finding a subset of features from a high dimensional feature set is NP-hard. Therefore, to solve the feature selection problem, heuristic methods such as evolutionary algorithms are gaining importance. In many face recognition applications, due to the small sample size (SSS) problem, it is difficult to construct a single strong classifier. Recently, ensemble learning in face recognition is gaining significance due to its ability to overcome the SSS problem. In this paper, the NP-hard problem of finding the best subset of the extracted PCA features for face recognition is solved by using the differential evolution (DE) algorithm and is referred to as FS-DE. The feature subset is obtained by maximizing the class separation in the training data. We also present an ensemble based approach for face recognition (En-FR), where different subsets of PCA features are obtained by maximizing the distance between a subset of classes of the training data instead of whole classes. The subsets of the classes are obtained by bagging and overlap each other. Each subset of the PCA features selected is used for face recognition and all the outputs are combined by a simple majority voting. The proposed algorithms, FS-DE and En-FR, are evaluated on four wellknown face databases and the performance is compared with the PCA and Fisher's LDA algorithms.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1509-8; POD:978-1-4673-1510-4","10.1109/CEC.2012.6256523","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256523","differential evolution;ensemble learning;face recognition (FR);feature selection;machine learning;principal component analysis (PCA);small-sample-size (SSS) problem","Bagging;Classification algorithms;Databases;Face recognition;Principal component analysis;Training;Vectors","computational complexity;evolutionary computation;face recognition;principal component analysis","NP-hard problem;differential evolution algorithm;discriminant PCA features;ensemble based face recognition;evolutionary algorithms;feature selection;majority voting;principal component analysis;small sample size problem;subspace projection technique","","4","","31","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, many methods for finding attribute reducts from large data sets always meet a difficult problem of combination explosion. To overcome the problem and find some attribute reducts with high efficiency, the algorithm CARHS was proposed. The basic idea of CARHS is: 1) transform the problem into an equivalent one that searches paths, from which attribute reducts can be easily derived, from a graph; 2) employ high efficient heuristic rules during the course of depth-first search on the graph. By means of the heuristic rules, those paths that would not derive attribute reducts could be blocked as early as possible, furthermore, for those paths that would derive the same attribute reduct, only one of them could complete the course of search, and the others could be blocked as early as possible. Thus some attribute reducts could be found by CARHS with high efficiency even when dealing with huge data sets. The transformation of the problem, novel concepts, the heuristic search rules, and the algorithm CARHS were illustrated in detail by some examples. At last, The experiment on three classic UCI data sets showed the effect of the heuristic search rules and the efficiency of the algorithm CARHS.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-1490-9; POD:978-1-4673-1488-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252484","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252484","attribute reduct;data mining;machine learning;reduct discernibility graph","Data mining;Explosions;Heuristic algorithms;Information systems;Machine learning;Search problems;Transforms","data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);tree searching;very large databases","CARHS;attribute reducts;classic UCI data sets;depth-first search;graph search strategy;heuristic rules;heuristic search rules;large data sets;large databases;nontrivial abstractions;problem transformation","","0","","9","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The development of learning algorithms capable of learning from past experience is an important step in emulating inductive learning in humans. Classification finds application in many domains, of which selection of customers for a marketing campaign, fraud detection, diagnosis of diseases, image recognition, and spam e-mail filtering are just a few examples. In this paper, we present a comparative study of the application of the Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification methods to the problem of screening candidates for a vacant position in an organization. The observable attributes of a candidate profile are first established. In the training phase, a training set of example profiles is used for learning the classification rules of the organization. In the test phase, the accuracy of the classification model is assessed by classifying example profiles not included in the training set, but for which the target class is already known. In the prediction phase, a profile whose target class is not known is classified.

Our previous work modeled this type of learning with a transductive One-Nearest-Neighbor (1NN) method that was effective for identifying atypical regions in chest radiographs. However, the need to compute distances between the feature vectors extracted from a test image and a very large archive of feature vectors (previously extracted from corresponding anatomical locations in a large set of “normal” chest radiographs) made the 1NN method very computationally intensive. This paper uses an instance selection mechanism based on an Extended Fuzzy C-Means (EFCM) clustering algorithm to reduce the magnitude of this computation. Our results (based on a large set of real-world chest radiographs obtained from Mayo Clinic) indicate that EFCM can substantially reduce the computational cost of the 1NN method, without a substantial drop in the accuracy of its atypicality estimates.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0382-8; POD:978-1-4673-0381-1; USB:978-1-4673-0380-4","10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310544","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310544","Computer aided diagnosis;X-rays;biomedical imaging;machine learning","Computational efficiency;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Radiography;Sensitivity;Training;Vectors","diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;object detection;pattern clustering","1NN method;EFCM clustering algorithm;atypical region identification;atypicality feature detection;extended fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm;feature vector extraction;instance selection mechanism;learning;normal chest radiographs;test image;transductive one-nearest-neighbor method","","0","","20","","","2-5 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Either microRNAs or its target genes can be recognized as biomarkers for diagnosis of diseases, prediction of prognosis, or even therapy decision. In this study, first we apply support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks and decision tree-based approaches to select a set of useful features, which represent important characteristics for the determination of the interaction between microRNA and its target binding mRNA sequence. Next, these selected features are used in two classifiers, SVM and Random Forests, to perform prediction of microRNA target sites.

SANS has reported the emergence of distributed SSH dictionary attacks, which are very stealthy in comparison with a simple one. Since even one success of such an attack causes serious problems, administrators should implement countermeasures. SSH dictionary attacks have been detected in two basic ways that rely on either log files or network traffic. Both approaches, however, have limitations. The first approach imposes upon administrators heavy maintenance costs, which grow linearly with the number of hosts in networks. The second approach cannot distinguish between successful and unsuccessful attacks. Of more immediate concern, neither approach is effective against stealthy attacks because the login attempts of these attacks have little impact on log files or network traffic. An ideal method would be able to detect individual attacks and distinguish between an attack's success or failure, using information derived from only network traffic. In this paper, we describe such a method, which was developed by combining two novel elements. First, on the basis of our assumptions, we use two criteria: ""existence of a connection protocol"" and ""difference in the inter-arrival time of an auth-packet"". These criteria are not available, though, owing to the confidentiality and flexibility of the SSH protocol. Second, we resolve this problem by identifying transition points of a sub-protocol through flow features and machine learning algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments on real traffic traces collected at the edge in our campus networks. The experimental results are encouraging for this research direction, though they are derived from reduced datasets of SSH dictionary attacks and under simplifying assumptions. The significant contribution is the demonstration that an ideal metho- for detecting SSH dictionary attacks seems feasible.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5640-8; POD:978-1-4673-2001-6; USB:978-0-7695-4737-4","10.1109/SAINT.2012.16","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6305260","flow analysis;machine learning algorithm;network operation;ssh dictionary attack","Authentication;Dictionaries;IP networks;Payloads;Protocols;Servers","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","SANS;SSH dictionary attack detection;campus networks;connection protocol;flow analysis;log files;machine learning algorithms;network traffic;security threat;stealthy attacks","","2","","20","","","16-20 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To address this issue in the context of motion detection, GP programs evolved for various detection tasks are analyzed in this study. Previous work has shown the capabilities of these evolved motion detectors such as ignoring uninteresting motions, differentiating fast motions from slow motions, identifying genuine motions from a moving background, and handling noises. This study aims to reveal the behavior of these GP individuals by introducing simplified motion detection tasks. The investigation on these GP motion detectors shows that their good performance is not random. There are contributing characteristics captured by these detectors, of which the behaviors are more or less explainable.

In such a vision, the ultimate aim is to acquire knowledge about everyday life and human behavior. We apply these concepts to the automated home, in which even nowadays devices (sensors and actuators) are already Internet-capable ""things"" endowed with their own intelligence. This work introduces a semantic knowledge representation for domotics following the principles of the semantic Web (Web 3.0). We have implemented specific ontologies that automatically take account of distributed environmental context information. The first result was to achieve a natural abstraction of different, incompatible devices in order to support interoperability in a consistent technology-independent manner and impart awareness to the domestic environment in which ""things"" such as furniture and other objects, as well as the rooms themselves, take on computational significance. This goal includes leveraging the development of a comprehensive intelligent ecosystem that, by applying machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, gains knowledge of the occupants' behaviors and habits and can thereby adapt itself to the specific setting and anticipate their needs without direct human intervention. The same modeling process serves as the basis for implementation of an e-health system that can anticipate, and thereby prevent, possible health hazards before emergency situations arise (especially for the sick and elderly).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4684-1; POD:978-1-4673-1328-5","10.1109/IMIS.2012.109","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6296947","Ambient Intelligent;DomoNet;E-Health;Machine Learning;Ontology;SOA;XML;domotics;home automation","Ambient intelligence;Context;Monitoring;Ontologies;Semantics;Senior citizens","data structures;ecology;embedded systems;emergency services;health care;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","Internet of Things;Internet-capable things;ambient intelligence;artificial intelligence techniques;automated home;computational significance;digital traces;distributed environmental context information;domestic environment;e-health system;embedded intelligence;emergency situations;everyday life;health hazards anticipation;human behavior;intelligent ecosystem;intelligent things;interoperability;machine learning;natural abstraction;occupants behaviors;ontology-based IoT domotic environment;semantic Web;semantic knowledge representation;technology-independent manner","","6","","15","","","4-6 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It aims at detecting the emotional impact of a video clip in a new way by first identifying emotional events in the affective stream (fast increase of the subject excitation) and then by giving the associated binary valence (positive or negative) of each detected event. The study was conducted to be as close as possible to realistic conditions by especially minimizing the use of active calibrations and considering on-the-fly detection. Furthermore, the influence of each physiological modality is evaluated through three different key-scenarios (mono-user, multi-user and extended multi-user) that may be relevant for consumer applications.

This paper introduces two new statistical shape models (SSMs) that combine radial shape parameterization with machine learning techniques from the field of nonlinear time series analysis. We then develop two dynamic contour models (DCMs) using the new SSMs as shape priors for tumor and lesion segmentation. From training data, the SSMs learn the lower level shape information of boundary fluctuations, which we prove to be nevertheless highly discriminant. One of the new DCMs also uses online learning to refine the shape prior for the lesion of interest based on user interactions. Classification experiments reveal superior sensitivity and specificity of the new shape priors over those previously used to constrain DCMs. User trials with the new interactive algorithms show that the shape priors are directly responsible for improvements in accuracy and reductions in user demand.","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2012.2196285","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6189787","Active shape model;biomedical image processing;image segmentation;machine learning;stochastic processes","Image segmentation;Lesions;Mathematical model;Shape;Time series analysis;Training","computerised tomography;fluctuations;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;sensitivity;stochastic systems;time series;tumours;user interfaces","back automatic segmentation;boundary fluctuations;classification experiments;computerised tomography;dynamic contour models;high-level shape information;interactive lesion segmentation;lesion-of-interest;machine learning;manual delineation;medical image segmentation;nonlinear time series analysis;offline learning;online learning;pathological regions;radial shape parameterization;sensitivity;shape modelling techniques;tumors;user interactions","Algorithms;Area Under Curve;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Liver Neoplasms;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Multiple Sclerosis;ROC Curve;Sensitivity and Specificity;Stochastic Processes;Tomography, X-Ray Computed","7","","67","","20120425","Sept. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, in many operational applications, the environment has three level responses; one for reward, one for small scale penalty and the last one for large scale penalty. In these applications, the old LA not only can not minimize the mean value of receiving penalties, but also in some cases their mean value of receiving penalties are even more than a pure-chance automaton. In this paper, first the triple level environments with illustrative example are described precisely. Then, the new fixed structure stochastic LA (called TILA) is introduced and its properties are considered mathematically.

"Predictive defense against evolving adversaries","R. Colbaugh; K.

This paper leverages the coevolutionary relationship between attackers and defenders to derive two new approaches to predictive defense, in which future attack techniques are anticipated and these insights are incorporated into defense designs. The first method combines game theory with machine learning to model and predict future adversary actions in the learner's “feature space”; these predictions form the basis for synthesizing robust defenses. The second approach to predictive defense involves extrapolating the evolution of defense configurations forward in time, in the space of defense parameterizations, as a way of generating defenses which work well against evolving threats. Case studies with a large cyber security dataset assembled for this investigation demonstrate that each method provides effective, scalable defense against current and future attacks, outperforming gold-standard techniques. Additionally, preliminary tests indicate that a simple variant of the proposed design methodology yields defenses which are difficult for adversaries to reverse-engineer.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2104-4; POD:978-1-4673-2105-1","10.1109/ISI.2012.6283222","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6283222","adversarial coevolution;cyber security;game theory;machine learning;predictive analytics;security informatics","Accuracy;Classification algorithms;Filtering algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Unsolicited electronic mail;Vectors","game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","adaptive adversaries;border security;counterterrorism;cyber defense;cyber security dataset;defense designs;defense parameterizations;evolving adversaries;fraud prevention;gold standard techniques;machine learning;predictive defense","","5","","23","","","11-14 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The PDZ is one of the most common and well-studied protein binding domains, hence it is a perfect model system for designing protein binding predictors. The standard approach to identifying the binding partners of PDZ domains uses multiple sequence alignments to infer the set of contact residues that are used in a predictive model. We expand on the sequence alignment approach by incorporating structural information to generate descriptors of the binding site geometry. Furthermore, we generate a real-value score for binary predictions by applying a filter based on models that predict the probability distributions of contact residues at each of the canonical PDZ ligand binding positions. Under training cross validation, our model produced an order of magnitude more predictions at a false positive proportion (FPP) of 10 percent than our benchmark model chosen from the literature. Evaluated using an independent cross validation, with computationally predicted structures, our model was able to make five times as many predictions as the benchmark model, with a Matthews' correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.33.

Very often, the identity and relations of target of interest have already been established, and can be represented as relational data. Hence, we can expect a stream of relational data arriving at our agent input as the situation updates. The prediction task can then be expressed as a function of this stream of relational data. Run-time learning to predict a stream of percepts in an unknown and possibly complex environment is a hard problem, and especially so when a serious attempt needs to be made even on the first few percepts. When the percepts are relational (logical atoms), the most common practical technologies require engineering by a human expert and so are not applicable. We briefly describe and compare several approaches which do not have this requirement on the initial hundred percepts of a benchmark domain. The most promising approach extends existing approaches by a partial matching algorithm inspired by theory of conceptual blending. This technique enables predictions in novel situations where the original approach fails, and significantly improves prediction performance overall. However an implementation, based on backtracking, may be too slow for many implementations. We provide an accelerated approximate algorithm based on best-first and A* search, which is much faster than the initial implementation.","","Electronic:978-0-9824438-5-9; POD:978-1-4673-0417-7; USB:978-0-9824438-4-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289804","Learning;Machine learning;Pattern analysis;Prediction;Reasoning under uncertainty;Relational Time Series","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Markov processes;Prediction algorithms;Roads;Time series analysis;Weapons","expert systems;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;relational databases;sensor fusion;time series","backtracking;benchmark domain;complex environment;conceptual blending predictors;human expert;impact assessment;logical atoms;partial matching algorithm;practical technology;prediction performance;prediction task;relational data;relational time series;runtime learning;sensor fusion;target of interest","","1","","9","","","9-12 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the real world environment, the mathematical models of many robots are often not accurate, due to the presence of continuous disturbances that effect their dynamic equations, in addition to errors in parameter knowledge. Consequently, method that rely less on precise mathematical models are often preferred. One such Adaptive Machine Learning Technique is proposed to be applied here, for motion control of the robot arm. The controller uses an inverse learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model only to train itself from certain given robot trajectories. Ideally, these trajectories should be obtained by directly measuring the robot arm responses for given inputs to capture the actual dynamics in the presence of all uncertainties. However, for algorithm validation, trajectories generated through simulations based on mathematical models assumed to be reasonably accurate, can also be used for the training purpose. This approach is used for design and implementation of an ANFIS controller which is shown to act work satisfactorily. Further possible developments of this method are also outlined.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1154-0; POD:978-1-4673-1153-3","10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317522","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6317522","A robot arm;ANFIS Model;Machine Learning Techniques;Manipulator;Neuro-Fuzzy Controllers;SCARA","Adaptation models;Manipulator dynamics;Mathematical model;Torque;Trajectory","adaptive control;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);manipulator dynamics;mathematical analysis;motion control;neurocontrollers;training","4 degree-of-freedom selective compliant assembly robot arm;ANFIS controller;SCARA type manipulator;SCARA type robot arm;adaptive machine learning technique;adaptive neurofuzzy control approach;dynamic equations;inverse learning adaptive neurofuzzy inference system;link variables control;mathematical models;parameter knowledge;robot arm motion control;robot arm responses measurement;robot dynamics;robot trajectories;training purpose","","3","","15","","","18-19 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A training tool is designed for a PC to collect the mapping of “statistical information” and each application running in the PC. This statistical information is sent to the cloud for training. In the cloud, a database is designed to collect these information and a machine learning based training system is constructed. For traffic and applications classification service, the tool in the network of a company or a campus will also send the “traffic statistics” to the cloud, which then identifies these traffic by using virtual machines and returns the identified results.

In the real world environment, the mathematical models of many complex systems are often not accurate, due to the presence of continuous disturbances that effect their dynamic equations, in addition to errors in parameter knowledge. Consequently, methods that rely less on precise mathematical models are often preferred. One such Adaptive Machine Learning Technique is proposed for motion control in spacecraft maneuver. The controller uses an inverse learning Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model only to train itself from certain desired trajectories and tries to mimic the same in its response. Ideally, these training trajectories are obtained by directly measuring the spacecraft manuever response for various test inputs. Once the system is fully trained, the manuever is tested on a new trajectory with uncertain plant dynamics. However, for algorithm validation, trajectories generated through simulations based on mathematical models assumed to be reasonably accurate, can also be used for the training purpose. This approach is used for design and implementation of an ANFIS controller which is shown to work satisfactorily. Further possible developments of the method are outlined.","","Electronic:978-0-9567157-1-5; POD:978-1-4673-1524-1","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6260276","A Spacecraft Manuever;ANFIS Model;Machine Learning Techniques;Neuro-Fuzzy Controllers;Quaternion representation","","","","","0","","16","","","24-26 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These data consist of module-string currents and voltages and their instantaneous (filtered) rates of change, acquired via a combination of analog and digital sensors. Our diagnostics algorithms comprise thermal and electrical System ID stages, augmented by a Bayesian MAP (Maximum A posteriori Probability) inference engine utilizing a simplified stochastic, spline-based integrated plant model in the optical, electrical and thermal domains. Our (path-integral, physics-based) MAP inference engine detects incipient hot-spots; attributes them to the most likely proximate- and underlying causes (such as shading or dust-deposition patterns, direct heating, inherent mismatches or circuit failures); and renders quantitative estimates of the most likely culpable environmental factor (e.g. a time-varying shading pattern). The same simplified plant model is periodically used to prognosticate the likely future evolution of the incipient hot spot. Our diagnostics and prognostics algorithms can be applied to simulated and/or empirical data (the latter from our roof-top PV lab at Carnegie Mellon). The algorithms leverage changes in estimated conductances in different regions of the electrical state-space, and at different granularities (cells, panels, strings and full array). It take into account temperature coefficients, ohmic- and optical heating, and (optionally) inherent electrical mismatches. Our algorithm suite requires as input neither temperature sensors, nor sub-panel electrical data, nor load sweeps; even pyranometer data is optional. The only necessary sensor data are string electrical data at the actual instantaneous in-operation external load (either with or without a perturb-and-observe MPPT control procedure). Digitized measurements of the low-pass-fi- tered time derivatives of these currents are useful, but if not available they can be replaced with numerical differentiation. However, occasional voltage sweeps - augmented with pyranometer, thermal and intra-panel (bypass diode voltage) data from our heavily instrumented PV array - along with online astronomical and meteorological data and artificially induced shading patterns - are used to validate our algorithms and to improve the baseline System ID parameters estimation.","0160-8371;01608371","DVD:978-1-4673-0065-0; Electronic:978-1-4673-0066-7; POD:978-1-4673-0064-3","10.1109/PVSC.2012.6318087","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6318087","Bayesian;Irradiance;MAP;MPPT;Maximum Power Point;PV array;PV cell;Shading;diagnostics;equivalent circuit;estimator;hot-spot;machine learning;nonlinear dynamics;ohmic heating;one-diode model;opto-electric;panel string;path integral;photovoltaics;prognostics;solar power generation;splines;stochastics;string current;system ID;thermo-electric;web services","Arrays;Bayesian methods;Splines (mathematics);Temperature distribution;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Voltage measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);photovoltaic cells;probability","Bayesian MAP;bypass diode voltage;hot-spot Bayesian diagnostics;instantaneous rates of change;machine-learning algorithms;maximum a posteriori probability;module-string currents;online photovoltaic array;perturb-and-observe MPPT control procedure;streaming string-level electric data","","1","","4","","","3-8 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Capturing features from the transport and internet layers of the network stack based on responses to various Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests may allow for increased classification accuracy.

This study was conducted to illustrate that ANFIS is effective with hybrid learning, for the adaptation of learning content according to learners' needs. Study results show that ANFIS has been successfully implemented for learning content adaptation within different learning context scenarios. The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated using standard error measurements which revealed the optimal setting necessary for better predictability. The MATLAB simulation results indicate that the performance of the ANFIS approach is valuable and easy to implement. The study results are based on analysis of different model settings; they confirm that the m-learning application is functional.

In many problems, however, the observed data is related to a natural set of latent variables through a non-trivial sensing process. A common approach in such cases is to either ignore the sensing process or to invert it and then proceed with dimensionality reduction and classifier design. Inversion can be costly and may be unnecessary if the end goal is classification. Rather than either ignoring sensing structure or using it for explicit inversion, we propose using “structured random projections” whose correlation explicitly accounts for the sensing structure. We show examples comparing the performance of independent random projections of observed data, independent random projections of reconstructed data, and our new structured random projections of observed data which demonstrate the benefits of our approach.","2373-0803;23730803","Electronic:978-1-4673-0183-1; POD:978-1-4673-0182-4; USB:978-1-4673-0181-7","10.1109/SSP.2012.6319716","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6319716","Inverse Problems;Least-Squares;Machine Learning;Nearest Neighbor Classification;Random Projections;Tikhonov Regularization","Correlation;Data models;Explosions;Noise measurement;Sensors;Signal to noise ratio;Training","signal classification","classifier design;distance-preserving data dimensionality reduction;high dimensional signals;high-dimensional classification problems;independent random projections;latent variables;nearest neighbor classification;nontrivial sensing process;reconstructed data;sensing aware dimensionality reduction;sensing structure;structured random projections","","0","","","","","5-8 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, we propose to use a manifold learning method- Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) for reconstructing the input LR patch with a linear weight summation of its several most similar training LR patches, and then can recover HR patch using the same linear summation of the corresponding training HR patches. Furthermore, in order to solve the expensive computational problem in the conventional exampled-based learning method, only the patches with larger variance, which means with high-frequency components, are selected for super-resolution procedures.

The biometric system consists of components for data capture, feature extraction, authentication classification, and receiver-operating-characteristic curve generation. Using keystroke data from 120 users, system performance was obtained as a function of two independent variables: the user population size and the number of keystrokes per sample. For each population size, the performance increased (and the equal error rate decreased) roughly logarithmically as the number of keystrokes per sample was increased.

We propose here a robust methodology to detect phishing websites that employs for semantic analysis a topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, and for classification, AdaBoost. The methodology developed is a content driven approach that is device independent and language neutral. The website content of mobile and desktop clients are collected by employing an intelligent web crawler. The website contents that are not in English are translated to English using Google's language translator. Topic model is built using the translated contents of desktop and mobile clients. The phishing website classifier is built using (i) distribution probabilities for the topics found as features using Latent Dirichlet Allocation and (ii) AdaBoost voting technique.

Daylight infiltration is generally good for occupant comfort, and provides opportunities to ""harvest"" this daylight and save energy on electric lighting, provided that it is harnessed in a way that it does not over illuminate or cause glare. Building an intelligent lighting control system is challenging due to incompatible or sometimes conflicting lighting preferences from adjacent people or areas. Some office environments can be additionally challenging because of complex geometries, time-varying nondeterministic daylight contributions through windows, and glare. Here we address the challenges of meeting users' individual lighting preferences using a highly accurate illumination model to enable balancing the various lighting requirements among spatially grouped task areas, while minimizing the energy needed to do so (and in the future, minimizing the number of wireless sensors needed for this application). We propose an illumination model-based method and algorithm for intelligent open-loop lighting control, and present the results of a simulation study using a simplistic virtual room model to demonstrate the validity of our method.

Assuming that the regression model performing the mapping is suited to the data, the performance of the predictor largely depends on how well the parameters of this regression model can be inferred from the training data. In situations where the training data is scarce, model performance is degraded due to over-fitting. The effects of over-fitting can be mitigated by feature selection but the model performance remains low due to the insufficiently representative training data. The objective we pursue is to enhance the performance of a quality predictor by augmenting the feature set with the output of a pre-trained quality predictor. This approach introduces an implicit dependence of the regression model parameters on a larger amount of training data. In view of the increasing usage of speech signals with higher bandwidth, and the dearth of training data for such signals, an augmentation of particular interest is that of a wide-band feature set with a narrow-band quality prediction. Experimental results for additive noise and non-linear distortions encountered in hearing aids, using quality labels from an intrusive quality predictor, illustrate the performance enhancement capabilities of the proposed approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0726-0; POD:978-1-4673-0724-6; USB:978-1-4673-0725-3","10.1109/QoMEX.2012.6263856","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6263856","Non-intrusive quality assessment;input uncertainty;machine learning with Gaussian processes","Data models;Niobium;Predictive models;Quality assessment;Training;Training data;Uncertainty","feature extraction;regression analysis;speech processing","additive noise;feature selection;feature set augmentation;nonintrusive quality predictor;nonlinear distortions;regression model;speech signals","","0","","18","","","5-7 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper demonstrates for the first time to our knowledge, a real-time implementation of the LM algorithm on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). It was used to train neural networks to solve the eXclusive Or function (XOR), and for 3D-to-2D camera calibration parameter estimation. A Xilinx Virtex-5 ML506 was used to implement the LMA as a hardware-in-the-loop system. The XOR function was approximated in only 13 iterations from zero initial conditions, usually the same function is approximated in thousands of iterations using the error backpropagation algorithm. Also, this type of training not only reduced the number of iterations but also achieved a speed up in excess of 3 ×10<sup>6</sup> when compared to the software implementation. A real-time camera calibration and parameter estimation was performed successfully on FPGAs. Compared to the software implementation the FPGA implementation led to an increase in the mean squared error and standard deviation by only 17.94% and 8.04% respectively.

This paper explores the effective sets of collocational features in Turkish in order to obtain better Turkish WSD systems. A lexical sample dataset of highly polysemous nouns and verbs has been prepared as the initial step of the work. Several supervised learning algorithms have been tested on this data by supplying different feature sets to select the best performing features for both nouns and verbs in Turkish.

Particularly the initial step of problem classification is complicated by error propagation making secondary problems surfacing on multiple dependent resources. In this paper, we propose to automate the process of problem classification by leveraging machine learning. The main focus is to categorize the problem a user experiences by recognizing the real root cause specificity leveraging available training data such as monitoring and logs across the systems. We transform the structure of the problem into a hierarchy using an existing taxonomy. We then propose an efficient hierarchical incremental learning algorithm which is capable of adjusting its internal local classifier parameters in realtime. Comparing to the traditional batch learning algorithms, this online solution decreases the computational complexity of the training process by learning from new instances on an incremental fashion. Our approach significantly reduces the memory required to store the training instances. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by learning hierarchical problem patterns for several issues occurring in distributed web applications. Experimental results show that our approach substantially outperforms previous methods.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2011.3","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5710866","Machine learning;artificial intelligence;computing methodologies;principles of services;services computing;services technologies","Frequency modulation;Machine learning;Monitoring;Prediction algorithms;Taxonomy;Training;Training data","business data processing;data handling;information technology;learning (artificial intelligence)","IT support services;computational complexity;hierarchical online problem classification;incremental learning algorithm;machine learning;multiple dependent resources;multitier IT systems","","6","","31","","20110210","Third Quarter 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

From X-ray angiography, robust automatic detection of coronary arteries would be of great interest during cardiac interventions. Multi scale Hessian-based filtering was proven successful to automatically detect vessels from X-ray angiography. However, other anatomical structures interfere greatly with the detection process and the result still contains many false positives. The goal of the project is to propose a novel machine learning-based method to improve Hessian-based coronary artery detection from X-ray angiography. The proposed method divides Hessian-filtered images in patches, uses feature extraction with a contour profiling algorithm, and classifies using Support Vector Machines. The method is applied recursively on the detected connected components using patches of different sizes to define the arteries. This scheme allows an improvement of robustness against noise and imaging artifacts.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-0382-8; POD:978-1-4673-0381-1; USB:978-1-4673-0380-4","10.1109/ISSPA.2012.6310542","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6310542","X-ray angiography;coronary arteries;image segmentation;machine learning","Angiography;Arteries;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Noise;Support vector machines;Training","blood vessels;diagnostic radiography;feature extraction;filtering theory;image classification;medical image processing;support vector machines","Hessian-based coronary artery detection;Hessian-filtered image;X-ray angiography;anatomical structure;automatic detection;cardiac intervention;contour profiling algorithm;feature extraction;machine learning;multiscale Hessian-based filtering;multiscale classification approach;navigation guidance;percutaneous coronary intervention;support vector machines;vessel detection","","1","","7","","","2-5 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In data mining, dimensionality reduction in data preprocessing plays a vital role for improving the performance of the machine learning algorithms. Many techniques have been proposed by researchers to achieve dimensionality reduction. Beside the contribution of feature subset selection in dimensionality reduction gives a significant improvement in accuracy, it reduces the false prediction ratio and reduces the time complexity for building the learning model in machine learning algorithm as the result of removing redundant and irrelevant attributes from the original dataset. This study analyzes the performance of these Cfs, Consistency and Filtered attribute subset evaluators in view of dimensionality reduction with the wide range of test datasets and learning algorithms namely probability-based Naive Bayes, tree-based C4.5(J48) and instance-based IB1.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2048-1; POD:978-1-4673-2045-0","10.1109/ICACCCT.2012.6320755","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6320755","Classification Accuracy;Classifier;Data mining;Data prepocessing;Dimensionality Reduction;Feature subset selection;Machine learning","Diabetes;Filtering algorithms;Glass;Ionosphere;Iris;Iris recognition;Meteorology","Bayes methods;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);trees (mathematics)","attribute subset evaluators;data mining;data preprocessing;dimensionality reduction;false prediction ratio;feature subset selection evaluators;instance-based IB1;machine learning algorithms;pragmatic analysis;probability-based Naive Bayes;supervised learning;test datasets;time complexity reduction;tree-based C4.S;tree-based J48","","2","","49","","","23-25 Aug. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Particle competition and cooperation in networks for semi-supervised learning with concept drift","F. Breve; L. Zhao","S&#x00E3;o Paulo State University (UNESP), Rio Claro, Brazil","The 2012 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)","20120730","2012","","","1","6","Concept drift is a problem of increasing importance in machine learning and data mining. Data sets under analysis are no longer only static databases, but also data streams in which concepts and data distributions may not be stable over time. However, most learning algorithms produced so far are based on the assumption that data comes from a fixed distribution, so they are not suitable to handle concept drifts. Moreover, some concept drifts applications requires fast response, which means an algorithm must always be (re)trained with the latest available data. But the process of labeling data is usually expensive and/or time consuming when compared to unlabeled data acquisition, thus only a small fraction of the incoming data may be effectively labeled. Semi-supervised learning methods may help in this scenario, as they use both labeled and unlabeled data in the training process. However, most of them are also based on the assumption that the data is static. Therefore, semi-supervised learning with concept drifts is still an open challenge in machine learning. Recently, a particle competition and cooperation approach was used to realize graph-based semi-supervised learning from static data. In this paper, we extend that approach to handle data streams and concept drift. The result is a passive algorithm using a single classifier, which naturally adapts to concept changes, without any explicit drift detection mechanism. Its built-in mechanisms provide a natural way of learning from new data, gradually “forgetting” older knowledge as older labeled data items became less influent on the classification of newer data items. Some computer simulation are presented, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4673-1490-9; POD:978-1-4673-1488-6","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252617","Concept Drift;Machine learning;Particle Competition and Cooperation;Semi-Supervised Learning","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer simulation;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Vectors","data acquisition;data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classifier;concept drift;data distributions;data item classification;data mining;data stream handling;graph-based semisupervised learning method;labeling data process;machine learning;particle competition approach;particle cooperation approach;passive algorithm;static data;unlabeled data acquisition","","4","","38","","","10-15 June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
