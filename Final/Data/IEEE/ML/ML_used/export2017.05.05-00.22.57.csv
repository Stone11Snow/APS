It can compare and analyze the degree of similarity between two or more sequences to speculate whether they are derived from the common ancestor or not. Usually, lengths of both input sequences are fairly long, resulting in long processing time. Many previous algorithms have been proposed to reduce the processing time. Previous systolic algorithms can achieve linear time complexity with linear number of processing elements. However, each processing element needs linear memory-space to store intermediate results and then the system needs too large memory-space in total, resulting in being not suitable for being implemented on VLSI. Hence, to design an efficient and hardware-implementable algorithm is an important issue. This paper proposes a reconfigurable systolic architecture for the sequence alignment problem. At first, we use Needleman-Wunsch recursive function to derive the rules of forward and backward processes. By employing “divide and conquer” technique, we can find a sequence alignment with the best score. It needs a little more time complexity with only linear memory-space in total. Furthermore, the number of physical processing elements can be fixed by employing the concept of virtual processing elements. Therefore, our proposed reconfigurable systolic architecture is not only hardware-implementable on VLSI but also efficient.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016879","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016879","Divide and conquer;Reconfigurable;Sequence alignment;Systolic algorithm;Virtual processing elements","Arrays;Complexity theory;Cybernetics;DNA;Machine learning;Process control;Program processors","VLSI;bioinformatics;computational complexity;divide and conquer methods;embedded systems;reconfigurable architectures","Needleman-Wunsch recursive function;VLSI;backward processes;biological information;divide and conquer technique;forward processes;hardware-implementable algorithm;linear memory-space;linear time complexity;reconfigurable embedded system;reconfigurable systolic architecture;sequence alignment problem;systolic algorithm;virtual processing elements","","0","","13","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to traditional biologically-inspired algorithms, Probability-Collectives (PC) based methods do not update populations of solutions; instead, they update an explicitly parameterized probability distribution over the space of solutions. Three versions of PCMAS in the extrema-tracking tasks are investigated: PCMAS1 (original PCMAS settings), PCMAS2 (temperature T - a factor controlling the balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space - is reset to the initial state when an environmental change takes place), as well as PCMAS3 (in addition to T being reset to the initial state, the probability distributions are also reset to uniform when an environment changes). By allowing PCMAS to detect changes in environments to re-explore the search space, we show that PCMAS2 and PCMAS3 significantly outperform the original PCMAS (i.e., PCMAS1). The study of the PCMAS in changing environments therefore sheds light on how this multi-agent methodology advances the current state of research in agent-based models for dynamic optimization problems.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016685","Dynamic environments;Extrema tracking;Multi-agent systems;Probability collectives","Entropy;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Joints;Machine learning;Optimization;Probability distribution","multi-agent systems;optimisation;search problems;statistical distributions","biologically-inspired algorithm;dynamic environment;dynamic optimization problem;extrema-tracking;parameterized probability distribution;probability collectives multiagent systems;search space;tracking extrema","","0","","13","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It can be perceived that the advertisement is more effective by adding more “bad” words since more information could be transmitted to the customers. As a result, forcing the attackers to diminish the number of “bad” words is an important research problem in good word attacks. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to force the attackers to diminish the number of “bad” words. Rather than only considering if a word contained in an email, the proposed method use the frequency of a word appeared in an email to simulate the adversary attack and the defense mechanism.

In terms of building the database, Gabor filter is utilized to enhance the extracted characteristics as well as to generate the feature vectors. The final step is adopting K-means clustering to build the classification model of feature vectors. The process of identifying laser speckle images is described as follows. Through experiments we observed that scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) can extract features of laser speckle images very well. However the drawback is that it took too much time to compute and match up those features, which is not suitable for fast laser speckle identification. Therefore the proposed method took enhance SIFT as backbone.

Therefore, it has become an important issue to work out efficient ways of finding the latest frequent itemsets when the transactions keep being added to the database. Although tree-based approaches have been recently adopted in most of the studies in this field, they have shown the two common problems: repeated adjustments of tree nodes and a need for large amounts of memory space.

Combined with the deficiency analysis of particle filter, an improved particle filter based on diversity guidance is proposed. Firstly, the adaptive resampling step in particle filter is tuned based on two diversity measures which are effective sample size and population diversity factor. Moreover, the operation of particle mutation after resampling is integrated into PF so as to assure the diversity of particle sets. Then, a hybrid proposal distribution is adopted to consider current information of the latest observed measurement. At the same time, annealing parameter is utilized to control the proportional of priori function and likelihood function.

Therefore, a generic packing detection framework (PDF) is proposed in this study. This framework first statically examines the Portable Executable (PE) file of each executable to gather a set of executable-related raw attributes. After running a subsequent attribute refinement process provided by PDF, valued attributes are extracted and then used to train a two-class support vector machines learning classifier to recognize whether a executable is packed.

In this paper, we propose an approach which can not only efficiently collect expertise information of each expert through top-k support documents, but also use effective co-occurrence relationship between expert candidates to rank the target experts. The use of co-occurrence relationship aims to quickly build a social network.

Three scenarios were calculated, the first is CBR with four parameters, maximum wind speed, minimum atmospheric pressure, maximum wind speed in typhoon center and lowest atmospheric pressure near typhoon center. The second scenario includes the four parameters with rainfall and calculated by CBR. The third scenario uses the fuzzy calculation with four parameters.

By comparing the supplier's profits under the condition of complete information and incomplete information, we found that the incumbent's private information always be leaked to the entrant by supplier. On the base of this, a signaling game model between the incumbent and the entrant during the process of ordering has been established, and the separating equilibrium has been analyzed. The result shows that the separating equilibrium cannot prevent information leakage.

We also have proved some representing properties of generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers after the fuzzy arithmetical operations with Second Function Principle.

Hence, they are ideally suited to support clinician in making diagnostic decision. However, if a given biosignal is an unknown type, none of the existing classification algorithms can be considered workable. In this paper, an intelligent framework that is able to automatically identify ECG from an unknown biosignal is described. In which, the first phase of the research is illustrated in detail, which focuses on classifying an unknown biosignal into ECG or other categories, by employing dynamic time warping (DTW), combined with clustering algorithm. The proposed framework consists of two major components: biosignal template construction and classification process. Biosignal template construction includes biosignal acquisition and segmentation, template optimization and management; while the classification process involves several sub-processes: biosignal preprocessing, biosignal pattern matching and majority voting.

It can provide a common representation for different agents to share and communicate knowledge for conducting unified opinions. Nowadays ontology construction method is divided into man-made and machine-made mechanisms. The former constructs the ontology topology by domain expert. Generally the constructed ontology can fit human expectation but it needs more development time to construct the whole structure. The latter uses semi-automatic or automatic methods, such as statistic or machine learning, to build the ontology. The efficient ontology construction is the main advantage for machine-made method. However, the advantage is that it is easily influenced by the category and type of domain concepts to generate unbalanced or skewed ontology topology. This will increase the time complexity to search and retrieve the concept from the constructed ontology structure. The situation worsens from being unable to use the ontology properly. An important problem is constructing a reasonable and balanced ontology topology systematically and automatically.

It is because this kind of retrieval method could narrow “semantic gap” between the visual features and the high-level semantic features. However, most of the existing methods of the semantic-based image retrieval are limited to fixed number of semantic features. A dynamic hierarchical semantic network method is proposed in this paper to overcome this limitation. The proposed dynamic hierarchical semantic network is constructed by relevance feedback. The number of semantic features can be dynamically changed according to user feedbacks. Moreover, the semantic features are allowed to have different levels of abstraction. In addition, the proposed method also integrates low-level visual feature-based image retrieval style, which could full use of the advantages of visual feature-based image retrieval and semantic-based image retrieval. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher retrieval accuracy than fixed number of semantic feature method and only one level semantic feature method.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6017037","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017037","Hierarchical semantic network;Relevance feedback;Semantic gap;Semantic-based image retrieval;low-level visual feature-based image retrieval","Cybernetics;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image retrieval;Machine learning;Semantics;Visualization","image retrieval;relevance feedback","dynamic hierarchical semantic network based image retrieval;relevance feedback;semantic based image retrieval;semantic features;semantic gap","","0","","16","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we first summarize current research development of video retrieval. Then, we propose a new video clustering method based on a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) trained via a minimization of the Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM).

A sentence is represented as a sequence of words along with their lemma and part-of-speech tags. Experiments show that sequence kernel has a clear advantage over all common subsequences.

The method of KM-A* belongs to hierarchical pathfinding, which incorporates the information of obstacle distribution when partitioning game maps using K-means clustering. This algorithm reduced unnecessary storage and unnatural paths in some open areas. However, the found path by KM-A* is very unstable and the quality closely depends on the clustering results. In this paper, we proposed an improved KM-A* algorithm, which aims to enhance the stability and quality of pathfinding. First, an agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is used to determine the initial cluster centers, and K-Means algorithm is then applied to cluster obstacle nodes with k values which can possibly generate best cluster categories on game maps. Secondly, the strengthened form of DB Index criteria is defined by adding impact factors to the standard DB Index criteria to measure the quality of clustering results. Finally the best clustering is selected based on this new DB Index, which will provide a guidance to further generate an abstract map for on-line pathfinding. Experiments are conducted to compare the performance of KM-A* and improved KM-A*, which show that the latter can find more stable paths and use less on-line processing time.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4577-0308-9; POD:978-1-4577-0305-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6017018","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6017018","DB Index;KM-A<sup>∗</sup>;hierarchical clustering;pathfinding in games","Algorithm design and analysis;Clustering algorithms;Games;Heuristic algorithms;Indexes;Machine learning;Partitioning algorithms","computer games;pattern clustering","DB index criteria;K-means clustering;KM-A* pathfinding algorithm;computer games;game maps;hierarchical clustering;obstacle distribution information;obstacle nodes","","0","","13","","","10-13 July 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performances of these seven kernels are compared in 30 UCI datasets. The experimental comparisons are carried out according to the following three aspects: the classification accuracy, ranking performance and the class probability estimation. The latter two are measured by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the conditional log likelihood (CLL). The related kernels are compared via two-tailed t-test with a 95 percent confidence level and the Friedman's test using the 0.05 critical level.

The L-GEM upper bound (R*<sub>SM</sub>) is computed for each output neuron of a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). For a multi-class classification problem, there are more than one output neurons. For a K-class problem, there will be K L-GEM values, i.e. one for each output neuron. How to use these K L-GEM values to select the architecture of a RBFNN is still an open problem. One could use average, maximum and minimum value among these K L-GEM values to estimate the overall performance of the RBFNN under investigation. All three of them are reasonable and provide some information about the generalization capability of the RBFNN.
