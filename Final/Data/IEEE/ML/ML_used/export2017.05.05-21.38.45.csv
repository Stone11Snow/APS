The main goal is the discovery of a set of 3-D bases poses that can characterize the manifold of primitive human motions, or movemes, from a training set of 2-D projected poses obtained from still images taken at various camera angles. The proposed technique for basis discovery is data-driven rather than hand-designed. The learned representation is rotation invariant, and can reconstruct any training instance from multiple viewing angles. We apply our method to modeling human poses in sports (via the Leeds Sports Dataset), and demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned bases in a range of applications such as activity classification, inference of dynamics from a single frame, and synthetic representation of movements.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5473-2; POD:978-1-5090-5474-9","10.1109/ICDM.2016.0156","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837969","Human Motion Analysis;Latent Factor Modeling;Machine Learning;Representation Learning;Rotation Invariance","Activity recognition;Data models;Image reconstruction;Matrix decomposition;Solid modeling;Training;Training data","cameras;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;pose estimation;sport;statistical analysis","2D projected poses;3D bases poses;Leeds Sports Dataset;activity classification;camera angles;human pose modeling;lower-dimensional projections;moveme discovery;primitive human motions;rotation invariant latent factor model;static poses;still images;synthetic movement representation","","","","","","","12-15 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Nutritional assessment of children under five based on anthropometric measurements with image processing techniques","V. A. Ayma; V. H. Ayma; L. G.

Weight and height are the most frequently measured morphological traits which in combination with child's gender and age, generates anthropometric indices to establish child's nutritional status. Nevertheless, accomplishment of this task in rural areas is difficult because of complications to transport bulky and heavy equipment, which must be properly and adequately calibrated. This work proposed a novel approach to perform nutritional assessments of children under five, through a system focused on the estimation of anthropometric indices, based on the measurements obtained from a set of body part images and its relations with child's gender and age. The results showed that sensitivity and specificity for the anthropometric indicators, ranged from 66% to 100% and 88% to 100%, respectively. Moreover, overall accuracies were over 85% up to 100%. Additionally, the experiments conducted shown our method as a viable solution to perform nutritional evaluations via accurate anthropometric index estimations.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2532-9; POD:978-1-5090-2533-6","10.1109/ANDESCON.2016.7836265","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836265","image processing;machine learning;malnutrition;neural networks;nutrition assessment","Biological neural networks;Image processing;Pediatrics;Registers;Skin;Thigh;Weight measurement","anthropometry;medical image processing;paediatrics","anthropometric index estimations;anthropometric measurements;body part images;child gender;child mortality;child nutritional status;image processing techniques;malnutrition;morphological traits;nutritional assessment","","","","","","","19-21 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"PhosPred-RF: a novel sequence-based predictor for phosphorylation sites using sequential information only","L. Wei; P. Xing; J. Tang; Q. Zou","","IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","","2017","PP","99","1","1","Many recent efforts have been made for the development of machine learning based methods for fast and accurate phosphorylation site prediction. Currently, a majority of well-performing methods are based on hybrid information to build prediction models, such as evolutionary information, and disorder information, etc. Unfortunately, this type of methods suffers two major limitations: one is that it would be not much of help for protein phosphorylation site prediction in case of no obvious homology detected; the other is that computing such the complicated information is time-consuming, which probably limits the usage of predictors in practical applications. In this study, we present a simple, fast and powerful feature representation algorithm, which sufficiently explores the sequential information from multiple perspectives only based on primary sequences, and successfully captures the differences between true phosphorylation sites and non-phosphorylation sites. Using the proposed features, we propose a random forest based predictor named PhosPred-RF in the prediction of protein phosphorylation sites from proteins. We evaluate and compare the proposed predictor with state-of-the-art predictors on some benchmark datasets. The experimental results show that PhosPred-RF outperforms other existing predictors, demonstrating its potential to be a useful tool for protein phosphorylation site prediction. Currently, the proposed PhosPred-RF is freely accessible to the public through the user-friendly webserver http://server.malab.cn/PhosPred-RF.","1536-1241;15361241","","10.1109/TNB.2017.2661756","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7837721","feature representation;machine learning;protein phosphorylation;sequential information","Amino acids;Benchmark testing;Peptides;Prediction algorithms;Protein engineering;Proteins;Standards","","","","","","","","20170131","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, these optimizations view the whole run of a program in a monolithic manner. It is known that a program execution proceeds in phases-each phase corresponding to an identifiable set of control-flow behaviors. This implies that not all control-flows are hot (i.e. executed with a high frequency) all the times. Hence, if a program can switch among a set of hot paths for guiding the optimizations in the different phases, the optimizations may yield powerful results. We propose an algorithm that optimizes the clones of a function according to the different phase behaviors exhibited by the function, and dispatches its calls to the (potentially) most beneficial clone at runtime. This makes it possible to use profile information at a finer granularity than existing approaches. We start off by identifying critical functions that exhibit a high differential in its control-flow profiles, thereby exhibiting widely varying phase behavior. For these critical functions, we compile specialized clones that are tuned for each distinct phase behavior. Finally, we build a phase predictor that, at run-time, predicts the phase that a yet-to-be-executed function invocation would evoke (when executed), and guides the function invocation to the respective clone of the function. We build the predictor by learning a classifier over features extracted from the state of the program with the distinct phases acting as class labels. We demonstrate our algorithm by building a concrete phase-directed optimizer for register allocation (pdra) within the PBQP-based register allocator in the LLVM compiler infrastructure. We compare our allocator against the base allocator and a profile-guided allocator (pgra) that uses the profile information in a monolithic manner without extracting phase information.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5411-4; POD:978-1-5090-5412-1","10.1109/HiPC.2016.039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839692","compiler optimizations;machine learning;register allocation","Benchmark testing;Cloning;Feature extraction;Optimization;Registers;Resource management;Runtime","optimisation;program compilers","LLVM compiler infrastructure;PBQP-based register allocator;control-flow profiles;function clone optimization;function invocation;phase behavior;phase directed compiler optimizations;phase predictor;phase-directed optimizer;profile information;profile-guided allocator;register allocation","","","","","","","19-22 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Though, many times the use of Machine Learning is not enough to make sense of all this data. This makes visualization a very useful tool for Machine Learning practitioners and data analysts alike. Interactive visualization techniques can be very helpful by giving insight on the meaning of the output from classification tasks. This also applies to the data itself, as visualization can make some characteristics of the data become clear. Several bi-dimensional projection methods have been used to visualize data instances based on their attribute values. This visualization is more difficult when the instances have a large number of attributes. One of the visualization techniques that can deal with high dimensional data is Radial Coordinates Visualization (RadViz). RadViz can also be employed to visualize the performance of a probabilistic classifier, helping a user to find problematic instances that might have been misclassified. In this study, a new approach to use RadViz is proposed and investigated. The proposed approach combines the two aforementioned uses of RadViz (attribute-based data exploration and result exploration based on the output of probabilistic classification). For such, it approach provides an easy transition between the two types of visualization. This allows the context to be preserved, since the user can visually track the same data instance from one type of visualization to the other. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, a prototype, named DualRadviz, was implemented. On this prototype, in addition to RadViz, visualization by Parallel Coordinates is also provided, so that precise instance inspection can be performed, since, different from RadViz, Parallel coordinates visualization does not suffer from ambiguity. To illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method, a case study is presented.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3566-3; POD:978-1-5090-3567-0","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839593","RadViz;information visualization;machine learning;parallel coordinates;probabilistic classification","Context;Data visualization;Inspection;Matrix converters;Probabilistic logic;Prototypes;Springs","data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","DualRadviz;attribute-based data exploration;bidimensional projection methods;classification evaluation;data instance visualization;interactive visualization;machine learning;parallel coordinates visualization;probabilistic classifier;radial coordinates visualization","","","","","","","9-12 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The detection results are highly correlated to expert-labeled ground truth, therefore, ChainSpot is proven helpful for saving forensics efforts significantly.

The learning problem is modeled as a binary classification problem with latent variables that account for hidden information, such as multiple graduate programs within the same institution. An additional contribution of this paper is the collection of a new dataset of more than 25,000 students, with 6 applications per student on average and, hence, amounting to more than 150,000 applications spanning across more than 3000 source institutions. The dataset covers hundreds of target universities over several years, and allows us to develop models that provide insight into student application behavior and university decision patterns.

It is at the sixth position in the list of causes of death for the people aged between 60 and 65; the second between 65 and 75; the first over 75. Treatment of a patient, experiencing complications due to a fall, within the first 12 minutes after a fall brings a survival rate of 48% -75%. So, fast and accurate detection of fall events is emerging as a big necessity for many countries, especially for the advanced world where the society adopts the culture of independent living for elderly people. It is also important to determine the direction of a fall as it can help determine the locations of joint weakness and fracture quickly. Researchers' claims of fall detection accuracy of over 90% are based on accelerometers and embedded extra sensors like gyroscopes, cardio tachometer, magnetometer, and barometric pressure sensors. However, most such fall detection algorithms have been developed based on observational analysis of the data gathered, leading to thresholds settings for fall/non-fall situations. To detect the direction of fall, some researchers uses gyroscope or more accelerometers. The proposed method, using single 3D accelerometer and machine learning algorithm particularly SVM (Support vector machine) is to detect 4 types of falls (forward, backward, right and left). When applied to experimental data from 13 male subjects, the proposed system discriminates between falls and activities of daily living (ADL) with better than previously reported accuracy level. The system is reliable, user friendly and cost effective.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5421-3; POD:978-1-5090-5422-0","10.1109/MEDITEC.2016.7835372","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7835372","Barometric Pressure;Body Sensor Networks;Cardio tachometer;Machine Learning;Magnetometer;gyroscopes","Acceleration;Accelerometers;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Three-dimensional displays;Wearable sensors","accelerometers;cardiology;geriatrics;magnetometers;medical signal detection;pressure sensors;support vector machines;tachometers","activities-of-daily-living;backward fall;barometric pressure sensors;cardio tachometer;direction-sensitive fall detection system;elderly people;forward fall;gyroscopes;joint fracture;joint weakness;learning classifier;left fall;machine learning algorithm;magnetometer;right fall;support vector machine;three dimensional accelerometer","","","","","","","17-18 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is common to map these KBs into a graph when trying to induce inference rules from the KB, thus it is possible to apply graph-mining techniques to extract implicit knowledge. One common graph-based task is link prediction, which can be used to predict edges (new facts for the KB) that will appear in a near future. In this paper, we present Graph Rule Learner (GRL), a method designed to extract inference rules from ontological knowledge bases mapped to graphs.

In this paper, we propose the collaborative classification for recognizing daily activities with a smartwatch. We exploit a single off-the-shelf smartwatch to distinguish 5 different daily activities such as eating, vacuuming, sleeping, showering, and TV watching. More precisely, we conduct experiments for collecting sensor data from accelerometer and acoustic sensor which are embedded in a smartwatch. However, the simple combination of the raw acceleration and acoustic data does not deliver accurate recognition accuracy. In order to achieve high accuracy, we propose a collaborative classification algorithm which integrates sensor data and ground-truth label for improving recognition accuracy by constructing a mapping table. We evaluate accuracies using single-sensor based approach, multi-sensor based approach, and our collaborative classification approach. The results from activity recognition for about 20 hours data collected by subjects show reliable accuracies for all 5 activities, and the overall accuracy of our collaborative approach is about 91.5%.

"Naïve Bayes Approach for Predicting Missing Links in Ego Networks","A. K. Gupta; N.

For measurement and analysis of social networking sites, we can assume it as a huge graph, where nodes represent users while edges represent links among users. Millions of nodes make the study of social network complex to analyze, so we narrow down by considering ego network rather than considering whole social network for our analysis. Ego network can be considered as an individual's own social network with their direct connections known as alters'. In this paper we are trying to identify the missing links among alters of an ego network with the help of Naïve Bayes classification technique considering it as a link prediction technique. Link prediction techniques are used to predict the possibility of creation of new links in the network. For predicting new links, existing link prediction techniques calculate similarity score between two nodes in the network. Higher similarity score leads to the possibility of new links between nodes. These techniques mainly use common connectivity information, node degree or individual node features separately to calculate similarity score which may leads to high number of false predictions. Secondly deciding threshold for prediction is another issue with the similarity score based link prediction techniques. Thus we have implemented Naïve Bayes approach by considering it as a binary classification problem to identify the missing links in an ego network. The proposed approach uses common neighbors and individual node features among its existing connections and based on that predicts the possibility of new links. We have validated the result with area under ROC curve.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6170-9; POD:978-1-5090-6171-6","10.1109/iNIS.2016.045","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7829543","Binary classification;Ego networks;Link prediction;Naïve Bayes classification;Social network;machine learning","Bayes methods;Computers;Education;Facebook;Indexes;Machine learning algorithms","Bayes methods;pattern classification;social networking (online)","Naïve Bayes classification;alters;binary classification problem;common connectivity information;ego networks;individual node features;missing link prediction;node degree;online social networking sites;similarity score based link prediction","","","","","","","19-21 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

One of the main reasons behind traffic congestion is accidents which can not only result in casualties and losses for the participants, but also in wasted and lost time for the others that are stuck behind the wheels. Early detection of an accident can save lives, provides quicker road openings, hence decreases wasted time and resources, and increases efficiency. In this study, we propose a preliminary real-time autonomous accident-detection system based on computational intelligence techniques. Istanbul City traffic-flow data for the year 2015 from various sensor locations are populated using big data processing methodologies. The extracted features are then fed into a nearest neighbor model, a regression tree, and a feed-forward neural network model. For the output, the possibility of an occurrence of an accident is predicted. The results indicate that even though the number of false alarms dominates the real accident cases, the system can still provide useful information that can be used for status verification and early reaction to possible accidents.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9005-7; POD:978-1-4673-9006-4","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840798","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840798","IoT;Traffic flow;accident detection;big data;computational intelligence;intelligent transportation systems;machine learning;nearest neighbor;neural networks;regression tree;sensors","Accidents;Big data;Computational modeling;Data models;Feature extraction;Hidden Markov models;Roads","Big Data;feature extraction;road accidents;road vehicles;roads;traffic engineering computing","Big Data;Istanbul City traffic-flow data;autonomous highway accident detection;computational intelligence;feature extraction;motor vehicles;quicker road openings;sensor locations;traffic congestion;urban population","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article describes a computational model that interprets dynamics-expressive loudness variations in performances-in terms of the musical score, highlighting differences between performances of the same piece.

The architecture uses machine learning techniques to proactively predict and judge the performance of the system and make decisions for effective resource management for the database. In addition, we propose an adaptive sampling mechanism for classification to ensure that the architecture does not impose an unreasonable overhead on the system.

This method consists of 2 parts, initial segmentation and computation of body part likelihood score for each segment. In this paper, we propose improvements to this approach. Firstly, we propose a novel motion based body part segmentation using kinematic features to identify segments which undergo similar motion in the video based on a consistency or error measure. Secondly, we replace the Extreme Learning Machine classifier in the original work with deep learning to investigate it's performance. For accurate detection, deep learning requires a lot of training data and it has so far been used only in high resolution images.

In this project, we propose to use a touch pad to construct a HAM radio interface. Low-power, short-range wireless communication interfaces which have become available with modern microcontrollers enable the construction of such systems which can allow users to exchange information within buildings. While Morse code was invented for telegraphy, its simplicity allows a person with physical disability to use it more effectively than a keyboard-based interface. Thus, such an interface can be useful in rehab centers, old-age homes and hospitals. Security systems are yet another domain where Morse code can be gainfully employed. Since the user must make use of touch, drag and release operations for Morse code signaling, it is difficult to prescribe any strict guidelines on the length of the drag or the time gap between two drags. Multiple users of the system will use the system at different speeds. We propose the use of Fuzzy logic with elements of machine learning to reduce the chances of misinterpreting the Morse code and adapting to different users. In order to demonstrate our project, we used the MSP430F5529 development kit from Texas Instruments which comes with a touch-pad, an LCD screen and an RF interface.

The proposed system learns a set of words through coupled commands and demonstrations. The user can teach the system a new command by demonstrating the uttered command through an alternative interface. With these coupled commands and demonstrations, the system can learn the acoustic representations of the used words coupled with the meaning or semantics. In previous work the focus was mainly on a batch learning scheme to train the model. All the commands and demonstrations had to be stored and the model had to be retrained from scratch every time a new demonstration was given by the user. This work presents a Bayesian learning scheme where the dictionary of learned words can be updated when new data is presented. The dictionary can automatically expand to add new words or shrink to forget old words. The proposed system is tested on a language acquisition task where the user suddenly starts using new words. The results show that the proposed system can learn the new words quicker than a baseline where the size of the dictionary cannot be adjusted.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4903-5; POD:978-1-5090-4904-2; USB:978-1-5090-4902-8","10.1109/SLT.2016.7846257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7846257","Bayesian methods;Machine learning;Non-negative Matrix Factorisation;Spoken language acquisition;Vocabulary learning","Acoustics;Dictionaries;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition;Semantics;Speech;Vocabulary","acoustic signal processing;learning (artificial intelligence);signal representation;speech recognition;speech-based user interfaces","Bayesian learning scheme;acoustic representations;command-and-control interface;incremental learning;language acquisition task;spoken language acquisition","","","","","","","13-16 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For example, it can help detect areas of priority and assign emergency personnel in an efficient manner. However, occupancy detection can be a major challenge in indoor environments. A recent technology that can prove very useful in that respect is Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is able to provide the location of a user using information from beacons installed in a building. Here, we evaluate BLE as the primary means of occupancy estimation in an indoor environment, using a prototype system composed of BLE beacons, a mobile application and a server. We employ three machine learning approaches (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression and support vector machines) to determine the presence of occupants inside specific areas of an office space and we evaluate our approach in two independent experimental settings. Our experimental results indicate that combining BLE with machine learning is certainly promising as the basis for occupancy estimation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5566-1; POD:978-1-5090-5567-8","10.1109/IUCC-CSS.2016.013","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7828580","bluetooth low energy;emergency management;machine learning;occupancy detection","Advertising;Bluetooth;Buildings;Energy consumption;Mobile applications;Mobile handsets;Servers","Bluetooth;emergency management;indoor environment;learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;support vector machines","BLE beacons;Bluetooth low energy;emergency management;indoor environments;k-nearest neighbours;logistic regression;machine learning approaches;mobile application;occupancy detection;occupancy estimation;office space;server;support vector machines","","","","","","","14-16 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Conventional thread partition algorithms primarily include heuristic-based and machine learning-based. The existing heuristic-based approaches are only suitable for one kind of programs and can not guarantee to get the optimal solution of thread partitioning, and the existing machine learning-based approaches usually use vector-based characterization to represent a program, but easily ignore control information among basic blocks. In this paper, we present a novel graph-based thread partition approach to avoid these problems. It characterizes programs by graphs, integrating static and dynamic features, as well as data and control information. The graph-based partition approach learns partition knowledge and predicts partition for unseen programs. Prophet, which consists of an automatic parallelization compiler and a multi-core simulator, evaluates the performance of multithreaded programs. Olden benchmarks are used to realize the approach. Experiments show that our approach delivers a maximum performance improvement of 37.42% on a 16 core than heuristic-based approach, and 37.41% against conventional machine learning-based approach.

Most existing methods rely on bag-of-words model, which disregard contextual information. In many cases however, the sentiment strength of a word is implicitly associated with its part of speech and context. In this paper, we present a WWE (weighted word embeddings) method that combines word embeddings and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. First, we used a continuous word representations algorithm (Word2Vec) to train a vector model. The algorithm learns the optimal vectors from the context of surrounding words. According to the cosine similarity between the vector of a word and the vectors of seed words, a polarity score of this word can be calculated. The state-of-the-art SyntaxNet was used for POS tagging. We then computed an overall polarity score of the whole sentence by POS weighted polarity scores of words. At the end, majority voting was applied to determine the final polarity. Our experimental results show that the WWE method is performed with promising outcomes. Additionally, the methodology was demonstrated on the 3 Twitter datasets from different domains. The robustness recommends that this method can be applied on other sentiment classification problems or domains. We also compared the performance on various dimensions of the trained models. A higher dimension achieved a better performance.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9005-7; POD:978-1-4673-9006-4","10.1109/BigData.2016.7841056","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841056","Big Data;Cosine Similarity;Machine Learning;NLP;NLU;Natural Language Processing;Natural Language Understanding;Parsey McParseface;Part of Speech;Sentiment Classification;Social Media;SyntaxNet;Twitter;Word Embeddings;Word2Vec","Big data;Conferences;Decision support systems","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sentiment analysis;social networking (online);vectors","Big Data emotions;POS tagging;POS weighted polarity scores;SyntaxNet;WWE;Word2Vec;continuous word representations algorithm;cosine similarity;majority voting;optimal vectors;part-of-speech tagging;polarity score;seed words;sentiment classification;twitter datasets;vector model;weighted word embeddings;word sentiment strength","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The time between two successive measurements is a critical parameter to set during the WSN configuration because it can impact the WSN's lifetime, the wireless medium contention and the quality of the reported data. As trends in monitored parameters can significantly vary between scenarios and within time, identifying a sampling interval suitable for several cases is also challenging. In this work, we propose a dynamic sampling rate adaptation scheme based on reinforcement learning, able to tune sensors' sampling interval on-the-fly, according to environmental conditions and application requirements. The primary goal is to set the sampling interval to the best value possible so as to avoid oversampling and save energy, while not missing environmental changes that can be relevant for the application. In simulations, our mechanism could reduce up to 73% the total number of transmissions compared to a fixed strategy and, simultaneously, keep the average quality of information provided by the WSN. The inherent flexibility of the reinforcement learning algorithm facilitates its use in several scenarios, so as to exploit the broad scope of the Internet of Things.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4130-5; POD:978-1-5090-4131-2","10.1109/WF-IoT.2016.7845391","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7845391","Autonomic Computing;Machine Learning;Performance Optimization;Wireless Sensor Networks","Learning (artificial intelligence);Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors;Time measurement;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;environmental factors;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;WSN configuration;application requirements;dynamic sampling rate adaptation scheme;environmental conditions;online reinforcement learning;relative humidity;sampling interval;sensor nodes;wireless medium contention;wireless sensor networks","","","","","","","12-14 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

They usually require prostheses to restore the original functionality of the missing limbs so to be able to assist them in the activities of daily living. Extensive works have been reported in developing prostheses that not only could work as close as the natural limbs but also look alike the original ones. Many of these prostheses are based on the myoelectric control which requires the electromyography (EMG) signal to be measured and analyzed from the remaining nerves or muscles left after amputation. It is still a challenge however to detect, process, classify and apply the signal appropriately. In this paper, a study on the relationship of thumb-tip force related to EMG signals using a well-designed, portable thumb training system is conducted. The EMG signal is classified by using machine learning techniques when the thumb is flexed at different angles and exerts different magnitude of forces at its tip. The thumb training system is developed with compliances to fit different shape and size of human hands. The result from the analysis done using WEKA software shows that the EMG signal can be used to estimate the posture of the thumb at different flexed angles and thumb tip forces.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7791-1; POD:978-1-4673-7792-8","10.1109/IECBES.2016.7843552","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7843552","Thumb-tip force;electromyography;machine learning;thumb training system","Electrodes;Electromyography;Force;Muscles;Thumb;Training","biomechanics;electromyography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;prosthetics;signal classification","EMG based classification;WEKA software;amputation;diabetes;electromyography;human limb loss;machine learning;muscles;myoelectric control;nerves;portable thumb training system;prostheses;signal classification;signal detection;signal processing;thumb posture;thumb-tip force;traumatic accidents;vascular diseases","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this field, among renewable sources, the wind power one is characterized by the higher criticalities, due to the inherent intermittency not correlated with the day-night cycle. Moreover, the intermittent nature of wind power produces a heavy effect on the power system, because very often the production takes place in low-load conditions on the network, a condition for which a prediction error causes higher problems.

In this paper a dataset of malware and clean files (goodware) was created and analyzed from the static and dynamic features provided by the online framework VirusTotal. The purpose is to select the smallest number of features that keep classification accuracy as high as possible in order to decrease the use of resources for monitoring as well as extracting features and the time for detection. In this research, it was found that “9” features are enough to distinguish malware from “goodware” files with an accuracy of 99.60%. Selecting the most representative features for malware detection relies on the possibility of creating an embedded program that monitors the processes executed by the operating system (OS) and looks for the characteristics that match malware behavior. In addition, classification algorithms such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) were used in a novel combination that not only showed an increase in accuracy, but also in the training speed from hours to just minutes. Finally, the trained model (which was trained with a dataset of malware samples seen before September 2015) was tested on a new dataset of malware samples seen by first time between October 2015 and June 2016 and showed that the model is still effective for detection of unseen malware files.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9005-7; POD:978-1-4673-9006-4","10.1109/BigData.2016.7841031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841031","Big Data Analytics;Feature selection;Machine Learning;Malware detection;Neural Networks;Random Forest;Support Vector Machine;improving accuracy","Big data;Conferences;DH-HEMTs;High definition video","feature extraction;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);operating systems (computers);pattern classification;pattern clustering;support vector machines;system monitoring","Internet;SVM;VirusTotal;big data technology;classification algorithm;computers;cyber threat clustering;cyber threat detection;cyber threat proliferation;dynamic feature;embedded program;feature extraction;goodware files;machine learning;malware behavior;malware classification;malware detection system;malware discovery;malware files;neural networks;operating system;process execution monitoring;random forest;smart phones;static feature;support vector machine;tablets","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In many applications, the data labeling process is expensive and can affect the predictive performance of classification models. A current solution has been the use of active learning, which investigates strategies for data labeling. Its main goal is to decide which instances should be labeled and added to the training set, reducing the overall labeling costs. However, the strategy normally depends on a learning algorithm, which should be chosen by a machine learning specialist - usually based on a cross-validation procedure. Consequently, there is a deadlock: without the complete training set, the algorithm that will present the best learning curve cannot be known in advance. Ideally, some type of automatic selection should be employed to solve this deadlock. This study investigates the use of meta-learning for automatic algorithm selection in active learning tasks. Experimental results show that meta-learning is able to find correspondences between algorithms and dataset features in order to help active learning to reduce the risks of incurring in unexpected labeling costs.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3566-3; POD:978-1-5090-3567-0","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.021","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839562","active learning;machine learning;meta-learning;recommendation","Clustering algorithms;Entropy;Labeling;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;System recovery;Training","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;sampling methods","active learning;active sampling;automatic algorithm selection;classification models;data labeling process;learning bias automatic selection;machine learning;metalearning","","","","","","","9-12 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The intent of IE is to produce a knowledge base i.e. organize the information in a way that it is useful to people and arrange the information in a semantic way so that algorithms can make certain useful inferences from it. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of IE which finds and classifies the names/entities. Once these Named Entities (NE) are extracted, they can then be indexed and made searchable, relations can be derived, questions can be answered and many more. NER techniques are different for different domains, because of the uniqueness that exists in each of the domains, although the process depends on a number of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing and model building. As an example, NER in the medical domain involves handling of a number of vital tasks such as identification of medical terms, attributes such as negation, severity, identification of relationships between entities and mapping terms in the document to concepts in domain specific ontologies. There is also a heavy dependence on domain specific resources such as medical dictionaries and ontologies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)[34]. In this paper, we focus on NER in the clinical domain. In particular, we will focus on the NER challenges and the qualitative analysis of clinical reports on the approaches we took for the named entities: anatomies, findings, location qualifier, and procedures.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9005-7; POD:978-1-4673-9006-4","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840814","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840814","Deep Learning;Language Modelling;Long short-term memory;Machine Learning;Natural Language Processing;Ontologies;Text Analytics","Data mining;Dictionaries;Medical diagnostic imaging;Medical services;Ontologies;Unified modeling language","knowledge acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;natural language processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;text analysis","IE;NER techniques;NLP;UMLS;clinical named entity recognition;domain specific ontology;entity classification;information extraction;knowledge extraction;machine learning;medical domain;medical term identification;name classification;natural language processing;term mapping;text analysis;unified medical language system;unstructured data;unstructured information sources","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose an integer form of stochastic computation and introduce some elementary circuits. We then propose an efficient implementation of a DNN based on integral SC.

Combining the channel properties variation principles with antenna size, frequency, mobility and scenario dug from the channel data, the proposed model can be expanded in versatile application to support future mobile research.","1673-5447;16735447","","10.1109/CC.2016.7833457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7833457","5G;big data;channel model;cluster;machine learning;massive MIMO","5G mobile communication;Antenna measurements;Bandwidth;Big data;Channel models;Computational modeling;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","N/A 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

With the growth of the PV manufacturing industry, automation for defect detection is seen as a great potential in ensuring the quality of these PV modules. Hotspot formation due to defects is detrimental to the performance of PV devices. Thus this research aims to detect and isolate hotspot areas in PV modules by applying two machine learning techniques, namely K-means color quantization for pre-processing, and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for processing, in the images captured by an infrared camera. In the preprocessing, K-means clustering algorithm produced a quantized color image represented by the contours while in the processing or clustering part, DBSCAN resulted in the segmentation of the image, isolating the hotspot. Further investigation of the PV module through visual inspection found a crack in one of the solar cell where the hotspot occurred.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2597-8; POD:978-1-5090-2598-5; USB:978-1-5090-2596-1","10.1109/TENCON.2016.7848290","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7848290","Color Quantization;DBSCAN;K-Means Clustring;hotspot detection;image processing;image segmentation;infrared imaging;machine learning;photovoltaic","Cameras;Clustering algorithms;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Photovoltaic cells;Quantization (signal);Temperature distribution","image colour analysis;image segmentation;power engineering computing;solar cells;solar power stations","DBSCAN;K-means clustering algorithm;K-means color quantization;PV arrays;PV manufacturing industry;defect detection automation;density based spatial clustering of applications with noise;hotspot detection;hotspot formation;image segmentation;infrared camera;machine learning techniques;photovoltaic arrays;photovoltaic modules;quantized color image;solar cell;solar energy","","","","","","","22-25 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As an effective technique for data fusion, unsupervised multimodal feature representation aims to learn discriminative features, indicating the improvement of classification and clustering performance of learning algorithms. However, it is a challenging issue since varying modality favors different structural learning. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature learning method to represent multimodal images as a sparse multi-graph structure embedding problem. First, an effective algorithm is proposed to learn a sparse multi-graph construction from multimodal data, where each modality corresponds to one regularized graph structure. Second, incorporating the learned multi-graph structure, the feature learning problem for multimodal images is formulated as a form of matrix factorization. An efficient corresponding algorithm is developed to optimize the problem and its convergence is also proved. Finally, the proposed method is compared with several state-of-the-art singlemodal and multimodal feature learning techniques in eight publicly available face image datasets. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing ones in terms of clustering performance for all tested datasets.","1520-9210;15209210","","10.1109/TMM.2017.2663324","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839979","feature fusion;graph embedding;machine learning;multimodal data;sparse representation","Clustering algorithms;Correlation;Data integration;Feature extraction;Learning systems;Optimization;Sparse matrices","","","","","","","","20170202","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

To reduce expenses while ensuring the required grade of service, in this paper we propose a VNT reconfiguration approach based on data analytics for traffic prediction (VENTURE). It regularly reconfigures the VNT based on the predicted traffic, thus adapting the topology to both the current and the predicted traffic volume and direction. A machine learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network is used to provide robust and adaptive traffic models. The reconfiguration problem that takes as its input the traffic prediction is modeled mathematically, and a heuristic is proposed to solve it in practical times.

As malware become more capable at hiding its malicious intent through the use of code obfuscation, it becomes imperative for malware detection techniques to keep up with the pace of malware changes. Currently, most of the existing malware detection approaches for Android platform use semantic pattern matching, which is highly effective but is limited to what the computers have encountered before. However, their performance degrades significantly when it comes to identifying malicious apps they have never tackled before. In this paper, we propose DroidDeepLearner, an Android malware characterization and identification approach that uses deep learning algorithm to address the current need for malware detection to become more autonomous at learning to solve problems with less human intervention.

It is built on the assumption that context changes that require these adaptations at run-time can be anticipated at design-time. Therefore, the set of adaptation rules and the space of configurations in a DSPL are predefined and fixed at design-time. Yet, for large-scale and highly distributed systems, anticipating all relevant context changes during design-time is often not possible due to the uncertainty of how the context may change. Such design-time uncertainty therefore may mean that a DSPL lacks adaptation rules or configurations to properly reconfigure itself at run-time. We propose an adaptive system model to cope with design-time uncertainty in DSPLs. This model combines learning of adaptation rules with evolution of the DSPL configuration space. It takes particular account of the mutual dependencies between evolution and learning, such as using feedback from unsuccessful learning to trigger evolution. We describe concrete steps for learning and evolution to show how such feedback can be exploited.

Existing solutions either base static reasoning on syntactic properties, such as exception handlers or configuration fields, or compute data-flow reachability over the program, which leads to scalability challenges. We explore a new and complementary category of features, which strikes a middleground between the above two categories. This new category focuses on security-relevant operations (communication, lifecycle, etc) - and in particular, their multiplicity and happens-before order - as a means to distinguish between malicious and benign applications. Computing these features requires semantic, yet lightweight, modeling of the program's behavior. We have created a malware detection system for Android, MASSDROID, that collects traces of security-relevant operations from the call graph via a scalable form of data-flow analysis. These are reduced to happens-before and multiplicity features, then fed into a supervised learning engine to obtain a malicious/benign classification. MASSDROID also embodies a novel reporting interface, containing pointers into the code that serve as evidence supporting the determination. We have applied MASSDROID to 35,000 Android apps from the wild. The results are highly encouraging with an F-score of 95% in standard testing, and >90% when applied to previously unseen malware signatures.

Computational challenges combined with high data velocity have to this point restricted rtfMRI analyses to studying regions of the brain independently. However, given that neural processing is accomplished via functional interactions among brain regions, neuroscience could stand to benefit from rtfMRI analyses of full-brain interactions. In this paper, we extend such an offline analysis method, full correlation matrix analysis (FCMA), to enable its use in rtfMRI studies. Specifically, we introduce algorithms capable of processing real-time data for all stages of the FCMA machine learning workflow: incremental feature selection, model updating, and real-time classification.

Experiments show that our system successfully analyzes a stream of brain volumes and returns neurofeedback with less than 180 ms of lag.

We first expand the functionality of the Flink Python API in order to accommodate the implementation of rank-1 dictionary learning, a model for decomposing a large matrix. Iterative algorithms, aggregators, and other features are added to the incomplete Python API, and the experiences and lessons learned are described. Using these features, we port an existing implementation of r1DL from using the Python API of Apache Spark to using the Python API of Apache Flink. In preliminary testing, this implementation suggests performance boosts over Spark for large input files, meriting further research. We conclude that Flink is likely a feasible tool for the application of dictionary learning to decompose fMRI data, and we continue to evaluate and apply it.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9005-7; POD:978-1-4673-9006-4","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840869","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840869","Data science;distributed computing;iterative algorithms;machine learning;open source software","Data analysis;Dictionaries;Engines;Iterative methods;Java;Matrix decomposition;Sparks","application program interfaces;biomedical MRI;data analysis;iterative methods;matrix decomposition;medical signal processing;optimisation","Apache Flink Python API;Apache Spark Python API;data analysis framework;fMRI data decomposition;iterative algorithms;matrix decomposition;optimizations;r1DL algorithm;rank-1 dictionary learning algorithm","","","","","","","5-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Rating mechanisms usually exist in most of the shopping sites. Therefore, predicting which products a customer is going to buy next from the rating information becomes possible, making recommender systems important for online shopping. The success of an online shopping site can be dominated by the quality of the recommender system involved. One factor for the quality is whether the user preference can be taken into account in the recommender system. A method that examines if a user's rating truly reflects a product's quality was proposed by Allahbakhsh and Lgnjatovic. By giving different weights to users' ratings according to the examined results, products are recommended to interested users automatically. However, the method does not consider that preferences are different among different individual users. In this paper, we propose a method which is also based on the examined results, but takes personal preference into account as well. As a result, different recommendations are preferably provided to different users. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4102-2; POD:978-1-5090-4103-9; USB:978-1-5090-4101-5","10.1109/ICInfA.2016.7831992","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7831992","machine learning;online rating;recommender system","Clustering algorithms;Companies;Mathematical model;Measurement;Motion pictures;Recommender systems;Testing","Internet;Web sites;recommender systems;relevance feedback;retail data processing","online shopping sites;personal preference;product quality;rating scores;recommendations;recommender system quality;shopping style;user ratings","","","","","","","1-3 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The final multiclass prediction is obtained by a proper combination of the outputs of the binary classifiers induced in their solution. Decision directed acyclic graphs (DDAG) can be used to organize and to aggregate the outputs of the pairwise classifiers from the one-versus-one (OVO) decomposition. Nonetheless, there are various possible DDAG structures for problems with many classes. In this paper evolutionary algorithms are employed to heuristically find the positions of the OVO binary classifiers in a DDAG. The objective is to place easier sub-problems at higher levels of the DDAG hierarchical structure, in order to minimize the occurrence of cumulative errors. For estimating the complexity of the binary sub-problems, we employ two indexes which measure the separability of the classes. The proposed approach presented sound results in a set of experiments on benchmark datasets, although random DDAGs also performed quite well.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3566-3; POD:978-1-5090-3567-0","10.1109/BRACIS.2016.031","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7839572","Genetic Algorithms;Machine learning;Multiclass Problem","Complexity theory;Evolutionary computation;Genetic algorithms;Indexes;Sociology;Statistics;Support vector machines","computational complexity;directed graphs;evolutionary computation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","DDAG;OVO;binary subproblem complexity;decision directed acyclic graphs;evolutionary algorithms;machine learning;multiclass classification problems;multiple binary subproblems;one-versus-one decomposition","","","","","","","9-12 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe additional functionality for our watershed planning system, called WRESTORE (Watershed REstoration Using Spatio-Temporal Optimization of REsources) (http://wrestore.iupui.edu), where stakeholders can collaboratively optimize best management practices on to the watershed. WRESTORE utilizes the USDA's public domain Soil and Water Assessment Tool hydrologic model for watershed simulations. Reinforcement learning and interactive genetic algorithms are applied for the search process. The new functionality described is a user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's decision-making, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs. The user modeling task utilizes neural network approaches, such as deep learning. We believe the originality of our approach centers on integrating user models in to the hydrological decision support process. This paper thus has three objectives: (i) outline current work in user modeling and watershed design, (ii) describe our system for interactive optimization of watershed design, and (iii) describe our work on implementing accurate and stable user predictive models to boost optimization performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1897-0; POD:978-1-5090-1898-7; USB:978-1-5090-1819-2","10.1109/SMC.2016.7844555","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7844555","cybernetics;data science;decision support system;deep learning;evolutionary multi-objective optimization;fuzzy logic;hydroinformatics;interactive optimization;machine learning;multiple criteria decision analysis;user modeling","Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Fuzzy logic;Machine learning;Neural networks;Optimization;Predictive models","decision support systems;fuzzy neural nets;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);wetlands","USDA public domain soil-and-water assessment tool hydrologic model;WRESTORE;computational model;deep learning approach;fuzzy learning approach;hydrological decision support process;interactive genetic algorithms;interactive optimization;neural network approach;optimal watershed design;reinforcement learning;search process;user decision-making;user modeling component;user predictive model;watershed planning system;watershed restoration-using-spatiotemporal optimization-of-resources","","","","","","","9-12 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent works focus on applying machine learning techniques for Twitter spam detection, which make use of the statistical features of tweets. In our labeled tweets data set, however, we observe that the statistical properties of spam tweets vary over time, and thus, the performance of existing machine learning-based classifiers decreases. This issue is referred to as “Twitter Spam Drift”. In order to tackle this problem, we first carry out a deep analysis on the statistical features of one million spam tweets and one million non-spam tweets, and then propose a novel Lfun scheme. The proposed scheme can discover “changed” spam tweets from unlabeled tweets and incorporate them into classifier's training process. A number of experiments are performed to evaluate the proposed scheme. The results show that our proposed Lfun scheme can significantly improve the spam detection accuracy in real-world scenarios.","1556-6013;15566013","","10.1109/TIFS.2016.2621888","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7707341","Social network security;machine learning;twitter spam detection","Feature extraction;Malware;Market research;Security;Twitter;Uniform resource locators","pattern classification;security of data;social networking (online)","Lfun scheme;classifiers training process;drifted Twitter spam;statistical features-based real-time detection","","","","","","20161026","April 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
