It combines the minimum infinity-norm and minimum two-norm solutions by using a new problem formulation. 2) Such a bi-criteria scheme is then reformulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem with its coefficient matrix being positive semi-definite. 3) The LVI-based primal-dual neural network is finally chosen to solve online such a QP problem as well as the bi-criteria weighting scheme. This is in view of the fact that the LVI-based primal-dual neural network has a simple piecewise-linear dynamics and higher computational efficiency.

Thus the normalization of the image with different divergences on two directions is different from the normalization of its rotation. The most intuitive way to overcome the difficulty is normalizing the images on all directions. After new normalization, the number in each bin of polar histogram is counted and it is lined row by row to form a vector. Then, the Fourier spectrum of the vector, called Fourier descriptor, is computed. Finally, experimental results of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) are presented and show that the NPNH is a simple, affine invariant and powerful distance in object recognition.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370434","Estimation;Information fusion;Resource management;Tracking","Biomedical imaging;Biomedical optical imaging;Character recognition;Cybernetics;Feature extraction;Histograms;Machine learning;Object recognition;Optical character recognition software;Optical distortion","Fourier analysis;feature extraction;object recognition;statistical analysis","Fourier descriptor;Fourier spectrum;affine invariant feature extraction;object recognition;optical recognition;pattern recognition;polar normalized image histogram bin","","2","","15","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This model divides every feature vector into several subvectors, each of which is modeled on Bayes assumption. Then subvectors are combined by inducing a weight parameter vector. After some transforms, the weight parameters is fit discriminatively by a perceptron algorithm. Furthermore, we give detailed theoretical analysis and justification on the convergence and robustness to the inseperable data. As an important byproduct, an approach is discribed to generalize the binary classifier perceptron into multiclass classifer.

Planning with over-subscription problem and preferences is one of the most challenging problems in planning. Inspired by the following two facts, we come up with a method to handle soft goals problem, and it also efficient with classical planning problems. Firstly, using external information has turned out to be a fruitful approach for classical planning; secondly, strategies in incremental planning for ordering and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals of a planning problem have recently draw a lot attention from planning community. In this paper we present an approach to combining incremental planning with control knowledge and this approach can be used to handle soft goals. Our method improved incremental planning using goal agenda with more ordering for atomic goal and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals. We also provide preliminary empirical results in a planner called FFps which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to the original FF and it can handle soft goals problem.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370677","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370677","Artificial intelligence;External information;Incremental planning;Over-subscription and preferences planning;Reasonable ordering","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Costs;Cybernetics;Machine learning;NASA;Strategic planning;Sun;Trajectory","planning (artificial intelligence);uncertainty handling","incremental planning;over-subscription planning;reasonable ordering;soft goals handling","","1","","10","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on this concept, Refined CDOGP algorithm is designed to minimize the number of nodes in the graph and save some storage space at the same time. Partial relaxed planning task could avoid some dead-end states. Based on the goal distances and the utilization of resource, a novel heuristic function is designed in this paper, and it will lead the search to the direction to a better valid plan.

In this paper, a partition method of basic block is suggested. In this partition method, branch instructions are reduced greatly, while the high error detection coverage remain ensure. The simulated results show that compared with the traditional Control Flow Checking by Software Signatures(CFCSS) control flow checking algorithm, the Improved algorithm can reduce total branch instructions by over 10%, reduce the power dissipation by nearly 9%, without decreasing the error detection coverage.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370659","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370659","Base node;Control flow checking;Control flow graph;Low power dissipation","Control systems;Cybernetics;Error correction;Fault tolerance;Hardware;Machine learning;Partitioning algorithms;Power dissipation;Power system reliability;Software algorithms","artificial satellites;embedded systems;power aware computing;program compilers;program diagnostics","branch instruction;error detection;partition method;power-aware software control flow checking;satellite-borne embedded system;single event upset;software compilation;software signature;spatial radiation environment","","1","","7","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

If the numbers themselves are not certain, how can the distance between them be certain? In this paper, we consider different approaches to compute the distance between fuzzy numbers, and introduce a fuzzy value distance by using graded mean integration representation of trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and the span of the fuzzy numbers. Then we also discuss the distance of the linguistic data ""greater or less than x"", or ""about x"". The result shows that it is more reasonable to say that ""the fuzzy distance of about 3 and about 7 is about 4, not 4"". Here, we apply the proposed fuzzy distance concept to make house buying decision. The idea is that the buyer is looking for a house that is the minimal distance to her/his ideal house comparing with other houses. Suppose the buyer considers m attributes (price, district, area, location... etc.) for buying a house, and assigns the weight and ideal value of each attribute. Then we use the sum of the m-weighted fuzzy distance of the attributes for the buyer and the corresponding attributes of the house. The graded mean integration representation of the sum is used to rank the order of the house in selling queue. The real estate sales person can introduce the suitable houses to the buyer in the ranking order of the houses. Through this process, the buyer can find a satisfactory house much quicker. However, the concept of fuzzy distance can be applied in solving many other decision problems.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370365","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370365","Fuzzy distance;Fuzzy number;Graded mean integration ranking;Graded mean integration representation;House selection","Cities and towns;Conference management;Cybernetics;Educational institutions;Finance;Financial management;Fuzzy logic;Information management;Machine learning;Marketing and sales","decision making;decision theory;fuzzy set theory;integration;number theory;real estate data processing","fuzzy value distance;graded mean integration representation;house buying decision;house selection;real estate process;trapezoidal fuzzy number","","1","","12","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our work mainly focuses on improving naive Bayes classifier through feature weighting strategy. The basic idea is that parameter estimation of naive Bayes can consider the degree of feature importance as well as feature distribution. In addition, we have extended a conventional algorithm for incremental feature update for developing a dynamic feature space in operational environment.

Decision making under uncertainty conditions is one of the main problems in multi-agent systems. Uncertain and stochastic factors affect the performance of the action and make the agent unable to take the appropriate task. A high complexity of such environment causes decision making on the basis of traditional method (hard code) to be absolutely difficult, so new approaches of decision making such as Markov decision process (MDP) and neural networks are used. In our research, the soccer 3D simulation is used as a test bed for multi-agent systems. In this paper, the Markov decision process is used as a strategy for decision making of soccer 3D agents, and also a novel policy is proposed in our MDP method. The simulation results are used for performance evaluation of our proposed approach in comparison with traditional method in situations that agents' sense/act abilities have a lot of noise involved, the simulation results show that in our MDP method, the agents make better decision and carry out better action which help to reach the goal of plan.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370557","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370557","Decision making;Markov decision process;Uncertainty environment","Computational modeling;Cybernetics;Decision making;Distributed computing;Electronic mail;Machine learning;Multiagent systems;Testing;Uncertainty;Working environment noise","Markov processes;decision making;multi-agent systems;neural nets;uncertainty handling","Markov decision process;decision making;multi-agent artificial intelligence distributed algorithms;neural networks;soccer simulation","","2","","12","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The concept of local region conservation comes from a motif, a fragment with biological or functional meaning. Besides, structure-based identification of homologues often succeeds where sequence-alone-based methods fail, because in many cases evolution retains the folding pattern long after sequence similarity becomes undetectable. Thus, prediction of protein function from sequence and structure is a difficult problem, because homologous proteins often have different functions. Alternative methods include inferring conservation patterns in members of a functionally uncharacterized family for which many sequences and structures are known. The researches show that sequence conservation could be discovered that their corresponding residues in 3D space are a compact region and close to ligand. But the question is that is it possible to discover compact regions via protein structure analysis; therefore, our motivation is find out a local structure representation and apply the concept of mining frequent item set to discover local structure conservation. In the experiments, we use enzyme classification to discover local structure conservations, which we can easily identify the connection linked by detected local structure conservations and substrates.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370464","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370464","Local structure representation;Neighborhood residues sphere;Protein structure comparison;Protein structure mining","Biochemistry;Computer science;Cybernetics;Data mining;Laboratories;Machine learning;Oceans;Protein engineering;Protein sequence;Telecommunications","biology computing;data mining;enzymes","enzyme classification;frequent item set mining;local conserved structure discovery;local region conservation;local structure representation;protein functions;sequence conservation","","0","","21","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We formulate it as discrete energy minimization problem and map it into Hopfield neural network with the fuzzy c-means strategy to find the TDMA schedule for nodes in a communication network. Each time slot is regarded as a data sample and every node is taken as a cluster. Time slots are adequately distributed to the dedicated node while satisfying the constraints. The aim is to minimize the TDMA cycle length and maximize the node transmissions avoiding both primary and secondary conflicts.

The fuzzy belief networks is utilized to represent the composition and structure of various types of groups. And the fuzzy logic inference is employed to infer the type of group with its attributes. In this paper, the nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm is utilized to merge targets into groups by position. Based on the aggregation result, the type of merged group is recognized via fuzzy belief networks. Finally, a simple application of the approach is described. The results show that the approach is available.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370331","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370331","Force Aggregation and Classification;Fuzzy Logic;Situation Assessment","Bayesian methods;Clustering algorithms;Computer science;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Force sensors;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy neural networks;Fuzzy sets;Machine learning","belief networks;fuzzy logic;fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;military computing;pattern classification;pattern clustering","bidirectional fuzzy influences;force aggregation;force classification;fuzzy belief networks;fuzzy logic inference;fuzzy set membership functions;military domain situation assessment;nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm","","1","","17","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These models can't successfully work in network environment nowadays due to the difficulty to make the labels of subjects and objects unaltered across different computers. Recent years many researchers put forward cryptographic solutions to address multilevel security problem. But the key management schemes in real systems were always difficult problems that made those solutions unfeasible. The trusted computing technologies are great advancement in computer architecture and should be a powerful tool to securely manage the keys. This paper proposes a new approach on the base of the capabilities provided by TPM (trusted platform module) to implement a sound cryptographic algorithm.

Because of insufficient or noisy training data in real-world problems, the estimated parameters of the GMM are not able to accurately represent the underlying distributions of the observations. In this paper, we investigate the GMM with uncertain mean vector or uncertain covariance matrix. To handle uncertain parameters, we assume that they vary anywhere in an interval with uniform possibilities. As a result, the likelihood of the GMM with uncertain parameters becomes an interval rather than a precise real number. Due to interval likelihoods, the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion is not suitable for classification. Hence we use the generalized linear model (GLM) for classification decision-making. Multi-category classification on different datasets from UCI repository shows that GMMs with uncertain parameters are better than conventional GMMs. The proposed method for modeling uncertain parameters of the GMM can be applied to other statistical models which may have uncertain parameters because of incomplete information in real-world problems.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370617","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370617","Gaussian mixture models (GMMs);Generalized linear model (GLM);Maximum-likelihood (ML)","Covariance matrix;Cybernetics;Decision making;Machine learning;Maximum likelihood estimation;Parameter estimation;Random variables;Testing;Training data;Uncertainty","Gaussian processes;covariance matrices;pattern classification","Gaussian mixture models;classification decision-making;generalized linear model;maximum-likelihood criterion;multi-category classification;uncertain covariance matrix;uncertain mean vector;uncertain parameters","","2","","15","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Edge detection is a fundamental issue in the coal gangue image processing and pattern recognition. Through traditional methods of image processing are efficient as edge detectors, a lot of false edge information will be extracted from a coal gangue image, because the coal gangue images are always contaminated with speckles of coal dust. Therefore a revised algorithm based on wavelet transform is developed to suppress the speckles in the gangue images, to enhance edges. At last the gangues and coal are separated according to their characteristics. The experiment results show that the recognition rate of coal gangues is increased by the wavelet transform method.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370409","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370409","Coal gangues;Edge detection;Image processing;Multi-resolution analysis;Wavelet transform","Automation;Cybernetics;Image analysis;Image edge detection;Image processing;Machine learning;Water pollution;Water resources;Wavelet analysis;Wavelet transforms","coal;edge detection;image classification;mining industry;wavelet transforms","automation selecting system;coal gangue image;false edge information;pattern recognition;revised edge detection algorithm;wavelet transform","","2","","2","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this approach, the tutorial-<i>like</i> system is capable of presenting teaching material within a Socratic model of teaching. The corresponding questions are of a multiple choice type, in which the complexity of the material increases in difficulty. This enables the tutorial-<i>like</i> system to present the teaching material in different chapters, where each chapter represents a level of difficulty that is harder than the previous one. We attempt to achieve the entire learning process using the learning automata (LA) paradigm. In order for the domain model to possess an increased difficulty for the teaching environment, we propose to correspondingly reduce the range of the penalty probabilities of all actions by incorporating a scaling factor mu. We show that such a scaling renders it more difficult for the student to infer the correct action within the LA paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, the concept of modeling teaching material with increasing difficulty using an LA paradigm is unique. The main results we have obtained are that increasing the difficulty of the teaching material can affect the learning of normal and below-normal students by resulting in an increased learning time, but it seems to have no effect on the learning behavior of fast students.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370125","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370125","Domain modeling;Learning automata;Tutorial-like Systems","Computer science;Convergence;Cybernetics;Education;Electronic mail;Learning automata;Machine learning;Stochastic processes;Testing;Tutorial","computer aided instruction;learning automata;teaching","Socratic teaching model;learning automata;learning behavior;learning process;teaching environment;teaching material;tutorial-like system","","3","","12","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As illustrative numerical examples, both 6times6 and 10 times 10 job-shop scheduling problems are considered. Through the comparative simulations with position-based crossover, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed crossover are demonstrated.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370688","Genetic algorithms;Job crossover;Job-Shop scheduling","Algorithm design and analysis;Cybernetics;Design engineering;Genetic algorithms;Genetic engineering;Information science;Job shop scheduling;Machine learning;Optimal scheduling;Production","computer integrated manufacturing;fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;integrated manufacturing systems;job shop scheduling","fuzzy job shop scheduling;genetic algorithm;operation-based coding;optimal scheduling solution;position-based crossover","","1","","5","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fuzzy Power Quality Indicator","Y. T. Hsiao; Y. M. Wu; Y. H. Lee; F. Ye","Department of Computer Science, National Taipei University of Education, Taipei, Taiwan. E-MAIL: ythsiao@tea.ntue.edu.tw","2007 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","20071029","2007","3","","1418","1423","This paper proposes a novel fuzzy power quality indicator for representing the level of power quality status. In this work, we develop the fuzzy rules, degree membership function and inference rules for identifying the power quality level on six encountered types of power quality events. The traditional power quality indices are not performed well for assessing the status of the power quality because of their hard limits. Hence, this study develops the soft (human thinking like) indices for presenting the serious degree of power quality. Simulation results show the proposed fuzzy power quality indicator is suitable for representing the level of power quality events.","2160-133X;2160133X","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-0973-0; POD:978-1-4244-0972-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2007.4370367","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4370367","Fuzzy;Index;Power quality;Voltage quality","Cybernetics;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy systems;Harmonic distortion;Humans;Machine learning;Power quality;Power supplies;Total harmonic distortion;Voltage","fuzzy reasoning;fuzzy set theory;power supply quality","fuzzy power quality indicator;inference rule","","2","","16","","","19-22 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
