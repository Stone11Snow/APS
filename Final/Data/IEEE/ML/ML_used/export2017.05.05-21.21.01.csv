Many efficient algorithms have been proposed in the literature. The idea presented in this paper is to extract a condensed representation of the frequent itemsets called rule-free sets, instead of extracting the whole frequent itemsets collection. We show that this condensed representation can be applied to regenerate all frequent itemsets and their exact frequencies without any access to the original data. An algorithm, RFS-MINER, is presented to extract the frequent rule-free sets and practical experiments show that this representation can be extracted very efficiently. We compared it with another representation in the literature called frequent closed sets and in nearly all experiments we have run, the rule free sets have been extracted much more efficiently than frequently closed sets.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264434","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264434","","Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Costs;Data mining;Databases;Educational institutions;Electronic mail;Frequency;Itemsets","data mining;set theory","condensed representation;data mining;frequent closed sets;frequent itemsets extraction;rule-free sets","","0","","5","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clustering analyzing is one of the important problems in data mining. Because most of its objects are large-scale databases or high-dimension data, clustering requests more powerful computing availability. So how to develop parallel clustering algorithm based on cluster system deserves attention. This paper proposes a new parallel clustering algorithm called PARCLE for very large databases that are suitable for cluster system. This algorithm adopts data parallelism and asynchronous communication to reduce the communication costs. It applies a new clustering algorithm derived from BIRCH to improve the quality of clustering. Our implementation shows high speedups with negligible communication overheads and good clustering result not less that that of linear clustering algorithm.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264431","","Asynchronous communication;Clustering algorithms;Concurrent computing;Data mining;Databases;Machine learning algorithms;Parallel processing;Partitioning algorithms;Software;Systems engineering and theory","data mining;database management systems;parallel databases;workstation clusters","PARCLE;asynchronous communication;cluster system;data mining;data parallelism;high-dimension data;large-scale databases;linear clustering algorithm;parallel clustering algorithm","","0","","14","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important task of semantic integration in heterogeneous database is to determine which fields refer to the same data. Although many methods can be employed to automate the process, we argue that the existing methods of identifying corresponding attributes are time-consuming. In this paper we contribute to lower time complexity without reducing the precision ratio and recall ratio by providing a more efficient method, a data-type-based approach, to identify corresponding attributes in heterogeneous databases. The experimental results showed our method is effective.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264490","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264490","","Computer science;Cybernetics;Databases;Machine learning;Neural networks;Statistics;White spaces","computational complexity;distributed databases;meta data","data contents;data-type-based approach;heterogeneous databases;metadata;semantic integration;time complexity","","4","","11","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The core of this method is a learning mechanism that reduces a huge amount of training samples into a highly condensed set of templates. When used in a testing process, these templates hold target patterns within the nearest K templates for almost all unknown objects, where K is a small number (2 or 3, for example). This learning mechanism also produces an extremely small set of confusing pairs, in opposition to all N(N-1)/2 possible pairs, where N is the total number of patterns. These pairs are further processed by a disambiguation procedure that improves the overall performance of the pattern classifier. This learning method thus suggests a two-stage online process for classifying unknown objects. The first stage reduces the number of possible candidates to a few candidates and the second stage identifies the target patterns out of these candidates.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260096","","Costs;Electronic mail;Information science;Learning systems;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pattern matching;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Testing","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern matching;support vector machines","SVM;disambiguation procedure;learning mechanism;nearest K templates;pattern classifier;support vector machines;target patterns;two stage online process;unknown objects classification;vector pattern matching problems","","0","","12","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There are a lot of methods to compute the minimal reducts in complete information systems. But for incomplete information systems, the research of this aspect is less or more difficult. Incomplete data sets may be transformed into complete data sets by similarity measures or by removing objects with unknown values before handling with them. But transforming incomplete data sets into complete data sets is only by what we have supposed, and may not accord with the fact. So it is necessary to find reducts directly from incomplete data sets without guessing unknown attribute values. A theorem is proved on the basis of binary discernible matrix and similarity relation. And a genetic algorithm based on this theorem is proposed for finding the minimal reducts from incomplete information systems. We also propose a genetic algorithm directly based on binary discernible matrix in incomplete information systems.

In the literature, some approaches for modeling TSK fuzzy rules have been proposed. Most of them define their fuzzy subspaces based on the idea of training data being close enough instead of having similar functions. Recently, a new approach, fuzzy c-regression model (FCRM) clustering algorithm, is proposed to construct TSK fuzzy models. However, this approach does not take into account the training data with outliers. In order to overcome the effects of outliers, a robust TSK fuzzy modeling with outliers has been proposed. It is worth noting that this approach may need more computation time due to complicated formulas. Hence, a novel TSK fuzzy modeling approach with outliers is presented in this paper. In this approach, robust fuzzy regression (RFR) clustering algorithm is proposed to simultaneously define fuzzy subspaces and find the parameters in the consequent parts of TSK rules. In the clustering process, the similarity measure is used to reduce the redundant rules. To obtain a more precision model that is not affected by outliers, an annealing robust BP learning algorithm is employed. From the simulation results, the proposed TSK fuzzy model approach indeed showed superior performance.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259863","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259863","","Annealing;Backpropagation algorithms;Business;Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Fuzzy systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Robustness;Training data","backpropagation;fuzzy set theory;modelling;optimisation;regression analysis","Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy modeling;annealing robust backpropagation learning;fuzzy c-regression model clustering algorithm;fuzzy rules;outliers;robust fuzzy regression clustering;training data","","4","","19","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, like most machines learning algorithms, neural networks are adversely affected by sparse training sets, especially with respect to generalization performance. Several approaches to improve generalization performance when only sparse training data are available have been suggested. These include adding noise to training data or to weight updates. One method by Karystinos and Pados first clusters the training data and then generates new training data using a probability density function estimated from the clusters. This paper investigates this method further, especially with respect to the sensitivity of the method to the clustering procedure. We investigate the sensitivity to the number of clusters used by the clustering method, the sensitivity to the clustering method (K-means) itself, and also the use of the minimum differential entropy as an indicator for good cluster choice.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1264501","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1264501","","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Covariance matrix;Entropy;Information technology;Jacobian matrices;Machine learning algorithms;Neural networks;Probability density function;Training data","learning (artificial intelligence);minimum entropy methods;neural nets;set theory;statistical analysis","clustering procedure;machines learning algorithms;minimum differential entropy;neural networks;probability density function;randomly expanded data sets;sparse training data;sparse training sets","","1","","3","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

There is a lot of research on formalization of cognitive state that include intentions of the agents in a multi-agent system. These theories are based on normal modal logic, interpret intention as unary normal modal operator in Kripke semantics, and hence suffer from the harmful logical omniscience and side-effect problems. These have not been eliminated satisfactorily as yet. In this paper, we interpret intention as unary non-normal modal operator and introduce novel possible world semantics for intention, called the twin-subset semantics. It describes the intentions of agent in a possible world w with two subsets of W, where W is the set of all possible worlds which an agent can be in, and allows us to embody essential cognitive features of intention and the relations between belief and intention. Compared with classical normal or non-normal modal logics, not only does it avoid the logical omniscience and side-effect problems but also the classical semantics of logical connectives are still valid; and moreover, it improves the true-false subset semantics, which were introduced by us previously, and overcomes its serious drawbacks.","","POD:0-7803-7865-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1259832","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1259832","","Artificial intelligence;Autonomous agents;Cognition;Computer science;Cybernetics;Logic design;Machine learning;Multiagent systems","cognitive systems;formal logic;multi-agent systems;semantic networks;set theory","Kripke semantics;agent indispensable cognition attribute;agent rational behavior;cognitive state formalization;logical omniscience;multiagent system;normal modal logic;side-effect problems;twin-subset semantics;unary normal modal operator","","1","","15","","","2-5 Nov. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But frequently updating velocities weaken local exploitation abilities of particles and slow down convergence. In this paper, relaxation-velocity-update (RVU) strategy is incorporated into PSO algorithm to accelerate convergence. RVU strategy suggests that the velocity should be updated only when the particle cannot further improve the fitness with its previous velocity, rather than in every iteration. Standard linearly decreasing weight PSO (LDW-PSO) and LDW-PSO with RVU strategy (LDW-RVU-PSO) are compared on three well-known benchmark functions. The results show that RVU strategy significantly improves the convergence speed of LDW-PSO.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382218","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382218","","Acceleration;Birds;Competitive intelligence;Computational intelligence;Convergence;Iterative algorithms;Mathematics;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization;Pattern recognition","convergence;optimisation;relaxation theory","particle swarm optimization;relaxation velocity update strategy;swarm intelligence","","1","","9","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To facilitate the operation of train services, a train service provider (SP) has to negotiate with the infrastructure provider (IP) for a train schedule and the associated track access charge. This paper models the SP and IP as software agents and the negotiation as a prioritized fuzzy constraint satisfaction (PFCS) problem. Computer simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the effects on the train schedule when the SP has different optimization criteria. The results show that by assigning different priorities on the fuzzy constraints, agents can represent SPs with different operational objectives.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382067","","Australia;Computer simulation;Constraint optimization;Electronic mail;Engineering management;Multiagent systems;Processor scheduling;Rail transportation;Resource management;Supply chains","constraint theory;digital simulation;fuzzy set theory;optimisation;railways;scheduling;software agents","agent negotiation model;computer simulations;infrastructure provider;optimization;prioritized fuzzy constraint satisfaction problem;railway scheduling;railways resources;software agents;stakeholders;train service provider","","3","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This formation could also be expanded to other shapes. We achieve this global behavior of making dynamic formation in a group of agents by using only local sensing and interaction. The algorithm is very simple and it solves the problem with agents having camera, sonar, laser and a radio link. The basic idea is to keep immediate leader or friend in its view by panning the camera at the angle required for making a shape, and at a fixed distance so as to maintain the formation. While in the group how to keep the formation and change it with the addition of a new agent is the main issue we are dealing here which has not been done according to our information.

A key problem with the existing wrappers is that the wrapped rule learned from the examples is only adaptive for the specific Web site. We propose a novel approach, DBFinder, to discover interest data blocks from a set of Web pages. It is a key step in the data extraction. The process of DBFinder consists of two phases: semi-supervised wrapping and unsupervised wrapper. The goal of the first phase is to learn the wrapped rules for the specific Web site. The goal of the second phase is to popularize the wrapped rules for other Web sites in the same domain with the sample Web site. Two kinds of data mining techniques, frequent sub-tree mining and association rule mining, are used to accomplish such a goal. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, some detailed experiments are conducted. We have also applied our approach in a real application, which is a comparison-shopping agent.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382000","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382000","","Application software;Association rules;Computer applications;Computer science;Data engineering;Data mining;Neutron spin echo;Taxonomy;Web pages;Wrapping","Internet;Web sites;data mining;divide and conquer methods;hypermedia markup languages;information retrieval;learning by example;unsupervised learning","DBFinder method;Web pages;Web site;association rule mining;comparison shopping agent;data extraction;data mining technique;divide and conquer methods;frequent subtree mining;hypermedia markup languages;interest data block discovery;online information sources;semisupervised wrapping;stepwise learning method;unsupervised wrapper;wrapped rules","","1","","11","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
