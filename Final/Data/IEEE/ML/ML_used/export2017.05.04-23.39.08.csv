Based on the fundamental of original SVM, L2RL2SVM, C-SVC, L1RL2SVM and ν-SVC can linearly handle the large-scale high-dimension data well. When the training data can not be separated by linear classifiers, KSVM is a crucial technique to overcome this shortage in a supervised-learning framework. In a semi-supervised learning framework, LapSVM, is the state-of-the-art technique which better handles both generalization of the classifier and out-of-sample problem. Experiments, on four common datasets of two classes with eleven algorithms, show that accuracies, utilizing different algorithms in different data sets, are different and prior geometrical information from training data is necessary to improve the accuracy when the machine learns to select a optimum model either in a supervised-learning framework or in a semi-supervised-learning framework. By analyzing the results of the experiments, we found that the distributional characteristics of each data set can be observed.","1948-2914;19482914","Electronic:978-1-4244-9352-4; POD:978-1-4244-9351-7","10.1109/BMEI.2011.6098517","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6098517","","Accuracy;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training;Training data","classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;support vector machines","ν-SVC;C-SVC;L1RL2SVM;L2RL2SVM;SVM;binary classification;linear classifiers;machine learning;semisupervised learning;supervised learning;support vector machines","","2","","25","","","15-17 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a fully automated approach based on machine learning for inferring undisclosed attributes of OSN users.

The conventional LS-SVM and PSVM cannot be used in regression and multiclass classification applications directly, although variants of LS-SVM and PSVM have been proposed to handle such cases. This paper shows that both LS-SVM and PSVM can be simplified further and a unified learning framework of LS-SVM, PSVM, and other regularization algorithms referred to extreme learning machine (ELM) can be built. ELM works for the “generalized” single-hidden-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs), but the hidden layer (or called feature mapping) in ELM need not be tuned. Such SLFNs include but are not limited to SVM, polynomial network, and the conventional feedforward neural networks. This paper shows the following: 1) ELM provides a unified learning platform with a widespread type of feature mappings and can be applied in regression and multiclass classification applications directly; 2) from the optimization method point of view, ELM has milder optimization constraints compared to LS-SVM and PSVM; 3) in theory, compared to ELM, LS-SVM and PSVM achieve suboptimal solutions and require higher computational complexity; and 4) in theory, ELM can approximate any target continuous function and classify any disjoint regions. As verified by the simulation results, ELM tends to have better scalability and achieve similar (for regression and binary class cases) or much better (for multiclass cases) generalization performance at much faster learning speed (up to thousands times) than traditional SVM and LS-SVM.","1083-4419;10834419","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2168604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6035797","Extreme learning machine (ELM);feature mapping;kernel;least square support vector machine (LS-SVM);proximal support vector machine (PSVM);regularization network","Approximation methods;Feedforward neural networks;Kernel;Machine learning;Optimization;Support vector machines;Training","computational complexity;feedforward neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;optimisation;pattern classification;polynomials;regression analysis;support vector machines","ELM;LS-SVM;PSVM;binary classification applications;computational complexity;conventional feedforward neural networks;extreme learning machine;feature mapping;generalized single-hidden-layer feedforward networks;least square support vector machine;multiclass classification;optimization method;polynomial network;proximal support vector machine;regression;regularization algorithms","","1005","2","56","","20111006","April 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Reduction of communicated multimedia volume is an important step to reduce energy consumption in WMSNs because of the relatively huge amount of data collected by the nodes compared with scalar sensors. One of the algorithms in machine learning which can reduce the dimensionality is unsupervised learning Self Organizing Map (SOM) which typically performs dimensionality reduction through pattern clustering. In this work, an attempt has been made to reduce the amount of transmitted information in WMSNs using SOM in order to increase the lifetime of the network.

Gyrodactylus salaris is a notifiable pathogen of salmonids and a semi-automated / automated method permitting its confident species discrimination from other non-pathogenic species is sought to assist disease diagnostics during periods of a suspected outbreak. This study will assist pathogen management in wild and cultured fish stocks, providing improvements in fish health and welfare and accompanying economic benefits. Multi-stage classification is proposed as a solution to this problem because use of a single classifier is not sufficient to ensure that all the species are accurately classified. The results show that Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) with 21 features is the best classifier for performing the initial classification of Gyrodactylus species.

Since a scoring function (SF) is used to score, rank, and identify drug leads, the fidelity with which it predicts the affinity of a ligand candidate for a protein's binding site has a significant bearing on the accuracy of virtual screening. Despite intense efforts in developing conventional SFs, which are either force-field based, knowledge-based, or empirical, their limited predictive power has been a major roadblock toward cost-effective drug discovery. Therefore, in this work, we explore a range of novel SFs employing different machine-learning (ML) approaches in conjunction with physicochemical features characterizing protein-ligand complexes. We assess the scoring accuracies of these new ML-based SFs as well as those of conventional SFs in the context of the 2007 PDBbind benchmark dataset on both diverse and protein-family-specific test sets. We find that the best performing ML-based SF has a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.771 between predicted and measured binding affinities compared to 0.644 achieved by a state-of-the-art conventional SF.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4574-5; POD:978-1-4577-1799-4","10.1109/BIBM.2011.128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120516","Machine learning;protein-ligand binding affinity;scoring function;scoring power;structure-based drug design","Correlation;Drugs;Proteins;Radio frequency;Software;Support vector machines;Training","drugs;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;proteins","binding affinity prediction;chemical biology;comparative assessment;computational biomolecular science;drug discovery;empirical SF;force-field based SF;knowledge-based SF;machine-learning-based scoring functions;protein-family-specific test sets;protein-ligand complex;structural biology;virtual screening","","2","","11","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These models can be used directly by power companies to assist with prioritization of maintenance and repair work. Specialized versions of this process are used to produce (1) feeder failure rankings, (2) cable, joint, terminator, and transformer rankings, (3) feeder Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) estimates, and (4) manhole events vulnerability rankings. The process in its most general form can handle diverse, noisy, sources that are historical (static), semi-real-time, or real-time, incorporates state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for prioritization (supervised ranking or MTBF), and includes an evaluation of results via cross-validation and blind test. Above and beyond the ranked lists and MTBF estimates are business management interfaces that allow the prediction capability to be integrated directly into corporate planning and decision support; such interfaces rely on several important properties of our general modeling approach: that machine learning features are meaningful to domain experts, that the processing of data is transparent, and that prediction results are accurate enough to support sound decision making. We discuss the challenges in working with historical electrical grid data that were not designed for predictive purposes.

An important step in many machine learning techniques applied in computational biology is encoding the symbolic data of protein sequences reasonably efficient in numeric vector representations. This encoding can be achieved by either considering the amino acid physicochemical properties or a generic numerical encoding. In order to be effective in the context of a machine learning system, an encoding must preserve information relative to the problem at hand, while diminishing superfluous data. To this end, it is important to measure how much an encoding scheme can conserve the underlying similarities and differences that exist among the amino acids. One way to evaluate the effectiveness of an amino acid encoding scheme is to compare it to the roles that amino acids are actually found to play in biological systems. A numerical representation of the similarities and differences between amino acids can be found in substitution matrices commonly used for sequence alignment, since these substitution matrices are based on measures of the interchangeability of amino acids in biological specimens. In this study, a new encoding scheme is also proposed based on the genetic codon coding occurs during protein synthesis. The experimental results indicate better performances compared to the other commonly used encodings.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1613-3; POD:978-1-4577-1612-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2011.6112394","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112394","amino acids;artificial neural networks;machine learning;substitution matrix","Amino acids;Approximation methods;Biological neural networks;Encoding;Matrices;Proteins;Training","biology computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;proteins","amino acid encoding scheme;artificial neural network;biological specimen;biological system;computational biology;generic numerical encoding;machine learning;numeric vector representation;physicochemical properties;protein sequence;protein synthesis;substitution scoring matrices;symbolic data","","4","","18","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

These mechanisms can be associated with user and device profiles, context, and decisions. The focus learning user preferences is the dynamic inference and estimation of current and future user preferences. The acquisition and learning of context information encompasses mechanisms for the system to perceive its current status and conditions in its present environment, as well as estimating (and forecasting) the capabilities of available network configurations. Finally, learning related to decisions addresses the building of knowledge with respect to the efficiency of solutions that can be applied to specific situations encountered. Based on knowledge obtained through learning, decision-making mechanisms can become faster, since the CR system can learn and immediately apply solutions that have been identified as being efficient in the past. Moreover, knowledge obtained through learning mechanisms may be shared among nodes of a system.

The inclusion of SNPs from GWAS has shown some benefits of improving traditional risk prediction. However, the contribution of genomic profiling to disease classification is unclear yet. Here we present a systematic analysis of the effects of genomic profiling by machine learning. Our study suggests that the odds ratio plays an essential role in the disease classification. In order to explain the majority of variations in a typical case/control study, at least 100 SNPs with effect size of 1.5 and 20% frequency have to be included. The result indicates that more disease-related variants are yet to be identified to obtain meaningful genomic profiling. SVM is capable to recognize the classification pattern with relatively less samples and more resistant to noises.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1613-3; POD:978-1-4577-1612-6","10.1109/BIBMW.2011.6112449","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6112449","","Bioinformatics;Diseases;Genomics;Kernel;Support vector machines;Vectors","biology computing;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;support vector machines","SVM;disease classification;genetic mutation;genome-wide association studies;genomic profiling;machine learning;support vector machines","","0","","32","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As a result, the accuracy of application identification is getting worse as the increase of encrypted traffic. In this paper, we propose a method to increase the accuracy of application identification whatever the traffic is encrypted or not. We propose EFM (Estimated Features Method) and investigate how three different supervised machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes Kernel Estimation, and C4.5 decision tree) affect the accuracy of identification.

This transition has been facilitated by the usage of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automatically identify patterns and extract non-trivial knowledge from data. The experimental procedures associated with that are usually complex and computationally demanding. Scheduling is a typical method used to decide how to allocate tasks into available resources. An important step for such is to guess how long an application would take to execute. In this paper, we introduce an approach for predicting processing time specifically of ML tasks. It employs a metalearning framework to relate characteristics of datasets and current machine state to actual execution time. An empirical study was conducted using 78 publicly available datasets, 6 ML algorithms and 4 meta-regressors. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms a commonly used baseline method.

The developed algorithms on credit matrix and the credit correlation matrix are presented. The error of the training sample distributed to the activated memory cell is proportional to the cell's credibility, which is determined by its activated times. The convergence processes of CA-CMAC in cyclic learning are further analyzed with two convergence theorems. In addition, simulation results on the inverse kinematics of 2-degree-of-freedom planar robot arm are used to prove the convergence theorems and show that CA-CMAC converges faster than conventional machine learning.","","","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6075721","cerebellar model articulation controller;machine learning;self-learning;self-maintenance machine","Convergence;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Noise;Symmetric matrices;Training;Vectors","","","","1","","","","","Oct. 2004","","TUP","TUP Journals & Magazines"

We apply machine learning to uncover a system implementation structure that includes its normal functions from the design, as well as the hidden malicious behaviors.

Unfortunately, practical system implementations are usually incompletely specified and the prevalent algorithms do not apply. We design generalized and efficient machine learning algorithms for incompletely specified protocol system implementations for detecting implanted malicious code. We further extend the results where machine learning starts from an approximate model instead of an empty conjecture - a usual approach of machine learning algorithms, and our approach learns an implementation structure more efficiently than the known algorithms.

Link adaptation for SC-FDE systems, where the modulation and coding rate are adapted based on the current channel state, is straightforward with perfect channel state information due to the simple analytical form of the post-processing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Imperfect channel state information, however, introduces adaptation errors. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach for link adaptation in bit interleaved convolutionally encoded SC-FDE systems. To improve performance in the presence of channel uncertainty, principal component analysis is used to reduce the feature space dimensionality consisting of the channel coefficients, noise variance, and post-processing SNR. The reduced dimension feature set improves performance of the link adaptation classifier and leads to higher performance versus just the post-processing SNR estimate. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm increases the goodput while maintaining the target packet error rate, achieving optimal adaptation in 95% of the tested cases.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4244-9268-8; POD:978-1-4244-9266-4","10.1109/GLOCOM.2011.6134362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6134362","","Channel estimation;Encoding;Modulation;Principal component analysis;Signal to noise ratio;Training data","channel allocation;convolutional codes;equalisers;frequency-domain analysis;interleaved codes;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;quadrature amplitude modulation;radio receivers;signal processing;telecommunication computing","SC-FDE systems;adaptation errors;bit interleaved convolutionally encoded;channel coefficients;channel uncertainty;coding rate;current channel state;cyclically prefixed quadrature amplitude modulation;feature space dimensionality;imperfect channel state information;link adaptation classifier;machine learning approach;machine learning-based approach;modulation rate;noise variance;optimal adaptation;post-processing SNR;post-processing signal-to-noise ratio;principal component analysis;receiver;reduced dimension feature set;simple frequency domain equalization;single carrier frequency domain equalization;target packet error rate","","4","","15","","","5-9 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve our goal of reliable authorship affiliation, we extract term frequency-based features (that are conventional in document classification) along with less commonly used linguistic style-based features. The resulting set of stylometric features are then utilized in two widely used supervised classification algorithms, namely k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and Support Vector Machines. Specifically, we used k-NN with cosine distance and Support Vector Machines with two different kernel functions.

It places threads on cores in order to amortize memory latency and/or to reduce memory contention. However, efficient thread mapping relies upon matching application behavior with system characteristics. Particularly, Software Transactional Memory (STM) applications introduce another dimension due to its runtime system support. Existing STM systems implement several conflict detection and resolution mechanisms, which leads STM applications to behave differently for each combination of these mechanisms. In this paper we propose a machine learning-based approach to automatically infer a suitable thread mapping strategy for transactional memory applications. First, we profile several STM applications from the STAMP benchmark suite considering application, STM system and platform features to build a set of input instances. Then, such data feeds a machine learning algorithm, which produces a decision tree able to predict the most suitable thread mapping strategy for new unobserved instances. Results show that our approach improves performance up to 18.46% compared to the worst case and up to 6.37% over the Linux default thread mapping strategy.","1094-7256;10947256","Electronic:978-1-4577-1950-9; POD:978-1-4577-1951-6","10.1109/HiPC.2011.6152736","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6152736","machine learning;software transactional memory;thread mapping","Decision trees;Instruction sets;Linux;Machine learning;Multicore processing;Prediction algorithms;Runtime","Linux;concurrency control;decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;multiprocessing systems","Linux;STAMP benchmark suite;decision tree;machine learning based approach;memory contention;memory hierarchy;memory latency;modern chip multiprocessors;software transactional memory applications;thread mapping","","6","","27","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition, our back-testing proves that our trading model outperforms well-known technical indicator based trading strategies with regards to cumulative returns by 30%-100%.

Support vector machines (SVMs) are a subset of kernel machines and generalize well for classification, regression, and anomaly detection tasks. The training procedure for traditional SVMs involves solving a quadratic programming (QP) problem. The QP problem scales super linearly in computational effort with the number of training samples and is often used for the offline batch processing of data. Kernel machines operate by retaining a subset of observed data during training. The data vectors contained within this subset are referred to as support vectors (SVs). The work presented in this paper introduces a subset selection method for the use of kernel machines in online, changing environments. Our algorithm works by using a stochastic indexing technique when selecting a subset of SVs when computing the kernel expansion. The work described here is novel because it separates the selection of kernel basis functions from the training algorithm used. The subset selection algorithm presented here can be used in conjunction with any online training technique. It is important for online kernel machines to be computationally efficient due to the real-time requirements of online environments. Our algorithm is an important contribution because it scales linearly with the number of training samples and is compatible with current training techniques. Our algorithm outperforms standard techniques in terms of computational efficiency and provides increased recognition accuracy in our experiments.

The most dose-limiting factor in radiotherapy is the radiation-induced lung toxicity (RILT). RILT is generally measured semi-quantitatively, by a dyspnea, or shortness-of-breath, score. In general, about 20-30% of patients develop RILT several months after treatment, and in about 70% of the patients the delivered dose is insufficient to control the tumor growth. Ideally, if the RILT score would be known in advance, then the dose treatment plan for the low-toxicity-risk patients could be adjusted so that higher dose is delivered to the tumor to better control it. A number of possible predictors of RILT have been proposed in the literature, including dose-related and clinical/demographic patient characteristics available prior to radiotherapy. In addition, the use of imaging features -- which are noninvasive in nature - has been gaining momentum. Thus, anatomic as well as functional/metabolic information from CT and PET scanner images respectively are used in daily clinical practice, which provide further information about the status of a patient. In this study we assessed whether machine learning techniques can successfully be applied to predict post-radiation lung damage, proxied by dyspnea score, based on clinical, dose-related (dosimetric) and image features. Our dataset included 78 NSCLC patients. The patients were divided into two groups: no-deterioration-of-dyspnea, and deterioration-of-dyspnea patients. Several machine-learning binary classifiers were applied to discriminate the two groups. The results, evaluated using the area under the ROC curve in a cross-validation procedure, are highly promising. This outcome could open the possibility to deliver better, individualized dose-treatment plans for lung cancer patients and help the overall clinical decision making (treatment) process.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.139","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147677","Non-small cell lung cancer;clinical prognostic models;individualized dose treatment planning;radiation-induced lung damage","Cancer;Computed tomography;Lungs;Machine learning;Positron emission tomography;Three dimensional displays;Tumors","biological tissues;cancer;cellular biophysics;computerised tomography;decision making;dosimetry;learning (artificial intelligence);lung;medical image processing;positron emission tomography;radiation therapy;sensitivity analysis;tumours","CT scanner imaging;PET scanner imaging;ROC curve;clinical-demographic patient characteristics;decision making processing;deterioration-of-dyspnea patients;dose treatment planing;dose-limiting factor;functional-metabolic information;low-toxicity-risk patients;machine learning techniques;machine-learning binary classifiers;nonsmall cell lung cancer patients;normal tissues;post-radiation lung damage;radiation dosimetry;radiation-induced lung toxicity;radiation-induced normal-tissue toxicity;radiotherapy;tumor growth","","0","","9","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, there is a need for an intelligent automated process capable of substituting the real samples by artificial samples that carry the same characteristics as the real samples and hence could be used for running comprehensive testing of new methodologies. Motivated by this need, we describe a novel approach that integrates Probabilistic Boolean Network and genetic algorithm based techniques into a framework that uses some existing real samples as input and successfully produces new samples as output. The new samples will inspire the characteristics of the existing samples without duplicating them. This leads to diversity in the samples and hence a more rich set of samples to be used in testing. The developed framework incorporates two models (perspectives) for sample generation. We illustrate its applicability for producing new gene expression data samples; a high demanding area that has not received attention. The two perspectives employed in the process are based on models that are not closely related; the independence eliminates the bias of having the produced approach covering only certain characteristics of the domain and leading to samples skewed towards one direction. The produced results are very promising in showing the effectiveness, usefulness and applicability of the proposed multi-model framework.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4574-5; POD:978-1-4577-1799-4","10.1109/BIBM.2011.105","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6120442","gene expression data;genetic algorithm;learning;probabilistic boolean network;sample generation","Bioinformatics;Biological cells;Boolean functions;Data models;Gene expression;Genetic algorithms;Probabilistic logic","Boolean algebra;biology computing;data analysis;genetic algorithms;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","data enrichment;gene expression data analysis;genetic algorithm based techniques;machine learning techniques;multimodel framework;probabilistic Boolean network","","2","","12","","","12-15 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, this is time consuming because it requires executing a MapReduce program multiple times using various parameters. Such multiple executions can be assigned to a cluster in various ways, and the execution time varies depending on the assignments. To achieve the shortest execution time, we propose a method for optimizing the assignment of MapReduce jobs to a cluster assuming machine learning targeted runtime. We developed an execution cost model to predict the total execution time of jobs and obtained the optimal assignment by minimizing the cost model. To evaluate the proposed method, we implemented an experimental MapReduce runtime based on Message Passing Interface and executed logistic regression in four cases. The results showed that the proposed method can correctly predict the optimal job assignment.

We investigate three different supervised classification methods - Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) - for this binary classification task. The classifiers are trained and evaluated using 37830 examples obtained from 14 experimentally validated, taxonomically diverse microbial genomes whose essential genes are known. A set of 52 relevant genomic sequence derived features is used as input for the classifiers. The models were evaluated using novel blind testing schemes Leave-One-Genome-Out (LOGO) and Leave-One-Taxon-group-Out (LOTO) and 10-fold stratified cross validation (10-f-cv) strategy on both the full multi-genome datasets and its class imbalance reduced variants. Experimental results (10 X 10-f-cv) indicate SVM and ANN perform better than DT with Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AU-ROC) scores of 0.80, 0.79 and 0.68 respectively. This study demonstrates that supervised machine learning methods can be used to predict essential genes in microbial genomes by using only gene sequence and features derived from it. LOGO and LOTO Blind test results suggest that the trained classifiers generalize across genomes and taxonomic boundaries.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147671","bioinformatics;essential genes;microbial genomes;supervised learning","Artificial neural networks;Bioinformatics;Genomics;Organisms;Support vector machines;Testing;Training","bioinformatics;decision trees;genetics;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;support vector machines","10-fold stratified cross validation strategy;ANN;AU-ROC scores;LOGO scheme;LOTO scheme;SVM;area under the receiver operating characteristics;artificial neural network;binary classification task;biotechnology;blind testing schemes;decision tree;essential gene identification;essential gene prediction;genome biologist;genomic sequence;leave-one-genome-out scheme;leave-one-taxon-group-out scheme;medicine;microbial genomes;multigenome datasets;supervised classification methods;supervised machine learning method;support vector machine;trained classifiers","","1","","33","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Through machine learning, we can detect language patterns used by bullies and their victims, and develop rules to automatically detect cyber bullying content. The data we used for our project was collected from the website Formspring.me, a question-and-answer formatted website that contains a high percentage of bullying content. The data was labeled using a web service, Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

Backbone QoS monitoring and analysis in Multi-hop Networks requires therefore knowledge about types of applications forming current network traffic. To overcome the drawbacks of existing methods for traffic classification, usage of C5.0 Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) was proposed. On the basis of statistical traffic information received from volunteers and C5.0 algorithm we constructed a boosted classifier, which was shown to have ability to distinguish between 7 different applications in test set of 76,632-1,622,710 unknown cases with average accuracy of 99.3-99.9%. This high accuracy was achieved by using high quality training data collected by our system, a unique set of parameters used for both training and classification, an algorithm for recognizing flow direction and the C5.0 itself. Classified applications include Skype, FTP, torrent, web browser traffic, web radio, interactive gaming and SSH. We performed subsequent tries using different sets of parameters and both training and classification options.

These relationships are embodied in a hierarchical classification, such as the Structural Classification of Protein (SCOP), which is mostly manually curated. Such a classification is essential for the structural and functional analyses of proteins. Yet a large number of proteins remain unclassified. In this study, we have proposed an unsupervised machine learning approach to classify and assign a given set of proteins to SCOP superfamilies. In the method, we have constructed a database and similarity matrix using P-values obtained from an all-against-all BLAST run and trained the network with the ART2 unsupervised learning algorithm using the rows of the similarity matrix as input vectors, enabling the trained network to classify the proteins from 0.82 to 0.97 f-measure accuracy. The performance of ART2 has been compared with that of spectral clustering, Random forest, SVM, and HHpred. ART2 performs better than the others except HHpred.

In this study, LapRLS was used to establish the quantitative relationship between near infrared (NIR) spectra and cetane number (CN) and total aromatics of diesel fuels. Near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a widely used technique for monitoring chemical compounds in petroleum industry. A total of 381 obtained samples were randomly split into two sets under different proportion. One set was used as calibration set (labeled data) whereas the remaining samples were used as the prediction set (unlabeled data). LapRLS, LS-SVM, and PLS were used to establish determination models based on NIR spectra.

Different from other incremental ELMs (I-ELMs) whose existing hidden nodes are frozen when the new hidden nodes are added one by one, in AG-ELM the number of hidden nodes is determined in an adaptive way in the sense that the existing networks may be replaced by newly generated networks which have fewer hidden nodes and better generalization performance. We then prove that such an AG-ELM using Lebesgue <i>p</i>-integrable hidden activation functions can approximate any Lebesgue <i>p</i>-integrable function on a compact input set.

However, these systems depend on the availability of the systems normal traffic pattern profile. But the statistical fingerprint of the normal traffic pattern can change and shift over a period of time due to changes in operational or user activity at the networked site or even system updates. The changes in normal traffic patterns over time lead to concept drift. Some changes can be temporal, cyclical and can be short-lived or they can last for longer periods of time. Depending on a number of factors the speed at which the change in traffic patterns occurs can also be variable, ranging from near instantaneous to the change occurring over the span of numerous months. These changes in traffic patterns are a cause of concern for IDSs as they can lead to a significant increase in false positive rates, thereby reducing the overall system performance. In order to improve the reliability of the IDS, there is a need for an automated mechanism to detect valid traffic changes and avoid inappropriate ad hoc responses. ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of IDSs. ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve in presence of concept-drifting network traffic. In this paper, we present a integrated supervised machine learning and control theoretic model for detecting concept drift in network traffic patterns. The model comprises of a online support vector machine based classifier(incremental anomaly based detection), a Kullback - Leibler divergence based relative entropy measurement scheme(quantifying concept drift) and feedback control engine(adapting ROC thresholding). In our proposed system, any intrusion activity will cause significant variations, thereby causing a large error, while a minor aberration in the variations (concept drift) w- ll not be immediately reported as alert.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1376-7; POD:978-1-4577-1375-0","10.1109/THS.2011.6107850","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107850","Anomaly Based Intrusion Detection Systems;Concept Drift;Support Vector Machine","Accuracy;Adaptation models;Engines;Entropy;Feedback control;Support vector machines;Training","data mining;feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;security of data;support vector machines","Kullback-Leibler divergence;ROC curve;adapting ROC thresholding;anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems;concept drift detection;concept-drifting data stream mining;control theoretic model;entropy measurement scheme;feedback control engine;incremental anomaly based detection;network attack;normal traffic pattern profile;receiver operating characteristic curve;supervised machine learning;support vector machine based classifier;user activity","","4","","21","","","15-17 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this work, we use the ML-based classification method to identify the classes of the unknown flows using the payload-independent statistical features such as packet-length and arrival-interval. In order to improve the efficiency of the classification methods, the feature reduction techniques are further adopted to refine the selected features for attaining a best group of features. Finally we compare and evaluate the ML classification algorithms based on the BRASIL data source in terms of the three metrics such as overall accuracy, average precision and average recall.

"Machine Learning for Seismic Signal Processing: Phase Classification on a Manifold","J. Ramirez Jr; F. G.

In seismology, knowledge of the seismic activity arrival time and phase leads to epicenter localization and surface velocity estimates useful in developing seismic early warning systems and detecting man-made seismic events. Formally, the activity arrival time refers to the moment at which a seismic wave is first detected and the seismic phase classifies the physics of the wave. We propose a new perspective for the classification of seismic phases in three-channel seismic data collected within a network of regional recording stations. Our method extends current techniques and incorporates concepts from machine learning. Machine learning techniques attempt to leverage the concept of ""learning'' the patterns associated with different types of data characteristics. In this case, the data characteristics are the seismic phases. This concept makes sense because the characteristics of the phase types are dictated by the physics of wave propagation. Thus by ""learning'' a signature for each type of phase, we can apply classification algorithms to identify the phase of incoming data from a database of known phases observed over the recording network. Our method first uses a multi-scale feature extraction technique for clustering seismic data on low-dimensional manifolds. We then apply kernel ridge regression on each feature manifold for phase classification. In addition, we have designed an information theoretic measure used to merge regression scores across the multi-scale feature manifolds. Our approach complements current methods in seismic phase classification and brings to light machine learning techniques not yet fully examined in the context of seismology. We have applied our technique to a seismic data set from the Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah regions collected during 2005 and 2006. This data set contained compression wave and surface wave seismic phases. Through - ross-validation, our method achieves a 74.6% average correct classification rate when compared to analyst classifications.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4607-0; POD:978-1-4577-2134-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2011.91","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6147002","Manifold Signal Processing;Seismology;Supervised Learning","Entropy;Kernel;Manifolds;Matrix decomposition;Training;Vectors;Wavelet transforms","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;regression analysis;seismic waves;seismology;signal classification","classification algorithm;compression wave seismic phases;epicenter localization;kernel ridge regression;machine learning;man-made seismic event;multiscale feature extraction;regression score;seismic activity arrival time;seismic data clustering;seismic early warning system;seismic phase classification;seismic signal processing;seismic wave;seismology;supervised learning;surface velocity;surface wave seismic phases;three-channel seismic data","","1","","15","","","18-21 Dec. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Indoor localization can be enabled through wideband or ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) transmission, due to its fine delay resolution and obstacle-penetration capabilities. A major hurdle is the presence of obstacles that block the line-of-sight (LOS) path between devices, affecting ranging performance and, in turn, localization accuracy. Many techniques have been proposed to address this issue, most of which make modifications to the localization algorithm. Since many localization algorithms work with distance or angle estimates, rather than received waveforms, information inherent in the wideband waveform is lost, leading to sub-optimal ranging error mitigation. To avoid this information loss, we present a novel approach to mitigate ranging errors directly in the physical layer. In contrast to existing techniques, which detect the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) condition, our approach directly mitigates the bias incurred in both LOS and non-LOS conditions. In particular, we apply two classes of non-parametric regressors to form an estimate of the ranging error. Our work is based on, and validated by, an extensive indoor measurement campaign with FCC-compliant UWB radios. The results show that the proposed regressors provide significant performance improvements in various practical localization scenarios, compared to conventional approaches.","0090-6778;00906778","","10.1109/TCOMM.2012.042712.110035","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6192275","Bayesian learning;Gaussian processes;Localization;UWB;ranging error mitigation;support vector machine","Databases;Delay;Distance measurement;Feature extraction;Niobium;Support vector machines;Training","indoor communication;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;support vector machines;ultra wideband communication","UWB localization;fine delay resolution;indoor localization;location-awareness;machine learning approach;non-line-of-sight condition;obstacle-penetration capabilities;ranging error mitigation;ultrawide bandwidth transmission;wireless networks","","44","","70","","20120430","June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

By nature, agriculture is a spatial science characterized by significant variability in terms of yield and concentration of pests and plant diseases. Consequently, precision agriculture seeks to improve the effectiveness of various types of sensing information to give the grower more data and the ability to design the specific treatments for site-specific management of inputs and outputs. The intensive use of data in agriculture is at a relatively early stage and there remains much opportunity to refine modeling approaches and to build information infrastructure. With the overall goal of optimizing inputs to achieve the maximum output in terms of yield, this paper focuses on the application of a clustering algorithm to field data with the goal to identify management zones. We employ two sets of attributes, first yield and second field properties like slope and electrical conductivity to delineate the management zones. By definition, a management zone is a contiguous area defined by one or more features and may take on many different shapes. Building on the established machine learning approach of k-means clustering, we successfully identify a near optimal number of management zones for a cotton field.","","Electronic:978-1-4577-1591-4; POD:978-1-4577-1592-1","10.1109/CEWIT.2011.6163052","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6163052","k-means;management zones;precision agriculture;unsupervised learning","Clustering algorithms;Conductivity;Cotton;Global Positioning System;Sensors;Soil","agriculture;cotton;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;statistical analysis","agricultural productivity;cotton;data-driven agriculture;global positioning system;k-means clustering;machine learning technique;management zone;precision agriculture;sensing technology;statistical modeling","","5","","26","","","2-3 Nov. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, in many cases the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks can be remote. Only a few features derived from the auxiliary data may be helpful for the target learning. We call such scenario the deep transfer-learning scenario and we introduce a novel transfer-learning method for deep transfer. Our method uses restricted Boltzmann machine to discover a set of hierarchical features from the auxiliary data. We then select from these features a subset that are helpful for the target learning, using a selection criterion based on the concept of kernel-target alignment. Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training. Our experiment results show that this transfer method is effective.

Both training and test documents can be projected into that space, allowing cross-lingual semantic comparisons between the documents without the need for translation. Accordingly, the training documents with known sentiment are used to build a machine learning model which can, because of the multilingual nature of the document projections, be used to predict sentiment in the other languages. We explain and evaluate the accuracy of this approach.

The problem itself is vital for the robot to correctly achieve its goals. There are several ways to approach this problem, for example, robot localization using landmarks [4], [5], calculation of the robot's position based on the distance it has covered [6], [7], etc. Many of these solutions imply the use of active sensors in the robot to calculate a distance or notice a landmark. However, there is a solution which has not been explored and is the main topic of this paper. In essence the solution we tested has to do with the possibility that the robot can determine its own position at any time using only a single sensor, and a reduced database. This database contains all the information needed to match what the robot is sensing with its spatial position. In order for the method to be practically implementable we reduced the number of necessary matches by defining a subset of the original database images. There are two issues which have to be solved in order to implement such solution: a) the number of elements in every subset of the matching images and b) the absolute positions of each of these elements. Once these are determined, the matching process is very fast and ensures the adequate identification of the robot's position without errors. However, the two goals we just mentioned impose conflicting optimization goals. On the one hand we seek for the largest subset so that position identification is accurate. On the other we wish this subset to be as small as possible so that the online processing is as fast as possible. These conditions constitute a multi-objective optimization problem. To solve it we used a Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) which minimizes the number of pixels required by the robot to identify an image. To test the validity of this approach we also solved this problem using a statistical methodology which solves problem (a)- and a random mutation Hill Climber to solve problem (b).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4605-6; POD:978-1-4577-2173-1","10.1109/MICAI.2011.41","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6119007","genetic algorithms;machine learning;multi-objective optimization","Databases;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems","genetic algorithms;image matching;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;position control;robot programming","MOGA;image matching;machine learning;mobile robot;multi objective genetic algorithm;reduced database;robot localization;robot position","","1","","13","","","Nov. 26 2011-Dec. 4 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In order to optimize the radio resource usage and maxmize the throughput and quality of service (QoS), the link aggregation technologies to utilize multiple different available RANs have been studied. However, in such heterogeneous wireless networks, it is difficult to improve the throughput by their aggregation because of the differences among the QoSs of the different RANs. In this paper, we propose an autonomous parameter optimization scheme using a machine learning algorithm, which maximize the throughput of the heterogeneous RAN aggregation system. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme implemented on a cognitive wireless network system called Cognitive Wireless Cloud (CWC) system, connected to real wireless network services, such as HSDPA, WiMAX and W-CDMA.

This is to address the limitations of the existing pooling techniques, like simple summation, averaging, Minkowski summation, etc., which tend to be ad hoc. We advocate machine learning for feature pooling because it is more systematic and data driven. The experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the eight existing relevant schemes.

One challenge with integrating renewables into the grid is that their power generation is intermittent and uncontrollable. Thus, predicting future renewable generation is important, since the grid must dispatch generators to satisfy demand as generation varies. While manually developing sophisticated prediction models may be feasible for large-scale solar farms, developing them for distributed generation at millions of homes throughout the grid is a challenging problem. To address the problem, in this paper, we explore automatically creating site-specific prediction models for solar power generation from National Weather Service (NWS) weather forecasts using machine learning techniques. We compare multiple regression techniques for generating prediction models, including linear least squares and support vector machines using multiple kernel functions. We evaluate the accuracy of each model using historical NWS forecasts and solar intensity readings from a weather station deployment for nearly a year. Our results show that SVM-based prediction models built using seven distinct weather forecast metrics are 27% more accurate for our site than existing forecast-based models.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-9624-2; Electronic:978-1-4577-1702-4; POD:978-1-4577-1704-8; USB:978-1-4577-1702-4","10.1109/SmartGridComm.2011.6102379","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6102379","","Correlation;Kernel;Measurement;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Weather forecasting","learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;power engineering computing;regression analysis;smart power grids;solar power;solar power stations;support vector machines;weather forecasting","NWS weather forecast;National Weather Service;grid energy fraction;large-scale solar farm;linear least squares;machine learning;regression technique;smart grid initiative;solar generation prediction;support vector machines","","32","","11","","","17-20 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, the utility of trait based approaches for microbial communities has been identified. Increasing availability of whole genome sequences provide the opportunity to explore the genetic foundations of a variety of functional traits. In this paper, we proposed a machine learning framework to quantitatively link the genotype with functional traits. Genes from bacteria genomes belonging to different functional trait groups were grouped to Cluster of Orthologs (COGs), and were used as features. Then, TF-IDF technique from the text mining domain was applied to transform the data to accommodate the abundance and importance of each COG. After TF-IDF processing, COGs were ranked using feature selection methods to identify their relevance to the functional trait of interest. We focused on a binary functional trait in this paper, but plan to extend our approach to continuous functional traits in the future. Experimental results demonstrated that functional trait related genes can be detected using our method.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-1321-6; POD:978-1-4673-1320-9","10.1109/ICCABS.2012.6182648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6182648","Ecology;Feature Selection;Functional Trait;Machine Learning;Microbial communities;Ortholog;Sequencing","Accuracy;Bioinformatics;Communities;Genomics;Microorganisms;Support vector machines","bioinformatics;cellular biophysics;data mining;feature extraction;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);microorganisms;text analysis","COG;Cluster of Orthologs;TF-IDF technique;bacteria genomes;binary functional trait;feature selection method;functional trait groups;functional trait related genes;machine learning framework;microbial community;text mining domain;trait based genomics","","2","","23","","","23-25 Feb. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Social media relies heavily on tagging and often does not take advantage of machine learning advances. Twitter is no exception. Individual tweets are identified as being part of a trending discussion topic by the presence of a tagged keyword. Relying solely on this keyword, however, may be inadequate for identifying all the discussion associated with a trend. Our research demonstrates that machine learning techniques can be used identify the top trend a tweet belongs to with up to 85% precision without using the identifying keyword as a feature. This can aid in improving the quality of topic categorization by ensuring on-topic tweets that are missing the trend keyword are included, as well as suggest keywords to include in new tweets.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4578-3; POD:978-1-4577-1931-8","10.1109/PASSAT/SocialCom.2011.160","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6113187","machine learning;social media;twitter","Accuracy;Bayesian methods;Machine learning;Media;Support vector machines;Training;Twitter","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);social networking (online)","Twitter trends;machine learning;social media;topic categorization","","0","","13","","","9-11 Oct. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes one approach of nonintrusive appliance load monitoring (NIALM) for electrical consumption managing. This approach can automatically monitor the house power consumption of individual devices. It employs multiple-class support vector machine (M-SVM) to recognize different appliances. The approach is consisted of two stages. In stage one, harmonic feature analysis is applied on current signal. In stage two, a trained classifier based on M-SVM is applied to identify different appliances. This paper presents the principle of this approach, the experiment results on real data, and discussions on performance comparison with other study of supervised classification for household power appliance monitoring.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4637-7; POD:978-1-4673-0470-2","10.1109/ICICTA.2012.151","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6150170","NILM;Support vector machine;power feature;residential appliances recognition;smart grid","Educational institutions;Harmonic analysis;Heating;Home appliances;Kernel;Monitoring;Support vector machines","domestic appliances;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;power consumption;power engineering computing;power system harmonics;support vector machines;sustainable development","Household Power Appliance Monitoring;M-SVM;Machine Learning;NIALM;harmonic feature analysis;house power consumption;household electrical consumption;human society;multiple-class support vector machine;nonintrusive appliance load monitoring;sustainable development;trained classifier","","9","","25","","","12-14 Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
