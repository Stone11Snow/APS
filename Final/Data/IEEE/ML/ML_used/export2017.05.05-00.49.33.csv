In this paper, by changing the process of relevance feedback into a learning problem of neural network, a relevance feedback technique for content-based images retrieval by neural network learning (NELIR) is introduced, which can improve user interaction with image retrieval systems by fully exploiting similarity information. NELIR can describe the distribution of positive feedback sample images in feature space with a set of neighboring clusters produced through constructing neural network, for accurately reflecting their semantic relevance. In particular, constructing neural network is dynamic. The neural network depends on which images are retrieved in response to the query. On the other hand, NELIR is independent of the specific feature extraction and similarity measure. Thus, it may be embedded in many current CBIR systems to improve the performance of image retrieval. The performance of a prototype system using NELIR is evaluated on a database of 2,000 images. Experimental results demonstrate improved performance compared with a traditional CBIR system without NELIR algorithm using the same image similarity measure","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258628","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028712","Content-based image retrieval;Feature extraction;Neural network learning;Relevance feedback;Similarity measure","Content based retrieval;Feature extraction;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Neural networks;Neurofeedback;Prototypes;Radio frequency;Spatial databases","content-based retrieval;feature extraction;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;relevance feedback;user interfaces","CBIR systems;NELIR algorithm;RF interactive process;content-based image retrieval;image similarity measure;neural network learning;positive feedback sample images;relevance feedback technique;user interaction","","8","1","9","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose is to design a memoryless state feedback controller such that, for admissible uncertainties as well as actuator failures occurring among the prespecified subset of actuators, the plant remains asymptotically stable and guarantees an adequate level of a quadratic cost index. A sufficient condition for the existence of such controller is derived in the form of Lyapunov inequality. Furthermore, it is showed that a group of linear matrix inequalities provides a parameterized representation of robust reliable guaranteed cost controllers. Based on that, the design problem of the optimal robust guaranteed cost controller is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which can be solved by the existing convex optimization techniques.

Electricity load forecasting is difficult due to the nonlinearity of its influencing factors. Support vector machine (SVM) have been successfully applied to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. However, the application to load forecasting is rare. In this study, a model of support vector machine is proposed to forecast electricity load. The model overcomes the disadvantages of general artificial neural network (ANN), such as it is not easy to converge, liable to trap in partial minimum and unable to optimize globally, and the generalization of the model is not good, etc. The SVM model ensured the forecasting is optimized globally. Subsequently, examples of electricity load data from Hebei province of China are used to illustrate the performance of the proposed model. The empirical results reveal that the proposed model outperforms the general artificial neural network model, and the forecasting accuracy improved effectively.

In recent years, the image processing technology is widely applied to detection of the flame combustion condition. The combustion in furnace, such as the combustion of the pulverized coal, is the complex, stochastic and unstable burning process. The flame images are static and include a lot of noise signals from different reasons; so the method based on the processing of the single image does not reflect the combustion in furnace exactly. In this paper, the stochastic model, that is, hidden Markov model (HMM) is introduced to achieve modeling and recognition of the flame combustion condition in furnace. It makes use of a hidden Markov process to characterize the image frames correlation in the image sequences and transition of image states where the model parameters are determined by the feature vectors of image frames that form the observation sequences. Experiments demonstrate that the HMM can better describe the flame combustion condition in the furnace so as to improve recognition performance.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258472","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028645","Combustion condition;Flame image;Hidden Markov model;Image frame;Recognition","Combustion;Condition monitoring;Fires;Furnaces;Hidden Markov models;Image processing;Image sequences;Signal processing;Stochastic processes;Stochastic resonance","","","","1","","12","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The structure of the SLSVN is obtained by equality-constrained minimization. Under the condition of modeling approximating to performance, the pruning algorithm gets the sparse modeling.

Different triangular norm T identifies different point of view of similarity. Thus reasonable selection of triangular norm is clearly meaningful to practical applications of fuzzy rough sets. In this paper we first discuss the selection of triangular norm and emphasize the well-known Lukasiewicz's triangular norm T<sub>L</sub> as a reasonable selection. We then propose a function for each approximation operator in T<sub>L </sub>-fuzzy rough sets to measure its approximating ability. The measurement functions of lower and upper approximation operators are natural generalizations of belief and plausibility functions in the evidence theory respectively. By using these two functions, accuracy measure, roughness degree, entropy and conditional entropy are defined for T<sub>L</sub>-fuzzy rough sets","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:1-4244-0061-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2006.258898","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4028327","Lukasiewicz's triangular norm;Rough sets;belief function;fuzzy rough sets","Cybernetics;Entropy;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Machine learning;Mathematics;Physics;Physics computing;Rough sets;Set theory","approximation theory;belief maintenance;fuzzy set theory;mathematical operators;rough set theory;uncertainty handling","Lukasiewicz triangular norm;T<sub>L</sub>-fuzzy rough set;approximation operator;belief function;conditional entropy;evidence theory;fuzzy T-similarity relation;plausibility function","","0","","27","","","13-16 Aug. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
