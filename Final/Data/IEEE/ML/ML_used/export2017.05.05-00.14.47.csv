In our OEP-LDWS, different kinds of driving maneuver can be simulated with the road model, the vehicle model, the camera model and a vehicle trajectory generator. At the same time, the road scene that may be captured by the on board camera can be generated. Using our OEP-LDWS, one can not only evaluate the warning performance of the LDWS quantitatively, but also assess the whole performance under varying circumstance, such as different road surfaces, different road curvatures and so on. Actually, those assessments can hardly be evaluated through real driving test, and are very important aspects for a LDWS, such as warning strategy selection, system tailor.

These visual words are different from those learned from the generic object recognition which usually contain the negative visual words located on the background. For the purpose of object localization, the approach requires that the positive discriminative visual words mostly lie in the foreground object and the negative ones lie in the background. We firstly rank the visual words by the following three methods: the SVM classifier, the foreground likelihood ratio and the mutual information. Then, we integrate the three ranking results in an optimal combinational way and select the discriminative visual words by maximizing the object hit rate. Moreover, a coarse-to-fine detection framework to locate the object is designed. In the first stage, a branch-and-bound scheme combined with the discriminative visual words is implemented to find candidate object regions. In the second stage, a sliding window classifier is used to find the object location.

The method applies the human pose based features to describe actions and models the conditional probability relationship between feature sequences and actions using hidden conditional random field (HCRF). Given a video, limb masks are extracted by clustering image features in human region. Limb masks are helpful to reduce the interference from background and partially address the “double-counting” problem during the pose estimation. Then, the extracted pose sequence is smoothed using the kalman smooth to remove the noise and make the pose sequence consistent. Multiple kinds of feature sequences based on poses are extracted to describe the information of actions from different views. We train one HCRF for each feature sequence and combine the confidence from different HCRFs to improve the recognition accuracy. Experiments on the benchmark dataset show different features have their own advantages in action recognition and combine them can reach a good result.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359525","HCRF;Kalman Smooth;Limb Masks;Poses","Abstracts;Clocks","feature extraction;image denoising;image sequences;pattern clustering;pose estimation;probability;smoothing methods","HCRF;Kalman smoothing;background interference reduction;conditional probability relationship models;double-counting problem;feature sequence extraction;hidden conditional random field;human action recognition method;human pose-based features;human region;image feature clustering;limb mask extraction;noise removal;pose estimation;pose sequence;recognition accuracy improvement","","0","","17","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the technical indicators are efficient tools on stock prediction, we use technical indicators of every trading day in current year as the input variables to train a RBFNN based on L-GEM and make prediction of trading actions (buy, sell or hold) for days in the next year. Then, a Multiple Classifier System (MCS) is built to make the final prediction from all base RBFNNs which trained by data in different years.

However, how to handle the uncertainty and incompleteness of information related with many aspects of the UR decision problem is still a challenge issue to be solved. A belief rule-base inference methodology (RIMER) has been recently proposed to handle the uncertainty and incompleteness and incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data within the human decision making procedure. This paper presents an application of the extended RIMER (called RIMER+) to address UR decision problem, where the detailed sensitivity analysis of RIMER+ performance for predicting deprivation measures of the Greater Belfast Region is given by varying the uncertainty and incompleteness levels of the inputs of the system. These case studies are based on real practical data of the Greater Belfast Region in UK. The results demonstrate the positive performance of the RIMER+ method to provide valid and supportive evaluation results, and at the same time to measure the incompleteness and uncertainty range as a reflection of reality as additional support information to help decision making. These positive results indicate that RIMER+ can provide a well-established base to implement further research with combination with GIS to tackle the UR decision problem.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359478","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359478","Belief rule-base;Decision making;Decision support system;Information incompleteness;Spatial decision making;Uncertainty;Urban regeneration","Abstracts;Education;Employment;Heating;Humans;Pediatrics","decision making;decision support systems;geographic information systems;inference mechanisms;knowledge based systems;socio-economic effects;town and country planning","Greater Belfast Region;RIMER+ method;UR decision problem;belief rule-base inference methodology;decision making process;decision support system;expert judgments;extended RIMER;geographic information systems;incompleteness analysis;qualitative data;quantitative data;socioeconomic policies;stakeholder opinion;uncertainty analysis;uncertainty handling;urban planning decision problem;urban regeneration projects","","1","","16","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

But this does not guarantee that the testing words also have minimum distortion as training words. To address the problem of producing poor codebook for testing words in speaker independent speech recognition, the proposed method makes use of the diversity of different speakers by randomly selecting some speakers and their pronounced words in the codebook design procedure to optimize codebooks.

However, large decision spaces with multiple strategy threads (e.g., resource gathering, combat units development) may lead to complicated and even impossible weight calculatious. Many approaches adopted a simplified formula and assuming game features are all independent to each other. Unfortunately, this is not necessary true. We aim to evaluate the strategies' performance by considering the super-additive properties among variables. In this research, we used Fuzzy Integral to model the feature interactions in RTS games. We also proposed a new fuzzy integral with respect to the RTS game rules called Order-based Fuzzy Integral(Ord-based FI).

One of the well-known solutions is the depth from focus. However, the drawbacks of this method are the tradeoff between spatial resolution and robustness, and failure in textureless regions. In this paper, a novel approach of depth from focus with multiple images is proposed to improve the two shortcomings. By employing the mean shift segmentation before the step of building Markov random field, the result of segmentation serves as adaptive window for DFF. The edges of the recovered depth map are guaranteed to align with the edges of the original image. After the initial estimation of depth, the hierarchical Markov random field is generated to expand the area to extract depth information according to the structure of the scene. In this way, the experiments show that depth can extract from the textureless regions to some extent.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6359527","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6359527","Depth from Focus;Depth of field;Markov Random Field;depth estimation;depth map;mean shift segmentation","Abstracts;Image edge detection;Image resolution;Image segmentation;Laplace equations;Optical imaging;Vibrations","Markov processes;computer vision;estimation theory;image resolution;image segmentation;image sequences;image texture","DFF;adaptive depth;adaptive window;computer vision research;depth estimation;depth from focus;depth information;depth map;hierarchical Markov random field;image segmentation;image sequences;mean shift segmentation;multiple images;recovering depth;robustness;spatial resolution;textureless regions","","1","","17","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It assigns targets to test inputs sequentially making use of sparse Gaussian process regression models. The proposed approach deals with only one part of the whole data set at a time. Firstly, the IVM produces a sparse approximation to a Gaussian process (GP) by combining assumed density filtering (ADF) with a heuristic for choosing points based on minimizing posterior entropy, and then a sparse GPR classifier is learnt on part of the whole data set. Secondly, the representative points selected in the first step including part of remainder examples are used to train another sparse GPR classifier. Repeat the two steps sequentially until all unlabeled examples are deal with. The proposed approach is simple and easy to implement. The hyperparameters are estimated easily by maximizing the marginal likelihood without resorting to expensive cross-validation technique.

However, OASIS focuses on the difference of similarity values between relevant and irrelevant image pairs while ignores the similarity value between highly similar images.

Social platforms facilitate collaboration among the public during a crisis and also support after-the-fact analysis. Thus, social media are useful for the processes of understanding, learning, and decision making. In particular, having information from social networks in a suitable, ideally summarized, form can speed up such processes. The present study relies on Flickr and You Tube as social media and aims at automatically identifying individual sub-events within a crisis situation. The study applies a two-phase clustering approach to detect those sub-events. The first phase uses geo-referenced data to locate a sub-event, while the second phase uses the natural language descriptions of pictures and videos to further identify the ""what-about"" of those sub-events.

Although the normalized cut algorithm is very effective to handle different kinds of challenging datasets, its computational cost is very high, especially when the sizes of the datasets are large. In order to solve this limitation, we propose a fast normalized cut algorithm based on self-organizing map (FNCUT(SOM)) to perform clustering on large datasets. FNCUT(SOM) pays more attention to the representative feature vectors which are the weight vectors of the neurons in SOM, instead of considering all the feature vectors. Specifically, FNCUT(SOM) adopts the self-organizing map to perform fast clustering on the dataset at first. Then, the weight vectors of the neurons in SOM serve as a new dataset, and is used to construct a representative matrix. In the following, the normalized cut algorithm is adopted to partition the representative matrix and obtains the structure of the dataset. Finally, two assignment criteria are designed to distribute the feature vectors in the original dataset into the corresponding clusters.

Local Binary Pattern (LBP) method is one of these techniques which has shown its superiority in recognizing faces. The original LBP operator mainly thresholds pixels in a specific predetermined window based on the gray value of the central pixel of that window. As a result the LBP operator becomes more sensitive to noise especially in near-uniform or flat area regions of an image. To deal with this problem a generalization of the LBP descriptor, Local Ternary Patterns (LTP), came to the presence. In this paper we introduce a new local adapted texture features for efficient avatar face recognition based on the original LTP operator. The proposed technique, Adaptive Extended Local Ternary Pattern (AELTP), shares with the original LTP descriptor being less sensitive to noise. However AELTP is better as it determines the local pattern threshold automatically based on local statistics. Experiments conducted on two virtual world avatar face image datasets show that our technique performs better than original LBP, original LTP and Extended LTP (ELTP) in terms of accuracy.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.19","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406589","AELTP;Avatar;ELTP;LBP;LTP;face recognition","Accuracy;Avatars;Equations;Face recognition;Feature extraction;Noise","avatars;face recognition;image colour analysis;image texture","AELTP;LBP descriptor;LBP method;LBP operator;LTP operator;adaptive extended local ternary pattern;avatar face recognition;central pixel;extended LTP;face recognition techniques;gray value;local adapted texture features;local binary pattern method;nonbiological entities;original LTP;predetermined window;recognizing avatar faces;virtual world avatar face image datasets","","1","","20","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Then, a POMDP solver can be used to solve the problem. If the prior distribution over the environment's dynamics is a product of Dirichlet distributions, the POMDP's optimal value function can be represented using a set of multivariate polynomials. Unfortunately, the size of the polynomials grows exponentially with the problem horizon. In this paper, we examine the use of an online Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) algorithm for large POMDPs, to solve the Bayesian reinforcement learning problem online. We will show that such an algorithm successfully searches for a near-optimal policy. In addition, we examine the use of a parameter tying method to keep the model search space small, and propose the use of nested mixture of tied models to increase robustness of the method when our prior information does not allow us to specify the structure of tied models exactly.

The data describing the location of syndrome cases over the population suffers a moving-average filtering, and the resulting values are fitted by an RBF network performing a regression. Some contour curves of the RBF network are then employed in order to establish the boundaries between four kinds of regions: regions of high-incidence, regions of medium incidence, regions of slightly-abnormal incidence, and regions of normal prevalence. In each region, the risk is estimated with three indicators: a nominal risk, an upper bound risk and a lower bound risk. Those indicators are obtained by adjusting the probability employed for the Monte Carlo simulation of syndrome scenarios over the population. The nominal risk is the probability which produces Monte Carlo simulations for which the empirical number of syndrome cases corresponds to the median. The upper bound and the lower bound risks are the probabilities which produce Monte Carlo simulations for which the empirical values of syndrome cases correspond respectively to the 25% percentile and the 75% percentile. The proposed method constitutes an advance in relation to the currently known techniques of spatial cluster detection, which are dedicated to finding clusters of abnormal occurrence of a syndrome, without quantifying the probability associated to such an abnormality, and without performing a stratification of different sub-regions with different associated risks. The proposed method was applied on data which were studied formerly in a paper that was intended to find a cluster of dengue fever.

Many studies have focused on gene selection, examining both the design of these techniques and the classification performance of prediction models built using these techniques. However, it is only recently that any work has focused on the robustness or stability of these gene selection techniques. Robustness is important because techniques which do not give reliable gene lists cannot be trusted to give useful genes. Previous papers studying stability typically generate multiple random sub samples of the original dataset and compare the genes chosen from these with one another, or compare the genes from the sub samples directly with the genes from the original data. These methods both have known problems, either with comparing two randomly-generated datasets with an unknown level of overlap or with comparing two datasets of different sizes. This paper introduces a new algorithm for generating sub sample datasets called fixed-overlap partitions. This will generate sub samples which have exactly the desired level of overlap and number of instances. Using this method we evaluate nineteen feature selection techniques using twenty-six real world DNA microarray datasets. Our results show that there are three rankers (Deviance, Receiver Operating Characteristic curve, and Precision-Recall Curve) which are consistently the most stable. However, the level of overlap, the quality of the data, and the number of genes selected have an effect on which ranker will be the most stable in a given situation. The fixed-overlap partitions algorithm in particular is able to find how varying levels of overlap can cause different levels of difficulty to sometimes resemble one another (for example, moderate-difficulty datasets behave like easy-difficulty datasets at low levels of overlap, but diverge as the overlap increases).","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.149","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406746","DNA Microarray;Fixed-Overlap Partitions;Stability","Bioinformatics;DNA;Market research;Measurement;Partitioning algorithms;Stability criteria","bioinformatics;data handling","DNA microarray datasets;bioinformatics datasets;bioinformatics gene rankers;determining stability;feature gene selection;fixed overlap partitions;gene selection techniques;new fixed overlap partitioning algorithm","","0","","18","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, these tools are successful if the number of levels of an image are known and a careful choice of initialization is performed. We intend a novel hierarchical level set (HLS) followed by an Adaptive Regularized Boosting (AR-Boost) for automatic White Matter Lesion (WML) segmentation from Magnetic Resonance Images. HLS does not need to know the number of levels in an image and HLS is computationally less expensive and more initialization independent than coupled level-setssince HLS doesn't generate redundant regions. We employan energy functional that minimizes the negative logarithm of variances between the two partitions created by the level set function. HLS uses a level set to partition the image into a number of segments, then applies the level set on all the segments separately to create more segments and the process continues iteratively until all the segments become a nearly homogeneous region (low intensity variance). Then AR-Boost classifies the segments into WML and non-WML classes. The proposed loss function for AR-boost enforces more weight on misclassified samples at each iteration than Adaboost to classify correctly in the next iteration and consequently leads to early convergence. Unlike Adaboost, the user can select optimal weights through cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art automated white matter lesion segmentation techniques.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.24","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406594","Boosting;Diabetes;Level Set;White Matter Lesion Segmentation","Boosting;Diabetes;Image segmentation;Lesions;Level set;Magnetic resonance imaging;Partitioning algorithms","biomedical MRI;convergence of numerical methods;diseases;image classification;image sampling;image segmentation;iterative methods;medical image processing","AR-boost;HLS;adaptive regularized boosting;automatic WML segmentation;coupled level-sets function;diabetes;hierarchical level set;image levels;image partitioning;iterative process;magnetic resonance images;misclassified samples;multilevel image segmentation;nearly homogeneous region;negative variances logarithm;next iteration method;nonWML classes;redundant regions;white matter lesion segmentation","","0","","9","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, high dimensionalities of genotype data and exponential complexity of the search space with respect to the order of targeted interactions make most of existing interaction detection strategies practically inapplicable. Because they are capable of capturing interactions among input variables in addition to the nonlinear effects, decision trees and their ensembles have been recently shown to be resourceful strategies in detecting interactions in GWAS data. However, unlike other nodes, selection of root nodes for decision trees is merely based on marginal effects of candidate variables over the training data, which can greatly limit their epistasis detection performance, especially when disease genotypes have low marginal effects. In this study, we show that modifying the selection criterion of the root node of each new tree joining the ensemble, in a way that captures the interaction with the best variable ranked by the ensemble at the time, leads to a higher power in epistasis detection by decision tree ensembles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this idea using the three most popular decision tree ensemble algorithms: Bagging, Random Forest and Adaboost. Our simulation studies using five two-locus epistasis models with low marginal effects show a considerable enhancement of interaction detection power of all mentioned ensemble strategies after applying the proposed modification.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.114","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406635","decision trees;ensemble learning;epistasis models;interaction detection","Bagging;Boosting;Decision trees;Diseases;Training;Vegetation","bioinformatics;data analysis;decision trees;diseases;genetic engineering;genomics;learning (artificial intelligence);search problems","Adaboost;GWAS data;bagging;decision tree ensemble algorithm;disease genotype;epistasis detection performance;exponential complexity;five two-locus epistasis model;gene-gene interaction detection;genome wide association study;genotype data;interaction trees;nonlinear effect;random forest;root node selection;search space;training data","","1","","23","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is valuable in situations where the local clinical data repository does not have sufficient number of records to draw conclusions from. However, due to privacy concerns, hospitals are reluctant to divulge patient records. Consequently, a distributed model building mechanism that can use just the statistics from multiple hospitals' databases is valuable. Our DIDT algorithm builds a model in that fashion. In this study, using National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data for 2009, we demonstrate that DIDT algorithm can be used to help collaboratively build a better decision-making model in situations where hospitals have small number of records that are insufficient to make good local models. Based on 262 attributes used for model building, we showed that 9 collaborating hospitals each with less than 100 cases of hospitalizations related to diabetes were able to achieve 9.9% improvement in accuracies of hospitalization prediction collectively using a distributed model as compared to relying on local models developed on their own. When relying on local risk prediction models for diabetes at these 9 hospitals, 159 of 357 patients were misclassified and prediction was impossible for another 16 patients. Our integrated model reduced the misclassification to 138 effectively providing accurate early diagnostics to 37 additional patients.

The benefits of ensemble feature selection include increased feature (gene) subset stability and usefulness as well as comparable (or better) classification performance compared to using a single feature selection method. However, existing work on ensemble feature selection has concentrated on data diversity (using a single feature selection method on multiple datasets or sampled data from a single dataset), neglecting two other potential sources of diversity. We present these two new approaches for gene selection, functional diversity (using multiple feature selection technique on a single dataset) and hybrid (a combination of data and functional diversity). To demonstrate the value of these new approaches, we measure the similarity between the feature subsets created by each of the three approaches across twenty-six datasets and ten feature selection techniques (or an ensemble of these techniques as appropriate). We also compare the classification performance of models built using each of the three ensembles. Our results show that the similarity between the functional diversity and hybrid approaches is much higher than the similarity between either of those and data diversity, with the distinction between data diversity and our new approaches being particularly strong for hard-to-learn datasets. In addition to having the highest similarity, functional and hybrid diversity generally show greater classification performance than data diversity, especially when selecting small feature subsets. These results demonstrate that these new approaches can both provide a different feature subset than the existing approach and that the resulting novel feature subset is potentially of interest to researchers. To our knowledge there has been no study which explores these new approaches to ensemble feature selection within the domain of bioinformatics.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-4913-2; POD:978-1-4673-4651-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2012.175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406748","DNA Microarray;Ensemble Feature Selection;Similarity","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;DNA;Indexes;Stability criteria","bioinformatics;feature extraction;genetics;pattern classification","bioinformatics;classification performance;data diversity;ensemble feature selection;feature subset;functional diversity;gene selection ensemble approach;hard-to-learn dataset;hybrid diversity approach;similarity measure","","7","","23","","","12-15 Dec. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Sparse LS-SVM is obtained with a pruning procedure. The performance of sparse LS-SVM depends on the selection of hyper-parameters (i.e. kernel and penalty parameters). Currently, CV and LOO are the most common methods to select hyper-parameters for LS-SVM. However, CV is computationally expensive while LOO yields a high variance of validation error which may mislead the selection of hyper-parameters. Selecting both kernel and penalty parameters simultaneously needs to search in a high dimensional parameter space. In this work, we propose a new two-step hyper-parameter selection method. Distance between Two Classes (DBTC) method is adopted to select the kernel parameters based on a maximization of between-class separation of the projected samples in the feature space. However, data distribution could not be helpful in penalty parameter selection. Therefore, we propose to select the penalty parameter via a minimization of a Localized Generalization Error to enhance the generalization capability of the LS-SVM. Experimental results comparing to existing methods show the proposed two-step method yields better LS-SVMs in term of average testing accuracies.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358967","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358967","Distance Between Two Classes;Localized Generalization Error Model;model selection;sensitivity measure;sparse LS-SVMs","Abstracts;Heart;Sonar","least squares approximations;quadratic programming;support vector machines","between-class separation maximization;distance-between-two classes method;feature space;hinge loss function;kernel parameters;least square loss function;least square support vector machine;linear system solving problem;localized generalization error minimization;penalty parameters;pruning procedure;quadratic programming training method;sparse LS-SVM two-steps model selection method;two-step hyper-parameter selection method","","1","","18","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on parameters optimization and model selection idea, the swarm intelligence algorithm of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-SVM is proposed for financial distress predicting process with strong coupling and nonlinear characteristics through the principle component analysis (PCA). Furthermore, Logistic regression (LR) algorithm is induced to make a comparison with Least-Square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and PSO-SVM. The simulation results show that the presented algorithms could get the satisfied accuracy effectively, and by contrast, PSO-SVM shows a better learning ability and generalization in financial distress predicting process modeling, and could establish predictive model with better accessibility.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4673-1487-9; POD:978-1-4673-1484-8","10.1109/ICMLC.2012.6358968","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6358968","Financial Distress Prediction;LS-SVM;PCA;PSO","Abstracts;Couplings;Equations;Mathematical model;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Support vector machines","financial data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);least squares approximations;particle swarm optimisation;principal component analysis;regression analysis;support vector machines;swarm intelligence","LR algorithm;LS-SVM;PCA;PSO;coupling characteristics;financial distress predicting process modeling;learning ability;learning generalization;least-square support vector machine;logistic regression algorithm;model selection idea;nonlinear characteristics;parameters optimization;particle swarm optimization;principle component analysis;swarm intelligence algorithm","","0","","14","","","15-17 July 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
