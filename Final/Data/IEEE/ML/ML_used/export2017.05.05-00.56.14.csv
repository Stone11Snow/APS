Approximating TPS (ATPS) has been proposed to weak the interpolation condition. In ATPS, the regularization parameter plays an important role. It controls the smoothness of the transformation. Unfortunately, how to estimate is not solved. In this paper, estimation of the optimal regularization parameter has been proposed. It combines two evaluation factors, smoothness and location error hypothesis testing, to evaluate transformation results using fuzzy integral. The optimal regularization parameter is the best value maximizing the evaluation function.

Facing the explosion of newly generated protein sequences in the post genomic era, we are challenged to develop an automated method for fast and reliably annotating their subcellular localizations. To tackle the challenge, a novel method of the sequence-segmented pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) is introduced to represent protein samples. Based on the concept of Choupsilas PseAAC, a series of useful information and techniques, such as multi-scale energy and moment descriptors were utilized to generate the sequence-segmented pseudo amino acid components for representing the protein samples. Meanwhile, the multi-class SVM classifier modules were adopted for predicting 16 kinds of eukaryotic protein subcellular localizations. Compared with existing methods, this new approach provides better predictive performance. The success total accuracies were obtained in the jackknife test and independent dataset test, suggesting that the sequence-segmented PseAAC method is quite promising, and might also hold a great potential as a useful vehicle for the other areas of molecular biology.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621106","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621106","moment descriptor;multi-scale energy;sequence-segmented PseAAC;support vector machine","Conferences;Cybernetics;Machine learning","biology computing;macromolecules;molecular biophysics;proteins;support vector machines","molecular biology;moment descriptors;multiscale energy;protein subcellular localization;pseudo amino acid composition;sequence-segmented PSEAAC","","0","","17","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Whether a student is willing to contribute knowledge to a shared system presents a educational dilemma: Each student saves time and energy by not contributing any information to the system and by using the system only to retrieve information which was contributed by others. But if all students use this strategy, then the system will be empty and, hence, useless for every student. Based on theoretical approaches, one model for fostering the information-sharing behavior of system students are presented in education. Our empirical study examined the influence of information-sharing on learning outcome and learner satisfaction in e-learning environments. Three different settings were studied: two were e-learning environments - with information-sharing, and non-information-sharing. The third was the traditional classroom environment. Results of the experiment showed that the value of knowledge management for learning effectiveness was contingent upon the provision of information-sharing. Students in the e-learning environment that provided information-sharing achieved significantly better learning performance and a higher level of learner satisfaction than those in other settings. However, students who used the e-learning environment that provided non-information-sharing did not improve either.

Fast downward is a domain-independent heuristic planner, which is based on the causal graph heuristic. Because of translating a problem to a multi-valued planning task, and exploiting the underlying causal structure, fast downward can yield better performance compared with the state of the art heuristic planners in many domains, but it needs the state variables to be independent, which is always not satisfied.

First, the estimator of sample covariance is non-robust; Second, the possible high dimension of the covariance matrices makes exact parameter estimation difficult. In this paper, we propose the approach of mixtures of CSP (MCSP) to conquer this problem. MCSP constructs multiple CSP feature extractors by the bootstrap sampling method, and has the potential to improve the performance of one single feature extractor. The classification result of a new EEG sample is obtained by combining several classifier outputs corresponding to the multiple feature extractors.

The SYN flood attack is a DoS method affecting hosts to retain the half-open state and exhaust its memory resources. This attack is hard to be filtered by the routers in case that the source IP address is always spoofed. There are some common ways to defend against this attach, but all of them either requires a high-performance firewall or trade time for space. In this paper, we proposed a method to build a new kind of syn-agent which uses the TCP header reserved flag bits to notify the server a complete three-way TCP handshake. First the syn-agent instead of the real server answer the client with ACK after received a SYN packet from the client. Then if it is a syn-attack, there should be no further ACKs after this. After a given short period, the half-open TCP sock should be deleted from the agent. If it is a really connection request, after the third time handshake packet arrived, the agent set the reserved bit in the TCP header to be dasia1psila and route the packet to the real server. When the server received a packet with the reserved bits set to be dasia1psila, it directly allocates memory for the connection and begins to communicate.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620589","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620589","DoS;SYN flooding;syn-agent","Computer crime;Computer science;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Floods;Internet;Machine learning;TCPIP;Transport protocols;Web server","IP networks;software agents;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication security;transport protocols","IP address;SYN-agent;TCP syn flooding attack;denial-of-service attacks;high-performance firewall","","1","","3","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In fact there often exist many positive and negative interactions between goals, and the orders suggested by the dependence between goals can be further used as heuristic information in planning. Although recently Over-Subscription Planning problems (OSP) received more and more attention in planning community, few methods have been proposed to find out these interactions before planning. So in this paper, we introduce a method to find out primary interactions between atomic goals and orders can be inferred from these primary interactions. We define six types of interactions between goals and combination operations for them, which can be regarded as a groupoid algebra system. The orders suggest by interactions can be used as heuristic for planner. In practical, our framework can be a preprocessor of any classical planner for OSP handling, and we combine our suggested orders with other goal ordering techniques to build a more effective heuristic strategy. Besides tackling OSP, the time of processing goal relations inference is negligible comparing to the planning time, so we believe this method can serve as a new heuristic technique. We provide preliminary empirical results in a planner we called FF<sup>ps</sup> which demonstrate the effectiveness.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620377","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620377","Artificial Intelligence;Heuristic;Interactions between goals;Over-Subscription Planning;Planning","Algebra;Artificial intelligence;Buildings;Computer science;Cybernetics;Inference mechanisms;Machine learning;Process planning;Strategic planning","group theory;planning (artificial intelligence)","goal interaction;goal ordering techniques;groupoid algebra system;heuristic information;heuristic strategy;over-subscription planning problems","","0","","20","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Collaborative filtering based on cluster has high scalability but low accuracy of prediction.

However, these languages may not be the most elegant languages to use for artificially intelligent control of 3D for dramatic narrative, believable speaking characters, dynamic cinematography and stage management. A good alternative is the Java language which provides very productive syntax and a body of developed application code for control and management of 3D scenes. The paper first presents an analysis of the problems of interfacing Java to 3D rendering systems, and some possible solutions in the context of interfacing Java to VRML. Finally we implement a Java interface which is defined independent to the underlying 3D representation and format. This solution makes it possible to abstract out the particular field types used in the 3D rendering platform.

Next, these parameter values and other music information are used together to control a harmonic-plus-noise (HNM) model to synthesize singing voice signals.

Projected clustering has emerged as a possible solution to the challenges associated with high dimensional clustering. A projected cluster is a subset of points together with a subset of attributes, such that some category of value of cluster points has great probability in these attributes. The relationship between projected cluster and Bayesian network is discussed in this paper. The dense cells can be identified by Bayesian network, and then adjacent dense cells can be merged into a projected cluster. It avoids the blind selection of dimension and the chicken-and-egg problem that must identify dimensions and data objects simultaneously. It can also search clusters on arbitrary subspace.

A fast and efficient scheme of the genetic algorithm used to evolve the weights of the gating network is presented. A new bending line detection algorithm for the check image processing is proposed. The position information of the detected lines is utilized to connect the broken lines caused by the bending line problem and to enhance segmentation accuracy.

Classification is often performed in the flow pattern identification based on data extraction from all designed instruments. However, the raw data may contain a large number of features, but many features are not necessary, even resulting in more imprecise identification. The classifier also is difficult to be determined when the number of training data needed to design a classifier grows with the number of the features. Hence, a way is needed to reduce the number of the features without losing any essential information. Data fusion method is helpful to realize feature reduction. This paper presents a new method for feature reduction using interaction index-based data fusion, and compares it with some methods presented earlier in the literature.

In the training phase, the disadvantage of some CMAC models with a larger fixed learning rate is the unstable phenomenon. The smaller learning rate would cause slower convergence speed. In the aspect, we propose grey learning rate for training phase. We incorporate the grey relational analysis with the number of training iterations to get an adequate learning rate for better convergence performance. In addition, a serious problem of learning interference reduces learning speed and accuracy. The idea is that the error correcting must be proportional to the inverse of learning times, trained input area and grey relational grade for the addressed hyper cube. A credit apportionment adopts the idea to provide fast and accurate learning effects. This paper proposes a novel learning framework of CMAC for better performance and real-time applications. From the simulation results, it is evident that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate and fast convergence in the early cycles of training phase and also becomes significant in the follow-up cycles.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620940","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620940","CMAC;Learning interference;credit apportionment;grey relational analysis;grey relational grade","Accuracy;Convergence;Equations;Interference;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Training","cerebellar model arithmetic computers;grey systems;learning systems;nonlinear functions","CMAC;grey learning rate;grey-area-time credit apportionment;neural network;nonlinear functions mapping","","0","","12","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Secondly, we perform a soft color quantization step on the abstracted video. A significant advantage of the soft color quantization implementation is preserving temporal coherence and reducing computation time as well.

However, security of biometric data is particularly important as the compromise of the data will be permanent. To protect the biometric data, we need to store it in a non-invertible transformed version. Thus, even if the transformed version is compromised, the actual biometric data remains safe. In this paper, we implement the fuzzy fingerprint vault system combining fingerprint verification and fuzzy vault scheme to protect fingerprint templates. Fuzzy vault is a recently developed cryptographic construct to secure critical data with the fingerprint data in a way that only the authorized user can access the secret by providing the valid fingerprint. However, all the previous results assumed that fingerprint features were pre-aligned. To solve this problem, we perform the automatic alignment of fingerprint features by using the geometric hashing technique. Also, we implement a new RS decoding algorithm based on the Extended Euclidean algorithm proposed by Gao. Based on the experimental results, we confirm that the proposed approach can align fingerprint features automatically in the domain of the fuzzy vault and perform fingerprint verification with the protected template in real-time.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4621063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4621063","Crypto-Biometric;Fingerprint Template Protection;Fuzzy Vault;Geometric Hashing","Authentication;Bioinformatics;Biometrics;Cryptography;Cybernetics;Fingerprint recognition;Fuzzy systems;Layout;Machine learning;Protection","biometrics (access control);cryptography;fingerprint identification;fuzzy set theory","automatic fuzzy fingerprint vault;biometric data security;biometric-based authentication;crypto-biometric","","5","2","12","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, called user access pattern mining (UAP-miner), to provide real-time recommendations based user access patterns. UAP-miner uses a data structure named as user access pattern tree, or UAP-tree in short. The user access pattern tree can efficiently store large number of user access information. According to the user access patterns, the UAP-miner scans relevant sub-trees of the user access pattern tree to generate real-time recommendations.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620431","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620431","Real-time recommendations;Sequential patterns mining;UAP-tree;Web mining","Association rules;Collaboration;Data mining;Information analysis;Itemsets;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Transaction databases;Tree data structures;Web mining","Internet;data mining;data structures;information filters;trees (mathematics)","UAP-miner;Web mining;association rules;data structure;real-time recommendation algorithm;user access pattern mining;user access pattern tree;user access sequences","","0","","11","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A new method based on reinforcement learning and rough sets is proposed to accomplish robot navigation tasks in unknown environment. With reinforcement learning, robot can achieve autonomous navigation in an unknown environment. Because of the navigation knowledge of robot has the characteristic of incompleteness and inaccuracy, rough sets is an effective mathematical tools to deal with incompleteness. Rough sets can deal with robot initial navigation knowledge and simplify the complexity of navigation, therefore it can speedup the learning process of autonomous mobile robot and improve the obstacle avoidance ability of navigation system. This is the reason why we lead rough sets into reinforcement learning process. Finally, the effectiveness of the presented method is verified in simulation environment.

However, the scoring method used in AFCPMs does not explicitly use the discriminative information available in the training data. To harness this information, this paper proposes converting speaker models to supervectors by stacking the discrete densities in AFCPMs. An AF-kernel is constructed from the supervectors of target speakers, background speakers, and claimants. An AF-kernel based SVM is then trained to classify the super-vectors. Results show that AF-kernel scoring is complementary to likelihood-ratio scoring, leading to better performance when the two scoring methods are combined.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-2095-7","10.1109/ICMLC.2008.4620884","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4620884","SVM;Speaker verification;articulatory;features;kernels;pronunciation models","Cybernetics;Kernel;Machine learning","feature extraction;speaker recognition;support vector machines","articulatory feature-based phonetic-class pronunciation models;articulatory-feature based sequence kernel;background speakers;discriminative information;high-level speaker verification;pronunciation characteristics;scoring methods;target speakers;training data","","1","","12","","","12-15 July 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
