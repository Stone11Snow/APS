However, it is extremely difficult for investors to find useful trading rules based on numerous technical indicators. This paper innovatively proposes the use of biclustering mining to discover effective technical trading patterns that contain a combination of indicators from historical financial data series. This is the first attempt to use biclustering algorithm on trading data. The mined patterns are regarded as trading rules and can be classified as three trading actions (i.e., the buy, the sell, and no-action signals) with respect to the maximum support. A modified K nearest neighborhood (K-NN) method is applied to classification of trading days in the testing period. The proposed method [called biclustering algorithm and the K nearest neighbor (BIC-K-NN)] was implemented on four historical datasets and the average performance was compared with the conventional buy-and-hold strategy and three previously reported intelligent trading systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed trading system outperforms its counterparts and will be useful for investment in various financial markets.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2014.2370063","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6975065","Biclustering;machine learning;technical analysis;trading rules","Artificial neural networks;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Evolution (biology);Indexes;Market research;Stock markets","data mining;financial data processing;investment;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;stock markets","BIC-K-NN;K-NN method;biclustering learning;biclustering mining;financial markets;historical financial data series;investment;modified K nearest neighborhood method;pattern mining;technical analysis;technical indicators;technical trading patterns;trading day classification;trading decision making;trading rules","","4","","41","","20141204","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The ever-increasing number of M2M devices is heavily modifying the traffic patterns observed in cellular networks, and the interest in discovering and tracking these devices is rapidly growing among operators. In this paper we introduce MTRAC, a complete approach for M2M TRAffic Classification, capable of discovering M2M devices from coarse-grained measurements. MTRAC uses different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to unveil M2M devices in cellular networks. It relies on very simple traffic descriptors to characterize the communication patterns of each device. These descriptors are robust to traffic encryption techniques, and improve the portability of the MTRAC approach to other network scenarios. MTRAC is implemented on top of DBStream, a novel Data Stream Warehouse which allows to classify M2M devices in an on-line basis, using different temporal and logical traffic aggregations. We study the performance of MTRAC in the on-line classification of more than two months of traffic observed in a operational, nationwide cellular network, comparing different ML algorithms and different traffic aggregation techniques. To the best of our knowledge, MTRAC is the first ML-based approach for automatic M2M device classification in operational cellular networks.","1550-3607;15503607","Electronic:978-1-4673-6432-4; POD:978-1-4673-6430-0","10.1109/ICC.2015.7248398","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7248398","Cellular Networks;DBStream;Machine Learning;Machine-to-Machine Traffic;On-line Traffic Classification","Classification algorithms;Performance evaluation;World Wide Web","cellular radio;cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","DBStream;M2M traffic classification;MTRAC;automatic M2M device classification;cellular networks;coarse-grained measurements;data stream warehouse;logical traffic aggregations;machine learning;machine-to-machine network traffic;temporal traffic aggregations;traffic encryption","","0","","14","","","8-12 June 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Different approaches were followed for each tool to determine the polarity of each response (i.e. positive, negative or neutral). Overall, the non-commercial tools outperformed their commercial counterparts. However, due to the different features offered by the tools, specific recommendations are made for each. In addition, single-sentence responses were tested in isolation to determine the extent to which they more clearly express a single polarity.

Previous research on event detection concentrates majorly on the use of feed forward neural network and other classifiers such as naive Bayes and decision tree alone for modern fire detection applications. In our approach presented here, we combine k-means with neural networks and other classifiers in order to improve the detection rate of event detection applications. To demonstrate our approach, we perform data aggregation on normalized multi-dimensional fire datasets in order to remove redundant data. The aggregated data forms two clusters which represent the two class labels (actual outputs) with the aid of k-means clustering. The resulting data outputs are trained by the Feed Forward Neural Network, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.

Without human control, they need to keep operative states in applications such as drone-based delivery or robotic space landing. Nowadays, the partial and run-time reconfiguration (RTR) of FPGA-based Systems-on-chip (SoC) can enable dynamic hardware acceleration or self-healing structures, but this conversely increases system-memory traffic. This paper introduces the basis of cognitive reconfigurable hardware and presents the design of an FPGA-based RTR SoC that becomes conscious of its monitored hardware and learns to make decisions that maintain a desired system performance, particularly when triggering hardware acceleration and dynamic fault-tolerant (FT) schemes on RTR cores. Self-awareness is achieved by evaluating monitored metrics in critical AXI-cores, supported by hardware performance counters. We suggest a reinforcement-learning algorithm that helps the system to search out when and which reconfigurable FT-scheme can be triggered.

It can be used for plan view control to calculate the length of head cut precisely. With the continuous development of digital image processing technology, edge detection methods are used for object recognition and image analysis. However, in order to adapt to different light conditions, the parameters of edge detectors need to be adjusted frequently. Besides, edge detection methods cannot guarantee the continuity of the segmented region in the steel head shape recognition problem. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to identify the steel head shape. By using the proposed algorithm and a set of training images, an optimal model is obtained. With this model, new steel images can be processed, and the recognition of steel head shape is achieved.

We used the MEG responses recorded from subjects listening to acoustically different environmental sounds. By decoding the stimulus frequencies from the responses, our model was able to accurately distinguish between two different sounds that it had never encountered before with 70% accuracy. Convolution models typically decode frequencies that appear at a certain time point in the sound signal by using neural responses from that time point until a certain fixed duration of the response. Using our model, we evaluated several fixed durations (time-lags) of the neural responses and observed auditory MEG responses to be most sensitive to spectral content of the sounds at time-lags of 250 ms to 500 ms.

We collect a new RGBD corpus characteristic of a therapy environment and report accuracy of the framework in classifying a task possibility, given a set of objects. Further, we implement the proposed framework on the ADLER robot and test for a Reach task.","1945-7898;19457898","Electronic:978-1-4799-1808-9; POD:978-1-4799-1809-6; USB:978-1-4799-1807-2","10.1109/ICORR.2015.7281276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281276","Machine Learning;Perception;Robot-assisted therapy","Computational modeling;Image edge detection;Mathematical model;Medical treatment;Robots;Trajectory;Visualization","feature selection;medical robotics;object recognition;patient rehabilitation;patient treatment;trajectory control","ADLER robot;RGBD corpus characteristic;dynamic object positioning;object recognition;robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation;robot-assisted task-oriented therapy;task selection;trajectory planning","","","","22","","","11-14 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As students have limited sessions with Quran teachers, they resort to Computer Aided Learning (CAL) methods to further enhance their quality of recitations. Unfortunately existing applications that aid in CAL don't provide any feedback mechanisms in terms of ratings/scores about the quality of recitations to end users. The benefits of such feedback mechanisms are quite vital to learners of Holy Quran to improve their learning process stage by stage. Till date, the problem of automating evaluation of Holy Quran recitations using computational techniques remains as a open challenge to researchers.

In order to reduce the footprint of operations, DexROV proposes to implement and evaluate novel operation paradigms with safer, more cost effective and time efficient ROV operations. As a keystone of the proposed approach, manned support will in a large extent be delocalized within an onshore ROV control center, possibly at a large distance from the actual operations, relying on satellite communications. The proposed scheme also makes provision for advanced dexterous manipulation and semi-autonomous capabilities, leveraging human expertise when deemed useful.

We propose a novel online ensemble learning algorithm to update the aggregation rule in order to adapt to the underlying data dynamics. We rigorously determine an upper bound for the worst-case mis-classification probability of our algorithm, which tends asymptotically to 0 if the misclassification probability of the best (unknown) static aggregation rule is 0.

"Self-Organizing Map-Based Feature Visualization and Selection for Defect Depth Estimation in Oil and Gas Pipelines","A. Mohamed; M. S. Hamdi; S. Tahar","Inf. Syst. Dept., Ahmed Bin Mohammed Mil.

As a preprocessing step, MFL data are often reduced into a representative feature set that is capable of accurately estimating pipeline defect depths. However, this estimation capability may vary depending on the features used, which necessitates the need for selecting the most relevant ones. In this paper, self-organizing maps (SOMs) are used as feature visualization tool for the purpose of selecting the most appropriate features. First, a self-organizing map (SOM), i.e., A two-dimensional discretized representation of the input space of the training samples for the features, is produced. The SOM weights for each individual input feature (weight plane) are displayed then visually analyzed. Irrelevant and redundant features can be efficiently spotted and removed. The remaining ""good"" features (i.e., Selected features) are then used as an input to a feed forward neural network for defect depth estimation. Experimental work has shown the effectiveness of the proposed approach. For instance, within Â±5% error-tolerance range, the obtained estimation accuracy, using the SOM-based feature selection, is 93.1%, compared to 74% when all input features are used (i.e., No feature selection is performed), and within Â±10% error-tolerance range, the obtained estimation accuracy, using the SOM-based feature selection, is 97.5%, compared to 86% when all the input features are used (i.e., No feature selection is performed).","1550-6037;15506037","Electronic:978-1-4673-7568-9; POD:978-1-4673-7569-6","10.1109/iV.2015.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7272608","data visualization;feature selection;machine learning;neural networks;self-organizing map","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Estimation;Feature extraction;Magnetic flux leakage;Neurons;Pipelines","data visualisation;feature selection;feedforward neural nets;magnetic leakage;mechanical engineering computing;pipelines;pipes","MFL sensors;SOM-based feature selection;defect detection;feature visualization tool;feed forward neural network;gas pipeline;magnetic flux leakage sensors;oil pipeline;pipeline defect depth estimation;self-organizing map","","1","","30","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It is a very broad activity and includes almost everything that is done to change the software if required, to keep it operational after its delivery at the customer's end. A lot of maintenance effort is required to change the software after it is in operation. Therefore, predicting the effort and cost associated with the maintenance activities such as correcting and fixing the defects has become one of the key issues that need to be analyzed for effective resource allocation and decision-making. In view of this issue, we have developed a model based on text mining techniques using the statistical method namely, Multi-nominal Multivariate Logistic Regression (MMLR). We apply text mining techniques to identify the relevant attributes from defect reports and relate these relevant attributes to software maintenance effort prediction. The proposed model is validated using `Camera' application package of Android Operating System. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis is done to interpret the results obtained from model prediction by using the value of Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity and a suitable threshold criterion known as the cut-off point. It is evident from the results that the performance of the model is dependent on the number of words considered for classification and therefore shows the best results with respect to top-100 words. The performance is irrespective of the type of effort category.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8792-4; POD:978-1-4799-8793-1; USB:978-1-4799-8791-7","10.1109/ICACCI.2015.7275620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275620","Defect reports;Machine Learning;Receiver Operating Characteristics;Software Maintenance Effort Prediction;Text mining","Feature extraction;Logistics;Predictive models;Software maintenance;Testing;Text mining","Android (operating system);data mining;decision making;logistics;regression analysis;sensitivity analysis;software maintenance","AUC;Android operating system;MMLR;ROC analysis;area under the curve;cost association;decision making;defect reports mining;multinominal multivariate logistic regression;receiver operating characteristics;software development lifecycle;software maintenance;text mining","","","","35","","","10-13 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To take full advantage of these resources requires a simple, direct and effective access to those resources that are of interest, therefore, it is necessary that those resources are ordered or ranked based on some criteria?-that is to say, they have to be classified. Classification is usually done manually by the resource provider, which directly implies a main problem: the time spent categorising resources. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem through the design and implementation of a multi-label classifier that enables the automatic classification of a set of educational resources in their most suitable category or categories, thus eliminating the need to manually perform this classification. Evaluation results show that the performance of the OER classifier is comparable to classification of a de-facto standard corpus: OHSUMED.","2161-3761;21613761","Electronic:978-1-4673-7334-0; POD:978-1-4673-7335-7","10.1109/ICALT.2015.55","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7265364","Machine Learning;Multi-label classification;Open Educational Resources","Algorithm design and analysis;Classification algorithms;Conferences;Measurement;Standards;Support vector machines;Training","educational administrative data processing;pattern classification","OER classifier;educational community;multilabel classification;online repositories;open educational resources","","","","15","","","6-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The Web is undoubtedly the best tool for sharing content, especially through social networks. One of the most useful information that can be extracted is the geographical one. Current navigation systems lack in several ways to satisfy the need to process and reason upon such volumes of data, namely, to accurately provide information about urban traffic in real-time and the possibility to personalize the information used by such systems. This paper describes an approach to integrate and fuse tweet messages from traffic agencies in UK, with the objective of detecting the geographical focus of traffic events. Tweet messages are considered in this work given its uniqueness, the real time nature of tweets which may be used to quickly detect a traffic event and its simplicity; it only cost 140 characters to generate a message (called âtweetâ) for any user. The approach presented here is composed by several steps: tweet classification, event type classification, name entity recognition, geolocation and event tracking. Finally, we do an experimental study on a real dataset composed by traffic related tweet messages to access the accuracy of proposed approach. We present some inaccuracies ranging from lack of geographical information, imprecise and ambiguous toponyms, overlaps and repetitions as well as visualization to our data set in UK. We finally give an outlook into potential corrections. The work presented here is still part of on-going work.

However in many domains, like Chess, expert feedback is amply available in the form of annotated games. This feedback usually comes in the form of qualitative information because human annotators find it hard to determine precise utility values for game states. The goal of this work is to investigate inasmuch it is possible to leverage this qualitative feedback for learning an evaluation function for the game. To this end, we show how the game annotations can be translated into preference statements over moves and game states, which in turn can be used for learning a utility function that respects these preference constraints. We evaluate the resulting function by creating multiple heuristics based upon different sized subsets of the training data and compare them in a tournament scenario. The results showed that learning from game annotations is possible, but, on the other hand, our learned functions did not quite reach the performance of the original, manually tuned function of the Chess program. The reason for this failure seems to lie in the fact that human annotators only annotate âinterestingâ positions, so that it is hard to learn basic information, such as material advantage from game annotations alone.","1943-068X;1943068X","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2332442","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6861960","Computer Chess;machine learning in games;preference learning","Computers;Databases;Engines;Games;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines;Time factors","","","","0","","52","","20140722","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The use of face recognition techniques has unique advantages when compared to other biometric methodologies - face images can be obtained from a distance and without the cooperation of the subject. A recent example demonstrating the growing need for such solution are the videos released by some terrorist organizations where the suspect's face is occluded with only the eyes being visible. Research has yielded several state-of-the-art algorithms but their accuracy is greatly lowered in the presence of various factors. Face recogition with arbitrary large face off-the-plane rotation remains one very challenging and open research problem. In order to build better face recognition algorithms, it is important to identify and analyze what and how factors affect the accuracy of said algorithms so these methods can be improved and made more robust. In our previous work we presented how factors such as image registration, number and type of training templates and the presence of varying amount of partial face information that can be used to improve the performance of three very popular widely used face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we examine how using multi-channel color images instead of their one-channel grayscale/color composite improves face recognition accuracy in the challenging case when face arbitrary large off-the-plane rotation is present. We demonstrate the improvement to face recognition accuracy through the very popular and widely used Eigenface-based, Fisherface-based and Direct Correlation-based algorithms. Our findings and experimental results with the data, show that when using frontal-facing images as external test images with frontal-facing images as training set images, the additional information contained in the multi-channel color images doe- not improve the composite gray-scale face recogntition accuracy. However, in the case where the algorithms are trained using only images with slight or considerable off-the-plane rotation, and externally tested either on frontal-facing images or images with arbitrary off-the-plane rotation, the information provided by the multi-channel color images boosts the face recognition accuracy for all three recognition algorithms.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1737-2; POD:978-1-4799-1738-9","10.1109/THS.2015.7225314","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7225314","Biometrics;Computational Intelligence;Computer and Machine Vision;Correlation-based Face Recognition;Digital Image Processing;Eigenfaces;Face Recognition;Fisher-faces;Machine Learning","Accuracy;Color;Face;Face recognition;Gray-scale;Image color analysis;Training","face recognition;image colour analysis;image registration;national security","Eigenface-based algorithms;Fisherface-based algorithms;arbitrary large off-the-plane rotations;biometric methodologies;composite gray-scale face recognition;direct correlation-based algorithms;frontal-facing images;homeland security applications;image registration;noncomposite multichannel raw color images","","3","","33","","","14-16 April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This is being achieved by creating links between distributed data sources using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). In order to find information in this web of interconnected sources, complex query languages are often employed, e.g. SPARQL. However, this approach is limited as exact query matches are often required. In order to overcome this challenge, this paper presents a probabilistic approach to searching RDF documents.

It consists of an environment which demonstrates an OSN and each agent inside the model represents a user in OSN. In order to simulate the identification of important users, understanding the way that OSN users estimate important users is essential because the determination task in the model has to been simulate with this strategy.

Eng., Univ. of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada","IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management","20150904","2015","12","3","320","333","Web services have increasingly begun to rely on public cloud platforms. The virtualization technologies employed by public clouds can, however, trigger contention between virtual machines (VMs) for shared physical machine resources, thereby leading to performance problems for Web services. Past studies have exploited physical-machine-level performance metrics such as clock cycles per instruction to detect such platform-induced performance interference. Unfortunately, public cloud customers do not have access to such metrics. They can only typically access VM-level metrics and application-level metrics such as transaction response times, and such metrics alone are often not useful for detecting inter-VM contention. This poses a difficult challenge to Web service operators for detecting and mitigating platform-induced performance interference issues inside the cloud. We propose a machine-learning-based interference detection technique to address this problem. The technique applies collaborative filtering to predict whether a given transaction being processed by a Web service is adversely suffering from interference. The results can be then used by a management controller to trigger remedial actions, e.g., reporting problems to the system manager or switching cloud providers. Results using a realistic Web benchmark show that the approach is effective. The most effective variant of our approach is able to detect about 96% of performance interference events with almost no false alarms. Furthermore, we show that a load redistribution technique that exploits the information from our detection technique is able to more effectively mitigate the interference than techniques that are interference agnostic.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2015.2456172","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7156122","Cloud computing;machine learning;software performance;virtualization","Cloud computing;Estimation;Interference;Measurement;Monitoring;Time factors","Web services;cloud computing;collaborative filtering;learning (artificial intelligence);virtual machines;virtualisation","VM;VM-level metrics;application-level metrics;cloud-based Web services;collaborative filtering;machine learning based interference detection technique;performance interference management;physical-machine-level performance metrics;platform-induced performance interference;virtual machines;virtualization technology","","0","","43","","20150714","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Additionally, data from the ocean (WAM model) and atmospheric components of the ERA-Interim reanalysis of the ECMWF have also been used.

The complexity of a learning machine may be measured by the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension, and a small VC dimension leads to good generalization and lower test set errors. The Minimal Complexity Machine (MCM), that has been proposed very recently, shows that it is possible to learn a classifier with minimal VC dimension, leading to sparse representations and good generalization. In this paper, we draw on results from the MCM to propose a hybrid variant of the ELM, termed the Minimal Complexity - Extreme Learning Machine (MC-ELM), in order to realize a robust classifier that minimizes an exact bound on the VC dimension. The MC-ELM solves a linear programming problem for the last layer and offers the advantages of large margin and low VC dimension. In effect, the learning paradigm elucidated in this paper helps us build a classifier which is based on a minimal representation of the training data owing to MCM, and high training speed attributed to ELM. This makes it feasible for use in complex machine learning applications, where these advantages are of significance.","2161-4393;21614393","Electronic:978-1-4799-1960-4; POD:978-1-4799-1961-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280663","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280663","Extreme Learning Machine;Hybrid Models;Linear Programming;Minimal Complexity Machine;Performance Bounds;Support Vectors;VC Dimension","Complexity theory;Ionosphere;Neurons;Training","generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;pattern classification","ELM-like network learning;MC-ELM;Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension;classifier learning;complex machine learning applications;generalization;hybrid ELM;linear programming problem;minimal complexity machine;minimal complexity-extreme learning machine;minimum VC dimension;robust classifier;sparse representation;test set errors;training data;training speed","","","","40","","","12-17 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The initial estimate's accuracy is also vital in attaining convergence. In this paper, a new real time solution to the model identification problem is provided with the use of a Joint Unscented Kalman Filter for dual estimation.

Computer-aided diagnostic approaches based on thermography are typically split into a feature extraction stage that derives useful information from the thermogram images, and a classification stage that distinguishes between malignant and benign cases. The latter is challenging since, as is the case for many medical decision making problems, there are (many) more benign cases available for classifier training compared to malignant cases, leading to an imbalanced classification problem. In this paper, we first perform image analysis to identify features describing bilateral differences in regions of interest in the thermogram. These features then form the input for a pattern classification stage for which we present several strategies to address the existing class imbalance in the context of ensemble classifiers. In particular, we discuss an ensemble constructed of cost-sensitive decision tree classifiers, an ensemble whose base classifiers are trained on balanced subspaces, and an ensemble that is based on the combination of one-class classifiers. All three strategies are evaluated on a challenging dataset of about 150 thermograms and it is shown that they provide very good classification performance and furthermore perform favourably compared to other state-of-the-art classifier ensembles for imbalanced data.","1089-778X;1089778X","Electronic:978-1-4799-7492-4; POD:978-1-4799-7493-1","10.1109/CEC.2015.7257177","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7257177","breast cancer;breast thermogram;ensemble classification;imbalanced classification;machine learning","Breast cancer;Feature extraction;Sensitivity;Support vector machines;Training","CAD;cancer;decision making;infrared imaging;medical diagnostic computing","CAD;balanced subspaces;base classifiers;benign cases;computer-aided diagnostic approaches;ensemble classification;imbalanced classification problem;malignant cases;medical decision making problems;non-invasive technique;noncontact technique;one-class classifiers;passive technique;thermogram images;thermography breast cancer features","","","","36","","","25-28 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This has already proven to have applications in successfully forecasting behavior, techniques which are only likely to improve. To the extent that the science can move beyond a correlative understanding of the data to a causal understanding of the factors affecting behavior, it will allow new means for (perhaps covertly and deniably) influencing behavior, possibly through long causal chains that could conceal the influence of the manipulator.

This gland actively produces two kinds of hormone, namely thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). These hormones aim to produce protein, govern body metabolism, as well as to control body temperature circulation. Either excess or lack of these hormones will disturb those activities. The condition of excessive hormones is called hyperthyroid while the condition of lacking hormones is called hypothyroid. The major factor that influences the volume of the produced T3 and T4 hormones is iodine, because it is the main building-block substance of those hormones. The imbalance condition of this substance prevents thyroid to work properly. To identify the type of thyroid (normal, hypothyroid, hyperthyroid), WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) machine learning software is utilized. The thyroid dataset is taken from UCI (University of California - Irvine) machine learning repository as many as 215 instances. The test result shows that among six different methods available in WEKA, MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) method gives result with the highest accuracy, up to 96.74%, while BPA (Back Propagation Algorithm) methods produces result with the lowest accuracy, of 69.77%.","","DVD:978-1-4799-7709-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-7711-6; POD:978-1-4799-7712-3","10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7219959","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7219959","ANN methods comparison;UCI machine learning repository;WEKA;thyroid type","Accuracy;Artificial neural networks;Biochemistry;Computer architecture;Diseases;Glands;Training","backpropagation;diseases;medical diagnostic computing;multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification","BPA;MLP method;T3 hormones;T4 hormones;UCI machine learning repository;University of California-Irvine;WEKA machine learning software;Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis;backpropagation algorithm;classification methods;endocrine glands;hyperthyroid;hypothyroid;iodine;multilayer perceptron method;thyroid disease diagnosis;thyroid gland;thyroid hormone;thyroxine;triiodothyronine","","0","","14","","","20-21 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

DNS (Domain Naming System) traffic time series is considered that contains tagged DNS Denial of Service attacks. The first step of the analysis involves transforming the DNS time series into a multifractal variance dimension trajectory keeping statistical stationarity of data intact. Then features of the trajectory are extracted to remove high variability noise. The extracted set of features indicates the presence of an attack when the denoised trajectory shows increasing variance fractal dimension. This technique is superior in finding changing patterns of a data series due to the presence of noise and denial of service attack because it is not dependent on integer dimensions and mono-scale measurement of variations in data series. Moreover, this technique provides adaptive and locally stationary windows in a highly non stationary data series.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7289-3; Electronic:978-1-4673-7290-9; POD:978-1-4673-7291-6","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2015.7259368","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7259368","Adaptive Sliding Window;Anomaly Detection;Change Detection;Chaos;Cognitive Machine Learning;Cyber threats;DDoS Amplification;DNS;Data traffic;Fractal;Haar function;Internet;Multifractal;Non Sationary;Time Series Analysis;Trend Analysis;Variance Fractal Dimension;Wavelet","Discrete Fourier transforms;Wavelet transforms","Internet;computer network security;feature extraction;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;time series","Internet traffic time series;adaptive sliding window;cognitive multifractal approach;denial of service attacks;domain naming system;feature extraction model;integer dimensions;locally stationary windows;malicious DNS data traffic;monoscale measurement;multifractal variance dimension trajectory;nonstationary data series;nonstationary data traffic;scaling trajectory;statistical stationarity","","","","32","","","6-8 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Predicted generalization accuracy of the best configurations are checked by carrying out deep learning computation. Since generalization performance for a practical recognition task is always data- and code-dependent, we tried out our method on an open deep learning platform named Caffe, and we increased the generalization accuracy from 98.97% to around 99.25% on MNIST by replacing only five numbers.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-1948-2; POD:978-1-4799-1949-9; USB:978-1-4799-1947-5","10.1109/ChinaSIP.2015.7230511","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7230511","Architecture hyperparameter search;artificial neural network;convolutional neural network;deep learning;machine learning","Accuracy;Computer architecture;Convolutional codes;Machine learning;Neural networks;Noise;Tensile stress","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;tensors","Caffe open deep learning platform;MNIST;deep architecture learning;deep convolutional neural network;hyperparameter search;tensor completion method","","1","","12","","","12-15 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the domain of automatic web page classifier many approaches have been tried to solve this problem using different Machine learning-based algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), NaiÌve Bayes, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) and Neural Networks. However, there is a lack of comparison between these algorithms to find a better framework for the classification and analysis of health related web pages. In this research study, we compare two commonly used supervised Machine Learning algorithms; Support Vector Machines (SVM) and NaiÌve Bayes to classify web pages which provide drugs related information of patients for example side effects, patient action and follow-up information for patients. We use Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to annotate the health related concepts in Web pages and train SVM and NaiÌve Bayes classifiers in General Architecture for Text Engineering to classify health related and non-health related Web pages. The evaluation was performed using K-fold cross validation using four runs on a data set of fifty Web pages.

A new algorithm is thus derived in this paper to address this limitation. The optimal control law is found by solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the associated value function via synchronous policy iteration in a critic-actor configuration. As a major contribution, a new form of NN approximation for the value function is proposed, offering the closed-loop system asymptotic stability without additional tuning scheme or logic switch mechanism.

The predicted use cases are many and varied, and include navigation, planning, advertising and communication. Potentially, indoor tracking could become as ubiquitous as GPS - however, all of these possibilities depend on being able to produce a reasonably accurate, reliable system which does not require specialised infrastructure. While professional systems using custom devices are able to achieve very high levels of accuracy (<;1 cm), consumer no-infrastructure systems struggle to achieve reliable room-level tracking. This paper focuses on the use of WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting, a machine learning approach which currently seems to be the most promising option for consumer smartphones. We have undertaken experimentation and optimisation in a real-world, noisy environment - the Ian Potter Museum of Art - where we developed and deployed a no-infrastructure, indoor visitor tracking application. Data was collected in a trial involving several dozen users over a few weeks, who used the system extensively. This data was analysed with a range of current WiFi RSSI fingerprinting techniques and algorithms (WASP, Redpin (kNN), SSD, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forests), and their efficacy was compared and improved where possible. Known challenges such as device heterogeneity are explored, and the consistency of signal levels, including magnetic fields, are examined. Large Random Forests (200 trees) were found to have the best performance, which was further improved by calibrating for average differences in RSSI between phone models, to achieve an average of 90% correct classification of exhibits within the top five hits.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8054-6; POD:978-1-4673-8055-3","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275486","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275486","fingerprinting;machine learning;optimisation;wifi","Base stations;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Indoor navigation;Reliability;Support vector machines;Wireless communication","Global Positioning System;fingerprint identification;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence)","GPS;Gaussian Naive Bayes;Ian Potter Museum of Art;RSSI;Redpin;SSD;SVM;WASP;WiFi;advertising;communication;indoor location recognition;indoor tracking;machine learning;navigation;planning;received signal strength indicator;smartphones adds context;wireless fingerprinting","","3","","14","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This estimation challenge can be tackled by imposing sparse solutions. However, the sensitivity of sparse estimators to correlated variables leads to non-reproducible results, and only a subset of the important variables are selected. In this paper, we explore an approach based on bagging clustering-based data compression in order to alleviate the instability of sparse models. Specifically, we design a new framework in which the estimator is built by averaging multiple models estimated after feature clustering, to improve the conditioning of the model. We show that this combination of model averaging with spatially consistent compression can have the virtuous effect of increasing the stability of the weight maps, allowing a better interpretation of the results.

Simple time series' feature representation schemes like RFM can provide reasonable predictive models solely based on online game players' login records, but maybe without fully exploring the predictive potential of these data. We propose a frequency analysis approach for feature representation from login records for churn prediction modeling. These entries (from real data) were converted into fixed-length data arrays using four different methods, and then these were used as input for training probabilistic classifiers with the k-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm. The classifiers were then evaluated and compared using predictive performance metrics.

Metagenomics is the study of microorganisms collected directly from natural environments using whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. Metagenomics methods allow sequencing of organism genomes which cannot be cultured in a laboratory. Grouping random fragments obtained from whole shotgun genome data into groups is known as binning. Metagenomics methods allow quick sequencing of microbes obtained from natural disaster sites to identify microbes and provide rapid and timely response, in terms, for examples, for rapid environment cleanup/restoration, rapid quarantine of objects/animals/humans, recovery, etc. In this paper we propose machine learning related predictive DNA sequence feature selection algorithms to solve binning problems in more accurate and efficient ways. Here we use sub-sequences blocks extracted from organism protein domains as features. We analyze and compare binning prediction results obtained by using k-mers, by using codons, and by using sub-sequences blocks derived from conserved protein domains. We show here, that sub-sequences blocks derived from conserved protein domains give better prediction accuracy than k-mers or codons. We also showed comparative analysis of binning predictive models using NaiÌve Bayes Classifier and Random Forest Classifier with feature set derived from conserved protein domain.

The proposed algorithm runs in two phases where in the first phase a set of prototypes of original dataset are derived by scanning the entire dataset once.

As market forces move increasingly towards Internet and VoIP communications, there is proportional increase in telephony denial of service (TDoS) attacks. Like denial of service (DoS) attacks, TDoS attacks seek to disrupt business and commerce by directing a flood of anomalous traffic towards key communication servers. In this work, we focus on a new class of anomalous traffic that exhibits a mimicry TDoS attack. Such an attack can be launched by crafting malformed messages with small changes from normal ones. We show that such malicious messages easily bypass intrusion detection systems (IDS) and degrade the goodput of the server drastically by forcing it to parse the message looking for the needed token. Our approach is not to parse at all; instead, we use multiple classifier systems (MCS) to exploit the strength of multiple learners to predict the true class of a message with high probability (98.50% â¤ p â¤ 99.12%). We proceed systematically by first formulating an optimization problem of picking the minimum number of classifiers such that their combination yields the optimal classification performance. Next, we analytically bound the maximum performance of such a system and empirically demonstrate that it is possible to attain close to the maximum theoretical performance across varied datasets. Finally, guided by our analysis we construct an MCS appliance that demonstrates superior classification accuracy with O(1) runtime complexity across varied datasets.","1932-4537;19324537","","10.1109/TNSM.2015.2459603","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163619","SIP;anomaly;classification;machine learning;mimicry attacks;multiple classifier systems","Computer crime;Degradation;Electronic mail;Grammar;Internet;Protocols;Servers","Internet telephony;computational complexity;computer network security;optimisation;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","IDS;Internet communications infrastructure;MCS;MCS appliance;US economic growth;US national academies of science board;VoIP;anomalous traffic;communication servers;intrusion detection systems;mimicry TDoS attack;mimicry attacks mitigation;multiple classifier systems;optimization problem;runtime complexity;session initiation protocol;telephony denial of service attacks;voice-over-IP communications infrastructure","","0","","48","","20150721","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Fundamental elements of the basis known as âatomsâ allow us to define âatomic normsâ that can be used to formulate convex regularizations for the reconstruction problem. Efficient algorithms are available to solve these formulations in certain special cases, but an approach that works well for general atomic norms, both in terms of speed and reconstruction accuracy, remains to be found. This paper describes an optimization algorithm called CoGEnT that produces solutions with succinct atomic representations for reconstruction problems, generally formulated with atomic-norm constraints. CoGEnT combines a greedy selection scheme based on the conditional gradient approach with a backward (or âtruncationâ) step that exploits the quadratic nature of the objective to reduce the basis size. We establish convergence properties and validate the algorithm via extensive numerical experiments on a suite of signal processing applications. Our algorithm and analysis also allow for inexact forward steps and for occasional enhancements of the current representation to be performed. CoGEnT can outperform the basic conditional gradient method, and indeed many methods that are tailored to specific applications, when the enhancement and truncation steps are defined appropriately. We also introduce several novel applications that are enabled by the atomic-norm framework, including tensor completion, moment problems in signal processing, and graph deconvolution.","1053-587X;1053587X","","10.1109/TSP.2015.2461515","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7169598","Greedy algorithms;machine learning","Atomic measurements;Convergence;Image reconstruction;Optimization;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Tensile stress","gradient methods;greedy algorithms;optimisation;signal reconstruction;signal representation","CoGEnT;atomic norm regularization;atomic representations;conditional gradient approach;convex regularization;forward-backward greedy algorithm;greedy selection scheme;optimization algorithm;signal processing application;signal processing applications;signal reconstruction;signal representation;truncation steps","","0","","60","","20150728","Nov.1, 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

However, existing learning environments are not fully inclusive, particularly for those with multiple disabilities. Most learning environments built for students with disabilities limit themselves to meeting the needs of specific disabilities and do not attempt to scale up to the difficulties of designing for those with multiple disabilities. This paper seeks to address how virtual learning environments (VLEs) can be designed to include the needs of learners with multiple disabilities. Specifically, it employs AI to show how specific learning materials from a huge repository of learning materials can be recommended to learners with various disabilities. This is made possible through employing semantic web technology to model the learner and their needs. Three techniques are discussed to combine requirements. Simple logical operators, knowledge based rules, and machine learning based rule induction are combined in this integrated approach. It is hoped that developers of e-learning systems will be encouraged from this approach to design fully inclusive virtual learning environments.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8547-0; POD:978-1-4799-8548-7; USB:978-1-4799-8546-3","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237128","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237128","AI Agency;adaptation;e-learning;inclusion;machine learning;multiple disabilities;ontologies;personalization","Assistive technology;Auditory system;Electronic learning;Ontologies;Semantic Web;Visualization","Internet;computer aided instruction;further education;handicapped aids;knowledge based systems;learning (artificial intelligence);student experiments","AI;VLE;Web-based higher education;e-learning systems;knowledge based rules;learning materials;machine learning;multiple disabilities;rule induction;students;virtual learning environments","","2","","31","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Europe is presenting a geometrically growing interest in exploring and investing in such offshore power plants as the continent's water sites offer impressive wind conditions. Moreover, as human activities tend to complicate the construction of land wind farms, offshore locations, which can be found more easily near densely populated areas, can be seen as an attractive choice. However, the cost of an offshore wind farm is relatively high, and therefore, their reliability is crucial if they ever need to be fully integrated into the energy arena. This paper presents an analysis of supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) extracts from the Lillgrund offshore wind farm for the purposes of monitoring. An advanced and robust machine-learning approach is applied, in order to produce individual and population-based power curves and then predict measurements of the power produced from each wind turbine (WT) from the measurements of the other WTs in the farm. Control charts with robust thresholds calculated from extreme value statistics are successfully applied for the monitoring of the turbines.","0278-0046;02780046","","10.1109/TIE.2015.2442212","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7118737","Machine learning;Offshore wind farm;SCADA;machine learning;offshore wind farm;pattern recognition;supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA);wind turbine (WT) monitoring;wind turbine monitoring","Gaussian processes;Monitoring;Testing;Training;Wind farms;Wind turbines","SCADA systems;computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;control charts;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;power measurement;wind power plants;wind turbines","Lillgrund offshore wind farm;SCADA;control chart;extreme value statistics;performance monitoring approach;population-based power curve;power measurement;robust machine learning approach;supervisory control and data acquisition;wind turbine monitoring","","2","","51","","20150605","Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Results showed the use of STM classification provided diagnostic accuracy of 89.2%, sensitivity of 71.8% and specificity of 90.1%.

The open problems are that recent techniques are still unable to work well in different domain; sentiment classification based on insufficient labeled data is still a challenging problem; there is lack of SA research in languages other than English; and existing techniques are still unable to deal with complex sentences that requires more than sentiment words and simple parsing.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8547-0; POD:978-1-4799-8548-7; USB:978-1-4799-8546-3","10.1109/SAI.2015.7237157","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7237157","Lexicon-based approaches;machine learning approaches;sentiment analysis","Analytical models;Data mining;Semisupervised learning;Sentiment analysis;Supervised learning;Support vector machines;Unsupervised learning","learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;text analysis","Lexicon-based technique;aspect extraction;aspect-based sentiment analysis;complex sentences;document level analysis;hybrid technique;machine learning-based techniques;opinion labeling;phrase level analysis;semisupervised learning technique;sentence level analysis;sentiment analysis technique;sentiment classification;sentiment words;simple parsing;unsupervised learning;writer opinion","","2","","43","","","28-30 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The best subset contains the minimum number of dimensions retaining a suitably high accuracy on classifier in representing the original features. The objective of the proposed approach is to reduce the number of input features thus to identify the key features and eliminating irrelevant features with no predictive information using clustering technique, K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and rough set. This paper deals with two partition based clustering algorithm in data mining namely K-Means and Fuzzy C Means (FCM). These two algorithms are implemented for original data set without considering the class labels and further rough set theory implemented on the partitioned data set to generate feature subset after removing the outlier by using KNN. Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets derived from UCI machine learning database are used for the purpose of testing the proposed hybrid method. The results show that the hybrid method is able to produce more accurate diagnosis and prognosis results than the full input model with respect to the classification accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3975-6; POD:978-1-4799-3976-3","10.1109/ICCIC.2014.7238376","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7238376","classification;fcm;feature selection;k-means;machine learning;outlier detection","Accuracy;Algorithm design and analysis;Breast cancer;Classification algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Data mining;Partitioning algorithms","data mining;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);rough set theory","FCM;KNN;UCI machine learning database;Wisconsin breast cancer datasets;clustering techniques;data mining;enhanced feature selection method;fuzzy c means;k-nearest neighbors;rough set theory","","0","","20","","","18-20 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Much research in this filed concerns development of bespoke systems, in which sound tracks are exclusively classified and segmented, and a specific type of sound is recognized and analyzed. This approach however is detrimental to the complete extraction of all relevant semantic information and audio scene analysis. The current study addresses the issues of sound tracks with overlapped music, speech and ambient sounds, and explores how MARSYAS (Music Analysis, Retrieval and Synthesis for Audio Signals) can be extended to mixed and overlapped soundtrack applications. The MARSYAS has been adapted to this application by means of adopting additional speech cleaning algorithms. The proposed new system can analyze arbitrary sound tracks and timestamp the occurrence of music and speech, allowing overlaps, in the form of a âsound scoreâ for further recognition methods to extract music score and text information. Validation tests have shown that the new system handles overlapping cases and is therefore capable of extracting more information than other existing methods.","1935-4576;19354576","Electronic:978-1-4799-6649-3; POD:978-1-4799-6650-9; USB:978-1-4799-6648-6","10.1109/INDIN.2015.7281886","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281886","Audio information retrieval;classification;feature extraction;machine learning;non-exclusive classification;segmentation;semantic audio","Multiple signal classification;Music;Noise;Semantics;Speech;Speech enhancement;Speech recognition","audio signal processing;information retrieval;music;speech processing;speech recognition","MARSYAS framework;Music Analysis-Retrieval-and-Synthesis for Audio Signals;mixed soundtracks;music score extraction;recognition methods;semantic information extraction;sound score;speech cleaning algorithms;text information extraction;timestamp","","","","23","","","22-24 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed time-delayed CoRe technique exploits the distributed nature of multiphase switched capacitor voltage converters where half of the converter stages are delayed to eliminate the risk of having zero power trace entropy (PTE) under machine learning based DPA attacks. A high PTE value is maintained (above 3.2 for a 64-phase time-delayed CoRe technique) regardless of the phase difference between the attacker's sampling rate and the operating frequency. In addition, the minimum PTE value of the proposed time-delayed CoRe technique is enhanced from zero to ~ 3 by inserting a certain time-delay to half of the converter stages.","1943-0663;19430663","","10.1109/LES.2015.2433175","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7106483","Machine learning-based DPA attacks;multiphase switched capacitor;power trace entropy;time-delayed","Delay effects;Entropy;Monitoring;Regulators;Switches;Switching frequency;Synchronization","capacitors;learning (artificial intelligence);power engineering computing;switching convertors;synchronisation","CoRe technique;PTE;machine learning based DPA attacks;machine learning based differential power analysis attacks;multiphase switched capacitor voltage converters;operating frequency;power delivery architecture;power trace entropy;sampling frequency synchronization;time-delayed converter-reshuffling technique","","2","","9","","20150513","Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We previously proposed a method of timeliness identification of application, which can achieve to use first several packets of flow to identify applications with high accuracy whatever the traffic is encrypted or unencrypted. However, our previous method still has a challenge in terms of timeliness because it uses a single classifier with same traffic features to identify all applications, though some traffic features can be used earlier. In this paper, we propose a method of multistage application identification, which classifies progressively applications into groups with different granularity of groups. We first demonstrate that the accuracy of existing application identification is getting worse significantly, by increasing the number of application to identify. Second, propose a method of multistage identification method, and then explain group classification algorithm to classify applications into groups.

We show that an algorithm's score depends on final task. Thus to properly evaluate an algorithm and to determine its suitability, precise score value obtained on well formulated tasks can be used only. When an algorithm suitability is well known, the algorithm can be efficiently used for a task by applying it in the most favorable environmental conditions determined during the evaluation. However, high quality algorithm selection is possible only if each algorithm suitability is well known because only then the algorithm selection result can improve the best possible result given by a single algorithm. The task dependent evaluation is demonstrated on segmentation and object recognition. Additionally, we also discuss the importance of high level symbolic knowledge in the selection process. The importance of this symbolic hypothesis is demonstrated on a set of learning experiments with both a Bayesian Network and SVM. We show that task dependent evaluation is required to allow efficient algorithm selection. Also by studying symbolic preference of algorithms for semantic segmentation we show that algorithm selection accuracy can be improved by 10 to 15%.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7186-5; POD:978-1-4673-7187-2; USB:978-1-4673-7185-8","10.1109/DT.2015.7222974","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7222974","Algorithm Selection;Machine Learning;Semantic Segmentation","Algorithm design and analysis;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Machine learning algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Semantics;Software algorithms","belief networks;computer vision;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;support vector machines","Bayesian network;SVM;algorithm selection approach;computer vision;high quality algorithm selection;high-level information feedback;learning experiments;object recognition;semantic segmentation;symbolic hypothesis","","0","","22","","","7-9 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The improving effectiveness of machine learning approaches is being given a lot of importance by medical practitioners for breast cancer diagnosis. The paper proposes an effective hybridized classifier for breast cancer diagnosis. The classifier is made by combining an unsupervised artificial neural network (ANN) method named self organizing maps (SOM) with a supervised classifier called stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Also a comparative analysis is performed between the proposed approach and three supervised state of the art machine learning techniques decision tree (DTs), random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). Initially SGD method is used in isolation for the classification task and then it is made to perform the classification after being hybridized with the unsupervised ANN technique on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD) [10]. The comparison is based up on classification accuracy that is produced by generating a confusion matrix. For verifying consistency of accuracy values, the classification task was repeated with Internet Advertisements Dataset [11]. The results of the classification experimentation using hybridization of SOM with SGD are much more superior to SGD in isolation. All the accuracy values have been computed after achieving a ten-fold cross validation on the both the datasets to further verify the classifier's performance.","2159-6247;21596247","Electronic:978-1-4673-9107-8; POD:978-1-4673-9108-5; USB:978-1-4673-9106-1","10.1109/AIM.2015.7222674","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7222674","accuracy;cancer diagnosis;decision tree;machine learning;random forests;self organizing maps;stochastic gradient descent;support vector machines","Accuracy;Breast cancer;Internet;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Training","cancer;decision trees;gradient methods;matrix algebra;medical diagnostic computing;pattern classification;random processes;self-organising feature maps;support vector machines","ANN method;DTs;Internet advertisements dataset;RF;SGD;SOM;SVM;WBCD;Wisconsin breast cancer database;breast cancer diagnosis;classification experimentation;classification task;confusion matrix;decision tree;hybridized classifier;machine learning;random forests;self-organizing maps;stochastic gradient descent;supervised classifier;support vector machine;ten-fold cross validation;unsupervised ANN technique;unsupervised artificial neural network method","","1","","20","","","7-11 July 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For this purpose, modern organizations operate a wide range of information support systems to assist customers with critical service requests and to provide proactive monitoring, where possible, to prevent service requests from occurring in the first place. It is often the case that relevant information is scattered over the Internet and/or maintained on disparate systems, buried in large amount of noisy data, and in heterogeneous formats, thereby complicating the access to reusable knowledge and extending the response time to reach a resolution. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose an effective knowledge mining solution to improve the quality of service request resolution. We model the service resolution problem as an online search and classification problem, and use domain knowledge in the form of ontology to guide effective machine learning. Our proposed solution has been extensively evaluated with experiments and has been used in a real enterprise customer center.","1939-1374;19391374","","10.1109/TSC.2015.2474861","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7230298","Knowledge management service;business rules;data mining;event processing;machine learning;natural language processing;ontology;production rule system;semantic web","Data mining;Integrated circuits;Internet;Knowledge management;Ontologies;Semantics;Social network services","","","","0","","","","20150831","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Logistic regression and support vector machines consistently outperform log-likelihood ratio and signature detectors as processing and detection methods.
