A case study for the energy saving education was taken as the example for assessment. The model, which combines fuzzy Delphi method and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, was developed in this research to evaluate the courseware in teaching process. The candidate indexes were selected from the most important factors of the summary of literature review. Fuzzy Delphi method was employed to study the influential factors for evaluation model in every aspect of candidates. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was utilized to analyze the weight of each influential factor so as to construct a reasonable and more effective score list, with which a courseware could be evaluated. Based on the given approach, the professional ability on the courseware can be improved and then the teaching quality of the different education field could be upgraded. Besides, the methodology can also be served as a basis for the future development of courseware design.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212588","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212588","Energy education;Fuzzy Delphi method;Fuzzy analytic Hierarchy process","Courseware;Cybernetics;Decision making;Design methodology;Education;Fuzzy set theory;Fuzzy sets;Machine learning;Resource management;Uncertainty","courseware;fuzzy set theory;power engineering education;teaching","courseware assessment methodology;courseware design methodology;energy saving course;energy saving education;fuzzy Delphi method;fuzzy analytic hierarchy process;fuzzy theory;teaching process","","0","","15","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a different multi-pass coarse-fine opinion mining framework. In this framework, a base classifier firstly coarsely estimates the opinion of sentences. The obtained sentence-, paragraph- and document-level opinions are incorporated in an improved classifier as features to re-estimate the opinion of sentences.

This study investigates the changes of the landscape pattern and the changes of the ecological sustainability of the agricultural landscapes in 5 fundamental land use scenarios that are proposed based on land use analysis, land suitability evaluation, planning and peasant's demand in Ansai County, which is located in the northern part of the Chinese Loess Plateau. We combined expert judgement with a regression model and a geographic information system. Using a grid mesh of 600times600m size as a spatial reference framework based on the land use map, the concept of hemeroby was used for assessment ecological sustainability of agricultural landscape. Fourteen variables describing the landscape structure were chosen as predictors for ecological sustainability of landscape. The results suggested that the following land use scenario was recommended: all land with deep soil and slopes smaller than 15deg should be used for agriculture cropland, all farmland with slopes between 15deg-20deg should be converted to orchard or cash trees, and all farmland with slopes between 20deg-25deg should be converted to grassland. A great reduction of on-farm income, however, would be induced on the short term by such a scenario.

In the stage of on-line detection, we apply two methods to speed up the detection procedure. The first one is to adjust the threshold of the strong classifiers to remain the like-ear sub windows for further processing only using the first two layer classifiers. The second one is to keep the size of the original image while scaling the detection sub-windows to locate the ear part. The ear detection experiments on USTB ear database, CAS-PEAL face database and CMU PIE database show that the proposed method is significantly efficient and robust.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212166","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212166","Ear detection;Gentle AdaBoost;haar-like features","Biometrics;Cybernetics;Data mining;Ear;Face detection;Humans;Image databases;Layout;Machine learning;Spatial databases","learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;visual databases","AdaBoost algorithm;CAS-PEAL face database;CMU PIE database;USTB ear database;cascaded multilayer ear detector;ear detection approach;off-line cascaded classifier training;online ear detection","","7","","8","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This new evolutionary learning algorithm is based on a hybrid of cooperative particle swarm optimization and cultural algorithm. It is thus called cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (CCPSO). The proposed CCPSO method, which uses cooperative behavior among multiple swarms, can increase the global search capacity using the belief space. Cooperative behavior involves a collection of multiple swarms that interact by exchanging information to solve a problem. The belief space is the information repository in which the individuals can store their experiences such that other individuals can learn from them indirectly. The proposed FLNFN model uses functional link neural networks as the consequent part of the fuzzy rules. This study uses orthogonal polynomials and linearly independent functions in a functional expansion of the functional link neural networks. The FLNFN model can generate the consequent part of a nonlinear combination of input variables. Finally, the proposed functional-link-based neural fuzzy network with cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization (FLNFN-CCPSO) is adopted in predictive application. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed CCPSO method performs well in predicting the number of sunspots problems.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212629","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212629","Cultural algorithm;Functional-link network;Neural fuzzy network;Particle swarm Optimization;prediction","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Cultural differences;Design engineering;Fuzzy neural networks;Input variables;Machine learning algorithms;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Particle swarm optimization","evolutionary computation;fuzzy neural nets;fuzzy set theory;learning (artificial intelligence);particle swarm optimisation;polynomials;search problems","belief space;cultural cooperative particle swarm optimization algorithm;evolutionary learning algorithm;functional-link-based neural fuzzy network design;fuzzy rule;fuzzy set theory;global search capacity;linearly independent function;orthogonal polynomial","","2","","17","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An important concept introduced in this paper is ""detection before segmentation"" for extracting pedestrians' boundaries more precisely no matter what cameras (mobile, PTZ, or stationary) are used or how does the background include various lighting changes. First of all, the Adaboost-based detector is trained for detecting all possible pedestrians from still images. Then, we adopt the watershed algorithm to over-segment each frame as a rough segmentation. Since two homogenous regions will still connect together, a triangulation-based scheme is then used to divide them into different tinier regions using their edge features. Then, we propose a novel kernel density analysis to estimate the probability of each tinier region to be foreground or background. With the kernel modeling, an optimal segmentation of pedestrian can be found by maximizing a posteriori probability for maintaining the visual and spatial consistencies between each segmented regions. Then, each desired pedestrian can be more accurately extracted for content analysis even though it is occluded with other objects or captured by a mobile camera. Experimental results have shown the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in pedestrian segmentation.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212735","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212735","","Cameras;Cybernetics;Detectors;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Kernel;Machine learning;Object detection;Object segmentation;Video compression","feature extraction;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;probability","adaboost-based detector;deformable triangulation;feature extraction;kernel density estimation;mobile camera;pedestrian boundary extraction;pedestrian segmentation;posteriori probability;probability estimation;single image segmentation;watershed algorithm","","1","","16","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recently, most studies have been focused on using an efficient data structure with preprocessing data for the frequent closed itemset mining. Existing prefix-tree-based approach presented the IT-Tree data structure in its complete preprocessing data for the efficient frequent searching but used large memory space and time consuming in the preprocessing step. Lately, another approach introduced the efficient data structure, called ldquoa collaboration of array, bitmap, and prefix treerdquo, to improve storage and time in preprocessing data. However, its preprocessing step was not complete and hence its frequent searching for the frequent closed itemset mining may take more time than that of the IT-Tree-based approach.

The specialized process migration mechanism for TriBA (PMMFT), which includes register tables to help record the process and related migration information, is proposed. By retransferring the messages related to the migrated process during migration, PMMFT decreases the process residual dependency and improves the process communication transparency. By the checkpoint-based process migration strategy, PMMFT can avoid the migration failure due to the possible node failure related to the migration process. In experiment, PMMFT is adopted by THINDLBA, a dynamic load balancing algorithm specially designed for TriBA, the results verified the availability of PMMFT.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212644","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212644","Checkpoint;Process migration;Process register table;Triplet-based architecture","Computer aided instruction;Computer architecture;Cybernetics;Data communication;Data processing;Educational institutions;Joining processes;Load management;Machine learning;Multiprocessor interconnection networks","computer architecture;resource allocation","checkpoint-based process migration strategy;complex problems;decomposition method;dynamic load balancing algorithm;process migration mechanism;process residual dependency;register tables;scalable triplet-based computer architecture","","0","","10","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To achieve the aim, five indicators are selected as the input variables and real estate price is used as output variable of the SVR. The quarterly data during 1998-2008 are employed as the data set to construct the SVR model. With the scenarios, real estate prices in future are forecasted and analyzed. The forecasting performance of SVR model was also compared with BPNN model. The experimental results demonstrate that based on the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean squared error (RMSE), the SVR model outperforms the BPNN model and the SVR based approach was an efficient tool to forecast real estate prices.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212389","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212389","Support vector machine (SVM);forecast;real estate price","Cybernetics;Economic forecasting;Economic indicators;Employment;Loans and mortgages;Machine learning;Macroeconomics;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Technology forecasting","forecasting theory;mean square error methods;pricing;real estate data processing;regression analysis;support vector machines","SVM;SVR based forecasting;mean absolute error;mean absolute percentage error;real estate price prediction;root mean squared error;support vector machine;support vector regression","","1","","19","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The scheme is composed of two steps: the phase unwrapping and denoising. At first, we proposed a novel phase unwrapping method called Ideal Unwrapper (IU). Afterwards, to solve the rest denoising problem, the theory of convex feasible is introduced. In addition, the convex sets for the Projection Onto Convex Sets (POCs) denoising, which might preserve the given arbitrary feature areas perfectly, are also constructed. Finally, numerical results are also illustrated to show the virtues of the proposed scheme. Especially, the proposed Ideal Unwrapper shows its powerful efficiency in Unwrapping two-dimensional phase images with little computational burden by comparing with the newly proposed Graph Cut method.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212778","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212778","Alternating Projection;Convex Feasible;Denoising;Phase Retrieval;Phase Unwrapping;Projections onto Convex Sets","Automation;Bayesian methods;Computer science;Cybernetics;Electronic mail;Hilbert space;Iterative algorithms;Machine learning;Noise reduction;Synthetic aperture radar interferometry","image denoising;radar imaging;radar interferometry;synthetic aperture radar","InSAR;convex feasible model;graph cut method;phase retrieval;phase unwrapping;projection onto convex sets denoising;synthetic aperture radar interferometry","","0","","11","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) has been widely adopted in nonlinear dynamical system identification because of its simple topological structure, fast learning and strong extrapolating capability. The major problem in applying RBFNN is the selection of the number of hidden neurons. In this paper, we adopt the Localized Generalization Error Model (L-GEM) to select number of hidden neurons of RBFNN for chaotic time series prediction. The effectiveness of the L-GEM is evaluated by using two benchmarking chaotic time series datasets: Mackey-Glass series and Lorenz series. Simulations results show that the proposed method provides a better prediction performance in comparison with the RBFNN trained with a cross validation method.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212381","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212381","Chaotic time series prediction;Localized Generalization Error Model;RBFNN","Autoregressive processes;Chaos;Chaotic communication;Cybernetics;Machine learning;Neural networks;Neurons;Nonlinear dynamical systems;Prediction methods;Predictive models","chaos;nonlinear dynamical systems;radial basis function networks;time series","chaotic time series prediction;hidden neurons number selection;localized generalization error model;nonlinear dynamical system identification;radial basis function neural network","","0","","22","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

With the aid of the high sampling rate 1200 frames/second of video camera, the time series aiming trajectory during the releasing stage can be captured for analysis, especially the releasing string motion. The linear time invariant auto-regressive exogenous (ARX) process is adopted to model the intended aiming trajectory before the releasing arrow stage. Then based on the model the estimated trajectory during the releasing arrow stage is evaluated as the reference, so its difference between the real one is the main focus in the paper. According to these discrepancies some key parameters are defined first, and the implementation of correlation approach can result in some significant relationships which can characterize his particular releasing string motion during this stage. For example, his releasing arrow trajectory always has an upper linear trend along the vertical direction, and the vertical deviation on the target plays more important role than the radial deviation.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212738","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212738","ARX;Archery performance;Correlations;Releasing arrow stage;Time series analysis","Cameras;Cybernetics;Electromyography;Heart rate;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Performance analysis;Sampling methods;Stability;Time series analysis","autoregressive processes;sampling methods;sport;time series","archery performance;linear time invariant auto-regressive exogenous process;releasing arrow stage;releasing string motion;time series analysis;time series trajectory;video camera sampling rate","","0","","13","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, through theoretical analysis, we find that different scales may affect the training process of HSC, which influences its classification performance. To investigate the impact and find a suitable scale, the scale transformation of HSC is studied. The experimental results show that the accuracy increases with the shrinkage of the scale, but the effect is tiny. Furthermore, we find that some samples become inconsistent and repetitious when the scale is adequately small, because of the powerlessly providing enough precision by the data type of computer. Fortunately, HSC can get a high performance with common scales as experiments exhibit.","2160-133X;2160133X","POD:978-1-4244-3702-3","10.1109/ICMLC.2009.5212302","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5212302","HSC;Hyper Surface Classification;Scale Transformation","Business process re-engineering;Cognition;Cybernetics;Deductive databases;Information processing;Laboratories;Learning systems;Machine learning;Partitioning algorithms;Pattern recognition","classification;topology;very large databases","Jordan curve theorem;hyper surface classification;large database classification;scale transformation;topology","","0","","6","","","12-15 July 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
