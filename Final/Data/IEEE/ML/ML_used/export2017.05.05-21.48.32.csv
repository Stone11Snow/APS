Research on pitch extraction is several years old and numerous algorithms have been developed over the years to improve its accuracy. It becomes more difficult in the presence of additive noise and reverberation because noise corrupts the periodicity information which is vital for estimating the pitch. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis on pitch tracking in the presence of reverberation by different state of the art methods. We compare Neural Network (NN) based approaches such as the Subband Autocorrelation Classifier (SAcC) with signal processing based methods such as YIN and RAPT. We enhance the performance of SAcC by introducing a cross-correlogram feature (CC+SAcC). We further show that multi-style training of NN using the CC+SAcC feature outperforms all the other methods. Experiments were conducted using artificially reverberated Keele and TIMIT databases with room impulse responses of varying T60 values.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0481-2; POD:978-1-5090-0482-9; USB:978-1-5090-0480-5","10.1109/ISSPIT.2015.7394326","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7394326","machine learning;pitch tracking;reverberation;speech;subband","Correlation;Hidden Markov models;Measurement;Reflection;Reverberation;Spectrogram;Speech","frequency estimation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;reverberation;speech processing","NN multistyle training;TIMIT database;additive noise;artificially reverberated Keele database;cross-correlogram feature;fundamental frequency estimation;neural network based approach;periodicity information;pitch estimation;pitch extraction;pitch tracking;reverberant environment;reverberation;room impulse response","","","","18","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the computational intelligence area there are a number of techniques capable of dealing with each kind of uncertainty. However, it is possible that a problem involves more than one kind of uncertainty at the same time, and in this case, hybrid solutions must be sought. Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models capable of modeling statistical uncertainty and are widely applied in many practical problems. Despite Bayesian networks being able to deal with randomness, they are unable to model linguistic vagueness. Fuzzy systems, on the other hand, are a well known technique capable of dealing with linguistic vagueness by representing knowledge with simple and interpretable rules and membership functions. As classical fuzzy systems are unable to model statistical uncertainty, Probabilistic Fuzzy Systems were developed in order to account for both kind of uncertainties. In this work we propose the Probabilistic Fuzzy Bayesian Network as a combination of both probabilistic fuzzy systems and bayesian networks, also capable of simultaneously modeling both kinds of uncertainty using the concepts of bayesian inference and probabilistic fuzzy systems. The proposed model is firstly applied in a very simple classification problem in order to show its potential and advantage over traditional naive bayes classifiers. For validation of the proposed model, experiments are done using benchmark classification data sets from the UCI machine learning repository and the results are then compared with other machine learning techniques.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7681-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7682-2; POD:978-1-4673-7683-9","10.1109/FSKD.2015.7381989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381989","Probabilistic fuzzy systems;bayesian networks;machine learning;naive bayes classifiers;uncertainty","Bayes methods;Computational modeling;Fuzzy systems;Probabilistic logic;Probability distribution;Uncertainty","belief networks;fuzzy set theory;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);probability","Bayesian inference;UCI machine learning repository;computational intelligence;fuzzy system;probabilistic fuzzy Bayesian network;probabilistic graphical models","","","","22","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of this paper is to find out the impact of skewed feature variation in the training dataset for the Naïve Bayesian Classifier(NBC) and Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN) while classifying imbalanced data. The experiment was carried out on six KEEL dataset which are skewed in terms of class distribution having different imbalance ratio.

It can be expected that each sentence of a document is composed of a subject and an object, where the subject is defined in relation to its object. Using ""definition"" and ""use"" relations, we may thus identify the subjects in a given document by looking for keyphrases which appear frequently as subjects of sentences in the document. We thus present a subject-keyphrase extraction (SKE) algorithm based on the notion of definition-use chain (DU Chain) to identify subject-keyphrases.

The key idea is to influence the magnetic sensor by writing character gestures (i.e. Graffiti or EdgeWrite) in front of the device using a properly shaped magnet taken in hand. The movement of this magnet changes the magnetic flux pattern around the device and it is sensed and registered by the magnetometer sensor. Then, we classify this flux pattern using Support Vector Machine (i.e. SVM) classifier.

Solutions based on Complex Event Processing (CEP) have the potential to extract high-level knowledge from these data streams but the use of CEP for distributed IoT applications is still in early phase and involves many drawbacks. The manual setting of rules for CEP is one of the major drawback. These rules are based on threshold values and currently there are no automatic methods to find the optimized threshold values. In real-time dynamic IoT environments, the context of the application is always changing and the performance of current CEP solutions are not reliable for such scenarios. In this regard, we propose an automatic and context aware method based on clustering for finding optimized threshold values for CEP rules. We have developed a lightweight CEP called μCEP to run on low processing hardware which can update the rules on the run.

Such ability of the software enables developers to reduce the faults in the whole life cycle of software development, at the same time it benefits automation process, and reduces the overall cost and efforts of the software maintenance. In this paper, we propose to design fault prediction model by using a set of code and design metrics; applying various machine learning (ML) classifiers; also used transformation techniques for feature reduction and dealing class imbalance data to improve fault prediction model. The data sets were obtained from publicly available PROMISE repositories. The results of the study revealed that there was no significant impact on the ability to accurately predict the fault-proneness of modules by applying PCA in reducing the dimensions; the results were improved after balancing data by SMOTE, Resample techniques, and by applying PCA with Resample in combination. It has also been seen that Random Forest, Random Tree, Logistic Regression, and Kstar machine learning classifiers have relatively better consistency in prediction accuracy as compared to other techniques.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-7811-3; Electronic:978-1-4799-7812-0; POD:978-1-4799-7813-7","10.1109/ICOSST.2015.7396406","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396406","Class imbalance;Data mining;Fault prediction model;Feature reduction;Machine learning;Software metrics","Data mining;Data models;Measurement;Prediction algorithms;Predictive models;Principal component analysis;Software","data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;program testing;random processes;regression analysis;sampling methods;software fault tolerance;software maintenance;software metrics;trees (mathematics)","Kstar machine learning classifier;PCA;SMOTE;class imbalance data;fault prediction model;fault prone module;feature reduction;logistic regression;random forest;random tree;resample technique;soft computing technique;software development;software faulty module;software maintenance;transformation technique","","","","21","","","17-19 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose Securitas, a network trace-based protocol identification system, which exploits the semantic information in protocol message formats. Securitas requires no prior knowledge of protocol specifications. Deeming a protocol as a language between two processes, our approach is based upon the new insight that the n-grams of protocol traces, just like those of natural languages, exhibit highly skewed frequency-rank distribution that can be leveraged in the context of protocol identification. In Securitas, we first extract the statistical protocol message formats by clustering n-grams with the same semantics, and then use the corresponding statistical formats to classify raw network traces. Our tool involves the following key features: 1) applicable to both connection oriented protocols and connection less protocols; 2) suitable for both text and binary protocols; 3) no need to assemble IP packets into TCP or UDP flows; and 4) effective for both long-live flows and short-live flows. We implement Securitas and conduct extensive evaluations on real-world network traces containing both textual and binary protocols. Our experimental results on BitTorrent, CIFS/SMB, DNS, FTP, PPLIVE, SIP, and SMTP traces show that Securitas has the ability to accurately identify the network traces of the target application protocol with an average recall of about 97.4% and an average precision of about 98.4%. Our experimental results prove Securitas is a robust system, and meanwhile displaying a competitive performance in practice.","1063-6692;10636692","","10.1109/TNET.2014.2381230","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004871","Latent Dirichlet Allocation;machine learning;network security;protocol identification","Feature extraction;Internet;Payloads;Protocols;Security;Semantics;Training","IP networks;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","BitTorrent;CIFS/SMB;DNS;FTP;IP packets;PPLIVE;SIP;SMTP;Securitas;TCP;UDP flows;automated network protocol identification;binary protocols;clustering -grams;connection less protocols;connection oriented protocols;malware activities detection;natural languages;network measurement;network monitoring;network trace-based protocol identification system;protocol message formats;protocol specifications;semantics-aware approach;statistical protocol message formats;textual protocols;traffic classification","","0","","37","","20150108","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The challenge in this work is to detect sentiment classes from relatively long text, where writers merge sentences and expressions when asked to write reviews, instead of being directly asked to write their sentiment degree. The approach is data-driven, which uses machine learning to train classifier features to recognize the sentiment.

This recorded raw data is further used for the analysis of the performance of buildings and its different components e.g. Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC). To save time and energy it is required to ensure resilience of the data by detecting and replacing outliers (i.e. data samples that are not plausible) in the data before detailed analysis. This paper discusses the steps involved for detecting outliers in the data obtained from absorption chiller using their On/Off state information. It also proposes a method for automatic detection of On/Off and/or Missing Data status of the chiller. The technique uses two layer K-Means clustering for detecting On/Off as well as Missing Data state of the chiller. After automatic detection of the chiller On/Off cycle, a method for outlier detection is proposed using Z-Score normalization based on the On/Off cycle state of chillers and clustering outliers by Expectation Maximization clustering algorithm. Moreover, the results of filling the missing values with regression and linear interpolation for short and long periods are elaborated.

However, to ensure diagnosis accuracy and effective board repair, a large number of syndromes must be used. Therefore, the diagnosis cost can be prohibitively high due to the increase in diagnosis time and the complexity of test execution and analysis. We propose an adaptive diagnosis method based on incremental decision trees (DTs). Faulty components are classified according to the discriminative ability of the syndromes in DT training. The diagnosis procedure is constructed as a binary tree, with the most discriminative syndrome as the root and final repair suggestions are available as the leaf nodes of the tree. The syndrome to be used in the next step is determined based on the observation of syndromes thus far in the diagnosis procedure. The number of syndromes required for diagnosis can be significantly reduced compared to the total number of syndromes used for system training. Moreover, online learning is facilitated in the proposed diagnosis system using an incremental version of DTs, so as to bridge the knowledge obtained at test-design stage with the knowledge gained during volume production. The diagnosis system can thus adapt to occurrences of new error scenarios on-the-fly. Diagnosis results for three complex boards from industry, currently in volume production, highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","0278-0070;02780070","","10.1109/TCAD.2015.2459046","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7163559","Board-level;decision tree (DT);decision-tree;diagnosis;evaluation;functional failure;machine learning","Circuit faults;Decision trees;Fault diagnosis;Maintenance engineering;Manufacturing;Production;Training","decision trees;fault diagnosis;printed circuits;testing","adaptive board-level functional fault diagnosis;adaptive diagnosis method;binary tree;diagnosis system;discriminative syndrome;incremental decision trees;product yield;system training;test analysis;test execution;volume production","","2","","27","","20150721","Feb. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

MatrixMap provides powerful yet simple abstraction, consisting of a distributed data structure called bulk key matrix and a computation interface defined by matrix patterns. Users can easily load data into bulk key matrices and program algorithms into parallel matrix patterns. MatrixMap outperforms current state-of-the-art systems by employing three key techniques: matrix patterns with lambda functions for irregular and linear algebra matrix operations, asynchronous computation pipeline with optimized data shuffling strategies for specific matrix patterns and in-memory data structure reusing data in iterations. Moreover, it can automatically handle the parallelization and distribute execution of programs on a large cluster.

Monthly demand is subject to various factors such as season and climate effects, thus making accurate load demand forecasts a challenging task. In this paper a data driven machine learning approach is applied on monthly load morphing. More particularly, kernel based Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is adopted for forecasting the amount of load demand for each month in a year-ahead-horizon. The GPR model is equipped with a valid kernel function (four different kernels are tested) and is trained on a set of historical datasets that contain the recorded monthly demands of the prior four to the tested years. It is extensively benchmarked on a period of five years and its performance is measured using the Mean Average Percentage Error (MAPE). Furthermore, it is compared to the performance taken with simple linear regression model. Results demonstrate the superiority of the GPR forecasting over that of the linear regression, however, a dependence of GPR on selection of kernel is observed.","","Paper:978-1-78561-146-9","10.1049/cp.2014.1693","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7386134","Gaussian Process Regression;Kernel Methods;Machine Learning;Monthly Load Forecasting","","Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);load forecasting;regression analysis","data driven machine learning approach;electricity load forecasting;historical datasets;kernel based Gaussian process regression;kernel function;load demand;mean average percentage error;monthly load forecasting;monthly load morphing;year-ahead-horizon","","","","","","","2-5 Nov. 2014","","IET","IET Conference Publications"

Most of these solutions are reactive in nature as CEP acts on real-time data and does not exploit historical data.

Stage 1: A machine learning demand model has been created applying adaptive boost to a regression tree algorithm, achieving an RMS error of 0.25. The model has been used to simulate the individual base-demand for 50 homes in a precinct. Stage 2: A linear programing model has been developed that determines the impact of solar and battery storage on that base demand, and optimizes the system capacities for each home in the precinct while limiting emissions. This model shows reducing emissions by 50% through solar and battery storage cost 2.6% more than the grid only scenario.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8132-1; POD:978-1-4673-8133-8; USB:978-1-4673-8131-4","10.1109/APPEEC.2015.7381039","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381039","Battery Storage;Machine learning;Optimisation;Residential Demand Forecast;Solar","Adaptation models;Batteries;Data models;Demand forecasting;Load modeling;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models","learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;load forecasting;power engineering computing;regression analysis;secondary cells;solar power;tariffs;trees (mathematics)","RMS;battery storage;electricity tariff;linear programing model;machine learning demand model;optimised solar generation;regression tree algorithm;residential precinct electricity demand forecasting","","1","","30","","","15-18 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second step attempts to identify the textual traits that are unique to authentic and fictitious reviews. For the purpose of this paper, a ground truth dataset of 1,800 reviews, uniformly divided between authentic and fictitious, was created. With respect to the first step, authentic and fictitious reviews were classified by using four forms of textual differences: understandability, level of details, writing style, and cognition indicators. Classification was performed using voting by average probability among logistic regression, C4.5, Support Vector Machine, JRip, and Random Forest classifiers. Using five-fold cross-validation, the proposed approach was found to outperform two existing baselines. Furthermore, with respect to the second step, the textual traits unique to authentic and fictitious reviews were identified using Information Gain, and Chi-squared feature selection techniques. A sequential forward feature selection approach was further adopted to identify the top five features that aid the classification of authentic and fictitious reviews. These include the use of nouns, articles, function words, punctuations, and in particular, exclamation points in reviews.

This calls for development of novel approaches that leverage recent advances in storage/memory, context-awareness, edge/cloud computing, and falls into framework of big data. However, the big data by itself is yet another complex phenomena to handle and comes with its notorious 4V: Velocity, voracity, volume, and variety. In this work, we address these issues in optimization of 5G wireless networks via the notion of proactive caching at the base stations. In particular, we investigate the gains of proactive caching in terms of backhaul of-floadings and request satisfactions, while tackling the large-amount of available data for content popularity estimation. In order to estimate the content popularity, we first collect users' mobile traffic data from a Turkish telecom operator from several base stations in hours of time interval. Then, an analysis is carried out locally on a big data platform and the gains of proactive caching at the base stations are investigated via numerical simulations. It turns out that several gains are possible depending on the level of available information and storage size. For instance, with 10% of content ratings and 15.4 Gbyte of storage size (87% of total catalog size), proactive caching achieves 100% of request satisfaction and offloads 98% of the backhaul when considering 16 base stations.","1229-2370;12292370","","10.1109/JCN.2015.000102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7387263","5G cellular networks;big data;content popularity estimation;machine learning;proactive caching","5G mobile communication;Base stations;Big data;Estimation;Wireless networks","5G mobile communication;Big Data;cache storage;cellular radio;mobile computing;optimisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","5G wireless network optimization;Turkish telecom operator;base stations;big data framework;cloud computing;content ratings;context-awareness;deployment technique;edge computing;mobile cellular networks;mobile traffic data;optimization technique;proactive caching perspective;request satisfaction;storage size;telcos;variety;velocity;volume;voracity","","2","","","","","Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

A key element in building predictive models is the ability to introduce features that capture historical user behaviors in an effective manner so as to differentiate between those consumers who are most likely to convert without nurturing, those who are likely to convert with nurturing, and those who are unlikely to convert irrespective of the marketing campaign and channel to which they may be subjected. Towards this effort, we propose to use a set of dynamic features to capture consumers' engagement behaviors. Moreover, we have also applied the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify certain hidden customer behavior patterns and use them as additional features. Various sampling techniques are then explored and compared to address the following three most common challenges faced in dealing with marketing data: 1) severely unbalanced historical ground truth, 2) sparsity in the relevant data due to low historical response rates, and 3) high dimensional due to the large variety of campaign channels, programs or themes. To validate our approach, we conducted some preliminary experiments using real-world campaign data. The evaluation shows that the random oversampling approach has the best performance giving the largest area under the curve (AUC) and an up to 160% improvement in the lift index. Finally, we conducted a pilot with one of our clients over a period of five weeks, which aims to help prioritize the campaign contacts to its consumers in Latin America. As a result, the pilot achieved 74% and 132% of lift in terms of customer responses to phone calls and emails in the test group, as compared to those from the control group.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8493-3; POD:978-1-4673-8494-0","10.1109/ICDMW.2015.30","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7395688","Direct marketing;NMF;customer behavior modeling;data mining;data sampling;machine learning","Buildings;Data mining;Data models;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Neural networks;Predictive models","consumer behaviour;data mining;marketing data processing;matrix decomposition;sampling methods","AUC;NMF;area under the curve;campaign channel;campaign contact;consumer conversion;consumer prioritization;consumers engagement behavior;control group;customer response;data mining technique;direct marketing;dynamic feature;email;hidden customer behavior pattern;historical ground truth;historical response rate;historical user behavior;marketing campaign;marketing data;marketing key performance indicator;nonnegative matrix factorization;phone call;predictive model;random oversampling approach;real-world campaign data;relevant data;resource constraint;sampling technique;time constraint","","","","22","","","14-17 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Consequently, smartphone applications containing sensitive personal or company data are at risk when targeted by attackers. Continuous and passive authentication is a popular scheme for secretly classifying users' identities based on their own unique touch motions (i.e., keystrokes and gestures). However, previous methods are inadequate when classifying users' singular touch motions. In this paper, we propose a novel continuous authentication method. The proposed method not only profiles behavioral biometrics from keystrokes and gestures, it also acquires the specific properties of a one-touch motion during the user's interaction with the smartphone. We demonstrate that the manner by which a user uses the touchscreen - that is, the specific location touched on the screen, the drift from when a finger moves up and down, the area touched, and the pressure used - reflects unique physical and behavioral biometrics. Moreover, the speed of the Gesture Segment (GS) is defined to extract a meaningful velocity segment. Experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed method for combining keystroke and gesture behavior demonstrate its effectiveness and accuracy.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-8691-0; POD:978-1-4799-8692-7","10.1109/CCST.2015.7389681","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7389681","data leakage prevention;keystroke profiling;machine learning;sensitive data protection;smartphone movement behavior","Authentication;Feature extraction;Iris recognition;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets","gesture recognition;human computer interaction;message authentication;pattern classification;smart phones;touch sensitive screens","GS;gesture profiling;gesture segment;keystroke profiling;one-touch motion;smart phone continuous authentication;touch screen;user identity classification;user interaction","","1","","25","","","21-24 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Progression of glaucoma occurs due to an increase in intraocular pressure and results in the damage of optic nerve. Progression of glaucoma can be stopped if detected at an early stage. There are no early symptoms of glaucoma and the only source to detect glaucoma at an early stage is the structural change that arises in the internal eye. Fundoscopy is one of the modern medical imaging techniques that enable Ophthalmologists to observe structural changes in the Optic Disc to detect glaucoma. Many autonomous glaucoma detection systems analyze fundus image by calculating Cup to Disc Ratio (CDR) and categorize the image as glaucoma or healthy. Glaucoma detection using machine learning is also being used widely to aid ophthalmologists. The proposed methodology provides a novel algorithm to detect glaucoma using a fusion of CDR and hybrid textural and intensity features. Image categorization (glaucoma, non-glaucoma, suspect) is done based on the results from both CDR and classifier. This fusion of CDR with hybrid features has improved the sensitivity of system to 1, specificity 0.88 and accuracy 92%.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0481-2; POD:978-1-5090-0482-9; USB:978-1-5090-0480-5","10.1109/ISSPIT.2015.7394362","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7394362","Cup to disc ratio;Machine Learning;fundus;hybridfeatures","Biomedical optical imaging;Feature extraction;Histograms;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Optical imaging;Optical sensors","biomedical optical imaging;diseases;feature extraction;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;object detection","autonomous glaucoma detection systems;cup-to-disc ratio calculation;fundoscopy;fundus image;glaucoma progression;hybrid intensity features;hybrid textural features;image categorization;intraocular pressure;irreversible blindness;machine learning;medical imaging techniques;noncurable optic disease;optic nerve damage","","","","12","","","7-10 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Bayesian network (BN) is an important tool for dealing with uncertain problems and information. Mutual information (MI) measures dependencies between random variables and is therefore a suitable feature selection technique for evaluating the relationship between variables in a complex classification tasks. Using Bayesian network as a statistical model, this study leverages mutual information to build a credit scoring model called BNMI. The learned Bayesian network structure is adaptively adjusted according to mutual information. Empirical study compared the results of BNMI with three existing baseline models.

A core component of the smart grid are phasor measurement units (PMUs) which offer the ability to capture time-coherent measurements across a geographically distributed area. However, due to the fast sampling rate of these devices, a significant volume of data is generated on a daily basis and this presents challenges for how to leverage the information most effectively. In this paper, we address this challenge by applying machine learning techniques to PMU data for the purpose of detecting line events in a wide-area power grid. Specifically, we use archived synchrophasor data from PMUs located across the Pacific Northwest to train and test a decision tree built using the J48 algorithm. In contrast to other studies exploring machine learning in the context of the smart grid, our work uses PMU data from a large, active, power grid as opposed to data obtained from a simulation. We show that our classifier performs as well as hand-coded rules developed by a domain expert when applied at locations near to a line fault and that it significantly outperforms hand-coded rules when identifying line faults from a distance.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0172-9; POD:978-1-5090-0173-6","10.1109/IGCC.2015.7393695","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393695","decision trees;event detection;machine learning;phasor measurement units;smart grids","Legged locomotion;Phasor measurement units;Training;Volume measurement","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);phasor measurement;power engineering computing;smart power grids","J48 algorithm;PMU data streams;decision tree;energy infrastructure;machine learning;phasor measurement unit;power grid;smart grid line event classification;supervised learning","","2","","31","","","14-16 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A feasible solution for the problem is incorporating various priors into restoration procedure as constrained conditions. Recently, the patch-based Gaussian mixture model (GMM) priors became popular. However, the learning of patch-based GMM priors usually assumes the components of the GMM are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The assumption means that two components could model the same training samples, and thus a possible decrease in model's description ability. This work presents a new learning method to diversify the patch-based GMM priors through modeling the GMM's parameters as a determinantal point process (DPP). The introduction of DPP allows us to specify a preference for diversity in patch-based GMM using a positive definite kernel function and thus to increase the model's description ability for a given model complexity. Furthermore, under the expected patch log-likelihood (EPLL) restoration framework, we further introduce the diversified patch-based GMM priors into remote sensing literature and develop new remote sensing image restoration algorithms. The extensive experiments for denoising and deblurring of remote sensing images demonstrated that the proposed algorithms produced better restoration results than other methods that already proven to perform well in the literature.","1939-1404;19391404","","10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2488583","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7307106","Determinantal point process (DPP);Gaussian mixture model (GMM);diversity;machine learning;prior;remote sensing image;restoration","Algorithm design and analysis;Computational modeling;Gaussian mixture model;Image restoration;Kernel;Machine learning;Noise reduction","Gaussian processes;geophysical image processing;geophysical techniques;image denoising;image restoration;mixture models","clean remote sensing image restoration procedure;degraded images;determinantal point process;ill-posed problem;learning method;model complexity;model description ability;patch log-likelihood restoration framework;patch-based Gaussian mixture model priors;positive definite kernel function;remote sensing image deblurring;remote sensing image denoising","","","","54","","20151026","Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To solve these quadratic optimization problems over peer-to-peer networks, we propose an asynchronous, distributed algorithm that scales with both the number and the dimension of the input data (training samples in the classification problem). The proposed distributed optimization algorithm relies on the notion of “core-set” which is used in geometric optimization to approximate the value function associated to a given set of points with a smaller subset of points.

It measures the positions of a ball from multiple video sequences in real time. The positions can be used for calculating various statistical data and making visual effects for a broadcast program. Although a number of methods for visual object tracking have been proposed, tracking a small ball is still a challenging task. We focused on the motion features of a ball object, adding to its appearance features. We created two discriminate models for tracking a ball in the manner of supervised machine learning. The appearance classifier was trained with visual features of ball images, and the motion classifier was trained with ball trajectories. Tracking results from multiple cameras are integrated in consideration of their reliabilities, and the final ball position is robustly measured. The system was evaluated with two professional football games.

In the first step, stress level of each participant was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) questionnaire. EEG signals of twenty eight participants were recorded using a single channel EEG headset for duration of three minutes. Feature vector based on frequency sub bands is used to train three different machine learning algorithms, to classify the stress level of participants. It is evident from results that psychological stress level can be measured by single channel EEG headset using machine learning algorithms with considerable accuracy.

A random forest classifier that uses the differences in resulting docking scores between the 166 mutant pairs and their wild-types was used, to distinguish between variants that have either completely or partially lost binding ability. 50% of non-binders were correctly predicted with a false discovery rate of only 2%. The model was tested on a set of 15 HIV-1 - human, as well as 7 human - human glioblastoma-related, mutant proteins pairs: 50% of combined non-binders were correctly predicted with a false discovery rate of 10%. The model was also used to identify 10 protein-protein interactions between human proteins and their HIV-1 partners that are likely to be abolished by rare non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs).

For the next generation of cooperative cyber-physical system-of-systems, safety and security constitute two key issues of public concern that affect the deployment and acceptance. In engineering, the openness and evolutionary nature also entail radical paradigm shifts. This paper presents one novel approach to the development of qualified cyber-physical system-of-systems, with Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS) as one target. The approach, referred to as knowledge-in-the-loop, aims to allow a synergy of well-managed lifecycles, formal quality assurance, and smart system features. One research goal is to enable an evolutionary development with continuous and traceable flows of system rationale from design-time to post-deployment time and back, supporting automated knowledge inference and enrichment. Another research goal is to develop a formal approach to risk-aware dynamic treatment of safety and security as a whole in the context of system-of-systems. Key base technologies include: (1) EAST-ADL for the consolidation of system-wide concerns and for the creation of an ontology for advanced run-time decisions, (2) Learning Based-Testing for run-time and post-deployment model inference, safety monitoring and testing, (3) Provable Isolation for run-time attack detection and enforcement of security in real-time operating systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1950-2; POD:978-1-5090-1951-9","10.1109/IntelCIS.2015.7397237","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7397237","cyber-physical system;knowledge modeling;machine learning;model-based development;ontology;quality-of-service;safety;security;systems-of-systems;verification and validation","Analytical models;Ontologies;Organizations;Risk management;Roads;Security;System analysis and design","cyber-physical systems;evolutionary computation;formal verification;intelligent transportation systems;learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);security of data","C-ITS;EAST-ADL;cooperative intelligent transport systems;cooperative system-of-systems;cyber-physical system-of-systems;evolutionary development;formal quality assurance;integrated safety and security;knowledge-in-the-loop approach;learning based-testing;ontology;risk-aware dynamic treatment;run-time attack detection;safety monitoring;smart system feature","","1","","53","","","12-14 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper examines a robust, semi-automated approach that utilizes simple and efficient machine learning algorithms to perform supervised classification of multi-spectral image data into land and water regions. By combining the four wavelength bands widely available in imaging platforms such as IKONOS, QuickBird, and GeoEye-1 with basic texture metrics, high quality segmentation can be achieved.

To do this effectively an elaborate and reliable data management system is required. Unfortunately, such systems do not exist in many developing countries where the available information can be sparse and noisy with important factors missing from the data. In this paper, we report on the study of three diseases and their outbreaks in a developing country (Pakistan) with the goal of gaining a better understanding of environmental/weather and socio-economic factors that impact them. The data available from local health units contained only numbers of reported cases from different localities. We first enrich this data by fusing key environmental and socio-economic factors obtained from other sources. We then perform independent factor analysis of the augmented data, using decision tree and logistic regression. We study cross-disease and cross-locality impacts, and show the effectiveness of an outbreak prediction model.

In addition to the positive-negative disparity the overall cost of labeling these datasets typically leads to situations where the number of unlabeled examples greatly outnumbers the labeled. Accordingly, we perform several experiments, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, examining the performance of state of the art PU-learning algorithms when there is significant bias in the labeling process.

The presented ground truth and metrics may adapt to any state-of-the-art technique and provide a reliable and unbiased solution to compare them.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7129-2; POD:978-1-4673-7130-8","10.1109/LARS-SBR.2015.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402136","computer vision;dataset;fire detection;machine learning","Cameras;Detectors;Image color analysis;Measurement;Robot vision systems;XML","emergency services;object detection;robot vision;service robots;video signal processing","computer vision algorithm;frame-by-frame annotation;fully autonomous fire fighter robot;ground truth;nonstationary video based fire detection","","2","","17","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, accurate classification is challenging if the training data is contaminated with unclean traffic. Recent researches often assume clean training data, and hence performance reduced on real-time network traffic. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose a robust method, Unclean Traffic Classification (UTC), which incorporates noise elimination and suspected noise reweighting. Firstly, UTC eliminates strong noisy training data identified by a consensus filtering with multiple classifiers. Furthermore, UTC estimates the relevance of remaining training data and learns a robust traffic classifier. Through a number of experiments on a real-world traffic dataset, we show that the new method outperforms existing state-of-the-art traffic classification methods, under the extremely difficult circumstance with unclean training data.","","Electronic:978-0-7695-5785-4; POD:978-1-4673-8669-2","10.1109/ICPADS.2015.49","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7384312","machine learning;network security;random forest;traffic classification;unclean Internet data","Clustering algorithms;Internet;Noise measurement;Ports (Computers);Robustness;Training;Training data","computer network management;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","UTC;consensus filtering;mislabelled training samples;noise elimination;suspected noise reweighting;unclean traffic classification","","","","27","","","14-17 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The paper also investigates whether information about gestures co-occurring with speech contributes to the automatic prediction of the clause boundary pauses. Since one clause corresponds to one or more semantic units (dialog acts) the pauses investigated mark the start and end of large semantic units. The results of my study indicate that pauses that mark clause boundaries, co-occur with all gesture types in the analyzed corpus. Finally, my automatic prediction experiments show that information about speech tokens preceding the pauses can predict their function as clause boundary markers with high precision and recall, while information about the gestures co-occurring with speech (head movements, facial expressions, and body postures) does not contribute to the prediction.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8129-1; POD:978-1-4673-8130-7; USB:978-1-4673-8128-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2015.7390650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7390650","Machine Learning;Multimodal communication;Semantic boundary pauses","Magnetic heads;Semantics;Sequential analysis;Shape;Speech;Speech processing;Tracking","gesture recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);speech processing","audio-recorded corpus;body postures;clause boundary pause;facial expressions;gestures;head movements;semantic boundaries;semantic units;speech pause;speech tokens;video-recorded corpus","","","","41","","","19-21 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This article focus on the problem that if the data collected from the sensors are valid or not. It tested the validation of an specified acceleration sensor on a truss structure by using Naive Bayesian Classifier (NBC) based on one kind of machine learning technology whose theory basis is probability statistics. In the course of data analyzing, the theoretical values modified by Finite Element Modeling are taken as an criterion of testing collected data from sensors. The continuous type of data are discretized by several different discretization methods. The classifier is created by discretized training data and used to test the validation of the specified sensor. It is proved that the testing method is effective.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8660-9; POD:978-1-4673-8661-6","10.1109/CIS.2015.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396295","Machine Learning;Naive Bayesian Classifier;Validation of Sensors","Acceleration;Algorithm design and analysis;Bayes methods;Classification algorithms;Redundancy;Sensors;Training data","Bayes methods;data analysis;finite element analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability;sensors;structural engineering computing;supports","NBC;acceleration sensor;collected data testing;data analysis;discretized training data;finite element modeling;machine learning technology;naive Bayesian classifier;probability statistics;sensor validation method;structural experiments;truss structure","","","","11","","","19-20 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Therefore, more and more scholars have concentrated on the issues about recognition the traffic signs by using computer vision and machine learning techniques. And now, traffic signs recognition algorithm has become an important part of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). A novel traffic signs recognition algorithm, which based on machine vision and machine learning techniques, is proposed in this paper. There are two steps in our algorithm: detection and recognition. First of all, the candidate regions are detected by using the color features of the pixels in the detection step. Next, the cascaded Feedforward Neural Networks with Random Weights (FNNRW) classifiers are utilized for shape and content recognition. The experimental results indicate that the average running time of the whole system is less than 40ms, with an accuracy rate of about 91 percent. Therefore, the proposed system has good performance both in accuracy and efficiency and is suitable for the application of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4673-7681-5; Electronic:978-1-4673-7682-2; POD:978-1-4673-7683-9","10.1109/FSKD.2015.7382137","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7382137","Feedforward Neural Networks with Random Weights (FNNRW);Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) features;machine learning;machine vision","Advanced driver assistance systems;Classification algorithms;Image color analysis;Roads;Shape;Training;Vehicles","driver information systems;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;object recognition;road safety;shape recognition","ADAS;FNNRW;advanced driver assistant systems;computer vision;content recognition;driving requirements;environmental information;feedforward neural networks with random weights classifiers;machine learning techniques;road change;shape recognition;traffic sign classification;traffic sign detection;traffic signs recognition algorithm","","","","16","","","15-17 Aug. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
