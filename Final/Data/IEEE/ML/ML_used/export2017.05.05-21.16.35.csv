If a sequence is taken as a set, then there is the RS (rough set) indiscernibility relation in the universe (U). And because a sequence is also of positions of its individuals, there is the partial order relation on U. Firstly, this paper combines these two relations and puts forward the necessary condition that indicates the difference of the RS discriminant indices between sequence sorted correctly and another sorted wrongly. Secondly, this paper points out that if a sequence does not meet the necessary condition, there must be some wrong permutation order in the sequence and it gives an algorithm to recognize and correct its wrong order. Lastly, a simulation example was examined and the result shows that the RS quality coefficient of approximation of classification is increased by 22 percents.

Based on the thought of life sciences and systems engineering, a bionics model of dam safety monitoring was proposed. From the viewpoint of a vital and intelligent system, this paper designed a monitoring system of dam safety, which was composed of integration control, comprehensive inference engine, project database, model base, graphics base, and input/output modules. Metadata base based on OODM was used to implement the integration of homogeneous or nonhomogeneous databases storing dam safety data from different information sources. The multilevel link style was adopted to manage model base. This work used the fuzzy theory and artificial neural networks to build the inference models, which can analyze and evaluate the run characteristics of dams. In practice, the proposed system has been used to monitor dam safety successfully. The applications show that the bionics model is feasible, the system structure is reasonable, the proposed key technologies are effective. The systems can supply technical support for improving the level of dam safety management, extending normal run time of dam and voiding dam failure.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382353","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382353","","Deductive databases;Engines;Fuzzy neural networks;Graphics;Information analysis;Intelligent systems;Monitoring;Pattern recognition;Safety;Systems engineering and theory","biocybernetics;computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;dams;diagnostic reasoning;fuzzy set theory;meta data;neural nets;object-oriented databases;safety","artificial neural networks;bionics model;dam safety monitoring system;fuzzy theory;graphics base;inference engine;integration control;intelligent system;metadata base;model base;project database","","0","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

All bitplanes of MSR are up shifted firstly. The bitplanes of GSRB can be shifted by a flexible method called multi-bitplane-alternating shift (MBAShift). AU bitplanes of LSRB are not shifted.

On the basis of describing the related concepts and a formal description method, this paper mainly presents two algorithms for achieving self-stabilization of the protocols. One algorithm, called the global state algorithm (GSA), can be used to obtain the global states of under case of a loss of cooperation of the different processes in the communication protocol, which can be applied to a recovery point that can be used by following recovery procedure for self-stabilizing a communication protocol. Second algorithm, called recovery stabilization algorithm (RSA), uses the contextual information exchanged during progress process of the protocol. After a failure is detected, all processes can eventually know the error by RSA. This paper gives also correctness proof and complexity analysis of these algorithms, and verifies the efficiency of the algorithms by illustrating the example protocols.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378306","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378306","","Algorithm design and analysis;Computer science;Context;Design methodology;Electronic mail;IP networks;Mobile communication;Next generation networking;Protocols;Quality of service","Internet;communication complexity;protocols;quality of service","QoS;communication complexity;communication protocol design;communication protocol self stabilisation;contextual information exchange;formal description method;global state algorithm;multimedia networks;next generation Internet;next generation networks;recovery stabilization algorithm","","0","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This multiwavelets motion model is particularly useful in estimating optical flows from the image sequence. In the gradient-based method, the computation of the motion field depends on minimizing the energy function and smoothness constraints. The proposed approach takes advantage of the nature of the multiwavelets theory, which can simultaneously possess desirable properties to model the vector fields and image related functions. Each flow vector and image function is represented by a linear combination of the multwavelets basis functions.

The basic idea is that there exists nine harmonic images that can be derived from a 3D model of a face, and by which we can estimate the illumination coefficient of any face sample. Using an illumination radio image, we can produce images under new lighting conditions. To detect the faces under certain lighting condition, we relight the original face samples to get more new faces under different kinds of possible lighting condition, and add them to the training set. Our experimental results on support vector machine (SVM) turns out that the relighting subspace is effective in face detection under various lighting conditions. Moreover, if we relight original face samples to the new samples under different illuminations, the collected example sets are multiplied. We use the expanded database to train an AdaBoost-based face detector and test it on the MIT+CMU frontal face test set. The experimental results show that the data collection can be efficiently speeded up by the proposed methods. The later experiment also verifies the generalization capability of the proposed method.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380483","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380483","","Computer science;Face detection;Face recognition;Frequency;Image databases;Laboratories;Lighting;Multimedia computing;Support vector machines;Testing","face recognition;image sampling;object detection;support vector machines","face detection;face relighting technology;harmonic image;illumination coefficient estimation;illumination radio image;support vector machine;variable lighting","","1","","22","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the resources are owned by different individuals or organizations with their own policies, have different access and cost models, and have dynamically varying loads and availability. To address the confronted issues, we propose an adaptive approach in this paper for distributed services composition and allocation, which is service-centric and workflow-oriented. We use XML to describe the services by encoding such factors as resource configuration, performance, and service-specific capabilities, which enables services to be easily developed, composed, deployed, relocated, monitored and managed in distributed environments. We use service composition technology to construct composite service by combining several independent services, which can be considered as the element services of the composite service, executed as workflow process. The allocation of such element services will be decided dynamically due to the economic objective function to address the issues of adaptation, availability, performance and economic cost.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380762","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380762","","Availability;Costs;Distributed computing;Encoding;Environmental economics;Kernel;Processor scheduling;Resource management;Web and internet services;XML","Internet;XML;telecommunication services;workflow management software","XML;adaptive workflow-oriented service;distributed resource;distributed services allocation;distributed services composition;economic objective function;service composition technology;service management;service scheduling;workflow process","","6","1","10","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We apply the proposed methods to phoneme classification on TIMIT speech corpus and show indeed that we are able to achieve about 2% percent improvement in recognition rate over that of the classical HMM.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378574","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378574","","Biological system modeling;Character recognition;Continuing education;Educational technology;Handwriting recognition;Hidden Markov models;Information analysis;Pattern recognition;Sequences;Speech recognition","hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;speech recognition","HMM based pattern recognition;TIMIT speech corpus;hidden state level information;learning;phoneme classification;state posterior probability trajectories","","0","","5","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, this algorithm sets the radius of the images of the training samples in the feature space using kernel tricks, then determines whether the samples are outliers or not, and finally analyzes the training samples which have eliminated the outliers using KPCA algorithm. The improved KPCA algorithm not only retains the non-linearity property of KPCA algorithm but also gets better robustness. Because the effects of outliers are eliminated, robust KPCA algorithm gets higher accuracy than KPCA algorithm for data analysis.

This paper proposes a maximum a posteriori (MAP) scheme for the transduction. The probability measure defined for the estimation is induced by the code length of the prediction error and the model with respect to some coding systems. The ideal MAP transduction is essential to minimize the so-called stochastic complexity. Approximations to the ideal MAP transduction are also addressed, where one or multiple models of the function are estimated as well as the values at the working sample. This work investigates, for both pattern classification and regression, that under what condition the approximated MAP transduction is better than the traditional induction, which learns models from the training samples and then computes the value at the given points. Analysis on whether the working samples compress the description length of the model is also presented. For some coding systems it does, for others it doesn't. For fairness, a universal coding system should be adopted, but it involves the problem of not recursively computable.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1382169","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1382169","","Bayesian methods;Length measurement;Pattern classification;Predictive models;Probability distribution;Stochastic processes;Text categorization","maximum likelihood estimation;pattern classification;regression analysis;stochastic processes","coding system;maximum a posteriori scheme;pattern classification;posteriori transduction;regression analysis;stochastic complexity;training samples","","0","","6","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design a genetic-based classifier system (CS), which recognizes a target utilizing audio fingerprints. Audio fingerprint technology can extract some unique feature from a given sound clip, and it is similar to that one man's fingerprint can identify a unique person himself, dissimilar sound leading to different fingerprint. All these have none business with the sound object's store way (analog or digital) or format (MP3, WAV, WMA, etc.). Compared with traditional CS, the proposed comparing and matching algorithm would give the fitness value more explicitly statistical meaning, which would make us easier to explain the rules with background knowledge. The proposed hyperplasia operator can handle those instances, which have not been emerged before. It gives the system persistent learning abilities, so the system may be more compatible with the surroundings. The proposed refining classifier merges those redundant rules and shrinks the rule set. In addition, we set an alterable mutation probability to the genetic algorithm in the CS, and the experiment shows that this strategy increases the speed and the accuracy of the classifying operation. We propose a highly automatic underwater target classifier system, and we keep improving it. We expect it can be competent in the recognition with minimum hardware requirements.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378276","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378276","","Dynamic range;Environmental management;Expert systems;Fingerprint recognition;Genetic algorithms;Radar;Sonar;Target recognition;Technology management;Underwater tracking","audio signal processing;feature extraction;fingerprint identification;genetic algorithms;pattern classification;pattern matching;probability","alterable mutation probability;audio fingerprint technology;automatic underwater target classifier system;feature extraction;genetic algorithm;genetic based classifier system;hyperplasia operator;target recognition;underwater target detection","","1","","12","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Based on the actual design data for various types of induction motors, cascaded artificial neural networks have been trained to give better solutions for the fundamental quantities and parameters of individual induction motor. After the training, the selected quantities have been estimated quite accurately from the specification of the individual induction motor on the cascaded artificial neural networks. The proposed neural network based designing system is quite efficient to reduce the designing process and also to have the sub-optimal design even in a restricted time period without the knowledge of experts.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1378512","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1378512","","Artificial neural networks;Compressors;Cooling;Fans;Induction motors;Neural networks;Nonlinear equations;Parameter estimation;Rotors;Voltage","design engineering;induction motors;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;power engineering computing","ANN based designing system;cascaded artificial neural network;industrial induction motors;neural network training;power engineering computing","","2","","8","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the severely mixed cuttings have greatly increased the difficulty in collecting samples through traditional geochemical logging technique. Based on the further study on geochemical logging and gas logging techniques, a new approach is presented in the paper to analyze rock cutting samples by hydrocarbon component through complete degasification. In addition, using PLC programmed control, an automatic degasification system of hydrocarbon component in rock cuttings is developed, which has achieved good testing results. The precision of exploration for petroleum and natural gas is hereby enhanced.","","POD:0-7803-8403-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2004.1380740","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380740","","Drilling;Engineering drawings;Equations;Geologic measurements;Helium;Hydrocarbon reservoirs;Instruments;Laboratories;Natural gas;Petroleum","chemical analysis;cutting;drilling;natural gas technology;petroleum;programmable controllers;rocks","PLC programmed control;automatic degasification system;drill bit technique;gas logging technique;geochemical logging technique;hydrocarbon component;natural gas;petroleum exploration;rock cutting;well drilling technique","","1","","10","","","26-29 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
