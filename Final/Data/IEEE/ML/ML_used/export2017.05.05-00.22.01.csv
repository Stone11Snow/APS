We state the co-clustering problem in terms of non-parametric generative models which can address the issue of estimating the number of row and column clusters from a hypothesis space of an infinite number of clusters. To reach large scale applications of co-clustering we exploit that parameter inference for co-clustering is well suited for parallel computing. We develop a generic GPU framework for efficient inference on large scale sparse bipartite networks and achieve a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to estimation based on conventional CPUs. In terms of scalability we find for networks with more than 100 million links that reliable inference can be achieved in less than an hour on a single GPU. To efficiently manage memory consumption on the GPU we exploit the structure of the posterior likelihood to obtain a decomposition that easily allows model estimation of the co-clustering problem on arbitrary large networks as well as distributed estimation on multiple GPUs. Finally we evaluate the implementation on real-life large scale collaborative filtering data and web scale text corpora, demonstrating that latent mesoscale structures extracted by the co-clustering problem as formulated by the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) are consistent across consecutive runs with different initializations and also relevant for interpretation of the underlaying processes in such large scale networks.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064611","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064611","","Collaboration;Data models;Generators;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Memory management;Motion pictures","Internet;computer graphic equipment;coprocessors;inference mechanisms;information filtering;parallel processing;pattern clustering;text analysis","GPU;Web scale text corpora;Web scale text processing;collaborative filtering;infinite relational model;large scale sparse bipartite networks;market basket analysis;nonparametric coclustering;nonparametric generative models;parallel computing;parameter inference;posterior likelihood","","5","1","34","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Unfortunately most kernels require careful tuning of intrinsic parameters to correctly model the distribution of the underlying data. For large-scale problems the multiplicative scaling in time complexity imposed by introducing free parameters in a cross-validation setup will prove computationally infeasible, often leaving pure ad-hoc estimates as the only option. In this contribution we investigate a novel randomized approach for kernel parameter selection in large-scale multi-class data. We fit a minimum enclosing ball to the class means in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS), and use the radius as a quality measure of the space, defined by the kernel parameter. We apply the developed algorithm to a computer vision paradigm where the objective is to recognize 72.000 objects among 1.000 classes.

In this way, bias vs variance compromise is managed independently in each block, allowing an enhancement if the energy of the unknown system is non-uniformly distributed.

Nonetheless, the amount of data may be quite large in practical applications, and this may limit the real-time applicability of CAMNS-AVM. In this paper, we propose a fast CAMNS-AVM algorithm involving three complexity reduction methods, specifically problem equivalence, redundant constraints removal, and customized algorithm implementation. The problem equivalence provides sufficiency in solving one linear program (LP) for each partial volume maximization problem, rather than the two LPs required by the original CAMNS-AVM. Then, we remove redundant constraints of each LP involved in CAMNS-AVM by using Quickhull algorithm to enumerate all the extreme points of the constraint-set-constructed convex hull. Finally, we implement a customized primal-dual interior-point method (IPM) for LP. Some Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that the fast CAMNS-AVM algorithm is thirty times more computationally efficient than the original CAMNS-AVMalgorithm, without any performance loss.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064571","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064571","Alternating volume maximization;Complexity reduction;Interior-point method;Linear programming;Non-negative blind source separation","Algorithm design and analysis;Blind source separation;Computational complexity;Linear matrix inequalities;Signal processing algorithms;Vectors","Monte Carlo methods;blind source separation;optimisation","CAMNS-AVM algorithm;Monte Carlo simulation;Quickhull algorithm;complexity reduction method;constraint-set-constructed convex hull;convex analysis;customized algorithm;customized primal-dual interior-point method;image analysis;iterative nonnegative blind source separation;linear program;partial volume maximization problem;redundant constraint;volume maximization algorithm","","0","","17","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The corresponding source signals and the set of temporal filters that operate on them constitute an efficient time-frequency decomposition of the LFP. This decomposition has the potential to identify sources that are more statistically dependent with stimuli or single-cell activity than the raw signal. In this work we show preliminary results on a synthetic dataset and a real dataset recorded from a rats nucleus accumbens during a reward administering experiment.

However, tracking multiple vehicles simultaneously on airborne platform is a challenging problem, owing to uncertain vehicle motion and visible frame-to-frame jitter caused by camera vibration. To address these problems, a new collaborative tracking framework is proposed. The framework consists of two level tracking processes: to track vehicles as groups, the higher level builds the relevance network and divides target vehicles into different groups; the relevance is calculated based on the status information of vehicles obtained by the lower level. This kind of group tracking takes into account the relevance of vehicles and reduces the impact of camera vibration, so the proposed method is applicable for multi-vehicle tracking in airborne videos.

The tree-structured prior [1, 2, 3] is one such prior which allows important multi-scale spatial correlations that exist in natural images to be captured. Two main types of tree structure prior have been previously proposed: 1) fixed quadtree structure [1], which suffers from âblockinessâ in the segmentation results and 2) flexible tree structure [2, 3] which can adapt its structure to the natural object boundary but at a significant computational cost. This paper presents a novel probabilistic unsupervised image segmentation framework called Irregular Tree-Structured Bayesian Networks (ITSBN) which introduces the notion of irregular tree structure that combines the merits of the two previous approaches. As in [2, 3], more natural object boundaries can be modeled in our framework since a tree is learned for each input image. Our method, however, does not update the adaptive structure at every iteration which drastically reduces the computation required. We derive a time-efficient exact inference algorithm based on a sum-product framework using factor graphs [4]. Furthermore, a novel methodology for the evaluation of unsupervised image segmentation is proposed. By integrating non-parametric density estimation techniques with the traditional precision-recall framework, the proposed method is more robust to boundary inconsistency due to human subjects.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064604","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064604","Bayesian networks;Unsupervised image segmentation;graphical models;precision-recall framework;tree structure","Adaptation models;Bayesian methods;Computational modeling;Graphical models;Image color analysis;Image segmentation;Inference algorithms","graph theory;image segmentation;natural scenes;nonparametric statistics;probability;quadtrees;smoothing methods;unsupervised learning","ITSBN;adaptive structure;boundary inconsistency;factor graphs;fixed quadtree structure;flexible tree structure;irregular tree structure;irregular tree-structured Bayesian networks;multiscale spatial correlations;natural images;natural object boundary;nonparametric density estimation techniques;precision-recall framework;probabilistic smoothing;probabilistic unsupervised image segmentation framework;sum-product framework;time-efficient exact inference algorithm;tree structure prior;tree-structured prior;unsupervised image segmentation algorithms","","3","","18","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The convergence and performance of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by means of several simulation examples, including an application consisting in the joint blind source separation (J-BSS) of three color images.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064584","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064584","Independent vector analysis (IVA);canonical correlation analysis (CCA);joint blind source separation (J-BSS);second-order statistics (SOS)","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Convergence;Cost function;Covariance matrix;Maximum likelihood estimation;Vectors","Gaussian processes;correlation methods;least squares approximations;maximum likelihood estimation","GML-IVA algorithm;Gaussian data set;canonical correlation analysis;color image;independent vector analysis;joint blind source separation;least squares problem;maximum likelihood approach;nonconvex IVA cost function;quadratic approximation","","5","","13","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

It therefore allows the monitoring and optimization of infrastructures using a signal that is often already available. Absolute positions can be obtained by combining the usage logs with a small number of hand-labeled positions of users and/or devices. The method exploits the characteristic that each time a user uses the infrastructure he typically interacts with the device that is closest to his physical position. This gives information about closest pairs. Special jobs that cannot be performed on all devices, the temporary unavailability of devices, or other reasons that prevent users from using the closest device, allow relative locations to be determined based on relationships beyond pairs, hence breaking the symmetries and ambiguities that would remain if only pairs could be used. This procedure is similar in spirit to the process of trilateration: a geometric method for determining the intersections of spheres given their centers and radii. Experiments show that a probabilistic model combined with Bayesian inference makes it possible to infer user and device locations relatively accurately in many settings and gives sensible descriptions of uncertainty in cases the logs do not provide enough information.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064591","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064591","","Image edge detection;Legged locomotion;Markov processes;Printers;Probabilistic logic;Switches;Uncertainty","Bayes methods;inference mechanisms;mobile computing;probability","Bayesian inference;device localization;infrastructure usage logs;probabilistic device log trilateration;sphere intersection;user localization","","0","","9","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Typical usage of an adaptive filter can be effective for feedback reduction but it relies on the presence of such a filter on the side of the far speaker in order to reduce feedback on the side of the near speaker. In order to avoid this reliance on the far speaker's setup, we can use an adaptive filter on the side of the near speaker. Unfortunately, due to non-linear speech coding typically used during speech transmission, these filters perform poorly in this situation. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic method, using a non-negative convolutive decomposition of spectrogram data to perform feedback reduction by posing the problem as a source separation problem. Our method is robust to non-linear speech coding as well as continuous double-talk, which often presents a challenge to adaptive filters.

There are two advantages of the proposed PVI: on one hand, its computational complexity is low, and on the other hand, it has flexibility of tuning the parameters to meet different datasets, especially the microarray datasets.

Sample reduction methods have been proposed and shown to reduce the training complexity significantly, but more or less trade off the generalization performance. This paper presents an efficient sample reduction method for multi-class classification using one-vs-rest SVMs, called Multi-class Sample Selection (MUSS). For each binary one-vs-rest classification problem, positive samples and negative samples are selected based on the distances from the cluster centers of positive class, assuming that positive samples with large distances from the positive centers and negative samples with small distances from the positive centers are near the classification boundary. The intention of clustering is to improve the computation efficiency of sample selection, other than to select from cluster centers as previous methods did. Experiments on a wide variety of datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MUSS over other competitive algorithms in respect of the tradeoff between reduced sample size and classification performance.

In this paper, a new fMRI simulation toolbox (SimTB) is used to simulate multi-subject realistic fMRI datasets that include inter-subject variability. We study the performance of two JBSS algorithms representing two different approaches to the problem: (1) a recently proposed IVA algorithm combining second-order and higher-order statistics denoted by IVA-GL; and (2) a JBSS solution found by jointly diagonalizing cross-cumulant matrices denoted IVA-GJD.

We applied the modified RPEM to train speaker models with the number of Gaussian mixture components adapted individually to each speaker and used it to perform some basic speaker recognition experiments. The experiments are very reassuring about using the modified RPEM as a training method for GMM based speaker recognition.

For this purpose, 832,612 manually ground-truthed handwritten digit patterns are used. Use of character patterns instead of general visual object patterns is very essential for our purpose. First, since there are only 10 classes for digits, it is possible to have an enough number of patterns per class. Second, since the feature space of small binary character images is rather compact, it is easier to observe the precise pattern distribution with a fixed number of patterns.

When there is a small amount of data, the uncertainty of the parameters is high. Thus with the predictive distribution, a more reliable result can be obtained in the applications as classification, recognition, etc. In the previous works, we have utilized the variational inference framework to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters in the beta distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the true posterior distribution from the approximating one. However, the predictive distribution of the beta distribution was approximated by a plug-in approximation with the posterior mean, regardless of the parameter uncertainty. In this paper, we carry on the factorized approximation introduced in the previous work and approximate the beta function by its first order Taylor expansion. Then the upper bound of the predictive distribution is derived by exploiting the local variational method. By minimizing the upper bound of the predictive distribution and after normalization, we approximate the predictive distribution by a probability density function in a closed form.

Extreme value theory (EVT) is a branch of statistics that is concerned with modelling extremal events, and is therefore appealing for use with novelty detection. However, conventional existing EVT approaches are limited to the analysis of univariate or low-dimension data. This paper considers the peaks-over-threshold method of EVT, in which exceedances over a (typically univariate) threshold can be shown to tend towards the generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We extend this method for use with high-dimensional data, allowing us to reason about the âextremeâ data lying in the tails of the distributions of complex, real-world datasets, which are typically multivariate and multimodal.

We investigated the two methods by performing independent component analysis (ICA) on the estimated signal subspace, assuming the number of selected principal components composing the signal subspace is equal to the number of sources of brain activities. Through examining wavelet-filtered EEG recordings (128 electrodes) of ERPs, ICA with the reference to GAP decomposed 14 selected principal components reliably into 14 independent components, and ICA decomposition with the variance explained method was not reliable, indicating that the number of sources, as well as the signal subspace, should be well estimated through GAP.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064590","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064590","Event-related potential;independent/principal component analysis;model order selection;number of sources;reliability;wavelet filter","Brain modeling;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Noise;Principal component analysis;Reliability","bioelectric potentials;electroencephalography;filtering theory;independent component analysis;medical signal processing;principal component analysis;wavelet transforms","ERP;GAP;ICA decomposition;brain activity;estimated signal subspace;event-related potentials;high-density EEG recordings;high-density electroencephalography recordings;independent component analysis;model order selection method;noise subspace;principal components;signal space;variance explained method;wavelet-filtered EEG recordings","","1","","24","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed method employs a Bayesian framework based on a SGLI (spatial gradient and local inhomogeneity) prior. The SGLI prior is from two discontinuity measures which have been utilized as an illumination normalization method for robust face recognition. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives an averaging 0.21 dB gain in PSNR for the JPEG compression artifact reduction.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064558","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064558","","Cameras;Filtering;Manganese;PSNR;Smoothing methods","Bayes methods;belief networks;data compression;face recognition;gradient methods;image coding","Bayesian framework;Bayesian method;JPEG compressed images;JPEG compression artifact reduction;JPEG images;PSNR;SGLI prior;discontinuity measures;high frequency components;illumination normalization method;picture quality;ringing artifact reduction;robust face recognition;sharp edges;spatial gradient and local inhomogeneity prior;unpleasant viewing experiences","","0","","12","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This study presents a new Bayesian nonparametric approach to conduct unsupervised learning of a hierarchical topic and sentence model (HTSM). This HTSM discovers an extended hierarchy in the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) where each sentence is assigned by a hierarchical topic path. A tree structure with distributions ranging from broad topics to precise topics is established. The dependencies among sentences are characterized. The words in different sentences are represented by a shared hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). The topic mixtures in word level and sentence level are estimated according to unsupervised nonparametric processes based on HDP and nCRP, respectively. Compared with the nCRP representing a document based on a single path, the proposed HTSM is flexible with a new nCRP where multiple paths are incorporated to generate different sentences of a document. A summarization system is developed to extract semantically-rich sentences from documents. A new Gibbs sampling algorithm is developed to infer the structural parameters of HTSM.

The potential of the paradigm is demonstrated and discussed in terms of learning rates and robustness by evaluating the predictive performance under various noise conditions on a synthetic dataset.

"A practical approach for depth estimation and image restoration using defocus cue","K. R. Ranipa; M. V. Joshi","","2011 IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","20111031","2011","","","1","6","Reconstruction of depth from 2D images is an important research issue in computer vision. Depth from defocus (DFD) technique uses space varying blurring of an image as a cue in reconstructing the 3D structure of a scene. In this paper we explore the regularization based approach for simultaneous estimation of depth and image restoration from defocused observations. We are given two defocused observations of a scene that are captured with different camera parameters. Our method consists of two steps. First we obtain the initial estimates for the depth as well as for the focused image. In the second step we refine the solution by using a fast optimization technique. Here we use the classic depth recovery method due to Subbarao for obtaining the initial depth map and Weiner filter approach for initial image restoration. Since the problem we are solving is ill-posed and does not yield unique solution, it is necessary to regularize the solution by imposing additional constraint to restrict the solution space. The regularization is performed by imposing smoothness constraint only. However, for preserving the depth and image intensity discontinuities, they are identified prior to the minimization process from initial estimates of the depth map and the restored image. The final solution is obtained by using computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm, thus avoiding the need for computationally taxing algorithms. The depth as well as intensity edge details of the final solution correspond to those obtained using the initial estimates. The experimental results indicate that the quality of the restored image is good even under severe space-varying blur conditions.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064594","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064594","","Approximation methods;Cameras;Cost function;Detectors;Estimation;Image edge detection;Image restoration","Wiener filters;computer vision;gradient methods;image restoration;minimisation","2D image;Wiener filter approach;computer vision;defocus cue;depth estimation;depth from defocus technique;depth map;depth reconstruction;depth recovery method;fast optimization technique;gradient descent algorithm;image restoration;minimization process;regularization based approach;space varying blurring","","1","","18","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Three cost-sensitive boosting algorithms are compared in this paper in the task of lesion detection of gastroscopic images. The optimal cost structure is selected for each boosting algorithm. Threshold obtained adaptively from training set is adopted to get the final result of a novel sample instead of the sign function. Classification performance becomes better after adaptive threshold is used. Experimental results show that Cost-sensitive AdaBoost performs the best for lesion detection of gastroscopic images achieving a sensitivity of 77.34% with the threshold obtained on training set at a target detection rate of 80%.

Following (Hansen et al., 2011) we model top-down attention as a sequential decision making process driven by a task - modeled as a classification problem - in an environment with random subsets of features missing, but where we have the possibility to gather additional features among the ones that are missing. Thus, the top-down attention problem is reduced to finding the answer to the question what to measure next? Attention is based on the top-down saliency of the missing features given as the estimated difference in classification confusion (entropy) with and without the given feature. The difference in confusion is computed conditioned on the available set of features. In this work, we make our attention model more realistic by also allowing the initial training phase to take place with incomplete data. Thus, we expand the model to include a missing data technique in the learning process. The top-down attention mechanism is implemented in a Gaussian Discrete mixture model setting where marginals and conditionals are relatively easy to compute. To illustrate the viability of expanded model, we train the mixture model with two different datasets, a synthetic data set and the well-known Yeast dataset of the UCI database. We evaluate the new algorithm in environments characterized by different amounts of incompleteness and compare the performance with a system that decides next feature to be measured at random.

However, this effect of the misclassification measure on robustness increase has been questioned in recent studies. In this paper, we clarify the cause of the measure's insufficiency and propose a solution by developing a new MCE training method using geometric margin as the misclassification measure. To maintain the high application generality of the MCE framework, we derive the geometric margin for a general class of discriminant functions and demonstrate the utility of our new MCE method by installing the newly formulated general geometric margin to widely used prototype-based discriminant functions.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064639","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064639","Discriminative training;geometric margin;minimum classification error;misclassification measure","Loss measurement;Prototypes;Robustness;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","pattern classification;probability","MCE training method;classification correctness;geometric margin enhancement;minimum classification error training;misclassification measure;pattern classifier design;robust pattern recognition","","2","","21","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The proposed technique employs adaptive diffusion algorithms that enable adaptation, learning, and cooperation at local levels.

In addition to the ones reported in the literature, we also consider other types of classifiers such as the multilayer feedforward neural network based on multi-valued neurons (MLMVN), and the classifier based on fuzzy logic, which we especially tuned for phase-based SSVEP decoding. The dependency of the decoding accuracy on the number of targets and on the decoding window size are discussed. When comparing existing phase-based SSVEP decoding methods with the proposed ones, we are able to show that the latter ones perform better, for different parameter settings, but especially when having multiple targets. The necessity of optimizing the target frequencies to the individual subject is also discussed.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064563","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064563","Steady state visual evoked potential;brain signals;decoding;phase shift","Accuracy;Decoding;Electrodes;Electroencephalography;Neurons;Training;Visualization","brain-computer interfaces;feedforward neural nets;fuzzy logic;pattern classification;visual evoked potentials","SSVEP recordings;brain-computer interface;classifiers;fuzzy logic;multi valued neurons;multilayer feedforward neural network;phase-based information decoding;steady-state visual evoked potential recordings","","0","","23","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally, features are extracted in sparse coding in specific locations, however, often we would prefer invariant representation. This paper introduces a general transformation invariant sparse coding (TISC) model. The model decomposes images into features invariant to location and general transformation by a set of specified operators as well as a sparse coding matrix indicating where and to what degree in the original image these features are present. The TISC model is in general overcomplete and we therefore invoke sparse coding to estimate its parameters. We demonstrate how the model can correctly identify components of non-trivial artificial as well as real image data. Thus, the model is capable of reducing feature redundancies in terms of pre-specified transformations improving the component identification.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064547","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064547","","Algorithm design and analysis;Encoding;Feature extraction;Image coding;Image reconstruction;Oscillators;Visualization","image coding;unsupervised learning","TISC model;component identification;invariant representation;transformation invariant sparse coding;unsupervised learning","","7","","26","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For instance, capturing the structure based on statistical regularities of data can be thought of as a problem of relevance determination, that is, information preservation under limited resources. The principle of relevant information is an information theoretic objective function that attempts to capture the statistical regularities through entropy minimization under an information preservation constraint. Here, we employ an information theoretic reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) formulation, which can overcome some of the limitations of previous approaches based on Parzen density estimation. Results are competitive with kernel-based feature extractors such as kernel PCA. Moreover, the proposed framework goes further on the relation between information theoretic learning, kernel methods and support vector algorithms.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064633","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064633","Information theoretic learning;kernel methods;unsupervised learning","Entropy;Estimation;Hilbert space;Information theory;Kernel;Support vector machines;TV","Hilbert spaces;entropy;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Parzen density estimation;entropy minimization;information preservation constraint;information theoretic learning;information theoretic objective function;information theoretic reproducing kernel Hilbert space formulation;kernel PCA;kernel methods;kernel-based feature extractors;relevance determination problem;relevant information principle;statistical regularities;support vector algorithms","","0","","25","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional speaker segmentation and clustering is performed by the hierarchical clustering algorithms with Bayesian information criterion (BIC) metric and cross likelihood ratio (CLR) metric after the speakers are segmented. Since this method has high computational complexity and may result in a suboptimal solution, we use spectral clustering to overcome this problem and improve the performance of clustering algorithm. First the affinity matrix is constructed with the mean supervector feature transformed by KL kernel mapping. And then the scaling parameter is selected adaptively. The experiments performed on the NIST 1998 multi-speaker corpus show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline system.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4577-1623-2; POD:978-1-4577-1621-8; USB:978-1-4577-1622-5","10.1109/MLSP.2011.6064579","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6064579","Bayesian information criterion;Speaker segmentation and clustering;Spectral Clustering","Clustering algorithms;Clustering methods;Kernel;Measurement;NIST;Speech;Viterbi algorithm","Bayes methods;matrix algebra;pattern clustering;speaker recognition","BIC metric;Bayesian information criterion;CLR metric;KL kernel mapping;affinity matrix;cross likelihood ratio;hierarchical clustering algorithm;mean supervector feature;scaling parameter;speaker clustering;speaker segmentation;spectral clustering","","0","","17","","","18-21 Sept. 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
