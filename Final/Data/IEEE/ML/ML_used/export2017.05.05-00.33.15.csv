Artificial Neural Networks is currently the promising area of interest to solve medical problems. Diagnosis of diabetes is one of the most challenging problems in machine learning. This medical data set is seldom complete. Artificial neural networks require complete set of data for an accurate classification. The system explains how the pre-processing procedure and missing values influence the data set during the classification. The implemented system compares various missing value techniques and pre-processing techniques. Some combinations prove the real influence of these techniques. A classifier has applied to Pima Indian Diabetes dataset and the results were improved tremendously when using certain combination of preprocessing and missing value techniques. The experimental system achieves an excellent classification accuracy of 99% which is best than before.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6007-6; POD:978-1-4244-6006-9","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.65","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5460760","Artificial Neural Networks;Back Propagation Method;Diabetes Mellitus;Missing Value Analysis;Pre Processing Methods","Artificial neural networks;Blood;Diabetes;Educational institutions;Insulin;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;Neural networks;Noise level;Sugar","diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medicine;neural nets;patient diagnosis;pattern classification;set theory","Diabetes Mellitus;Pima Indian Diabetes dataset;artificial neural networks;classification;data set;diagnosis preprocessing;machine learning;medicine","","2","","12","","","9-11 Feb. 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A coupling term related the CARE of the controller is found to be existed in the MEE of the observer. Unlike the separate principle to design the controller and observer separately without any coupling term, the design of the observer should consider the coupling term related to the CARE of the controller. The coupling problem between the controller and the observer usually exists in the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, and it is the main problem to be solved.

Owing to rapid development of the scanner technology, the volume of medical imaging data is becoming huger and huger. Automated segmentations of the target organ region are always required by the CAD systems. Although the analysis of lung fissures provides important information for treatment, it is still a challenge to extract fissures automatically based on the CT values because the appearance of lung fissures is very fuzzy and indefinite. Since the oblique fissures can be visualized more easily among other fissures on the chest CT images, they are used to check the exact localization of the lesions. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic fissure detection method based on the genetic algorithm to identify the oblique fissures.

Besides, the orientation information of these segments is more stable compared to orientation fields. It is a useful information for representing the fingerprints. In addition, each digital straight segment can be represented by four parameters: x-coordinate, y-coordinate, slope and length. It only needs about 600 bytes to store all the parameters of LDSSs of a fingerprint, which is much less than the storage orientation field needs. Finally, the LDSSs can automatically capture the maximum structural information of local regions. Consequently, LDSSs are more convenient to combine with the minutiae based methods than orientation fields.

With the trend toward taller and more flexible building structures, the use of vibration control devices, passive as well as active, as means of structural protection against strong wind and earthquakes have received significant attention in recent years. A mass-damper shaking table system has been considered as means for vibration suppression to external excitation and disturbances. In this paper, the direct experiment method is adopted to determine the control gains for better performance index. No explicitly system identification of the plant dynamics, no membership function and thus no fuzzification-defuzzification operation are required. For effective control performance, a neural classifier controller with genetic algorithm is developed. Compared with the conventional PI controller, neural network and fuzzy controller, the neural classifier controller using genetic algorithm has been presented with the effectiveness of the vibration suppression control.

We need to transfer each amino symbolic sequence as some useful physicochemical quantities by using Hurst exponent first, and then, some regression models may be considered. Combining the Hurst exponent and the Choquet integral regression model with respect to the well known fuzzy measure, L-measure, is first proposed in last year. Although L-measure is a multivalent measure and better than the well known fuzzy measures, λ-measure and P-measure, however it does not contain the additive measure and does not attain the largest fuzzy measure, B-measure. In accordance with above drawbacks, an improved L-measure, called generalized L-measure, was proposed, but this new fuzzy measure has not been used for combining the Hurst exponent to predict the temperature of thermostable proteins yet. In this paper, the sensitive comparison property between two completed fuzzy measures and some more properties of generalized L-measure are discussed, the method combining the Hurst exponent and the Choquet integral regression model with respect to generalized L-measure is proposed, a 5-fold Cross-Validation MSE is conducted. Experimental result shows that the Choquet integral regression model based on Hurst exponent and generalized L-measure has the best performance, it is better than Choquet integral regression model based on Hurst exponent and other fuzzy measures, including completed L-measure, L-measure, Lambda-measure, and P-measure, and the traditional prediction models, ridge regression and multiple linear regression models.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580685","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580685","Choquet integral;Generalized L-measure;Hurst exponent;L-measure;Maximized L-measure","Additives;Amino acids;Density functional theory;Density measurement;Predictive models;Proteins;Temperature measurement","biocomputing;fuzzy set theory;macromolecules;proteins;regression analysis","λ-measure;5-fold cross-validation MSE;Choquet integral algorithm;Choquet integral regression model;Hurst exponent;Lambda-measure;P-measure;amino symbolic sequences;fuzzy measure;generalized L-measure;multiple linear regression models;physicochemical quantity;regression model;temperature prediction;thermostable proteins","","1","","16","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Most of the artificial neural models merely emphasized the inter-neuronal relationship. Ignoring intra-neuronal dynamics is a simplification that might reduces the computational capability of the neurons. In this paper, a bio-inspired NeuroMolecular Computing Net (NMCN) model, which integrates inter-and intra-neuronal information processing so as to capture the biology-like malleability and gradual transformability, was proposed.

"Online supervised learning from multi-field documents for email spam filtering","W. Y. Liu; L. Wang; T.

Normally, the previous statistical TC algorithms treat an email as a single plain-text document, ignoring the multi-field feature of email documents. This paper investigates the multi-field feature, and proposes a multi-field learning (MFL) approach for email spam filtering. The MFL approach divides the complex TC problem of multi-field document into several sub-problems, and conquers each sub-problem separately. At online learning, multi-scorer is learned separately within its text field according to online supervised feedbacks. At online predicting, multi-scorer's output scores are combined to predict the new document's category. The MFL framework is a general frame to combine scorers implemented by any statistical TC algorithms. However, previous TC algorithms often require great training or updating time, which are impractical for large-scale email systems. Considering the space-time spending of email spam filtering, a string-frequency index (SFI) binary TC algorithm is proposed, which is based on the straightforward conditional probability and has low space-time complexity for both online learning and online predicting. The experimental results on TREC spam track show that the performances of online Bayesian and relaxed online SVMs algorithms can be improved by the MFL approach. Especially, the proposed SFI algorithm can achieve the state-of-the-art performance at greatly reduced computational cost within the MFL framework.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580676","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580676","Email Spam Filtering;Multi-field Document;Multi-field Learning;Online Supervised Learning;Text Classification","Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Filtering;Filtering algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Silicon;Training","e-mail filters;learning (artificial intelligence);unsolicited e-mail","binary text classification;conditional probability;email spam filtering;multi-field documents;multi-field learning;online supervised learning;string-frequency index","","2","","13","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper proposes a new statistical method combined with a simple classification algorithm that can discriminate epileptic EEG signals from normal signals. The statistical method extracts most significant spectral features by maximizing statistical distance between the epileptic and the normal power spectrums. The power spectrum density of EEG signals is estimated by the multi-taper method. A linear algorithm based on the Fisher discriminant analysis classifies the selected spectral features as either the epileptic or the normal class from the EEG recordings. The results demonstrate that our method could reach >99.6% classification accuracy while its computational complexity appears to be much lower than the previously proposed methods that exhibited similar classification performances.

There are three major tasks involved in the prediction system: (1) how to perceive driving events on the input sequence of driving conditions, (2) how to represent driving events, and (3) how to interpret driving events to decide whether or not they are hazardous. A directed acyclic graph, called the attributed driving relational map (ADRM), is introduced to represent driving events. The ADRM chronicles a driving event in terms of driving conditions. The prediction system evaluates the driving event to determine whether it is perilous or not by matching its ADRM against those of known dangerous driving events preserved in a database using a fuzzy attributed map matching technique. The database can automatically augment by including new dangerous driving events that approved any of the predefined danger criteria. A series of experiments with synthetic examples generated by a driving simulator have been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and rationality of the proposed system.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580474","Activation mechanism;Attributed driving relational map;Dangerous driving event prediction system;Driving safety assistance system;Fuzzy attributed map matching","Databases;Driver circuits;Equations;Hidden Markov models;Roads;Sensors;Vehicles","directed graphs;driver information systems;fuzzy set theory;road safety;roads","attributed driving relational map;dangerous driving event prediction;directed acyclic graph;expressways;fuzzy attributed map matching;prediction system","","0","","7","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First of all, we project the analyzed object onto the LAB color space and then find its principal color axis through the principal component analysis. Since the L axis corresponds to the intensity, we then rotate the found principal color axis for making it parallel to the L axis. After this rotation, the color distortions among different cameras can be reduced into minimum. Then, a hybrid classifier is designed for classifying objects into different categories even though they are captured under different lighting conditions. Based on a polar coordinate, a sampling technique is then proposed for extracting several important color features from AB plane. Then, using the SVM learning algorithm, a color classifier can be trained for classifying each object into different categories. For the non-color categories, we quantize the RGB channels into different levels. Then, another classifier is obtained for classifying each gray object into its corresponding category. Since the proposed color correction scheme reduce the problem of color distortions into a minimum, each object can be well classified and identified even though they are captured across different cameras and under lighting condition.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580787","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580787","","Cameras;Classification algorithms;Color;Image color analysis;Lighting;Object recognition;Vehicles","image colour analysis;object detection;pattern classification;principal component analysis;support vector machines","LAB color space;RGB channels;SVM learning algorithm;color classifier;color correction technique;cross-view object identification;hybrid classifier;principal color axis;principal color transformation;principal component analysis","","0","","10","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Under thirty real training images, experimental results demonstrated that the proposed TLIH algorithm has 1.13 dB and 0.75 dB image quality improvement when compared to the currently published two methods, one by Mese and Vaidyanathan and the other by Chung and Wu, respectively.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580742","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580742","Discrete cosine transform;inverse halftoning;learning process;lookup table;textures","Face;PSNR;Table lookup","discrete cosine transforms;image classification;image colour analysis;image reconstruction;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);table lookup","DCT-based learning scheme;TLIH algorithm;TLUT-based approach;classified textures;gray image reconstruction;image quality improvement;image textures;input halftone image;inverse halftoning;lookup table-based learning approach;reconstructed image quality;texture-and lookup table-based IH algorithm;texture-based learning approach","","0","","21","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Thus, people in general may find it difficult to learn by heart the tiles in sequence under dynamic situations, and some frauds are tempted to cheat in mahjong games. For the reason that Mahjong involves hands of 16 rounds of play, the chances of players being swindled may be increased. To make up for the shortage of the traditional video taping, this system distinguishes the players in an orderly fashion and reports to police when any player is found to lack or possess unknown tiles or exchange tiles. Since this system serves the function of database, it provides players with the function of reverse track and reflection of one's strategy and skills. Through repeated trials of four swindle types, this system is believed to provide 100-percent prevention of swindle, and in addition to greatly decreasing the possibility of swindle, it also helps players to improve their skills and thus is worth further development.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580761","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580761","Mahjong;RFID;Swindle","Antennas;Databases;Games;Monitoring;Radiofrequency identification;Tiles","entertainment;gesture recognition;object detection;radiofrequency identification","Chinese culture;RFID;antiswindle Mahjong system;mahjong games;reverse track;video taping","","0","","7","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For a networked target tracking system with single sensor, which consists of a state-vector and an observation-vector, the quantized state estimation with bandwidth constrained is studied under the centralized frame for wireless sensor network system in this paper. Firstly, the augmented state method is adopted to provide a more effective frame to solve the quantized filtering. Namely, the quantized error vector can be taken as a state component by the augmented technology. Accordingly, a novel quantized state estimator is proposed by using Kalman filter (KF). Secondly, because Strong Tracking Filtering (STF) has better estimation accuracy and the ability of processing state abrupt change than Kalman filter for the case with uncertain state model, another novel quantized state estimator is proposed by combing the STF with augmented state model.

This paper actually inherits that and uses G.A. to decided optimal Zigbee topology which explains in section 4.2. The related test and evaluation results in section 4.3 explain how to deploy an optimal Zigbee parking topology in the case campus. To Use Zigbee techniques as a back bone to develop ubiquitous applications has been warming up while current I.T. evolution moving from electrification to mobilization. However, most successful business cases still rely on mobile tools, such as PDA, WIFI, and GPS, to realize the concept of ubiquitous. The main challenges ahead for making real U-applications on the market are not only the definitions of zigbee specifications and protocols, but the related optimal database build-up and topology design methods. This paper aims to explore the necessary considerations between the gaps within ubiquitous information systems analysis and zigbee devices layout design using GA approach which could direct the right path for database arrangement. This follows the system development life cycle (SDLC) to identify a zigbee wireless network's optimal topology, data flows, and related database design. The case study was undertaken within Hsing-Wu college campus. This ensures the scenario based experiment design could be practical for the further applications. The main objectives are to build up a U-campus prototype to allow teachers and students getting more interactively information being everywhere. This system could benefit users to find services without asking. The research results reveal that using zigbee to build up U-campus parking applications are less manpower, capital assets, build-up time than the fixed intranet services.

The aim of data mining is extract the information from database and generate clear and understandable description of patterns. In this study we have introduced a new approach to generate association rules on numeric data. We propose a modified equal width binning interval approach to discretizing continuous valued attributes. The approximate width of the desired intervals is chosen based on the opinion of medical expert and is provided as an input parameter to the model. First we have converted numeric attributes into categorical form based on above techniques. Apriori algorithm is usually used for the market basket analysis was used to generate rules on Pima Indian diabetes data.

The drivers could change the path immediately according to the average vehicular if the average velocity of the next road segment is predicable. In this paper a neural network is used for prediction of average velocity, besides vehicles can collect the average velocity of current road segment to adjust the predicted average velocity of the next road segment. The collected average velocity is acquired from neighbor vehicles through VANET. There is no research considering the impact of weather factors on the average vehicular velocity previously. An example of weather condition affects the velocity, it is always low vehicular velocity on rainy day or in fog. In this paper, the proposed prediction considers the weather factors that include temperature, humidity and rainfall. This research is focus on urban VANET environments of Taipei in Taiwan, and the results show that the prediction of average velocity considering weather factors is more accurate than that without considering weather factors.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4244-6527-9; POD:978-1-4244-6526-2","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580743","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580743","Short-term average velocity prediction;VANET;intelligent transportation systems;neural network","Artificial neural networks;Forecasting;Mathematical model;Meteorology;Predictive models;Roads;Vehicles","environmental factors;mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication traffic","Taipei;Taiwan;proactive traffic management systems;short-term average vehicular velocity;short-term traffic flow;urban VANET environments;weather factors","","2","","9","","","11-14 July 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
