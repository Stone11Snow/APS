Because neither prior information nor data about expected damage are normally available, damage detection problem must be solved by using a novelty detection approach. Features, which are sensitive to damage, are often sensitive to environmental and operational variations. Therefore elimination of these variations is essential for reliable damage detection. At present many of the damage detection methods are linear, though it has been shown that many of the vibration changes in structures are bilinear or nonlinear. This paper proposes to use nonlinear factor analysis to detect damage via elimination of external effects from damage features. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by analyzing the experimental Z24 Bridge data with a comparison to a linear method. It is shown that elimination of adverse effects and damage detection are feasible.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5588688","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5588688","","Bridges;Data models;Feature extraction;Mathematical model;Monitoring;Temperature measurement;Training data","structural engineering computing","environmental variations;nonlinear factor analysis;novelty detection;operational variations;structural health monitoring","","3","","22","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We propose to introduce dilation and translation factors into a wavelet kernel function, in order to narrow down the search for kernel parameters required to calculate the kernel matrix. We tested the hypothesis of implementing a wavelet kernel PCA (WKPCA) to extract the feature information using a set of simulated multi-scale clustered data. We show that WKPCA is an effective feature extraction method for transforming a variety of multi-dimensional clustered data into data with a higher level of linearity among the data attributes.

In this paper, we present the multiple kernel learning (MKL) based approach to select Gabor filters with appropriate orientations, keeping the scale and center frequency fixed. A base kernel function is used for the response obtained from a filter with an orientation.

However, these methods do not take the local manifold structure of dyadic data into account. In this paper we present a method for manifold-respecting probabilistic matrix tri-factorization (MPMTF) where we incorporate a local manifold structure into PMTF, imposing smoothness constraints on posterior distributions over latent variables.

Searching strategies of feature selection methods could be divided into several types: exhaustive searches, heuristic searches, floating searches and random searches. In this work, we perform a comparative study between two different search strategies: sequential forward search and sequential backward search. The Localized Generalization Error (L-GEM) is adopted as the selection criterion. Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) is adopted as the classifier and we will perform experiments on UCI datasets.

A crucial step in this process is the construction of a codebook of visual features, which is usually done by cluster analysis of a large number of low-level image features detected as interest points. However, clustering is a process that retains regions of high density in a distribution and it follows that the resulting codebook need not have discriminant properties. Here we extend our recent work on constructing a one-pass discriminant codebook design procedure inspired by the resource allocating network model from the artificial neural networks literature. Unlike clustering, this approach retains data spread out more widely in the input space, thereby including rare low-level features in the codebook. It simultaneously achieves increased discrimination and a drastic reduction in the computational needs.

In second level, the features that have large projections are selected to form the feature space. Then the projections of all features onto the feature space are evaluated. Only features that have large projections both on orthogonal axis and feature subspace are selected as the feature subset. Then a neural network (NN) is employed to learn the classification model.

The objective of this study is to classify the controlled movement relating to an intended action from interfering signals that can be experienced. These interfering signals include but are not limited to, speech, coughing and drinking. Thus data was collected for six types of controlled movement and the various interfering signals, when subjects spoke, coughed or drank. The signal processing involves detection, segmentation, feature extraction and selection, and classification of tongue motions. The segmented signals were initially transformed into the wavelet packet domain, allowing for various features to be extracted based on statistical properties of the wavelet coefficients. These are then used as input into a Bayesian classifier under multivariate Gaussian assumptions. The average classification performance for identifying controlled movements and interfering tongue signals achieved 98% and 93.5% respectively. Thus the classification of tongue movement ear pressure signals based on the wavelet packet transform is robust. The application of this Bayesian classification strategy significantly reduces the interference of controlling commands when considered within a human-machine interface system operating in a challenging environment.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589102","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589102","Bayesian classifier;Tongue movement ear pressure signals;wavelet packet transform","Classification algorithms;Feature extraction;Gold;Tongue;Training;Wavelet packets","Bayes methods;human computer interaction;signal classification;wavelet transforms","Gaussian assumptions;feature extraction;human-machine interfaces;multivariate Bayesian classification;signal processing;statistical properties;tongue movement ear pressure signals;wavelet packet transform","","2","","7","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

By proposing a template based on this prior knowledge we set up a constrained local cost function which is to be minimized. In order to be able to achieve such an optimization, the Hierarchical Alternate Least Square (HALS) algorithm is adopted. The advantage of the proposed method is to simultaneously separate and distinguish the source of interest from other sources.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589216","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589216","","Brain modeling;Correlation;Cost function;Equations;Mathematical model;Matrix decomposition","biomedical MRI;blind source separation;least squares approximations;matrix decomposition;medical image processing","FMRI;NMF algorithm;bold detection;constrained local cost function;hierarchical alternate least square algorithm;magnetic resonance images;nonnegative matrix factorization","","4","","15","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The BCG artifact is considered here as the sum of a number of independent cyclostationary components having the same cycle frequency. Cyclostationary source extraction (CSE) is used here to remove BCG artifact. The results are compared with the results of benchmark BCG removal techniques.

The two stimuli used here are derived from the vase-faces illusion and share the same defining contours, differing only slightly in stimulus space. This emphasizes activity differences related to high-level percepts rather than low-level attributes. This design decision results in a difficult classification task for the ensuing EEG signals. Traditionally, EEG analyses are done on the basis of signal processing techniques involving multiple instance averaging and then a manual examination to detect differentiating components. The present study constitutes an agnostic effort based on purely statistical estimates of three major classifiers: L1-norm logistic regression, group lasso and k Nearest Neighbors (kNN); kNN produced the worst results. L1 regression and group lasso show significantly better performance, while being abl e to identify distinct spatio-temporal signatures. Both L1 regression and group lasso assert the saliency of samples in 170ms, 250ms, 400ms and 600ms after stimulus onset, congruent with the previously reported ERP components associated with face perception. Similarly, spatial locations of salient markers point to the occipital and temporal brain regions, previously implicated in visual object perception.

We do so without the need to perform separation on the signals. Unlike factorial Markov models which have been used similarly in the past, this approach features a low computational complexity in the number of sources and Markov states, which makes it a highly efficient alternative. We demonstrate the use of this framework in recognizing speech from mixtures of known speakers.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5588124","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5588124","","Computational modeling;Dictionaries;Equations;Hidden Markov models;Markov processes;Mathematical model;Speech recognition","Markov processes;computational complexity;source separation;speech recognition","Markov selection model;computational complexity;concurrent speech recognition;source separation problems;spectrogram nonnegative representations","","1","4","9","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The performance of these parametric approaches critically depend on using realistic models, but accurate models may ruin analytical tractability. Recently, an alternative nonparametric method was successfully proposed in [1]. The method was based on developing stationary support vector regression (SVR) models in the wavelet domain according to prior knowledge about signal and noise features. Nevertheless, off-line analysis of the particular signal and noise statistics is required to apply it to different problems. In this work, we take a similar non-parametric approach, but we explore the ability of kernel ridge regression (KRR) to locally follow image and noise characteristics, thus trivially obtaining adaptive (non-stationary) description of the image. Making KRR adaptive alleviates the strong assumption of Gaussianity of the noise. The method is embedded in the iterative restoration framework that allows consistent parameter tuning.

In this paper, we evaluate semi-supervised logistic regression (SLR), a recent information theoretic semi-supervised algorithm, for remote sensing image classification problems. SLR is a probabilistic discriminative classifier and a specific instance of the generalized maximum entropy framework with a convex loss function.

Borne out by experiments, we demonstrate the proposed method is able to track well under scale variation and when there are confusing objects in the background. Besides, it has higher performance than conventional particle filters in terms of weight and number of particle.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5588092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5588092","","Feature extraction;Histograms;Image color analysis;Markov processes;Particle filters;Robustness;Target tracking","object detection;particle filtering (numerical methods);singular value decomposition;target tracking","computer vision;object tracking;particle degeneracy Metropolis-Hastings sampling;robust tracking;singular value particle filter;visual tracking","","1","","21","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Furthermore, the proposed algorithm, called Gaussian Process Joint Particle Filtering (GPJPF), handles multiple targets, where each particle models the targets' states jointly. To handle the data association problem and interaction between targets in close proximity, a Markov Random Fields (MRF) -based motion model was applied.

Since, for a given observation model, each prior produces a different posterior distribution of the underlying High Resolution (HR) image, the use of variational posterior distribution approximation on each posterior will produce as many posterior approximations as priors we want to combine. A unique approximation is obtained here by finding the distribution on the HR image given the observations that minimize a linear convex combination of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences associated with each posterior distribution.

In spite of its simplicity, k-NN classification is very attractive to practitioners, as it has shown very good performances in practical applications. However, it suffers from various drawbacks, like sensitivity to “noisy” prototypes and poor generalization properties when dealing with sparse, high-dimensional data. In this paper, we tackle the k-NN classification problem at its core by providing a novel k-NN boosting approach. We propose a Universal Nearest Neighbors (UNN) algorithm, which induces a leveraged k-NN rule by globally minimizing a surrogate risk upper bounding the empirical misclassification rate over training data. Interestingly, this surrogate risk can be arbitrary chosen from a class of Bregman loss functions, including the familiar exponential, logistic and squared losses. Furthermore, we show that UNN allows to efficiently filter a dataset of instances by keeping only a small fraction of data. Experimental results on the synthetic Ripley's dataset show that such a filtering strategy is able to reject “noisy” examples, and yields a classification error close to the optimal Bayes error. Experiments on standard UCI datasets show significant improvements over the current state of the art.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589248","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589248","","Artificial neural networks;Boosting;Indexes;Measurement;Minimization;Nearest neighbor searches;Training","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","generic classification boosting;k-nearest neighbors voting rules;machine learning techniques;universal nearest neighbors algorithm","","0","","15","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Hence, adaptation of the kernel width allows for the criterion, and its performance surface, to be adjusted to changes in the signal distribution.

A new, custom architecture was recently proposed to overcome this by combining a reservoir with an extreme learning machine to deliver improved results. This paper extends this architecture further by introducing a ranking and pruning algorithm which removes neurons according to their significance. This provides further insight into the type of reservoir characteristics needed for a given task, and is supported by further reservoir measures of non-linearity and memory.

However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch techniques. It is only recently, that online adaptive techniques have been considered in the context of signal processing tasks. To the best of our knowledge, no kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, that is able to deal with complex valued signals. In this paper, we take advantage of a technique called complexification of real RKHSs to attack this problem. In order to derive gradients and subgradients of operators that need to be defined on the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted much attention in the signal processing community. Writinger's calculus simplifies computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Writinger's calculus is extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm. Experiments verify that the CKLMS can be used to derive nonlinear stable algorithms, which offer significant performance improvements over the traditional complex LMS or Widely Linear complex LMS (WL-LMS) algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589254","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589254","","Calculus;Context;Dictionaries;Hilbert space;Kernel;Least squares approximation;Signal processing algorithms","differentiation;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;signal processing","RKH spaces;Wirtinger calculus;complex kernel least mean square;gradients;machine learning community;nonlinear processing;online adaptive techniques;signal processing","","0","","25","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"A computationally-efficient alternative to kernel logistic regression","M.

However, its training-typically carried out by (quasi-)Newton methods-is rather time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an alternative probabilistic classification algorithm called Least-Squares Probabilistic Classifier (LSPC). KLR models the class-posterior probability by the log-linear combination of kernel functions and its parameters are learned by (regularized) maximum likelihood. In contrast, LSPC employs the linear combination of kernel functions and its parameters are learned by regularized least-squares fitting of the true class-posterior probability. Thanks to this linear regularized least-squares formulation, the solution of LSPC can be computed analytically just by solving a regularized system of linear equations in a class-wise manner. Thus LSPC is computationally very efficient and numerically stable. Through experiments, we show that the computation time of LSPC is faster than that of KLR by two orders of magnitude, with comparable classification accuracy.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589255","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589255","","Computational modeling;Kernel;Optimization;Probabilistic logic;Support vector machines;Training;Vectors","least squares approximations;logistics;pattern classification;regression analysis","KLR;LSPC;Newton methods;computationally efficient alternative;kernel logistic regression;least squares probabilistic classifier;probabilistic classification algorithm","","0","","21","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our issue is graph clustering, i.e. clustering nodes (examples) in a given network. We deal with a situation that we have multiple graphs, sharing nodes but having different edges, where each graph can have only part of the entire true clusters which we call localized clusters, being found in only part of all given graphs. For this issue, we present a probabilistic generative model and its robust learning scheme, being based on variational Bayes estimation. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by using synthetic and real graphs.","1551-2541;15512541","Electronic:978-1-4244-7877-4; POD:978-1-4244-7875-0; USB:978-1-4244-7876-7","10.1109/MLSP.2010.5589257","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589257","","Bioinformatics;Clustering algorithms;Genomics;Noise;Probabilistic logic;Symmetric matrices;Training","Bayes methods;data mining;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);network theory (graphs);pattern clustering;variational techniques","graph clustering;nodes clustering;pattern learning;pattern mining;probabilistic generative model;variational Bayes estimation;variational Bayes learning","","0","","18","","","Aug. 29 2010-Sept. 1 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
