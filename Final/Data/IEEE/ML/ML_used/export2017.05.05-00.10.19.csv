Merging methods available today, a new approach for a faster realization of a multi-finger soft robotic hand is presented here. This paper introduces a robotic hand with four fingers and 12 Degrees of Freedom (DoFs) using bellow actuators. The hand is generated via Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), an Additive Manufacturing method. The complex task execution of a specific action, i.e. the lifting, rotating and precise positioning of a handling-object with this robotic hand, is used to structure the whole development process. To validate reliable functionality of the hand from the beginning, each development stage is SLS-generated and the targeted task execution is trained via Reinforcement Learning, a machine learning approach. Optimization points are subsequently derived and fed back into the hardware development. With this Concurrent Engineering strategy a fast development of this robotic hand is possible. The paper outlines the relevant key strategies and gives insight into the design process. At the end, the final hand with its capabilities is presented and discussed.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.44","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784614","Additive Manufacturing;Compliant;Concurrent Engineering;LearningGripper;Reinforcement Learning;SLS;Soft Robotic Hand","Actuators;Bellows;Hardware;Robots;Thumb","concurrent engineering;control engineering computing;dexterous manipulators;laser sintering;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;rapid prototyping (industrial);service robots","SLS-generated soft robotic hand;additive manufacturing;bellow actuator;concurrent engineering;machine learning;multifinger soft robotic hand;optimization point;reinforcement learning;selective laser sintering","","1","","11","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Since the feature design process is tedious and requires a lot of experience, an automated solution is of great interest. However, an important problem in this field is that usually no objective values are available to fit a feature learning function to. Artificial Neural Networks are a sufficiently flexible tool for function approximation to be able to avoid this problem. We show how the error function of an ANN can be modified such that it works solely with objective distances instead of objective values. We derive the adjusted rules for back propagation through networks with arbitrary depths and include practical considerations that must be taken into account to apply difference based learning successfully. On all three benchmark datasets we use, linear SVMs trained on automatically learned ANN features outperform RBF kernel SVMs trained on the raw data. This can be achieved in a feature space with up to only a tenth of dimensions of the number of original data dimensions.

To surmount these difficulties, we propose an approach to track the multi-target online by Boosting and scene context reasoning. To this end, we use a two-stage system, where the first stage learns a non-linear classifier which is capable of generating the observation similarities. In the second stage, we demonstrate a novel relationship between observations and the scene layout parameters. Using a probabilistic formulation and the above relationship, our method has the unique ability to handle exceptions.

One of the efficient ways to represent this predictive model is to express it as an optimal set of classification rules to provide comprehensibility and precision, simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel incremental parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach for classification rule discovery. Our proposed method separates the training data into a set of data chunks regarding the classes and extracts optimal set of classification rules for each chunk in a parallel manner. In order to extract the rules from data chunks, we introduce an incremental PSO algorithm in which the previously extracted rules are directly employed to initialize the swarm population. Moreover, in each generation of the swarm, a tournament method is employed to substitute the weak individuals with strong extracted knowledge. To support the parallelism, we assign a PSO thread for each data chunk. As soon as all the PSO threads are completed, the extracted rules are integrated into a rule-base to construct a classification model. The evaluation results of the proposed approach on six datasets suggest that the classification precision of our proposed framework is competitive with offline learning methods and is 35% faster than its counterpart offline PSO approach.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.87","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784657","classification;incremental learning;parallel computation;particle swarm optimization;rule discovery","Classification algorithms;Data mining;Data models;Genetic algorithms;Sociology;Statistics;Training data","particle swarm optimisation;pattern classification","PSO threads;classification model;classification precision;classification rule discovery;counterpart offline PSO;data chunks;dynamic data;extracted rules;incremental PSO algorithm;incremental parallel particle swarm optimization;parallelism;predictive model;supervised learning;swarm population;tournament method;unobserved data","","1","","45","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Qamar et al. have developed a Similarity Learning Algorithm (SiLA) based on a combination of k nearest neighbor algorithm and Voted Perceptron. This approach is different from other state of the art algorithms in the sense that it learns appropriate similarity metrics rather than distance-based ones for all types of datasets i.e. textual as well as non-textual. In this paper, we present a novel ensemble classifier Rot-SiLA which is developed by combining Rotation Forest algorithm and SiLA. The Rot-SiLA ensemble classifier is built upon two types of approaches, one based on standard kNN and another based on symmetric kNN (SkNN), just as was the case with SiLA algorithm. It has been observed that Rot-SiLA ensemble outperforms other variants of the Rotation Forest ensemble as well as SiLA significantly when experiments were conducted with 14 UCI repository data sets.

Powerful and popular models for structured prediction have been developed. Despite the successes, they suffer from some known problems: (i) Hidden Markov models are generative models which suffer from the mismatch problem. Also it is difficult to incorporate overlapping, non-independent features into a hidden Markov model explicitly. (ii) Conditional Markov models suffer from the label bias problem. (iii) Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) overcome the label bias problem by global normalization. But the global normalization of CRFs can be expensive which prevents CRFs from applying to big data. In this paper, we propose the Empirical Co-occurrence Rate Networks (ECRNs) for sequence labeling. ECRNs are discriminative models, so ECRNs overcome the problems of HMMs. ECRNs are also immune to the label bias problem even though they are locally normalized. To make the estimation of ECRNs as fast as possible, we simply use the empirical distributions as the estimation of parameters.

In this paper we propose an on-line incremental learning technique using Fuzzy ARTMAP and a pattern selection criterion. The technique starts by training the ANN with a primitive knowledge base. In the presence of new patterns, the criterion-based on the success of the current action-decides autonomously if the pattern should be learned, if the ANN has to recall, or if a recovery action must be performed. The incremental learning approach is based on the online update of the neural network weights and the defined criterion decides should the new pattern be learned. The peg in hole operation (PIH) is selected as the study case in order to evaluate the performance of the technique, which is described in detail as well as the basics of the peg in hole operation.

It is crucial for a network to have a sufficient amount of learnable parameters yet still be able to capture in variances in data. In this paper, the authors propose spatial boosting networks, which employ convolutional feature learning networks as learning components. Each component in a network is assigned to a certain spatial region. This allows the network learn more adaptive features for each region. In order to make spatial boosting networks to capture relationship between regions of the visual field, we also propose convolutional pooling procedure. By expanding pooling scope into overlapping regions, we expect the features pooled in higher level to be more robust to noises and more invariant to transformation. Experiments show that using spatial boosting networks boosts up accuracy up to 3% from conventional approaches in standard datasets CIFAR and STL.

Although feature selection techniques are often evaluated based on how they can help improve classification performance, it is also important to find stable feature selection techniques which will give consistent results even in the face of dataset perturbations(such as class noise or sampling used to alleviate the problem of imbalanced data). This is especially important in bioinformatics, where the prime concern may be gene discovery rather than classification. In this study we use three frameworks to evaluate the stability of gene selection techniques: ""sampledcleanvs. sampled-clean, "" ""sampled-noisy vs. sampled-noisy, "" and"" sampled-clean vs. sampled-noisy."" All frameworks involve pairwisecomparisons among the results from the perturbed datasets(due to sampling or class noise injection followed by sampling). They differ in terms of whether they observe how sampling can create variation within the feature subsets (sampled-clean vs. sampled-clean), how noisy datasets (which were then sampled)can create a wide spread of selected features (sampled-noisyvs. sampled-noisy), or how features selected on clean and noisy datasets differ, after both datasets have been sampled (sampledcleanvs. sampled-noisy). Along with these three frameworks, our comparison of seven feature ranking techniques uses four cancer gene datasets, applies three sampling techniques, and generates artificial class noise to better simulate real-world datasets. The results from the frameworks are generally similar, with Signal-To-Noise and ReliefF showing the best stability and Gain Ratio showing the worst across all three frameworks, although Relief-W is notable for showing moderate to above-average stability when the- clean datasets are used, but giving the second worst performance when noise was present.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.85","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784655","Feature Selection;Imbalanced Data;Noise Injection;Stability","Cancer;Gene expression;Lungs;Noise;Noise measurement;Stability criteria","bioinformatics;genetics;sampling methods","Relief-W;artificial class noise;bioinformatics;biological datasets;cancer gene dataset;feature ranking technique;feature selection technique;feature subset;gain ratio;gene discovery;sampling technique","","0","","19","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Firstly, an appropriate prediction method has to be chosen. Subsequently, the parameters of this prediction method have to be adjusted to the time series evolution. In particular, an accurate prediction of future customer demands is often difficult, due to several static and dynamic influences. As a promising prediction method, we propose a lazy learning algorithm based on phase space reconstruction and k-nearest neighbor search. This algorithm originates from chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. In contrast to widely used linear prediction methods like the Box-Jenkins ARIMA method or exponential smoothing, this method is appropriate to reconstruct additional influences on the time series data and consider these influences within the prediction. However, in order to adjust the parameters of the prediction method to the observed time series evolution, a reasonable optimization algorithm is required. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm for parameter optimization. In this way, the prediction method is automatically fitted accurately and quickly to observed time series data, in order to predict future values.

In this work 1, we present a novel method, namely SETNET, to improve the stability and accuracy of GRN inference using ensemble techniques. For a given target gene, SETNET extract an ensemble of regulation networks from discretized expression data instead of a single one.

While smart monitoring and control of appliances can reduce the overall energy consumption, management and cost associated with such systems act as a big hindrance. Prior work has established that detailed feedback in the form of appliance level consumption to building occupants improves their awareness and paves the way for reduction in electricity consumption. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), i.e. the process of disaggregating the overall home electricity usage measured at the meter level into constituent appliances, provides a simple and cost effective methodology to provide such feedback to the occupants. In this paper we present Improved Non-Intrusive load monitoring using load Division and Calibration (INDiC) that simplifies NILM by dividing the appliances across multiple instrumented points (meters/phases) and calibrating the measured power. Proposed approach is used together with the Combinatorial Optimization framework and evaluated on the popular REDD dataset.

Existing action rule discovery methods utilize a generate-and-test approach in which candidate action rules are generated and those that satisfy the user-defined thresholds are returned. A shortcoming of this operational model is there is no guarantee all objects are covered by the generated action rules. In this paper, we define a new methodology referred to as Targeted Action Rule Discovery (TARD). This methodology represents an object driven approach in which an action rule is explicitly discovered per target object.

This is problematic as the population most affected by heart disease, the rural poor, is also the same population whose hospitals have the slowest adoption rates of advanced EHR systems. We apply the machine learning technique random forests to administrative claims data to predict unplanned all-cause 30 day readmissions for congestive heart failure patients in a hospital system located in central Virginia, USA.

It is not written as a historical recount of the work, since the sequence of the presentation is not in chronological order. It aims at presenting an approach to a wide range of problems in computer vision and machine learning that is data-driven, local and requires a minimal number of assumptions. The tensor voting framework combines these properties and provides a unified perceptual organization methodology applicable in situations that may seem heterogeneous initially. We show how several problems can be posed as the organization of the inputs into salient perceptual structures, which are inferred via tensor voting. The work presented here extends the original tensor voting framework with the addition of boundary inference capabilities; a novel re-formulation of the framework appli able to high-dimensional spaces and the development of algorithms for computer vision and machine learning problems. We show complete analysis for some problems, while we briefly outline our approach for other applications and provide pointers to relevant sources.","","97815982910","10.2200/S00049ED1V01Y200609IVM008","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6813721.pdf&bkn=6813720&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","","2006","","","","Morgan & Claypool","Morgan and Claypool eBooks"

In particular, we discuss two solutions with specific applications. First, we propose a method for automating music lessons for learning how to play pre-recorded songs via existing music information retrieval (MIR) techniques for adaptability to various learning styles.

To reduce these quadratic complexities, the proposed method first partitions the data into smaller subsets using various families of locality sensitive hashing, including random project and spectral hashing. Then, the method computes the similarity values among points in the smaller subsets to result in approximated similarity matrices. We analytically show that the time and space complexities of the proposed method are sub quadratic. We implemented the proposed method using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) framework and ran it on a cluster.

Semi-supervised approaches like Manifold Regularization learn a function taking the feature vectors as input, while being smooth over the network connections.

"Arm Space Decomposition as a Strategy for Tackling Large Scale Multi-armed Bandit Problems","N. Gupta; O. C. Granmo; A. Agrawala","Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA","2013 12th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications","20140410","2013","1","","252","257","Recent multi-armed bandit based optimization schemes provide near-optimal balancing of arm exploration against arm exploitation, allowing the optimal arm to be identified with probability arbitrarily close to unity. However, the convergence speed drops dramatically as the number of bandit arms grows large, simply because singling out the optimal arm requires experimentation with all of the available arms. Furthermore, effective exploration and exploitation typically demands computational resources that grow linearly with the number of arms. Although the former problem can be remedied to some degree when prior knowledge about arm correlation is available, the latter problem persists. In this paper we propose a Thompson Sampling (TS) based scheme for exploring an arm space of size K by decomposing it into two separate arm spaces, each of size sqrtK, thus achieving sub-linear scalability. In brief, two dedicated Thompson Samplers explore each arm space separately. However, at each iteration, arm selection feedback is obtained by jointly considering the arms selected by each of the Thompson Samplers, mapping them into the original arm space. This kind of decentralized decision-making can be modeled as a game theory problem, where two independent decision makers interact in terms of a common pay-off game. Our scheme requires no communication between the decision makers, who have complete autonomy over their actions. Thus it is ideal for coordinating autonomous agents in a multi-agent system. Extensive experiments, including instances possessing multiple Nash equilibria, demonstrate remarkable performance benefits. Although TS based schemes already are among the top-performing bandit players, our proposed arm space decomposition scheme provide drastic improvements for large arm spaces, not only in terms of processing speed and memory usage, but also in terms of an improved ability to identify the optimal arm, increasing with the number of bandit arms.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.51","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784621","Game Theory;Machine Learning;Multi-Armed Bandits;Optimization","Bayes methods;Educational institutions;Games;Nash equilibrium;Space exploration","game theory;multi-agent systems;optimisation;probability;sampling methods","Nash equilibria;Thompson sampling based scheme;arm selection feedback;arm space decomposition scheme;autonomous agents;decentralized decision-making;game theory problem;multi armed bandit based optimization schemes;multi-agent system;sub-linear scalability","","0","","19","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Managing these huge numbers of incoming bug reports is a challenging task. Dealing with these reports manually consumes time and resources which leads to delaying the resolution of important bugs which are crucial and need to be identified and resolved earlier. Bug triaging is an important process in software maintenance. Some bugs are important and need to be fixed right away, whereas others are minor and their fixes could be postponed until resources are available. Most automatic bug assignment approaches do not take the priority of bug reports in their consideration. Assigning bug reports based on their priority may play an important role in enhancing the bug triaging process. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the priority of a reported bug using different machine learning algorithms namely Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. We also investigate the effect of using two feature sets on the classification accuracy. We conduct experimental evaluation using open-source projects namely Eclipse and Fire fox.

Data were collected from 12 subjects in free-living for a period of 24-hrs under unrestricted conditions. ANN with a different number of hidden layer neurons and SVMs with different kernels were trained using a leave one out cross validation scheme. ANN achieved an average accuracy of 86.86 ¬± 6.5 % whereas SVM (with linear kernel) achieved an average classification accuracy of 81.93 ¬± 9.22 %. Data collected from an independent subject in a separate study were used to evaluate the performance of these classifiers in-terms of the number of meals detected per day resulting in an accuracy of 72.72% for ANN and 63.63% for SVM.

Manifold Regularization is a semi-supervised learning approach that extends the regularization framework so as to include additional regularization penalties that are based on the graph Laplacian as the empirical estimator of the underlying manifold. The incorporation of such terms rely on additional hyper-parameters, which, together with the original kernel and regularization parameters, are known to influence algorithm behavior. This paper proposes a gradient approach to the optimization of such hyper-parameters which is based on the closed form for the generalized cross validation estimate, being valid when the learning optimality conditions can be represented as a linear system, such as is the case for Laplacian Regularized Least Squares. For the subset hyper-parameters that are integer quantities, as is the case for the Laplacian matrix hyper-parameters, we propose the optimization of the weight components of a sum of base terms.

They work well in practice and have now been used across a wide range of applications from recognizing hand-written digits, to face identification, text categorisation, bioinformatics, and database marketing. In this book we give an introductory overview of this subject. We start with a simple Support Vector Machine for performing binary classification before considering multi-class classification and learning in the presence of noise. We show that this framework can be extended to many other scenarios such as prediction with real-valued outputs, novelty detection and the handling of complex output structures such as parse trees. Finally, we give an overview of the main types of kernels which are used in practice and how to learn and make predictions from multiple types of input data.

Kernel methods versions can handle structured data, such as trees, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. However kernelized versions of Online Learning algorithms slow down when the number of support vectors becomes large. The traditional way to cope with this problem is introducing budgets that set the maximum number of support vectors. In this paper, we investigate Distributed Trees (DT) as an efficient way to use structured data in online learning. DTs effectively embed the huge feature space of the tree fragments into small vectors, so enabling the use of linear versions of kernel machines over tree structured data. We experiment with the Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm by comparing the linear and the kernelized version. A massive dataset made with tree structured data is employed: it is originated from a natural language processing task, the Boundary Detection in the context of Semantic Role Labeling over Frame Net. Results on a sample of the final data show that the DTs along with the Linear PA algorithm and the Tree Kernel along with the Bundgeted PA achieve comparable results in terms of f1-measure. Finally, the exploration of the full dataset allows the former to improve the performance on the classification task, with respect to the latter.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.28","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784598","Distributed Trees;Online Learning;Tree Kernels","Complexity theory;Kernel;Semantics;Support vector machines;Syntactics;Training;Vectors","learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;tree data structures","Frame Net;boundary detection;distributed tree kernel;learning machine;linear online learning;natural language processing task;online algorithm;passive-aggressive algorithm;semantic role labeling;structured data;support vector","","1","","33","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

To the best of our knowledge there is no general well-founded approach for choosing them. As we demonstrate with Gaussian kernels, the kernel CCA tends to show perfect correlation as the bandwidth parameter of the Gaussian kernel decreases, while it provides inappropriate features with all the data concentrated in a few points. This is caused by the ill-posed ness of the kernel CCA with the 4th order moment of canonical variates becomes large. To overcome this problem, we propose to use constraints on the 4th order moments of canonical variates in addition to the variances. Experiments on synthesized and real world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel CCA provides well-posed and robust solution in reasonable ranges of all the hyper parameters.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.76","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784646","higher-order regularization;kernel CCA;measure of dependence;robust solution","Bandwidth;Correlation;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Kernel;Optimization;Standards","Gaussian processes;higher order statistics;learning (artificial intelligence)","4th order moment;Gaussian kernels;canonical variates;higher-order regularized kernel CCA;kernel canonical correlation analysis;machine learning","","0","","18","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we propose a novel systematic way of generating and selecting better features for daily peak electricity load prediction using kernel methods. Grammatical evolution is used to evolve an initial population of well performing individuals, which are subsequently mapped to feature subsets derived from wavelets and technical indicator type formulae used in finance.

For example, gene micro arrays can record the expression levels of thousands of genes, many of which have no relevance to the underlying medical or biological question. Building classification model son such datasets can thus take excessive computational time and still give poor results. Many strategies exist to combat these problems, including feature selection (which chooses only the most relevant genes for building models) and ensemble learners (which combine multiple weak classification learners into one collection which should give a broader view of the data). However, these techniques present a new challenge: choosing which combination of strategies is most appropriate for a given collection of data. This is especially difficult for health informatics and bioinformatics practitioners who do not have an extensive machine learning background. An ideal model should be easy to use and apply, helping the practitioner by either making these choices in advance or by being insensitive to these choices. In this work we demonstrate that the Random Forest learner, when using 100 trees and 200 features (selected by any reasonable feature ranking technique, as the specific choice does not matter), is such a model. To show this, we use 25 bioinformatics datasets from a number of different cancer diagnosis and identification problems, and we compare Random Forest with 5 other learners. We also tested 25 feature ranking techniques and 12 feature subset sizes, to optimize the feature selection step. Our results show that Random Forest with 100 trees and 200 selected features is statistically significantly better than any of the alternatives (orin the case of using 200 features, is statistically equivalent with the top choices), and that the specific choice of ranking technique is statistically insignificant.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784604","Bioinformatics;Random Forest;feature selection","Bioinformatics;Biological system modeling;Buildings;Data models;Niobium;Support vector machines;Vegetation","bioinformatics;cancer;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);patient diagnosis;pattern classification;statistical analysis","bioinformatics research;cancer diagnosis;cancer identification problem;classification model;ensemble learners;feature ranking technique;feature selection;health informatics;multiple weak classification learners;optimal model;random forest learner","","6","","16","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we design a new noise immunization based cluster ensemble framework named as AP2CE to tackle the challenges raised by noisy datasets. AP2CE not only takes advantage of the affinity propagation algorithm (AP) and the normalized cut algorithm (Ncut), but also possesses the characteristics of cluster ensemble. Compared with traditional cluster ensemble approaches, AP2CE is characterized by several properties. (1) It adopts multiple distance functions instead of a single Euclidean distance function to avoid the noise related to the distance function. (2) AP2CE applies AP to prune noisy attributes and generate a set of new datasets in the subspaces consists of representative attributes obtained by AP. (3) It avoids the explicit specification of the number of clusters. (4) AP2CE adopts the normalized cut algorithm as the consensus function to partition the consensus matrix and obtain the final result. The experiments on real datasets show that (1) AP2CE works well on most of real datasets, in particular the noisy datasets; (2) AP2CE is a better choice for most of real datasets when compared with other cluster ensemble approaches; (3) AP2CE has the capability to provide more accurate, stable and robust results.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890437","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890437","","Abstracts;Lungs","geometry;matrix algebra;pattern clustering","A P2CE;affinity propagation algorithm;cluster ensemble;consensus matrix;double affinity propagation;noise immunization;normalized cut algorithm;single Euclidean distance function","","0","","25","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The conventional bicasting scheme makes the bicasting decision according to signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) to minimize the packet delay time and aim at seamless connectivity during the handover processing period. However, the SNR-based bicasting scheme cannot optimize the efficiency of backhaul resource utilization and quality of service (QoS) for users. Instead of using SNR as the traditional bicasting mechanism does, the proposed bicasting scheme exploits packet success rates (PSR) as the link quality estimator during the handover processing time in order to simultaneously reduce the waste of backhaul resources and provide QoS for users. Neural networks (NNs) are used to learn the correlation function between PSR and relative metric indicators, e.g. SNR, packet length, bit error rate (HER), and so on, and then to generalize the learned function for the whole cases of interest. We conducted simulations to compare the performance of our proposed scheme with that of SNR-based scheme.

In this paper, we address two interesting and related problems for mining biomedical ontologies and data: i) how to discover semantic associations with the help of formal ontologies, ii) how to identify potential errors in the ontologies with the help of data. By representing both ontologies and data using RDF hyper graphs, and subsequently transforming the hyper graphs to corresponding bipartite forms, we provide a generalized data mining method that scales beyond what existing ontology-based approaches can provide. We show the proposed method is indeed capable of capturing semantic associations while seamlessly incorporate domain knowledge in ontologies by performing evaluations on real-world electronic health dataset and NCBO ontologies. We also show that our data mining methods can discover and suggest corrections for misinformation in biomedical ontologies.","","CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4154-4; Electronic:978-0-7695-5144-9; POD:978-1-4799-4155-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2013.31","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6784601","","Bipartite graph;Data mining;Diseases;Drugs;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Semantics","data mining;electronic health records;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","NCBO ontologies;RDF hypergraphs;biomedical ontologies mining;bipartite forms;electronic health dataset;formal ontologies;generalized data mining method;machine learning;semantic associations","","2","","25","","","4-7 Dec. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We extracted the rainstorm radar image's features from historical data set by using digital image processing technology, reduced the unwanted attributes, mined the minimum decision rules according to rough set theory, formed rainstorm knowledge base and case base, and achieved the forecast and recognition of strong convective weather finally. In this paper, the prediction medium scale was between 2km and 20km, the forecast aging was between 0 and 3 hours, and the rainfall amount exceeded 20mm during 3 hours. Experimental tests show that the accuracy of the rainstorm forecasting recognition is 87%, false alarm rate is 13%, alarm failure rate is 0, which meet the need of practical application and help people to make more accurate forecast. By the rainstorm case retrieve system, we can determine the similarity between the target case and the historical case and improve the knowledge base and the system's intelligence.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890359","Case Library;Feature Extract;Rough Set Theory;Rules;Similarity Retrieval","Abstracts;Feature extraction;Training","case-based reasoning;geophysical image processing;information retrieval;radar imaging;rough set theory;weather forecasting","digital image processing technology;rainstorm case retrieve system;rainstorm forecasting recognition;rainstorm radar image features;rainstorm recognition;rough set theory;similarity retrieval","","0","","8","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, the parametric uncertainties are assumed to be time-varying and norm bounded. Then, a state feedback controller is developed such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and the cost function value is below a specified upper bound for all admissible perturbations and unknown time delays. Afterwards, by combining Lyapunov method and the properties of linear matrix inequality, the sufficient condition for the existence of the presented controller is derived. Finally, a numerical simulation demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890802","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890802","Guaranteed cost control;Linear matrix inequality;Neutral stochastic system;Time delay;Uncertain nonlinear perturbation","Abstracts;Delays","Lyapunov methods;closed loop systems;delays;linear matrix inequalities;nonlinear control systems;numerical analysis;state feedback;stochastic systems;time-varying systems;uncertain systems","Lyapunov method;asymptotically stability;closed-loop system;cost function value;delays neutral stochastic systems;guaranteed cost control;linear matrix inequality;numerical simulation;parametric uncertainties;state feedback controller;uncertain nonlinear neutral stochastic systems;uncertain nonlinear perturbations;unknown time delays","","0","","20","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

For current inhibition zone measurement systems having some deficiency such as low processing speed, inability to identify conjoined objects and precision decline when inhibition zone deforms, an algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm can convert a multi-target identification problem to single-target one adaptively by using the information from bidirectional histograms, and can avoid most of interferences from deformation points by extracting a limited number of isometric candidate point-pairs from the inhibition zone contour and configuring non-isometric constrain. Test results show that this algorithm not only has an equivalent ability with traditional algorithm in identifying normal inhibition zones, but also has a significantly better effect in identifying and measuring sunken, extruded, conjoined or other distorted inhibition zones. And the processing speed is forty times faster than before.","2160-133X;2160133X","Electronic:978-1-4799-0260-6; POD:978-1-4799-0259-0","10.1109/ICMLC.2013.6890360","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890360","Adaptive Threshold;Distorted Circle Fitting;Identification of Inhibition Zone","Abstracts;Arrays;Marine animals;Valves","antibacterial activity;image processing;object detection","bidirectional histograms;conjoined inhibition zones;conjoined object identification;deformation points;distorted inhibition zones;extruded inhibition zones;inhibition zone array;inhibition zone contour;inhibition zone identification;inhibition zone measurement algorithm;inhibition zone measurement device quality;inhibition zone precision;interference avoidance;isometric candidate point-pair extraction;key-parameter calculation;multitarget identification problem;nonisometric constrains;normal inhibition zone identification;processing speed;single-target identification problem;sunken inhibition zones","","0","","8","","","14-17 July 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
