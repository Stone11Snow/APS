A number of procedures have been proposed to handle such delayed observations. A common characteristic of these methods is the policy of always incorporating, or fusing, delayed measurements at the time they are finally available. In this paper, we consider such methods, and develop thresholding techniques that result in delayed measurements being selectively fused. This selection is driven by an assessment of the utility of incorporating delayed measurements. With simulated and real data, we show that selective fusion can reduce computational costs while maintaining near optimal performance.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414329","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414329","","Covariance matrix;Delay effects;Equations;Error correction;Filtering;Fuses;Length measurement;Signal to noise ratio;State estimation;Time measurement","delays;filtering theory","delayed measurements;discrete time filtering;selective fusion;thresholding techniques","","3","","10","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We call these aspects structural and statistical information of patterns and aim for developing framework for the unified description of them. Statistical information can be simply and conveniently picked by feature histograms, structural information description is much more complex. In order to deal with it we are introducing the concept of hierarchical decomposition of pattern areas. Areas are described using statistical information by feature histograms, size and number of areas reflects structural information. This formulation unifies statistical and structural information and the problem of minimizing structural information is stated as reducing the number and size of the histograms. We illustrate this on an example of retrieval from face image database using features based on quantized block transform coefficients. We can show that very limited structural information is needed for nearly perfect retrieval performance equal to the best available algorithms.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414328","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414328","","Discrete cosine transforms;Discrete wavelet transforms;Geometry;Helium;Histograms;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information retrieval;Shape measurement;Statistical distributions","feature extraction;image retrieval;statistical analysis;visual databases","face image database;feature histograms;feature locations geometry;features distribution statistics;quantized block transform coefficients;statistical pattern retrieval;structural information description;structural pattern retrieval","","0","","17","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Considerable efforts have been made to convert the well established tools of real signal processing such as backpropagation training algorithm for multilayer perceptron to perform in complex domain. In this paper, we propose the echo state network (ESN) approach for complex domain signal processing. The complex ESN (CESN) replaces the real connection weights for the reservoir and readout with complex numbers and the real activation functions with fully complex nonlinearities. CESNs provide much faster and simpler learning compared to other techniques in the literature since ESN does not backpropagate the errors through complex nonlinearities for training but only adapts a feedforward linear readout.

We use local descriptors (SIFT keypoints) from image frames to model the object. These features are claimed in the literature to be highly distinctive and invariant to rotation, scale, and affine transformations. However, since the SIFT keypoints that are extracted from an object are instance-specific (variable), they form a dynamic feature space. This presents certain challenges for classification techniques, which generally require use of the same set of features for every instance of an object to be classified. To resolve this difficulty, we associate the extracted keypoints to the components (representative keypoints) in a mixture model for each target class. While the extracted keypoints are variable, the mixture components are fixed. The mixture models the keypoint features, as well as the location and scale at which each keypoint was detected in the frame. Key- point to component association is achieved via a switching optimization procedure that locally maximizes the joint likelihood of keypoints and their locations and scales with the latter based on an affine transformation. To each mixture component from a class, we link a (first layer) support vector machine (SVM) classifier which votes for or against the hypothesis that the keypoint associated to the component belongs to the model's target class. A second layer SVM pools the votes from the ensemble of SVM classifiers in the first layer and gives the final class decision. We show promising results of experiments for video sequences from the VIVID database.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414333","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414333","","Databases;Feature extraction;Image recognition;Object recognition;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines;Target tracking;Vehicle dynamics;Video sequences;Voting","feature extraction;object recognition;optimisation;support vector machines;vehicles","SIFT keypoint;affine invariant recognition;generative-discriminative learning;local image descriptor;object recognition;scale invariant recognition;support vector machine;switching optimization procedure;vehicular object","","2","","5","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper an autonomous stereo camera calibration technique with applications in industrial outdoor visual servoing systems is presented. The stereo camera model obtained was used to estimate the pose of the target object during the robot servoing process. The heavy-duty stereo camera rig was installed on the torso of an outdoor 3DOF robotic manipulator. An efficient iterative least- squares parameter estimation algorithm was used to estimate the transformation parameters between the 3D world coordinates of the target object and its 2D image coordinates in the stereo image planes. The stereo camera calibration is entirely an autonomous process as the robot moves the calibration tool within its workspace and the stereo camera model is produced after the data collection process. The stereo cameras are treated as a single unit and a single transformation is obtained for the stereo camera pair in the system. The calibration process is fast, efficient and no human interaction is required during the process.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414299","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414299","","Calibration;Cameras;Electrical equipment industry;Manipulators;Parameter estimation;Robot kinematics;Robot vision systems;Service robots;Torso;Visual servoing","cameras;iterative methods;least squares approximations;manipulators;robot vision;stereo image processing","2D image coordinates;autonomous process;autonomous stereo camera parameter estimation;data collection process;heavy-duty stereo camera;iterative least-squares parameter estimation algorithm;outdoor 3DOF robotic manipulator;outdoor visual servoing;sensor calibration;target point","","3","","24","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we build on the ideas of the Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) that has been successfully used in the document retrieval community. Under this probabilistic framework, any song will be projected into a relatively low dimensional space of ""latent semantics"", in such a way that that all observed similarities can be satisfactorily explained using the latent semantics. Additionally, this approach significantly simplifies the song retrieval phase, leading to a more practical system implementation. The suitability of the PLSA model for representing music structure is studied in a simplified scenario consisting of 10.000 songs and two similarity measures among them. The results suggest that the PLSA model is a useful framework to combine different sources of information, and provides a reasonable space for song representation.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414343","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414343","","Acoustic measurements;Brightness;Content based retrieval;Fuses;Informatics;Information resources;Mathematical model;Multiple signal classification;Music information retrieval;Recommender systems","information retrieval;music;semantic networks","document retrieval;music recommendation systems;music structure;probabilistic latent semantic analysis;similarity fusion;song representation","","6","","13","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we formulate the HKNN method in terms of subspaces. Advantages of the subspace formulation of the method are two-fold. First, it enables us to propose a variant of the HKNN algorithm, the local discriminative common vector (LDCV) method, which is more suitable for classification tasks where classes have similar intra-class variations. Second, the HKNN method along with the proposed method can be extended to the nonlinear case based on subspace concepts. As a result of the nonlinearization process, one may utilize a wide variety of distance functions in those local classifiers. We tested the proposed methods on several classification tasks.

In shotgun proteomics, typically proteins are digested into fragments (peptides) prior to mass analysis, and the presence of a protein in inferred from the identification of its constituent peptides. Thus, accurate proteome characterization is dependent upon the accuracy of this peptide identification step. Database search routines generate predicted spectra for all peptides derived from the known genome information, and thus, identify a peptide by 'matching' an experimental to a predicted spectrum. However, due to many problems, such as incomplete fragmentation, this process results in a large number of false positives. We present a new scoring algorithm that integrates probabilistic database scoring metrics (from the MSPolygraph program) with physico-chemical properties in a support vector machine (SVM). We demonstrate that this peptide identification classifier SVM (PICS) score is not only more accurate than the single best database scoring metric, but is also significantly more accurate than models derived using a linear discriminant analysis, decision tree, or artificial neural network.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.17","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457279","","Bioinformatics;Classification tree analysis;Databases;Genomics;Mass spectroscopy;Peptides;Proteins;Proteomics;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biology computing;mass spectrometer accessories;probability;proteins;query processing;support vector machines","MSPolygraph program;constituent peptides;database search routines;genome information;global protein content;improved peptide identification;mass analysis;mass spectrometry-based proteomics;peptide features;peptide identification classifier;physico-chemical properties;predicted spectrum matching;probabilistic database scoring metrics;probability models;proteome characterization;scoring algorithm;shotgun proteomics;support vector machine classification","","0","","13","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The best performing dimensionality reduction techniques for text categorisation are supervised, hence utilise the label information of the training data. Active learning is used to reduce the number of labelled training examples for problems where obtaining label information is expensive. Since the vast majority of data supplied to active learning are unlabelled, supervised dimensionality reduction techniques cannot be readily employed. For this reason, active learning in text categorisation problems do not perform dimensionality reduction thereby restricting the choice of classifier. In this paper we investigate unsupervised dimensionality reduction techniques in active learning for text categorisation problems. Two unsupervised techniques are investigated, namely document frequency and principal components analysis. We empirically show increased performance of active learning, using a k-nearest neighbour classifier, when dimensionality reduction is applied using the unsupervised techniques.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.9","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457246","","Application software;Artificial intelligence;Computer science;Educational institutions;Frequency;Machine learning;Principal component analysis;Supervised learning;Text categorization;Training data","data reduction;pattern classification;principal component analysis;text analysis","active learning;document frequency;k-nearest neighbour classifier;label information;principal components analysis;text categorisation problem;unsupervised dimensionality reduction","","3","","6","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Previous studies have proven that it is feasible to build sample classifiers using the gene expressional profiles. To build an effective sample classifier, dimension reduction process is necessary since classic pattern recognition algorithms do not work well in high dimensional space. In this paper, we present a novel feature extraction algorithm based on the concept of virtual genes by integrating microarray expression data sets with domain knowledge embedded in gene ontology (GO) annotations. We define semantic similarity to measure the functional associations between two genes using the annotation on each GO term. We then identify the groups of genes, called virtual genes, that potentially interact with each other for a biological function. The correlation in gene expression levels of virtual genes can be used to build a sample classifier. For a colon cancer data set, the integration of microarray expression data with GO annotations significantly improves the accuracy of sample classification by more than 10%.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.10","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457296","","Application software;Computer science;Data analysis;Data engineering;Feature extraction;Gene expression;Knowledge engineering;Machine learning;Ontologies;Spatial databases","biological tissues;cancer;feature extraction;genetic engineering;medical image processing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;semantic Web;virtual reality","biological function;colon cancer;feature extraction;gene expressional profiles;gene ontology annotations;living tissues;microarray expression data;molecular states;pattern classification;pattern recognition algorithms;semantic knowledge integration;virtual genes","","0","","10","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our formulation for classifier learning, which we refer to as iterative constrained optimization (ICO), involves an iterative process of the optimization of individual objectives with proper constraints on the remaining competing objectives. The fundamental idea is improving one objective while the rest are allowed to degrade. One of the main components of ICO is the supervision mechanism based on the local changes on a selected utility function for controlling the changes in the individual objectives. The utility is an aggregated preference chosen to make a joint decision when evaluating the appropriateness of local changes in competing criteria, i.e. changes from one iteration to the next. Another important component is the adjustment of constraint bounds based on the objective functions attained in the previous iteration using a development set. Many MOP approaches developed so far are formal and extensible to large number of competing objectives. However, their utilities are illustrated using a few objectives. We illustrate the utility of the proposed framework in the context of automatic language identification of 12 languages and 3 dialects, i.e., with a total of 30 objectives. In our experiments, we observed that the ICO-trained classifiers give not only reduced error rates but also a better balance among the many competing objectives.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414287","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414287","","Constraint optimization;Cost function;Decision making;Degradation;Error analysis;Functional programming;Machine learning algorithms;Measurement;Neural networks;Optimization methods","decision making;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;pattern classification","automatic language identification;classifier learning;decision making;iterative constrained optimization;multi objective programming approach;supervision mechanism","","0","","18","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper is based on a DNA microarray study providing gene signatures for hypoxia. These gene signatures were tested on a large breast cancer data set for assessing their prognostic power by means of Kaplan-Meier survival, univariate, and multivariate analyses. We explore the use of several mathematical programming-based techniques that aim to reduce the gene signature sizes as much as possible while maintaining the key characteristics of the original signature, more precisely: the signature prognostic and diagnostic significance. The proposed signature reduction techniques have very interesting potential uses. Indeed, by downsizing the relevant data to a manageable size, one can then patent the core set of biomarkers and also create a dedicated assay (e.g.: on a customized array) for routine applications (e.g.: in the clinical set up) leading to individualized medicine capabilities.

Quantization is often useful before statistical analysis or reconstruction of large network models among multiple random variables. The quantization, through dynamic programming, finds the optimal discrete representation of the original probability density function of a random variable by maximizing the likelihood for the observed data. This algorithm is highly applicable to study genomic features such as the recombination rate across the chromosomes and the statistical properties of non-coding elements such as LINE1. In particular, the recombination rate obtained by quantization is studied for LINE1 elements that are grouped also using quantization by length. The exact and density-preserving quantization approach provides an alternative superior to the inexact and distance-based k-means clustering algorithm for discretization of a single variable.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.36","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457287","","Bioinformatics;Biological cells;Computer science;Dynamic programming;Entropy;Genomics;Graphical models;Probability density function;Quantization;Random variables","dynamic programming;maximum likelihood estimation;probability;quantisation (signal);random processes","chromosomes;continuous random variable;discrete random variable;distance-based k-means clustering algorithm;dynamic programming;genomic features;maximum likelihood quantization;noncoding elements;optimal discrete representation;probability density function;recombination rate;statistical property","","0","","9","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Recent research in this domain has focused on the application of general-purpose evolutionary algorithms to match specific types of target sounds. However, it is difficult to establish whether success or failure of a particular match is due to the inefficiency of the optimisation engine, or the limitations of the matching synthesiser. In this paper the distinction between optimiser inefficiency and synthesiser limitations is elucidated with a contrived target test methodology that enables the performance of different optimisation techniques to be measured and compared. The methodology is applied to a Frequency Modulation synthesiser, in order to compare the performance of different Evolution Strategy-based algorithms. The algorithm producing the best results with contrived targets is then used to match a non-contrived acoustic instrument tone.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.34","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457236","","Acoustic measurements;Acoustic testing;Engines;Evolutionary computation;Frequency modulation;Instruments;Navigation;Optimization methods;Parameter estimation;Synthesizers","electronic music;evolutionary computation;frequency modulation;optimisation","automated parameter estimation;evolution strategy-based algorithms;evolutionary sound matching;frequency modulation synthesiser;optimisation techniques;optimiser inefficiency;sound space navigation techniques","","1","","27","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The most sensible and practical way is an unsupervised algorithm. Many clustering techniques have been developed for unsupervised classification. Many rely on all data being presented at once, the number of clusters to be known, or both.

In general, the optimal alignment can be obtained through the optimization of an objective function. However, such an optimization task is often computationally intractible, most of the existing alignment tools thus use statistical or machine learning based methods to avoid direct optimizations. In this paper, we develop a new method that can progressively construct and update a set of alignments by adding sequences in certain order to each of the existing alignments. In particular, each of the existing alignments is modeled with a profile hidden markov model (HMM) and an added sequence is aligned to each of these profile HMMs. The profile HMMs in the set are then updated based on the alignments with leading alignment scores. We performed experiments on BaliBASE benchmarks to compare the performance of this new approach with that of other alignment tools. Our experiments showed that, by introducing an integer parameter that controls the number of profile HMMs in the set, we are able to efficiently explore the alignment space and significantly improve the alignment accuracy on sequences with low similarity.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.90","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457294","","Bioinformatics;Computer science;Dynamic programming;Heuristic algorithms;Hidden Markov models;Iterative methods;Mathematics;Optimization methods;Proteins;Software tools","biology computing;hidden Markov models;optimisation;proteins","bioinformatics;multiple protein sequences alignment;objective function optimization;profile hidden Markov model","","0","","14","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This work aims at guiding the choices in order to get the best possible solution from data clustering. To do so, algorithms from different approaches were used, i.e. k-means and SOM algorithms belong to the unidimentional approach and SAMBA algorithm, a bidimentional approach. Methods of statistical and biological validation were employed in order to choose the best data clustering solution. Results presented here demonstrated that the statistic validation methods were hardly in agreement with the biology validation method. Furthermore, some advantages of the SOM algorithm over the k-means algorithm were observed.

Co-clustering the related objects often generates better clusters. One basic connection here is that the similarity among the objects of one type is often affected by the cluster structures on the objects of the other types. Although many co-clustering schemes have been proposed, none has explicitly explored such a connection. We propose a framework that utilizes this connection directly. In this framework, employing a spectral-embedding- based approach, we first obtain certain approximate cluster information about the objects of individual types. Such information is then used to refine the similarity measures for the objects of the related types. The final clustering is performed with the refined similarity. We tested our framework on both bipartite-graph and document clustering. Our experiments showed that the refined similarity leads to much better clustering, indicating that our refinement makes the similarity measures closer to their true values.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.77","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457260","","Clustering algorithms;Collaboration;Filtering;Machine learning;Matrix decomposition;Mutual information;Random variables;Spectral analysis;Testing","pattern clustering","coclustering scheme;similarity refinement framework;spectral-embedding-based approach","","0","","16","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Clusterng is useful for taxonomy design and similarity search of documents on such a domain. Similarity is fundamental to many clustering applications on hypertext. In this paper, we will study how measures of similarity are used to cluster a collection of documents on a web site. Most of the document clustering techniques rely on single term analysis of text, such as vector space model. To better group of related documents we propose a new semantic similarity measure. We compare our measure with Wu-Palmer similarity and cosine similarity. Experimental results show that cosine similarity perform better than the semantic similarities.

"Scalable optimal linear representation for face and object recognition","Y. Wu; X. Liu; W. Mio","Florida State Univ., Tallahassee","Sixth International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2007)","20080225","2007","","","298","303","Optimal component analysis (OCA) is a linear method for feature extraction and dimension reduction. It has been widely used in many applications such as face and object recognitions. The optimal basis of OCA is obtained through solving an optimization problem on a Grassmann manifold. However, one limitation of OCA is the computational cost becoming heavy when the number of training data is large, which prevents OCA from efficiently applying in many real applications. In this paper, a scalable OCA (S-OCA) that uses a two-stage strategy is developed to bridge this gap. In the first stage, we cluster the training data using K-means algorithm and the dimension of data is reduced into a low dimensional space. In the second stage, OCA search is performed in the reduced space and the gradient is updated using an numerical approximation. In the process of OCA gradient updating, instead of choosing the entire training data, S-OCA randomly chooses a small subset of the training images in each class to update the gradient. This achieves stochastic gradient updating and at the same time reduces the searching time of OCA in orders of magnitude. Experimental results on face and object datasets show efficiency of the S-OCA method, in term of both classification accuracy and computational complexity.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457247","","Application software;Computational efficiency;Computer science;Hidden Markov models;Linear discriminant analysis;Machine learning;Matrix decomposition;Object recognition;Stochastic processes;Training data","computational complexity;face recognition;feature extraction;image representation;object recognition;optimisation","Grassmann manifold;K-means algorithm;OCA gradient updating;computational complexity;dimension reduction;face recognition;feature extraction;object recognition;optimal component analysis;optimization problem;scalable optimal linear representation;stochastic gradient updating","","0","","15","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to temporal difference (TD) methods, evolutionary algorithms (EA) are among the most promising approaches. The relative performance of these approaches in certain subdomains of the general RL problem remains an open question at this time. In addition to theoretical analysis, benchmarks are one of the most important tools for comparing different RL methods in certain problem domains. A recently proposed RL benchmark problem is the Keepaway benchmark, which is based on the RoboCup Soccer Simulator. This benchmark is one of the most challenging multiagent learning problems because its state-space is continuous and high dimensional, and both the sensors and actuators are noisy.

An approach to tackle this problem is to filter the resulting rule set, which reduces the rules, at the cost of also eliminating potentially interesting ones. In exploring a new dataset in search of relevant associations, it may be more useful for miners to have an overview of the space of rules obtainable from the dataset, rather than getting an arbitrary set satisfying high values for given interest measures. We describe a rule extraction approach that favors rule diversity, allowing miners to gain an overview of the rule space while reducing semantic redundancy within the rule set. This approach adopts an itemset-driven rule generation coupled with a cluster-based filtering process.

One of the commonly used feature selection methods for small samples problems is recursive feature elimination (RFE) method.

Despite its good performance, RFE tends to discard ""weak"" features, which may provide a significant improvement of performance when combined with other features. In this paper, we propose an enhanced recursive feature elimination (EnRFE) method for feature selection in small training sample classification.

Kung","Princeton University, USA","2007 IEEE Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing","20080102","2007","","","1","20","An effective data mining system lies in the representation of pattern vectors. The most vital information to be represented is the characteristics embedded in the raw data most essential for the intended applications. In order to extract a useful high-level representation, it is desirable that a representation can provide concise, invariant, and/or intelligible information on input patterns. The curse of dimensionality has traditionally been a serious concern in many genomic applications. For example, the feature dimension of gene expression data is often in the order of thousands. This motivates exploration into feature selection and representation, both aiming at reducing the feature dimensionality to facilitate the training and prediction of genomic data. The challenge lies in how to reduce feature dimension while conceding minimum sacrifice on accuracy. For feature selection, both individual and group information are important, and each has its own pros and cons in measuring the truly relevant information. The individual quantification is simple as each of the M features can be represented by one single value. However, it cannot deal with the inter-feature redundancy, abounding specially in genomic data. In contrast, the group information can fully address the mutual redundancy, but it is often too complicated to process. (Note that there are 2<sup>M</sup> possible groups.) Between the two extremes, fortunately, there is a convenient compromise: the pairwise kernel - which has a low complexity (M<sup>2</sup> pairs) and yet reveals the critical information regarding the m inter-feature redundancy. Indeed, it has been already found very useful for many genomic applications. Especially, we shall describe how pairwise-based feature selection may be successful applied to genomic subcellular localization. A special method (VIA-SVM) designed exclusively for pairwise scoring kernels is introduced. This is the first method that fully utilizes the reflexive property of th- e so-called self-supervised training data, arising uniquely available in multiple sequence alignment. Based on several subcellular localization experiments, the VIA-SVM when combined with some filter-type metrics appears to deliver a substantial dimension reduction (one-order of magnitude) with only little degradation on accuracy.","1551-2541;15512541","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1566-3; POD:978-1-4244-1565-6","10.1109/MLSP.2007.4414275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4414275","","Bioinformatics;Data mining;Design methodology;Gene expression;Genomics;Kernel;Machine learning;Proteins;Signal processing;Training data","biology computing;data analysis;data mining;data reduction;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);signal processing;support vector machines","SVM;data mining;dimensionality reduction;feature selection;gene expression data;genomic signal processing;self-supervised training data","","0","","21","","","27-29 Aug. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we formulate the selection of the cost parameter and kernel parameter as a two-level optimization problem, in which the values of parameters vary continuously and thus optimization techniques can be applied to select ideal parameters. Due to the non-smoothness of the objective function in our model, a genetic algorithm has been presented.

One of the objectives of prognostics and health management (PHM) systems is to help reduce the number of unexpected failures by continuously monitoring the components of interest and predicting their failures sufficiently in advance to allow for proper planning. In other words, PHM systems may help turn unexpected failures into expected ones. Recent research has demonstrated the usefulness of data mining to help build prognostic models for PHM but also has identified the need for new model evaluation methods that take into account the specificities of prognostic applications. This paper investigates this problem. First, it reviews classical and recent methods to evaluate data mining models and it explains their deficiencies with respect to prognostic applications. The paper then proposes a novel approach that overcomes these deficiencies. This approach integrates the various costs and benefits involved in prognostics to quantify the cost saving expected from a given prognostic model. From the end user's perspective, the formula is practical as it is easy to understand and requires realistic inputs. The paper illustrates the usefulness of the methods through a real-world case study involving data-mining prognostic models and realistic costs/benefits information. The results show the feasibility of the approach and its applicability to various prognostic applications.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457248","","Condition monitoring;Costs;Data envelopment analysis;Data mining;Information technology;Machine learning;Predictive models;Prognostics and health management;Road safety;Sampling methods","computerised monitoring;condition monitoring;cost-benefit analysis;data mining;preventive maintenance","costs-benefits information;data-mining prognostic models;prognostics and health management systems","","0","","7","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An aggregate specifies a set of objects with certain properties and relations which together constitute a meaningful scene entity. In this paper we show how ontological concept descriptions for spatially related objects and aggregates can be learnt from positive and negative examples. Our approach features a rich representation language encompassing quantitative and qualitative attributes and relations. Using examples from the buildings domain, we show that learnt aggregate concepts for window arrays, balconies and other structures can be successfully employed in the conceptual knowledge base of a scene interpretation system. Furthermore we argue that our approach can be extended to cover ontological concepts of any kind, with very few restrictions.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.26","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457269","","Aggregates;Buildings;Computer vision;Informatics;Laboratories;Layout;Machine learning;Machine vision;Ontologies;Supervised learning","computer vision;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","computer vision;high-level scene interpretation;knowledge base;learnt aggregate;ontology;representation language;scene entity;scene objects","","4","","14","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper presents a systematic rule refinement method that deals with the old rule directly with the new data, for the first time. To be able to do the rule refinement, the data are represented in the extended data expression, where an event has its weight of importance. To show how this can be done systematically, a decision tree classifier is used for the rule refinement. The weights of the events of the former rule are adjusted according to the depth of the tree merged with the collected new data set to form the new rule. Experiment shows that this approach, with properly designing the weight assignment procedure, is promising to enhance the performance of the inference engine by generating a rule with higher accuracy than the one from new data set only.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.75","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457249","","Application software;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Data mining;Decision trees;Engines;Game theory;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Training data","data structures;decision trees;inference mechanisms;pattern classification","data representation;decision tree classifier;extended data expression;inference engine;rule refinement problem;weight assignment procedure","","3","","11","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This inspection concept, which combines optical, acoustical and other machine information, comes up with a large amount of data, which leads to multivariate methods for data analysis.

In this paper, we summarize the current strategies fetching parallel corpora from the Web and classify them into three classes: the structure-based, the content-based and the hybrid.

With an increasing number of computer-aided decisions having a large impact on our society, the motivation for our work is not only to document these decision processes semi-automatically but also to understand the preservation cost and related computational requirements. Our objective is to support computer-assisted creation of medical records, to guarantee authenticity of records, as well as to allow managers of electronic medical records (EMR), archivists and other users to explore and evaluate computational costs (e.g., storage and processing time) depending on several key characteristics of appraised records. Our approach to this problem is based on designing an exploratory simulation framework for investigating preservation tradeoffs and assisting in appraisals of electronic records. We have a prototype simulation framework called image provenance to learn (IP2Learn) to support computer-aided medical decisions based on visual image inspection. The current software enables to explore some of the tradeoffs related to (1) information granularity (category and level of detail), (2) representation of provenance information, (3) compression, (4) encryption, (5) watermarking and steganography, (6) information gathering mechanism, and (7) final medical report content (level of detail) and its format. We illustrate the novelty of IP2Learn by performing example studies and the results of tradeoff analyses for a specific image inspection task.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.92","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457283","","Appraisal;Biomedical imaging;Computational efficiency;Computational modeling;Decision making;Health information management;Image reconstruction;Inspection;Medical simulation;Software prototyping","decision making;document image processing;medical administrative data processing","computer-aided medical decision-making;computer-assisted medical decision process;data compression;data encryption;electronic medical records;exploratory simulation framework;image provenance to learn framework;information gathering;information granularity;medical report content;preservation understanding;prototype simulation framework;provenance information;reconstruction requirements;records authenticity;steganography;visual image inspection;watermarking","","0","","30","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Evolutionary sampling is a technique which seeks to counter this problem by using genetic algorithms to evolve a reduced sample of a complete dataset to train a classification model. Evolutionary sampling works to remove noisy and duplicate instances so that the sampled training data will produce a superior classifier. We propose this novel technique as a method to handle severe class imbalance in data mining.

The new formulation is based on maximizing the mutual information that a sample labeling provides about the retrieval/classification model. This methodology is related to and extends the Query-by-Committee approach (QBC) (Seung et al., 1992) by exploiting unlabeled data in novel ways, beyond their common use only as potential query points. Unlike QBC, this method allows us to employ unlabeled data in addition to labeled data in order to select more appropriate samples for labeling. The samples thus chosen are both informative and also relevant according to a distribution of interest. This flexibility allows us to also tailor the model to arbitrary distributions relevant to the task at hand, in particular to the distribution of the test data. This formulation has implications in scenarios where the training and test distributions are different, or when a general model is adapted to a more specific model. Experiments were conducted to evaluate retrieval performance of natural-language text associated to various concepts of interest in the medical domain. We demonstrate the advantages of our formulation compared with QBC, the state-of-the art active learning approach, and against random sample selection.","","POD:978-0-7695-3069-7","10.1109/ICMLA.2007.103","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4457284","","Application software;Art;Computer science;Information retrieval;Labeling;Machine learning;Mutual information;State feedback;Testing;Uncertainty","information retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;text analysis","Query-by-Committee approach;active learning formulation;classification model;free text;medical concept learning;medical concepts;mutual information;natural-language text retrieval performance;query points;retrieval model;semisupervised active learning;test data distribution;unlabeled data;unstructured text","","3","","23","","","13-15 Dec. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

However, the TNM is not accurate in prediction, partially due to the fact of deficient staging within and between stages. Based on the availability of large cancer patient datasets, there is a need to expand the TNM. In this paper, we present a general clustering-based approach to accomplish this task of expansion. This approach admits multiple factors. One major advantage of the approach is that patients within each generated group are homogeneous in terms of survival, so that a more accurate prediction of outcome of patients can be made.
