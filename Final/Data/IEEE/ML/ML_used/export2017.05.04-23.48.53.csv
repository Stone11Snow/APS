Those approaches require the use of fixed-length image representations because SVM kernels represent an inner product in a feature space that is a non-linear transformation of the input space. Many region-based CBIR approaches create a variable length image representation and define a similarity measure between two variable length representations. The standard SVM approach cannot be applied to this approach because it violates the requirements that SVM places on the kernel. Fortunately, a generalized SVM (GSVM) has been developed that allows the use of an arbitrary kernel. In this paper, we present an initial investigation into utilizing a GSVM-based relevance feedback learning algorithm. Since GSVM does not place restrictions on the kernel, any image similarity measure can be used. In particular, the proposed approach uses an image similarity measure developed for region-based, variable length representations. Experimental results over real world images demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2004.110","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1384946","","Computer science;Content based retrieval;Feedback;Image representation;Image retrieval;Image segmentation;Kernel;Length measurement;Machine learning;Support vector machines","","","","2","","","","","27-02 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Center, NY, USA","International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization","20050404","2005","","","11","","Summary form only given. Modern commercial software is written in languages that execute on a virtual machine. Such languages often have dynamic features that require rich runtime support and preclude traditional static optimization. Implementations of these languages have employed dynamic optimization strategies to achieve significant performance improvements. In this paper the author describes some of these strategies and demonstrates their effectiveness. The author then argues that further advances in this field are being hindered by our bias toward adapting traditional static optimization techniques. Instead, we need to think more like a computer architect to create new approaches to optimization in virtual machines.","","POD:0-7695-2298-X","10.1109/CGO.2005.37","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1402072","","Machine learning;Runtime;Virtual machining","learning (artificial intelligence);optimising compilers;virtual machines","commercial software;computer architect;dynamic optimization strategy;static optimization strategy;virtual machine learning","","0","","","","","20-23 March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We show that some features can carry significant nonlinear information about the defect content. Therefore, we use a nonlinear regression technique, neural networks, to solve the learning problem. To select the best among all neural networks trained on a given data set, one usually reserves part of the data set for later cross-validation; in contrast, we use a technique which leaves the full data set for training. This is an advantage when the data set is small. We validate our approach on a known empirical inspection data set. For that benchmark, our novel approach clearly outperforms both linear regression and the current standard methods in software engineering for estimating the defect content, such as capture-recapture. The validation also shows that our machine learning approach can be successful even when the empirical inspection data set is small.","0098-5589;00985589","","10.1109/TSE.2004.1265733","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265733","","Curve fitting;Estimation error;Inspection;Linear regression;Machine learning;Neural networks;Quality assurance;Software engineering;Software standards;Software testing","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program testing;program verification;regression analysis","defect content estimation;empirical methods;machine learning;neural network;nonlinear regression technique;program validation;software engineering;software inspection","","11","","25","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The bottleneck with this approach is the slow evolution time of the modules (using software techniques in PCs). However, using Michalski's machine learning based evolutionary algorithms, such as ""LEM (learnable evolution model)"", the usual evolution time (for certain categories of applications, e.g. mathematical function optimization) can be reduced by a factor of hundreds (Michalski, 2000). The authors hoped that this breakthrough would allow neural net modules to be evolved far more quickly. Unfortunately, it appears that the LEM approach does not work well with the evolution of dynamic neural nets.

The SVMs may be used in online learning setting. We proposed an approach for incremental batch learning with support vector machines for classification and regression, and define the normal solution of the incremental batch learning with SVMs as the solution minimizing a given positive-definite quadratic form in the coordinates of the difference vector between the normal vectors at the (k-1)-th and k-th incremental batch step and discuss the relation to standard SVM. It is shown that the concept that was learned at the last step does not change if the new data satisfy the separable condition.

The classifier is part of a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) scheme that is aimed to assisting radiologists in making more accurate diagnoses of breast cancer on mammograms. The methods we considered were: support vector machine (SVM), kernel Fisher discriminant (KFD), relevance vector machine (RVM), and committee machines (ensemble averaging and AdaBoost), of which most have been developed recently in statistical learning theory. We formulated differentiation of malignant from benign MCs as a supervised learning problem, and applied these learning methods to develop the classification algorithm. As input, these methods used image features automatically extracted from clustered MCs. We tested these methods using a database of 697 clinical mammograms from 386 cases, which included a wide spectrum of difficult-to-classify cases. We analyzed the distribution of the cases in this database using the multidimensional scaling technique, which reveals that in the feature space the malignant cases are not trivially separable from the benign ones. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate and to compare classification performance by the different methods. In addition, we also investigated how to combine information from multiple-view mammograms of the same case so that the best decision can be made by a classifier. In our experiments, the kernel-based methods (i.e., SVM, KFD, and RVM) yielded the best performance (A<sub>z</sub>=0.85, SVM), significantly outperforming a well-established, clinically-proven CADx approach that is based on neural network (A<sub>z</sub>=0.80).","0278-0062;02780062","","10.1109/TMI.2004.842457","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1397824","Clustered microcalcifications;computer-aided diagnosis;kernel methods;mammography;relevance vector machine;support vector machine","Breast cancer;Computer aided diagnosis;Image databases;Kernel;Learning systems;Spatial databases;Statistical learning;Supervised learning;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","biological organs;cancer;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);mammography;medical image processing;radiology;sensitivity analysis;support vector machines;tumours","AdaBoost;benign clustered microcalcifications;breast cancer diagnosis;committee machines;computer-aided diagnosis;ensemble averaging;feature extraction;kernel Fisher discriminant;machine learning;malignant clustered microcalcifications;mammograms;microcalcification classification;multidimensional scaling technique;radiologists;receiver operating characteristic;relevance vector machine;supervised learning;support vector machine","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Breast Neoplasms;Calcinosis;Female;Humans;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Precancerous Conditions;Radiographic Image Enhancement;Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Severity of Illness Index","108","1","42","","","March 2005","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Specifically, we apply the AFIRS to the mapping of United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)'s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) tracts in Texas County, Oklahoma. CRP is a nationwide program, and recently USDA announced payments of nearly $1.6 billion for new CRP enrollments. It is imperative to obtain accurate CRP maps for effective and efficient management and evaluation of the CRP program. However, most existing CRP maps are inaccurate and little work has been done to improve their accuracy. The proposed AFIRS is capable of handling the complex CRP mapping problem with high accuracy when limited training samples are available. Simulation results show that 5-10% improvements can be obtained by incorporating GIS ancillary data and other derived features in addition to multispectral imagery.

To illustrate our point, we perform a case study on a reuse data set using three different styles of learners: association rule, decision tree induction, and treatment. Software reuse is a topic of avid debate in the professional and academic arena; it has proven that it can be both a blessing and a curse.

Given a set of properties produced by the program analysis, the technique selects a subset of properties that are most likely to reveal an error. An implementation, the fault invariant classifier, demonstrates the efficacy of the technique. The implementation uses dynamic invariant detection to generate program properties. It uses support vector machine and decision tree learning tools to classify those properties. In our experimental evaluation, the technique increases the relevance (the concentration of fault-revealing properties) by a factor of 50 on average for the C programs, and 4.8 for the Java programs.

However, a reliable and automated detection of the Œ≤-wave capable of clinical use still remains a challenge. We propose a new machine learning approach to the detection of the CAPD that is based on adapted tight frame decompositions which are tailored for support vector machines with radial kernels. Using shift-invariant scale and morphological features of the binaurally evoked brainstem potentials, our approach provides at least comparable results to the Œ≤-wave detection in view of the discrimination of subjects being at risk for CAPD and subjects being not at risk for CAPD. Furthermore, as no information from the monaurally evoked potentials is necessary, the measurement cost is reduced by two-thirds compared to the computation of the binaural interaction component. We conclude that a machine learning approach in the form of a hybrid tight frame-support vector classification is effective in the objective detection of the CAPD.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2004.827948","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1306567","","Auditory system;Costs;Degradation;Helium;Kernel;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Signal processing;Support vector machine classification;Support vector machines","auditory evoked potentials;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical signal processing;patient diagnosis;support vector machines","CAPD diagnosis;auditory brainstem responses;binaural interaction component;binaurally evoked brainstem potentials;central auditory processing disorder objective detection;machine learning approach;radial kernels;shift-invariant scale;support vector machines;tight frame decomposition","Artificial Intelligence;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem;Humans;Language Development Disorders;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sound Localization","5","","44","","","July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Learned knowledge is then used for object recognition. In addition, the robots are trained to recognize objects using colour and other object attributes. Incorporating leaning into the vision system facilitates object recognition and provides the ability to automatically adapt vision to new environments.","","POD:0-7803-7852-0","10.1109/ICIT.2003.1290275","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1290275","","Calibration;Cameras;Lightning;Machine learning;Machine vision;Object recognition;Robot sensing systems;Robot vision systems;Robotics and automation;Robustness","calibration;image colour analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);lighting;mobile robots;object recognition;robot vision","Sony ERS210A robots;automatic colour calibration;colour cameras;lighting conditions;machine learning;object recognition;robot vision;vision recalibration","","1","","12","","","10-12 Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The early stopping criterion for active learning is based on the bias-variance tradeoff for classification. This corresponds to that learning instance when the boundary bias becomes positive, and requires one to switch from active to random selection of learning examples. The sign for the boundary and the increase in the classification error are two manifestations of the same phenomena, i.e., over-training. The experimental results presented show the feasibility and usefulness of our novel approach using a non-separable two-class classification problem.

A novel Bayesian decision tree algorithm is proposed to detect two types of pacemaker failures, non-sense and non-capture, without a priori knowledge of pacemaker type, model, or programming. A variety of pacemaker devices and modes were studied, including devices with single and dual chamber pacing; single and dual chamber sensing; and fixed rate and rate adaptive pacing. 12-lead ECG signals were acquired from 34 pacemaker patients at rest. These signals were annotated by a team of experts. A 10-fold cross-validation was performed on the data set to test the algorithm. Out-of-sample sensitivity and specificity of 87.8% and 98.7%, respectively, were achieved. This work shows that non-sense and non-captures pacemaker failures can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity without prior knowledge of the pacemaker type, model or programming, making this algorithm clinically relevant in emergency room environments where such pacemaker information may be unavailable.","0276-6547;02766547","POD:0-7803-8170-X","10.1109/CIC.2003.1291088","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1291088","","Batteries;Bayesian methods;Decision trees;Electrocardiography;Electrodes;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Pacemakers;Performance evaluation;Sensitivity and specificity","Bayes methods;biomedical electrodes;cardiovascular system;decision trees;electrocardiography;failure (mechanical);learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;pacemakers;patient monitoring","Bayesian decision tree algorithm;ECG signals;battery;dual chamber pacing;dual chamber sensing;electrical failures;electrodes;fixed rate pacing;implantation;machine learning techniques;mechanical failure;pacemaker noncapture failure identification;pacemaker nonsense failure identification;physiological failures;rate adaptive pacing;single chamber pacing;single chamber sensing","","1","","12","","","21-24 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditional machine learning methods seeking an accurate performance over a full range of instances are not suitable to deal with this problem, since they tend to classify all the data into the majority, usually the less important class. Moreover, some current methods have tried to utilize some intermediate factors, e.g., the distribution of the training set, the decision thresholds or the cost matrices, to influence the bias of the classification. However, it remains uncertain whether these methods can improve the performance in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose a novel model named biased minimax probability machine. Different from previous methods, this model directly controls the worst-case real accuracy of classification of the future data to build up biased classifier;. Hence, it provides a rigorous treatment on imbalanced data. The experimental results on the novel model comparing with those of three competitive methods, i.e., the naive Bayesian classifier, the k-nearest neighbor method, and the decision tree method C4.5, demonstrate the superiority of our novel model.","1063-6919;10636919","POD:0-7695-2158-4","10.1109/CVPR.2004.1315213","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1315213","","Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Computer science;Costs;Data engineering;Educational institutions;Learning systems;Machine learning;Minimax techniques;Sampling methods","data handling;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;pattern classification;probability","biased minimax probability machine;binary classification;imbalanced data;learning classifiers;machine learning methods","","10","","12","","","27 June-2 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Currently, the minimum dose of dialysis is assessed by computerised calculation of urea kinetics. Although fairly standard, it is still an approximate method due to the various assumptions made in the development of the final parametric model. Until now artificial intelligence has not been used to study haemodialysis and hence no machine learning approach has been used to model it so far.

We explored recognition of facial actions from the facial action coding system (FACS), as well as recognition of fall facial expressions. Each video-frame is first scanned in real-time to detect approximately upright frontal faces. The faces found are scaled into image patches of equal size, convolved with a bank of Gabor energy filters, and then passed to a recognition engine that codes facial expressions into 7 dimensions in real time: neutral, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise. We report results on a series of experiments comparing recognition engines, including AdaBoost, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, as well as feature selection techniques. Best results were obtained by selecting a subset of Gabor filters using AdaBoost and then training support vector machines on the outputs of the filters selected by AdaBoost. The generalization performance to new subjects for recognition of full facial expressions in a 7-way forced choice was 93% correct, the best performance reported so far on the Cohn-Kanade FACS-coded expression dataset.

People have access to vast stores of information on the World Wide Web ranging from online publications to electronic commerce. All this information, however, used to be accessible only while users are tethered to a computer at home or in an office. Wireless data and voice access to this vast store allows unprecedented access to information from any location at any time. The presentation of this information must be tailored to the constraints of mobile devices. Although browsing and searching are the acceptable methods of locating information on the wired Web, those operations soon become cumbersome and inefficient in the wireless setting and impossible in voice interfaces. Small screens, slower connections, high latency, limited input capabilities, and the serial nature of voice interfaces present new challenges.

The algorithm combines SVMs with the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Unlike a classic radial basis function networks or multilayer perceptrons that require the topology of the network to be defined before training, an SVM selects the minimum number of training points, called support vectors, that ensure modeling of the data within the given level of accuracy (a.k.a. insensitivity zone &epsi;). It is this property that is exploited as the basis for an image compression algorithm. Here, the SVMs learning algorithm performs the compression in a spectral domain of DCT coefficients, i.e., the SVM approximates the DCT coefficients. The parameters of the SVM are stored in order to recover the image. Results demonstrate that even though there is an extra lossy step compared with the baseline JPEG algorithm, the new algorithm dramatically increases compression for a given image quality; conversely it increases image quality for a given compression ratio. The approach presented can be readily applied for other modeling schemes that are in a form of a sum of weighted basis functions.","1045-9227;10459227","","10.1109/TNN.2003.813842","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215411","","Discrete cosine transforms;Image coding;Image quality;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Multilayer perceptrons;Network topology;Radial basis function networks;Support vector machines;Transform coding","data compression;discrete cosine transforms;image coding;learning (artificial intelligence);learning automata","compression ratio;discrete cosine transform;image compression;image quality;insensitivity zone;kernel machines;level of accuracy;lossy step;support vector machine learning;training points","","54","","14","","","July 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Instructions are not required, and the components are customised for a hypothesis space referring only to ground unit clauses in the background knowledge. It also benefits from a distributed memory hierarchy, with a method for including background knowledge to eliminate instructions. The effectiveness of this architecture is demonstrated using a large organic chemistry data set.

However, the precise nature of the correlation between protein three-dimensional (3D) structure and chemical shift remains largely unsolved. Thus, chemical shift prediction is a non-trivial task. This study tests the accuracy of three existing structure-based chemical shift prediction algorithms (SHIFTS, SHIFTX, PROSHIFT) against REFDB, a large database of experimentally determined, and manually re-referenced <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C, and <sup>15</sup>N chemical shifts. We report that the accuracy of backbone chemical shift predictions for each program is lower than that originally reported. This suggests these programs over-fit the data used in their construction. We then compare two novel methods for chemical shift prediction based on support vector machines (SVM) and bagging respectively. Each method was trained on REFUB using predictions made by SHIFTS, SHIFTX, and PROSHIFT as features. In cross-validated experiments, bagging is shown to be superior to SVMs, while both methods are substantially better than SHIFTS, SHIFTX, and PROSHIFT.

Proceedings.","20050131","2004","","","1","2","We at Carnegie Mellon University have pioneered context-aware mobile computing and built their first prototypes, including context-aware mobile phones and a context-aware personal communicator. These prototypes use machine learning and cognitive modeling techniques to derive user state and intent from the devices sensors. Context-aware computing describes the situation where a mobile computer is aware of its user's state and surroundings and modifies its behavior based on this information. We have demonstrated the power of our method to automatically derive a meaningful user context model and performed experimental measurements and evaluation. We have employed unsupervised machine learning techniques to combine real time data from multiple sensors into a model of behavior that is individualized to the user. We observe that context does not require a descriptive label to be used for adaptivity and contextually sensitive response. This makes our approach towards completely unsupervised machine learning feasible. By unsupervised learning we mean the identification of the users' context without requiring manually annotating current user states. We use unsupervised machine learning techniques to independently cluster sensor quantities and associate user interactions with these clusters. The use of this discretization enables learning from observations about the user. Each time a user interaction is observed, it is interpreted as a labeled example which can be used to construct a statistical model for context-dependent preferences. Example context-aware parameters are the following: location, nearby people and devices, calendar and other cyber sensors information, movement patterns and characteristics, user preferences, interests, and behavior patterns. By mapping observable parameters into cognitive states, the computing system can estimate the form of interaction that minimizes user distraction and the risk of cognitive overload. The capabilities herein proposed exte- d significantly the state-of-the-art, sometimes in a radical fashion, other times more incrementally. Our approach produces enriched observations by combining machine learning, instrumentation in software applications, sensors describing the user state, and task context information. Such diverse sensor fusion (symbolic and signal sensors) for inferring context and state goes much beyond the situation-sensing currently practiced, even in experimental settings.","","POD:0-7803-8823-2","10.1109/ICMLA.2004.1383485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1383485","","Biosensors;Context modeling;Context-aware services;Machine learning;Mobile computing;Prototypes;Sensor fusion;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Very large scale integration;Wearable computers","","","","0","","","","","16-18 Dec. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This paper seeks to develop ""prediction rules"" for predicting the degree of cell membrane disruption based on specified ultrasound parameters and measured acoustic signals. Three techniques for generating prediction rules (regression analysis, classification trees and discriminant analysis) are applied to data obtained from a sequence of experiments on bovine red blood cells. For each experiment, the data consist of four ultrasound parameters, acoustic measurements at 400 frequencies, and a measure of cell membrane disruption. To avoid over-training, various combinations of the 404 predictor variables are used when applying the rule generation methods. The results indicate that the variable combination consisting of ultrasound exposure time and acoustic signals measured at the driving frequency and its higher harmonics yields the best rule for all three rule generation methods. The methods used for deriving the prediction rules are broadly applicable, and could be used to develop prediction rules in other scenarios involving different cell types or tissues. These rules and the methods used to derive them could be used for real-time feedback about ultrasound's biological effects.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2003.820323","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1253997","","Acoustic measurements;Biomembranes;Cells (biology);Drugs;Frequency measurement;Machine learning;Regression analysis;Statistical analysis;Ultrasonic imaging;Ultrasonic variables measurement","biological effects of acoustic radiation;biomedical ultrasonics;biomembranes;blood;cellular effects of radiation;classification;drug delivery systems;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);prediction theory;regression analysis;spectral analysis;trees (mathematics)","acoustic signals;acoustic spectra;bovine red blood cells;cell membranes;classification trees;discriminant analysis;driving frequency;drug delivery;gene delivery;high harmonics;machine learning techniques;predictor variables;real-time feedback;regression analysis;rule generation methods;safe diagnostic applications;statistical analysis;ultrasound biological effects;ultrasound exposure time;ultrasound-mediated disruption","Animals;Artificial Intelligence;Cattle;Computer Simulation;Erythrocyte Membrane;Hemolysis;Models, Cardiovascular;Models, Statistical;Phonophoresis;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Sound Spectrography","5","","29","","","Jan. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The different sorts of instances, which are combined in granularity, are classified through different layers of classifiers. In this way, the difficulty of the learning is reduced, the capacity of learning from instances is increased, and the classifying accuracy is improved.

Two key reasons behind may be: 1) the slow gradient-based learning algorithms are extensively used to train neural networks, and 2) all the parameters of the networks are tuned iteratively by using such learning algorithms. Unlike these traditional implementations, this paper proposes a new learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) for single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs) which randomly chooses the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of SLFNs. In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The experimental results based on real-world benchmarking function approximation and classification problems including large complex applications show that the new algorithm can produce best generalization performance in some cases and can learn much faster than traditional popular learning algorithms for feedforward neural networks.","1098-7576;10987576","POD:0-7803-8359-1","10.1109/IJCNN.2004.1380068","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1380068","","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation algorithms;Feedforward neural networks;Function approximation;Iterative algorithms;Joining processes;Machine learning;Multi-layer neural network;Neural networks;Neurons","feedforward neural nets;function approximation;generalisation (artificial intelligence);gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","classification problems;extreme learning machine;function approximation;iterative tuning;learning speed;network parameter tuning;neural network training;single hidden layer feedforward neural networks;slow gradient based learning algorithms","","220","","19","","","25-29 July 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The idea of this heuristic algorithm is that the partition difference set has less elements, and existing hyperplane is much closer to the optimal one. New support vectors in this algorithm consist of existing support vectors and partition difference set of new training data and history data by separating hyperplane. The algorithm improves classification precision by adding partition difference set, and decreases the computation complexity by constructing new classification hyperplane on support vector set.

Our approach is based on optimization using machine learning and support vector machines (SVM). The basic idea is to change the excitation coefficient for each array element (magnitude and phase) to optimize for changes due to the environment surrounding an array antenna.

In addition, we describe an effective MCE classifier training algorithm that uses AdaBoost to generate alternative initial classifiers, as opposed to combining multiple classifiers as it is typically used. This method is applied to MCE classifier training to overcome local minimums in optimal classifier parameter search, utilizing the fact that the family of generalized linear classifiers is closed under AdaBoost. Moreover, we extend the loss function in MCE training to incorporate training sample prior distributions to compensate the imbalanced training data distribution in each category.

Since standard SVMs do not provide such outputs, two techniques are used to produce probabilities. One is to train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function. The other is to use the notion of version space. Experimental results on a database of 10,000 general-purpose images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed active learning scheme.","","POD:0-7803-8603-5","10.1109/ICME.2004.1394131","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1394131","","Asia;Content based retrieval;Entropy;Feedback;Image databases;Image retrieval;Information theory;Learning systems;Machine learning;Support vector machines","content-based retrieval;entropy;image retrieval;learning (artificial intelligence);relevance feedback;support vector machines","content-based image retrieval;entropy-based active learning;image database;interactive user image labeling;probabilistic SVM outputs;relevance feedback;request selection;sigmoid function parameter training;support vector machines;version space","","3","","7","","","27-30 June 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We describe the development of a machine learning method for predicting biological process as defined by the gene ontology (GO). The algorithm uses features that can be generated from amino acid sequence alone, and does not require further experimental studies such as microarrays, 2-hybrid screens or systematic 'pull-down' assays. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is used because of its comprehensive set of functional annotations, but the approach is sufficiently general for application to other eukaryote genomes. The input data include phylogenetic profiles, which represent the distribution of orthologous proteins in the genomes of other organisms, position-specific scoring matrices, and secondary structure and dynamic disorder predictions. These are encoded using diffusion kernels, which are used to represent pair-wise relationships such as sequence or secondary structure element similarity between nodes (proteins) in a graph. These kernels are benchmarked on the process prediction problem using a maximal margin (SVM) learning algorithm.","","POD:0-7695-2194-0","10.1109/CSB.2004.1332485","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1332485","","Amino acids;Bioinformatics;Biological processes;Genomics;Inference algorithms;Kernel;Learning systems;Machine learning algorithms;Ontologies;Proteins","biology computing;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;proteins;support vector machines","2-hybrid screens;Saccharomyces cerevisiae;amino acid sequence;biological process;diffusion kernels;dynamic disorder predictions;encoding;eukaryote genomes;gene ontology annotations;kernel-based machine learning algorithms;living cells;maximal margin learning algorithm;microarrays;orthologous proteins;position-specific scoring matrices;secondary structure;sequence data;support vector machine;systematic pull-down assays;yeast","","0","","5","","","16-19 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this study, we assess the feasibility of kernel based learning machines to estimate the photocatalyst activity using high-throughput screening data. Nanoparticular anatase-based photocatalyst specimens were characterized in a two dimensional feature space and their activity in emulated daylight was determined in a high-throughput screening procedure. Using this data, a kernel based support vector machine (SVM) was applied to model the relation between the feature space and the activity. After the learning, our scheme provided reasonable estimations of the activity of independent test specimens. It is concluded that kernel based SVMs are feasible for the estimation of photocatalyst activity.","","POD:0-7803-8536-5","10.1109/NANO.2004.1392378","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392378","","Computational modeling;Kernel;Large-scale systems;Machine learning;Nanomaterials;Nanoparticles;Support vector machines;Telephony;Testing;Throughput","catalysts;estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);photochemistry;support vector machines","SVM;high-throughput screening data;kernel based learning machines;kernel based support vector machine;nanoparticular anatase-based photocatalyst specimen;nanophotocatalyst activity","","0","","16","","","16-19 Aug. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Layout analysis is the process of extracting a hierarchical structure describing the layout of a page. In our approach, the layout analysis is performed in two steps: firstly, the global analysis determines possible areas containing paragraphs, sections, columns, figures and tables, and secondly, the local analysis groups together blocks that possibly fall within the same area. The result of the local analysis process strongly depends on the quality of the results of the first step. We investigate the possibility of supporting the user during the correction of the results of the global analysis. This is done by allowing the user to correct the results of the global analysis and then by learning rules for layout correction from the sequence of user actions.

The system contains a red-eye detector that finds red eye-like candidate image patches; a state of the art face detector used to eliminate most false positives (image regions that look but red eyes but are not); and a red-eye outline detector. All three detectors are automatically learned from data, using Boosting.

Proceedings.","20030904","2003","","","18","25","This paper deals with the possible benefits of perceptual learning in artificial intelligence. On the one hand, perceptual learning is more and more studied in neurobiology and is now considered as an essential part of any living system. In fact, perceptual learning and cognitive learning are both necessary for learning and often depends on each other. On the other hand, many works in machine learning are concerned with ""abstraction"" in order to reduce the amount of complexity related to some learning tasks. In the abstraction framework, perceptual learning can be seen as a specific process that learns how to transform the data before the traditional learning task itself takes place. In this paper, we argue that biologically inspired perceptual learning mechanism could be used to build efficient low-level abstraction operators that deal with real world data.","","POD:0-7695-1986-5","10.1109/COGINF.2003.1225946","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1225946","","Animals;Artificial intelligence;Computational complexity;Computers;Humans;Information processing;Learning systems;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Mobile robots","cognitive systems;computational complexity;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","artificial intelligence;cognitive learning;complexity reduction;learning tasks;living system;low-level abstraction operators;machine learning;neurobiology;perceptual abstraction;perceptual learning;real world data;specific process;traditional learning","","1","","35","","","18-20 Aug. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Inspired by this challenge, we sought to apply machine-learning methods to the problem of musical style modeling. Our work so far has produced examples of musical generation and applications to a computer-aided composition system. Machine learning consists of deriving a mathematical model, such as a set of stochastic rules, from a set of musical examples. The act of musical composition involves a highly structured mental process. Although it is complex and difficult to formalize, it is clearly far from being a random activity. Our research seeks to capture some of the regularity apparent in the composition process by using statistical and information theoretic tools to analyze musical pieces. The resulting models can be used for inference and prediction and, to a certain extent, to generate new works that imitate the style of the great masters.","0018-9162;00189162","","10.1109/MC.2003.1236474","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1236474","","Application software;Character generation;Computer applications;Information analysis;Machine learning;Mathematical model;Multiple signal classification;Predictive models;Sequences;Stochastic processes","inference mechanisms;information theory;learning (artificial intelligence);music","computer-aided composition system;highly structured mental process;inference;information theoretic tools;machine-learning methods;mathematical model;musical examples;musical generation;musical style modeling;prediction;statistical tools;stochastic rules","","23","","15","","","Oct. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Corp., Greenbelt, MD, USA","IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20040121","2003","41","12","2844","2860","This paper introduces a machine-learning approach to satellite ocean color sensor cross calibration. The cross-calibration objective is to eliminate incompatibilities among sensor data from different missions and produce merged daily global ocean color coverage. The approach is designed and investigated using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard of the Terra satellite and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). Data from these two sensors show apparent discrepancies originating from differences in sensor design, calibration, processing algorithms, and from the rate of change in the atmosphere and ocean within 1(1/2) h between sensor imaging of the same regions on the ground. The discrepancies have complex, noisy, and often contradictory time and space variabilities. Support vector machines are used to bring MODIS data to the SeaWiFS representation where SeaWiFS data are considered to exemplify a consistent ocean color baseline. Support vector machines are effective in learning and resolving convoluted data relationships between the two sensors given a variety of bio-optical, atmospheric, viewing geometry, and ancillary information. The method works accurately in low chlorophyll waters and shows a potential to eliminate sensor problems, such as scan angle dependencies and seasonal and spatial trends in data. The results illustrate that MODIS and SeaWiFS differences are noisy and highly variable, which makes it difficult to extrapolate the cross-calibration knowledge onto new time and space domains and to define representative global ocean color datasets for support vector machine training.","0196-2892;01962892","","10.1109/TGRS.2003.818016","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1260622","","Algorithm design and analysis;Atmosphere;Biosensors;Calibration;Image sensors;MODIS;Oceans;Process design;Satellites;Support vector machines","geochemistry;geophysics computing;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;oceanographic techniques;organic compounds;remote sensing","MODIS data;Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data;Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor data;SeaWiFS data;chlorophyll concentration;machine-learning techniques;remotely sensed ocean color data;support vector machines","","29","","53","","","Dec. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

We modify and improve the generality of the approach by adding a machine learning phase in order to generate probability maps. A statistic classifier has then defined that compares the probability maps and the histogram profiles extracted from each of the moving people. The approach is very robust if the initial constraints are satisfied and exhibits a very low computational time so that it can be used to process live videos with standard platforms.","","POD:0-7695-1948-2","10.1109/ICIAP.2003.1234034","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1234034","","Biological system modeling;Computer vision;Histograms;Humans;Image analysis;Machine learning;Object detection;Probability;Statistics;Surveillance","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical distributions;surveillance;video signal processing","domotics;histogram projections;human posture classification;human posture detection;indoor surveillance;live video processing;machine learning;probability maps;statistic classifier","","4","","6","","","17-19 Sept. 2003","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
